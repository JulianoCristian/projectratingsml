HUANGPU PORT PROJECT
Loan/Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:               People's Republic of China
Beneficiary:            Huangpu Harbor Bureau (HEB)
Amount:                  $88 million equivalent comprising a bank loan of
$63.0 million equivalent and an IDA Credit of
SDR 19.8 million ($25.0 million equivalent).
Terms:                   For the loan, twenty years, including five years of
grace, at the standard variable intetest rate; for the
credit, standard with 35 years maturity.
Relending Terms:         The proceeds of the loan and credit would be onlent
from the Government to HHB under a subsidiary loan
agreement with a 20-year term, including 5 years of
grace, at an interest rate of 42 p.a. The foreign
exchange risk between the dollar and RMB and
commitment fees would be borne by HHB.
Project Objectives:     The principal objective of the project is to assist
the Government in the effort to relieve congestion and
increase the handling capacity in the ports sub-
sector. The project would provide for infrastructure
development in a key port in southeastern China, as
well as technical assistance and training to
strengthen the port's management and improve its
operating capabilities and to address intermodal
aspects of port operations.
Project Description:    The project would:  (a) increase the capacity of
Huangpu port through construction of 1,000 m of quay-
walls for coal, iron ore, bulk fertilizer and general
cargo, including necessary ancillary works such as
dredging, reclamation, pavement, railways, roadways,
bridges, utilities, and supply of equipment; and
(b) provide training for port personnel in construc-
tion supervision, specialized design work and
managerial and operational improvements; and (c) pro-
vide technical assistance in updating the port's
master plan, including an intermodal cargo
distribution study.
Risks:                  There are no unusual risks associated with the proj-
ect. All components involve proven technology.
Training will be provided to HUB personnel in con-
struction and operation of the new facilities to

ensure that new equipment is properly used and main-
tained. The only risk lies in the potential for delay
in project start-up due to the introduction of ICB
procedures for civil works. To minimize this risk,
the Bank would provide appropriate assistance in the
early stages of the project.

HUANGPU PORT PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.01      Chinese policy statements repeatedly identify transportation and
energy shortages as the two most critical bottlenecks in the economy. Coal is
at the heart of both problems, becausi coal is simultaneously the most impor-
tant source of energy and the largest user of transport capacity. This dual
problem with coal is exacerbated by China's high level of energy consumption
per unit of GDP (about two and a half times that of other LDCs). However, the
need to ship large volumes of coal is not the sole cause of the transportation
bottleneck. The rapid growth of China's economy in recent years has stimula-
ted an increasing demand for the shipment of commodities of all sorts, and for
passenger travel as well. Efforts to reduce waste within the transport system
(for example, by eliminatiAg cross-hauling of the same coimodityt increasing
the processing of raw materials before shipment, and increasing the intensity
of road and waterway utilization) are certainly desirable. More fun-
damentally, however, the Government's strategy for sot.ving transportation
shortages will have to rely on an expansion of the system's capacity, primar-
ily by increasing the productivity of existing facilities wherever possible,
and secondarily by building new facilities where needed.
A. Traffic
1.02      Freight Traffic.  Domestic freight transported in 1985 reached
1,276 billion ton-ki, representing a 131 increase over 1984 and an average
annual growth rate since 1952 of almost 91, consistently higher than the
growth of domestic product. By the year 2000, domestic freight traffic could
be in the range of 3,000 billion ton-km. The modal split has moved toward a
more balanced use of modes, with the railways' dominant share of 82X in 1952
reduced to 641 by 1985.
1.03      Passenger traffic reached 425 billion passenger-km (p-ki) in 1985,
up 172 over 1984 and representing an average annual growth rate of 131 since
1978 and almost 92 since 1952. This illustrates the increasing demand for
travel as income grows. It is likely that this growth would have been even
more rapid if it had not been constrained by the limited capacity of the
transport sector, particularly the railways, to offer more passenger services.
Railways are the major passenger carrier, handling 572 of the traffic in
1985. Despite the rapid growth of passenger traffic in recent years, the
mobility of the Chinese people is still much lower than that of people in
countries with comparable income levels. By the turn of the century,
passenger traffic may well reach about 1,500 billion p-km per year.
B. Investment
1.04      Over the period 1953-85, some Y 154 billion, or 14X of all new
investments under central government control, went to transport. In



- 2 -
comparison with other countries, annual levels of transport investment apoear
somewhat on the low side, a factor contributing to transport being a bottle-
neck to economic development. For example, by 1983, 30 million tons of coal
had accumulated in Shanxi Province for lack of traniport, and some of this
stockpiled coal was destroyed by spontaneous combustion. Despite a recent
policy of curtailing production to match available transport, the volume of
coal stockpiled in Shanxi increased during 1984. Rural areas are short of
transport, both for agriculture and for other rural enterprises. In the
ports, lack of proper handling facilities is hampering trade in bulk commodi-
ties such as fertilizers, cement and grain. In the coming decades, a much
larger investment effort will be needed in transport if these bottlenecks are
to be overcome.
C. Systems
1.05      The railway system consists of some 52,000 route-km, of which about
9,700 km are double or multiple-track and 3,100 km are electrified. The net-
work is perved by 11,100 locomotives, 291,000 freight cars and 19,600 passen-
ger coaches. At present, 68% of tractive power is still steam, 28Z diesel and
42 electric. Freight traffic density averages 15 million net ton-km per
route-km which is the highest freight density in the world after the Soviet
Union, and 50% higher than freight density in the United States. Freight
traffic reaching 812 billion t-km in 1985. Growth averaged 6.22 p.a. since
1978, and reached 9X in 1985. Three-quarters of all freight traffic involves
ten commodities including coal, iron and steel, grain and construction
materials. The passenger traffic density of 4.2 million passenger-km per
route-km also ranks second in the world, after India. In 1985 1.1 billion
passengers were carried. The average annual increase since 1978 has been
11Z. Despite some possible rationalization in the transport of natural
resources and heavy industrial outputs, there is no question but that the
transport demand for the major commodities will continue to grow rapidly.
Thus, although its share of the total is expected to decrease, rail traffic
will continue to grow, requiring massive investments in line capacity, motive
power and rolling stock well into the future.
1.06      The highway system comprised about 942,400 km in 1985, of which
about 195,000 km were asphalt paved. Despite impressive expansion of the road
network since 1949, when only some 80,000 km of motorable roads existed, the
roads in China today are inadequate because: (a) pavement strength and quality
are poor; (b) there are many thousand kilometers of extremely rough macadam-
surfaced roads with traffic in excess of 300 average daily traffic (ADT);
(c) congestion is severe near cities, due to the mixing of slow and fast mov-
ing traffict and (d) there are gaps of about 4,000 km in major national roads
linking large cities and provincial capitals. The road network and road
transport in China today can therefore be characterized as underdeveloped.
Road maintenance, however, is well organized and currently absorbs much of the
attention and resources of the provincial and other local road authorities.
Except in western China, the highway network is still very much a system of
feeder roads to the railways. Nevertheless, maotor traffic has reportedly
grown at a very high overall annual average of 15% on the national highways
since 1978.



D. Transport Issues and Objectives in the 1980s
1.07      The transport system has been severely taxed by the pace of recent
economic development and capacity constraints are evident in all modes. Coal
transportation is a particularly serious case because of its significance for
energy supply and hence for industrial growth. At present, transport is a
greater constraint on the supply of energy than coal mine development. China
also needs to substantially expand its port and waterway facilities to rclieve
the growing hindrance to external trade caused by inadequate berth capacity
and container hatrling capability. But the most serious need is for dramatic-
ally expanded road transport, especially in rural areas where increased spe-
cialization has created an urgent demand for better farm-to-market transport
services. Road transport will also be called upon to meet a growing share of
the demand for passenger transportation from the increasingly mobile popi,la-
tion.
1.08      China's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes all these
sectoral needs. By the end of the Plan period, freight traffic is projected
to be 45% higher than in 1985, and passenger traffic 60% higher, with a dis-
proportionately greater share of the increase falling on road transport. To
meet these needs, substantial investments are envisioned, especially in new
rail lines, double-tracking and electrification of existing lines, new high-
ways, and more berths at coastal ports. The Plan also proposes to secure
efficiency gains in transportation from operational improvements; these
include the development of integrated intermodal transportation networks, in
particular for coal transportation and for import/export trade, and technolo-
gical improvements such as container-handling facilities and intermodal trans-
port centers. To facilitate these developments, the Plan envisions signifi-
cant institutional changes in the sector, including an extension of the policy
of separating the functions of government from those of operating enterprises
and delegating greater authority to the latter (recently begun in the ports
subsector, paras. 2.5-6). Continuing adjustment of charges for transportation
services is expected to assist the funding of investments in the sector from
internally generated resources.
1.09      The Bank subscribes to the Government's objectives for development
of the transport sector, and is supporting its initiatives with both financial
and technical assistance. Three railway projects (Loans 2394-CHA, 2540-CH-A
and 2678/Cr. 1680-CHA) have assisted the expansion of capacity on key routes
and the manufacture of electric locomotives, passenger coaches and signalling
equipment; a high"tay project (Loan 2539/Credit 1594-CHA) involves the con-
structick or improvement of national and rural roads. Port-related activities
are described in paras 2.18-2.19. Besides these subsector-specific opera-
tions, the Bank has recently begun to assist the Government in the conduct of
strategic studies of a wider nature: a review of the utilization of water
transport was recently completed and a comprehensive transportation study for
Guangdong Province is in progress.

II. THE PORTS SUBSECTOR
A.   Port Facilities
2.01      China has 15 major deep-water ports, but six of these handle over
80X of the total traffic: Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao, Qinghuangdao, Huangpu
and Tianjin. Shanghai, with 96 berths, is one of the ten largest ports in the
world. In 1985 it handled 113 milliou tons of cargo and more than 10 million
passengers. There are also many minor ports along China's 2,000-km coastline
and 110,000 km of navigable rivers.
B. Traffic
2.02      By comparison with other developing countries, China's port traffic
is low in relation to the size of its economy. However, it is now growing
rapidly following the opening of the economy to foreign trade: between 1977
and 1985 traffic at the 15 major ports almost doubled to 311 million tons.
Tonnages of domestic and foreign cargoes are increasing about equally but
foreign traffic is growing at a faster rate. Foreign trade is expected to
continue growing in stride with dhe economy as a whole; the Seventh Five-Year
Plan envisions port traffic reach.ng 500 million tons by 1990, over 502 higher
than the 1985 volume.
C. Investment Priorities and Technology
2.03      In the Seventh Five Year Plan, Government proposes to invest over
V 10 billion in the subsector. Major investments include 120 deep water
berths and 80 smaller ones, which together with other improvements would
increase coastal harbor capacity to 500 m tons by 1990, more than 502 more
than in 1985.
2.04      One of the Government's priorities for the Seventh Five-Year Plan is
to update technology. For the port subsector, this will involve in
particul r:
(a)  palletization and contair2rization facilities for break bulk cargo;
(b)  specialized handling equipment for bulk cargo, the majority of which
is now mixed with break bulk handling, resulting in unnecessarily
low efficiency; and
(c)  computerization of documentation flow and management information at
the berths.
D. Organization and Management
2.05      The organization of the subsector is currently being changed in an
effort to obtain greater productivity and faster development by increasing
local autonomy and accountability. Until recently, all the major ports in
China were responsible to, and closely controlled by, the Ministry of Coomuni-
cations (MOC). In 1985 a "pilot system reform" was introduced in which the
primary leadership of one port--Tianjin--was transferred from MOC to its local



government; and at the same time considerably greater autonomy was given to
the port's management, particularly in relation to development planning and
financial control. In 1986, revised organizational arrangements were made for
the ports of Shanghai and Dalian, which were also placed under the primary
leadership of their respective local governments. Huangpu port was placed
under the leadership of Guangzhou municipoal government (GMG) on January 1,
1987. All remaining ocean ports are intended to be transferred to local
government control before the end of 1987.
2.06      The objective of this program of decentralization is to develop the
capability and initiative of the ports' local managements, in the interests of
improved efficiency of operations and more effective development of the
ports. However, the details of reallocation of responsibilities differ in the
cases so far implemented, most particularly as to the approval of long-term
development plans (delegated in the case of Tianjin, but retained by MOC in
the case of Shanghai, Dalian and Huangpu) and the exemption of port profits
from tax (complete for Tianjin, but partial for the others although on
different bases). Recent comments by Chinese leaders have expressed satisfac-
tion with the program in general, but it is too early to evaluate the
different organizational models, and hence to be sure what pattern may be
adopted for the ports yet to be decentralized.
2.07      Although the decentralization program confers considerably greater
authority and responsibility on port managements than hitherto--even in the
cases of more limited delegation such as Shanghai, Dalian and Huangpu--the
ports, although profitable, arj still far from operating on a commercial
basis. In particular, they are not free to develop their own tariffs (para.
2.14), or to compete for traffic, which is allocated by MOC. But all the
ports are overloaded and would have little incentive to compete for business
at present; there is in any event no foreign port which would be vulnerable to
competition, so they could only compete amongst themselves. The gains from
competition would thus likely be modest but the risk of introducing disorder
into an already strained system could be high. In these circumstances the
retention of central government control over tariffs and traffic allocation is
prudent, and further movement towards a commercial basis is not expected until
port capacity has been substantially increased and the new organizational
models have been fully evaluated.
Eo Operations and Maintenance
2.08      All the major ports operate continuously with a three-shift system,
but operations are increasingly hampered by congestion and by the fact that a
lot of the equipment is outmoded and slow. In 1985 the average waiting time
in Dalian port was 6.7 days, up from 5.7 days in 1983 and 3.6 days in 1981.
Total port time in 1985 averaged 10.4 days. In Tianjin the average in 1983
was 5.5 days; in 1984 it increased to 7 days. Other aspects of port opera-
tions contribute significantly to long berth times in Chinese ports. First,
documentation procedures are complicated and ponderous. Frequently this
results in port equipment not being in the right place at the right time and
sometimes in cargoes arriving before bills of lading have been received by the
port. Second, in some of the southern ports a large proportion of traffic
involves ship-to-ship or ship-to-barge transfers, some of which could be



- 6 -
avoided by direct trading between minor ports or by using modern sea-going
barges capable of operating on both coaatal routes and inland waterways.
Third, not all shipping and domestic distribution is arranged as efficiently
as it might be and some transshipment cargoes could be distributed more easily
by rail from another port. MOC has begun rationalizing some traffic flows.
Shanghai, for example, has already had some coal traffic directed to their
final destinations in surrounding provinces and, by the year 2000, approxi-
mately 34 million tons of other transshipment traffic is expected to be
diverted from the port.
2.09      Recently the ports of Shanghai and DaliLa have each retained foreign
consultants to review their operations, identify weaknesses and recommend
improvements. The reports from these reviews have been submitted and their
conclusions and recomendations are currently under implementation as part of
the Seventh Five Year Plan. HEB has agreed to retain consultants to review
the port operations and submit their report with a proposed action plan before
the end. of 1988 (para. 4.08).
2.10      Each major port has its own maintenance works and port equipment is
kept serviceable, although much of the equipment suffers frequent breakdowns
because of age. The most serious maintenance problem is siltation at the
estuarine ports and this requires considerable routine dredging. Some of the
dredging may be excessive and might be reduced as a result of survey work to
provide a better understanding of estuarine flows.
2.11      Congestion is the overriding problem affecting virtually all of
China's ports. The shortage of berths causes long waiting times; in 1985 the
average was 11.1 days, up from 8.7 days in 1984. The extent of port conges-
tion is so serious that it threatens to hold back further expansion of China's
foreign trade. Within the inadequate total berth capacity, the distribution
of dedicated facilities does not match the present pattern of traffic. In
particular, container handling capacity is well below the potential for con-
tainerized cargo, much of which therefore has to be inefficiently handled as
general cargo. Specialized equipment is similarly scarce, and much of the
equipment that exists is old and outmoded. As a result, ships are further
delayed by slow turnaround times once they have reached a berth.
2.12      A scarcity of storage area and inadequate rail and road links hamper
the efficient turnaround of arriving cargo in a number of the ports. The pro-
per interfacing of different transportation modes is an aspect of port devel-
opment which is now receiving the urgent attention of MOC; however, only road
connections are within its own jurisdiction, while railway connections are the
responsibility of the Ministry of Railways (MR). MR is itself facing a seri-
ous shortage of capacity, and the coordination of its own priority projects
with those of MOC is important.
2.13      Port management systems need updating, particularly in the areas of
operations control, management information, and costing. Computer capacity at
most of the ports is small, and its enlargement is probably a prerequisite to
improvement in all the above areas.



-7-
F. Tariffs
2.14      Ths structure of port tariffs and tariff rates are determined
jointly by the MOC and the State Price Bureau. The present tariff structure
was set up in 1978 on the basis of a somewhat arbitrary allocation of costs to
the different port services. The structure also reflects all the distortions
inherent in the prices of the different factor inputs. As a first step in
rationalizing tariffs, the Bank's first port project in China (Ln 2207-CHA,
October 1982) includes a study of the economic costs of providing port ser-
vices for coal and containers at the project facilities. This study is
expected to be completed on schedule in late 1987, the first complete year of
project operation. The results will be made available to other ports.
2.15      Foreign ships pay higher harbor dues and charges than local ships.
About 80% of all Chinese cargo is carried in vessels owned or operated by the
Chinese Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), which is controLled directly by MOC.
In national terms, port tariffs paid by COSCO are little more than a transfer
payment between two parts of MOC. Tariff rates could be set for efficiency
objectives, but instead they seem to reflect the relative financial strengths
of COSCO and the ports and their different investment requirements. By con-
trast, rates for foreign vessels seem to be set on the basis of what the mar-
ket will bear. A 40X increase was effected in February 1985, but there was no
increase in the lower rates charged for domestic vessels, and MOC says it has
no immediate plans to increase these rates.
2.16      There are no shipping conference rates for Chinese ports and the
ports only rarely pay demurrage charges for ship waiting. Charter contracts
usually include an allowance for ship waiting time, but these charges are paid
by the cargo owner, not by the port. Recently, however, ports have been sign-
ing contracts with ship operators guaranteeing a certain turn around time,
with demurrage charges payable by the port if the time is exceeded or premiums
payable by the ship if it is handled faster. Usually the premiums far exceed
the demurrage charges.
2.17      One of the conditions precedent to rational tariff action is the
adoption of an accurate and uniform system of costing at the ports. At the
present time none such exists, but the Bank has begun discussions with MOC on
developing such a system,possibly with Bank funding.
G. The Role of the Bank Group
2.18      The Bank Group has supported, and will continue to support, the
Government's objective of expanding capacity and improving productivity in the
ports.  The first lending operation in the subsector (Three Ports Project,
Ln. 2207-CiA) fiuanced additional container handling capacity in Shanghai,
Huangpu and Tianjin and a coal terminal at Huangpu.  The second (Tianjin Port
Project, Ln. 2689-CHA) is financing the construction of eleven additional
berths at Tianjin for timber, construction materials and general cargo.  The
Dalian Port Project, at the negotiations stage, will finance the construction
of two containers and two general purpose berths, together with associated
infrastructure. Further operations are in preparation for the ports of
Shanghai, Xiamen and Ningbo.



- 8 -
2.19      The Government has already initiated new organizational models
designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of port operations
(para. 2.05). The Bank Group has supported management systems improvement
with project components addressing computer development, technical studies and
training, and containerization of c&rgo. The work of Bank missions has also
been instrumental in developing Chinese expertise in the economic evaluation
of investment projects, and in updating various aspects of port operation.
H. Experience in Past Lending
2.20      Construction of the Three Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA) is almost
complete, as envisioned at appraisal. There has been a considerable foreign
exchange cost saving under the project as a result of bids being lower than
expected, and $55 million of the original loan of $124 million has been
cancelled. The project is problem free. The Tianjin Port Project (Loan 2689-
CHA $130 million) was approved in April 1986. Implementation is on schedule.
III. HUANGPU P3RT
A.  Existing Facilities
3.01      Huangpu, South China's largest port, is situated close to the
estuary of the Zhujiang (Pearl River) about 130 km northwest of Hong Kong, and
is connected to the South China Sea by a 115 km navigation channel (Map IBRD
19567). It serves the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and Hubei, and
parts of Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces. The port comprises
two terminals (districts). District 1, the older terminal, has eight berths
totalling 1,434 m in length with 8 m depth below mean low water (MLW) along-
side. The recently built District 2 has eight berths totaling 1,520 m in
length with 11-12.5 m depth below MLW alongside. Berths 7 and 8 in District 2
are new container berths under construction. A new coal terminal (two berths)
is being built north of District 2 across one of the many branches of the
Dongjiang. Both berth 8 and the coal terminal were financed by the Bank under
the Three Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA). Two water-to-water berths are also
under construction.
3.02      The tide is semidiurnal (twice daily) with an average range between
mean high and low water of 1.6 m. The port approach channel has two bars, one
north of Tiger Island, and the Ling Ting bar south of Tiger Island (Map 19567);
the Ling Ting bar is the greater navigational obstacle. The two bars have a
combined length of about 53.7 km with a siltation rate necessitating average
annual maintenance dredging of 3.8-4.5 million cu m to maintain depths of 9 m
and 8.6 m below MLW respectively. The port area covers a number of branches
of Dongjiang, Beijiang, and Xijiang rivers, all of which converge into the
Zhujiang estuary.
3.03      Inland waterways provide the most important link between the port
and its hinterland, carrying some 40% of the traffic. In addition, both port
districts are well served by railway with adequate connections to the hinter-
land. The line connecting Guangzhou and Hengyang (part of the route to
Beijing) is rather congested now, but an additional track is being constructed



- 9 -
and will be ready for traffic by 1988. The Cuangzhou-Huangpu highway also
serves both port districts, but it is very narrow (8-12 m) and carries heavy
traffic. It is currently being widened to 18 m and this is expected to be
completed by late 1986. An upgrading of highway network connecting Guangzhou,
Human Province, Shenshen, and Zhuhai is also underway. Transit sheds, storage
warehouses and open storage areas are adequate and the bulk grain berth has
silo storage. Power, water supply and waste disposal systems are adequate,
while telecommunications need some modifications.
S. Traffic
3.04      As in all large ports in China, present facilities are congested.
Traffic at Huangpu port reached 17 million tons in 1985 whereas design capa-
city of its berths is around 12.5 million tons. Over 45Z of the traffic is
foreign trade. The major commodities are coal (211), petroleum (171), iron
and steel (141), grain (81), and chemical fertilizers (81). The remainder
(321), or about 5.5 million tons, are break-bulk and general cargoes.
3.05      Total port traffic is forecast to be about 25.5 million tons by 1990
(a 92 p.a. growth) and 40-50 million tons (about 6X p.a. growth) by the end of
the cent"ry (Annex 5, Table 1). These figures are well in line with macroeco-
nomic projections of quadrupling the output of industry and agriculture by the
year 2000. Given the emphasis placed by Government on foreign trade and the
potential for greater use of coastal shipping, these forecasts could well be
exceeded. Coal and iron ores are expected to grow fastest at 181, and 222
p.a., respectively, between 1985 and 2000. The port also expects to handle
significant amounts of incoming bulk fertilizers in the future. This project
will help expand facilities for this traffic.
C. Organization and Management
3.06      The port of Huangpu is administered by two organizations:  Huangpu
Harbor Superintendency Administration (HESA), under the primary leadership of
HOC, and Huangpu Harbor Bureau (HUB),under the primary leadership of GMC.
HHSA is responsible for common port services such as pilotage, dredging, navi-
gational aids, environmental control, and ship traffic control. HHB, the
beneficiary of the proposed project, is responsible for berth operations and
onshore cargo handling.
3.07     H8B is an administrative and economic unit, with departments con-
cerned with the administration of various aspects of port operations, notably
planning, finance, safety, technical procurement and personnel. The
operations of the port are carried out by a number of self-accounting enter-
prises (comptuies), for which HHB is the supervisory unit. There are two
stevedoring companies responsible respectively for District 1 and District 2
operations, a container company, and other companies concerned with mainte-
nance, equipment repair, passenger terminal operations, and waterway transpor-
tation. A third stevedoring company has recently been formed to operate the
new coal terminal, which was opened in March 1987. HHB also directs the
operations of a port hospital and a school. The organization chart of HHB and
its subordinate enterprises is at Chart A.



- 10 -
D. Planning, Budgeting, Accounting and Auditing
3.08      The long-term planning of Huangpu port's development remains the
responsibility of MOC, HHB's secondary leader. The implementation of major
capital projects is largely carried out under the direction of GMG. HHB
prepares an annual budget against which its expenditures are monitored.
3.09      HHB operates an accrual-based accounting system and follows account-
ing procedures laid down by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Its chart of
accounts and the form of its financial statements (income statement and
balance sheet) are as prescribed by MOC for the ports under its control.
Consolidated statements are prepared annually for HHB and its subordinate
enterprises, and with the addition of a funds flow statement these will be
acceptable to the Bank for the purposes of financial reporting.
3.10      Besides the internal audit procedures applied by MOC to the ports
and by the ports to their subordinate enterprises, external audit of HHB is
now provided by the Audit Administration of the People's Republic of China
(AAPRC). AAPRC carries out the audit of most Bank group projects in China and
is acceptable to the Bank Group as an independent external auditor. At nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained from HHB that it will submit its audited
financial statements to the Bank Group not later than six months after the end
of each financial year. GMG will keep the accounts of the project until it is
completed and handed over to HHB, and accordingly assurances were obtained
from GOC that it will provide the Bank Group with audited accounts of projects
expenditures not later than six months after the end of the financial year.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives
4.01      This project will directly address China's priority concern for the
subsector, to remove port bottlenecks by constructing additional deepwater
berths at a key port.  It will also increase Huangpu port's e.ficiency in han-
dling coal, iron ores, bulk fertilizer and general cargo by providing special-
ized berths with modern equipment. The project will support operational and
management improvement by providing training in the planning, specialized
design, control and operation of ports and by including studies for Huangpu
port of intermodal distribution of cargo, improvement of port management and
operations, and updating the port's master plan. These studies may generate
suggestions for future investment projects.
B.   Description of the Main Project Items.
4.02      The proposed project for the development of Huangpu port consists
of:
(a) Construction at the new Xinsha terminal of five new berths (1986-
1990): one each for coal, iron ore and bulk fertilizer, and two
general purpose berths. This component will require:



- 11 -
(i)  construction of a 600 m quaywall with alongside depth of 11.0 m
for coal, iron ore, and bulk fertilizer berths; construction of a
400 m quaywall with alongside depth of 11.0 m for general cargo
berths; and construction of a 700-m wharf with alongside depth of
4.0 m for lighters and harbor operations vessels. The quaywalls
will be designed with alongside depth of 12.5 m for future use;
(ii) basin dredging and land reclamation and compaction;
(iii) dredging of an east channel (approximately 7 km) to the new
terminal;
(iv) construction of various infrastructural components (which will
serve the future berths at Xinsha as well as those included in
the present project):
a. two railway bridges, and two highway bridges;
b.  the necessary railway lines, roadways and yard pavements;
c. water supply, sewarage and power supply connections;
d. maintenance buildings, auxiliary buildings, etc.;
(v) procurement of ancillary equipment including loading/unloading
equipment, navigational aids, surveying equipment and boats;
(b) training of personnel in China and abroad in the operation and
maintenance of the new facilities, including provision of training
equipment;
(c) technical assistance, including training of counterpart staff, in
the areas of:
(i) construction supervision;
(ii) specialized designs;
(iii) managerial and operational improve_ents in the port;
(d) studies: update of the master plan for Huangpu port, including an
intermodal cargo distribution study of Huangpu and its hinterland,
and a study to optimize the improvement of the inlet channel. Terms
of reference for these studies were discussed and agreed during
negotiations.
4.03      Wharf Construction.  The 1,000 m quaywall is basically designed as a
counterforted reinforced concrete wall. Dredging of about 4 million cubic
meters of soft soil is required, part of which will then be replaced by ade-
quate sand fill and then used after compaction as a foundation for the coun-
terforted wall. About 6 million cubic meters of reclamation sand will be
needed for the 600 m wide apron and storage yards behind the quaywall. Vari-



- 12 -
ous storage facilities are envisaged for the fertilizer berth and the general
purpose berths.  The 700 m lighter and barge berth is basically designed as an
anchored sheetpile wall.
4.04      Infrastructure.  To connect the Xinsha terminal with the main rail-
way line and the main highway, three bridges (highway and two railway) will be
needed to cross the branches of the Zhujiang. Water supply and power supply
will be connected to the proposed project area from the mains; the mains have
adequate capacity to satisfy the needs.
4.05      Training.  About 1,900 personnel are to be trained in operation and
maintenance of the project facilities. Most of the training will be carried
out locally, some by equipment suppliers abroad, and few of the higher
management persons will be trained abroad and funded through the proposed
loan. An analysis of the skills required is at Annex 3.
4.06      Construction Supervision.  Construction of the proiect will be con-
trolled by GMC but day-to-day supervision will be the responsibility of HHB's
Construction Command Department.  They will be assisted by foreign con-
sultants, whose principal tasks will be to arrange the supervision procedure
and to train the Chinese engineers in modern construction management
technology.
4.07      Specialized Designs.  HHB and the Fourth Navigation Design Institute
will need assistance with specialized designs, including in particular those
for automatic control systems, the sewage treatment plant, special moorings to
withstand typhoons, and floating docks. HHB intends to recruit specialist
foreign consultants to assist the Design Institute in these tasks. These
specialized designs are planned to be completed by the end of 1988.
4.08      Managerial and Operational Improvements.  HHB wishes to examine
every opportunity to improve the productivity of the port by procedural or
operational changes. In order to accomplish this goal, HHB intends to retain
consultants to identify any weaknesses and recommend improvements, as was
recently done at Dalian and Shanghai (para. 2.09). Some equipment will be
needed, including in particular computers and word processors. The assignment
is planned to be completed by December 1987.
4.09      Updating the Port's Master Plan.  Under the Three Ports Project
(Ln. 2207-CRA), the Bank financed a Master Planning course at Yantai during
August 1985. With the tools and techniques now available to the Chinese
experts, HHB in collaboration with MOC will upgrade and update the port's
master plan. This master plan will take into consideration, as before, the
development of surrounding ports and the new economic zones. New technologi-
cal innovations in ports such as floating terminals, modification of the barge
fleets and coastal shipping will be evaluated to arrive at a least-cost pro-
gram of development for Huangpu. The updating of the master plan is expected
to be completed by January 1990.
4.10      Intermodal Cargo Distribution Study.  Huangpu is served by
waterways, railways and highways for the distribution of cargo. Optimization
of the use of these transport modes, together with the siting of inland



- 13 -
distribution centers for cargo and the development of vehicles or other means
of transport, are the main objectives of this study, which will be carried out
as part of the master plan.
4.11      Improvement of the Inlet Channel.  The main inlet channel at Huangpu
(approximately 115 km long) will accommodate ships of up to 20,000 DWT, but
the berths at the new terminal at Xinsha are designed for ships of up to
35,0C DWT. Eventually, growth of the port's cargo handling capacity will
depend on enlarging the main channel to accommodate these bigger ships. The
study will determine, in the light of latest traffic forecasts, the optimum
timing and extent of the required dredging. This study will be included in
the updating of the master plan.
C. Cost Estimates
4.12      The total project cost is estimated at Y 1,088 million or
US$251 million equivalent, with a direct and indirect foreign exchange
component of Y 619 million or US$142 million equivalent. Project cost esti-
mates are summarized below and detailed costs are presented in Tables 4.1,
4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.

4.13      Coat estimates for civil works including design and supervision are
based on engineering designs and unit prices for ongoing similar works in
China. Equipment costs are based on the costs of similar equipment recently
purchased in China and in Bank-financed projects in other countries. Esti-
mates are in July 1987 prices, and include physical and price contingencies.
Physical contingencies of 10 have been included for all civil works and
equipment. Price contingencies for foreign costs assume an annual increase of
3.01 for 1987, 1.O for 1988, 1989 and 1990 and 3.51 for 1991 and 1992. Price
contingencies for local costs assume an annual increase of 6.51 for 1987
through 1990 and 4.51 thereafter. Customs duties and taxes amounting to about
101 on civil works and 121 of the purchase price will be levied on imported
equip.ient. Consultants (Louis Berger and Sweco) have reviewed the designs and
cost estimates for both civil works and equipment. About 120 man-months i8
estimated for technical assistance requirements. The rest of the technical
assistance will be used for purposes of training and subsector studies (see
Annex 4).

The loan and credit will be made to the People's Republic of China and will be
used to finance the foreign exchange cost of civil works and procurement of
equipment under contracts awarded through international competitive bidding
(ICB), and the costs of technical assistance and training. The Government
will finance tCe local costs and the remainder of the foreign exchange
costs. At negitiation assurances were obtained from Government that it will
onlend the proceeds of the loan and credit to HHB on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank Group. In accordance with Government's established
procedures, the terms will be those prescribed for enterprises in the ports
subsector; currently these are 41 p.a. over 20 years with a grace period equal
to the period of construction. HHB wi'.l bear the foreign exchange risk
between the US dollar and the Yudn. Signature of a subsidiary loan agreement
satisfactory to the Bank Group would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan.

E. Status of Preparation
4.15      The quaywall designs are complete, and consultants have reviewed
them and prepared bidding docuemnts for both civil works and equipment. Pre-
qualification of contractors is in progress; the call for tenders is planned
for January 1988 and the evaluation of bids from April to June 1988.
Construction is expected to start in 1988.
E. Implementation
4.16      The implementation of the physical components of the proposed
project falls under the responsibility of Construction Command Department,
which will undertake the completion of all design work, bidding, construction
supervision and import of equipment. Assistance will be provided by the
Fourth Navigational Design Institute, foreign consultants and China National
Technical Import Corporation as appropriate. The remaining components of the
project (training, technical assistance and studies) are the responsibility of
HHB under the supervision of the Planning Committee of GMG. At negotiations,
assurances were obtained from HHB that it will carry out (a) the training in
accordance with a program to be agreed with the Bank Group and (b) the studies
on the basis of terms of reference and timing agreed with the Bank Group.
4.17      Land needed for the project will be reclaimed from the river and
compacted within the project. Civil works and equipment installation are
expected to be completed by the end of 1990. Construction, procurement and
installation schedules are shown in Charts B and C.
G. Procurement
4.18      Procurement would be carried out according to the following table:

- 16 -
4.19      Two civil works contracts will be awarded through ICB, one for wharf
construction (US$40 million) and the other for the rest of the infrastructure
(US$30.17 million). The remaining civil works, which are mainl7 outside the
port and not financed by the Bank Group, will be carried out by contractors
chosen through LCB (see Table 4.1 for details). Prequalification of
contractors will be carried out for civil works contracts to be awarded under
ICB; qualifying domestic contractors for such works will receive a preference
in bid evaluation of 71Z of the total contract cost. Equipment will be
procured through ICB. Qualifying domestic suppliers of goods will receive a
preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the cif price or the import duty,
whichever is lower. Some small items to be agreed with the Bank and amounting
to less than US$200,000 per contract, and aggregaLing less than US$1,000,000,
would be procured under contracts awarded after evaluation and comparison of
quotations solicited from at least three qualified suppliers under procedures
acceptable to the Bank Group. Contracts to be awarded under ICB will be
subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation and proposed
contract awards. Consuitants for the technical assistance and training
components will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
H.   Disbursement
4.20      Disbursement from the proceeds of the loan and credit will cover:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures on equipment or 100% of the local ex-factory
expenditures, and 75% of other items locally procured; (b) 100% of foreign
expenditures and 30% of the local expenditures on civil works procured under
ICB; and (c) 100% of the costs of technical assistance and training.
Disbursement will be made against full documentation except for reimbursement
of the technical assistance and training and contracts for civil works and
goods each valued less than US$200,000 equivalent, which will be disbursed
against statements of expenditure. Supporting documents for the statements of
expenditure will be kept in the offices of GMG and HHB and will be available
for inspection by Bank supervision missions. On the basis of the
implementation schedules shown in Charts B and C, a schedule of estimated
quarterly disbursements has been prepared (Table 4.5). This schedule is based
on the assumption that the proposed loan and credit will become effective by
February 1988 and the closing date will be December 31, 1993. It follows dis-
bursement profiles of similar ports projects in China and in other
countries. A special account will be set up and maintained in US dollars at a
bank acceptable to the Bank Group, which will facilitate the disbursement of
small expenditures; the authorized allocation would be US dollar equivalent to
SDR 4.8 million, representing approximately four months' estimated
expenditures.
I.   Ecology and Environment
4e21      The project will not affect the existing ecology of the port of
Huangpu. Dredging spoil will be disposed of at dumping sites well away from
the port area. The terminal design will incorporate necessary precautions to
minimize pollution.

J. Reporting
4.22      HHB will submit to the Bank Group semiannual reports starting
June 30, 1988, covering the progress of project construction and all relevant
information including actual traffic through the existing port facilities. In
addition, promptly after project completion, HHB will prepare and furnish to
the Bank Group a report (the project completion report) on the execution and
initial operation of the project and the costs and benefits derived and to be
derived from it.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Costs and Benefits
5.01      For this analysis, all inputs and outputs have been evaluated in
constant July 1987 economic prices. Financial cost estimates were converted
to economic costs by shadow pricing major cost components and by applying
aggregate conversion factors estimated in previous Bank studies. Price
contingencies, taxes and duties are excluded (details are in Annex 5, Tables
6, 7 and 8). For traded goods, cif prices of imports and fob prices of
exports were used in estimating the cost of material and equipment, with due
adjustment for the cost of inland transportation.
5.02      The project will increase the port throughput capacity to about 32
million tons, which will barely be sufficient to handle the forecast traffic
up to 1995. Construction of a further five berths (three multipurpose, and
two timber berths) is tentatively planned to follow completion of the first
five. The railway, highway and bridge connections to the port and the water,
se' age, electricity, and telecommunication hookups necessary to serve all ten
berths, and part of the subsidiary buildings, are provided for in this proj-
ect. Therefore the economic analysis is based on the benefit/cost of con-
structing 10 berths.
5.03      The quantifiable benefits attributable to the proposed project are
cargo handling cost savings, ship tiLe savings and cargo time savings. Bene-
fits build up rapidly after project completion since the port is already very
congested.  After the year 2000, when project facilities will be used to their
full capacity, the project benefits are assumed to be constant.
5.04      Ship time savings account for at least two thirds of the first year
benefits (66Z for general cargo berths, 751 for the fertilizer berth, 801 for
the coal berth and 97% for the iron ore berth), increasing to 68-97% by 2000.
These include the reduction in ship time awaiting berth, and at berth due to
improved cargo h&ndling productivity. Cargo handling cost savings account for
most of the remaining benefits, and cargo time savings represent only a small
fraction of the total (Annex 5, Tables 11.1-11.3). As about 751 of the ships
calling at Huangpu are either Chinese owned or operated, most of the project
benefits will accrue to China directly.



- 18 -
B. Overall Evaluation and Risks
5.05      On the basis of the total project costs and the benefits described
above, the overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is 212. The
sensitivity of the ERR to variations in costs and benefits is summarized
below:
ERR
(%)
Base case                                        21.3
15X increase in costs                            18.9
15% reduction in benefits                        18.5
15% increase in costs combined with
151 reduction in benefits                      16.2
This ERR calculation uses the annualized resale value of ships in calculating
the ship-time savings benefit; this method usually gives a slightly lower rate
of return than using annualized replacement value of ships.
5.06      The economic benefits are calculated on the assumption that the port
could handle all the traffic demand without the project, by using measures
such as lightering from anchorage. This is a conservative assumption. Some
traffic might conceivably be diverted to other ports at a much higher total
transport cost, but since these other ports are themselves congested, it is
more likely that some traffic demand would simply not be satisfied. The eco-
nomic development of the port hinterland would be adversely affected; the cost
is difficult to estimate but could be substantial.
5.07      The major risk is that of delay in project start-up due to the
introduction of ICB for civil works. To minimize this risk appropriate Bank
assistance and supervision will be provided in the early stages of the proj-
ect. It is unlikely that traffic will fall short of estimates and it may
indeed be higher, which means the use of project berths will be maximized at
all time once construction is completed.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Past Results
6.01      HHB's financial results 11 for 1983-1985 are at Table 6.1; the
salient points are summarized below:
1983      1984       1985
Traffic ('000 tons)                  16,008    15,866    16,803
Net revenue (Y million) /a             80.4      101.3     138.5
Operating Profit (Y million)           44.2       58.4      86.1
Get profit (Y million)                  4.2       12.9      25.6
Operating ratio                          45         42         39
Return on assets /b employed (Z)       16.0       18.2      22.9
/a Excluding taxes.
/b At historic cost.
Revenue grew faster than traffic volume during the period because of a tariff
increase in 1985 and a favorable movement in traffic mix; foreign cargo (which
carries a higher tariff than domestic) grew from 371 to 46Z of total traffic,
and higher rated commodities (notably iron and steel) grew relative to lower
rated items (notably coal and petroleum, both of which declined). Average
revenue per ton of cargo handled thus increased from Y 3.0 to Y 5.1. Unit
costs increased only from Y 1.7 to Y 2.0. Profits were assisted by the growth
in container traffic which tripled in volume, although still remaining a small
proportion (21) of total traffic. As a result of these factors the port's
operating ratio and return on assets employed--already good in 1983--improved
further.
B.   Present Financial Position
6.02     At the end of 1985, HHB's financial condition was very sound.
Current assets substantially exceeded current liabilities, with two thirds of
current assets in the form of cash. The salient points of the balance sheet
(Table 6.3) are as follows:
1/        Subordinate enterprises consolidated.



- 20 -
Y million
Fixed assets (net)                                  423.0
Current assets                                       45.0
Special fund assets                                  51.5
Total                                           519.5
Equity                                              406.5
Long-term debt                                       23.7
Current liabilities                                  23.4
Special funds                                        65.9
Total                                           519.5
6.03      The low (5S) debt content in total capitalization reflects the Gov-
ernment policy prior to 1985, in which funding for capital expenditures was
provided by the state exclusively in the form of grant. In 1985 this was
changed to a policy of loan financing for all expenditures except marine civil
works.
6.04      In 1987, as part of the reformed administrative arrangementgs for
the port (para. 2.05), HHB was given considerable scope to finance capital
expenditure from retained earnings. The income tax and adjustment tax to
which its profits had previously been subject were cancelled, and instead its
earnings are to be applied as follows:
(a) first, to repayment of foreign loans;
(b) next, to special funds for production development and workers'
welfare and bonuses;
(c) next, to repayment of local loans;
(d)  finally, to capital expendiure.
In the event that profits available for capital expenditure exceed the capital
budget for the year, the excess is to be remitted to the state; in the event
of a shortfall, the deficit will be made up by the state in the form of loans.
C.   Future Financial Performance
6.05      Financial projections for the period 1986-93 based on HUB's traffic
forecasts are at Tables 6.1-6.3. Assuming the 1986 tariff schedule is unchanged
in real terms, average revenues will decline because of a gradual change in the
traffic mix in favor of less profitable commodities and an increase in the
proportion of domestic traffic, which carries lower rates. As a result, the
operating ratio will deteriorate somewhat, but overall profitability remains
satisfactory with a rate of return on assets employed of over 13X throughout
the period. Clearly, any action to reduce the differential between foreign
and domestic tariff rates (para. 2.14) would serve only to improve this
result.



- 21 -
6.06      The forecasts indicate that the new financial arrangements
introduced for HHB in 1987 (which will endure at least through 1990) will be
adequate for HHB's needs. After allowing for funds provided from the Bank
group financing, HHB will generate sufficient internal funds to complete the
funding of the project without recourse to local loans; in fact, upwards of
Y 150 million could be available by 1992 for capital investments beyond the
project. At that time the port will be capitalized roughly equally by equity
and long term debt, and debt service would be comfortably covered over 1.5
times. At negotiations, assurances were obtained from HHB that it will main-
tain its revenue at a level sufficient to cover its full costs of operation
including depreciation, and to meet from internally generated funds all its
financial obligations including debt service, taxes and allocations to special
funds.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      At negotiations, assurances were obtained:
(a) from Government, that it will:
(i) provide the Bank Group with audited accounts of project expendi-
tures not later than six months after the end of each financial
year (para. 3.10); and
(ii) onlend the proceeds of the Bank Group loan and credit to HHB on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.14);
(b) from HHB, that it will:
(i) submit to the Bank Group its audited financial statements not
later than six months after the end of each financial year
(para. 3.10);
(ii) carry out the training components of the project in accordance
with a program to be agreed with the Bank Group (para. 4.16);
(iii) carry out the studies included in the project on the basis of
terms of reference and timing agreed with the Bauk Group (para.
4.16); and
(iv) maintain its revenue at a level sufficient to cover its full
costs of operation including depreciation, and to meet from
internally generated funds all its financial obligations
including debt service, taxes and allocations to special funds
(para. 6.06).
7.02      Approval of the Loan and Credit Agreements by China's State Council,
and execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and HHB,
would be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 4.14).



- 22 -
7.03      Agreement having been reached on the above matters, the project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$63 million to the People's
Republic of China for a term of 20 years, including five of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate, and an IDA credit of US$25 million
equivalent, on standard terms with 35 years maturity.

CHINA
HUANCPU PORT PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
A. Hinterland and Traffic
1.        Hinterland.  Huangpu port serves the four provinces of Guangdong,
Guangxi, Hunan and Hubei and parts of Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan.
It is very conveniently located at the confluence of three rivers which merge
into the Pearl River estuary between Guangzhou and Hongkong. The longest is
the west river extending to Guangxi province and presently navigable by 200-
500 ton barges to Wuzhou (eastern Guangxi). The north and the east rivers
primarily serve Guangdong province. Rail access is also convenient and work
is underway to complete the double tracking of the Beijing-Guangzhou line
through Guangdong province. Double track on the critical section connecting
Guangzhou and Hengyang in Hunan province is expected to be open to traffic in
1988, doubling the line capacity to 30 mt p.a. The distribution network
radiating from the port is very convenient, particularly the inland water
system which carries some 401 of the port's traffic. The nearest ports
southwest and east of Huangpu port are Zhanjiang and Shantou; both have poor
distribution networks. There is, therefore, no other economic alternative to
the Pearl River estuary to serve the hinterland of Huangpu port.
2.        The investigation of new port development in the estuary of the
Pearl River started in the late 1970s. A study compared three different
locations including five sites in the Pearl River estuary, and concluded that
the Xinsha site is the most appropriate to be developed now.
3.        Present Traffic.  As in all large ports in China, present facilities
are congested.  Traffic at Huangpu port reached 17 million tons in 1985
whereas design capacity of its berths is around 12.5 million tons. Over 451
of the traffic is foreign trade. The major commodities are coal (211),
petroleum (171), iron and steel (141), grain (8X), and chemical fertilizers
(82). The remainder (32Z), or about 5.5 million tons, are break bulk and
general cargoes (Table 1). The inland water system and coastal shipping are
the most important modes of transport between the port and its hinterland. In
1985 the inland water system handled about 331 of the outgoing cargo and
coastal shipping handled about 851 of the incoming cargo. The other important
mode of transport is the railwa7, handling 271 of outgoing cargo and 5% of
incoming carlgo (Table 2).
4.        Future Traffic.  Total port traffic is forecast to be about 25.5
million tons by 1990 (a 9Z per annum growth) and 40-50 million tons (about 61
per annum growth) by the end of the century (Table 1). These figures are well
in line with macro-economic projections of a quadrupled output of industry and
agriculture by the year 2000. Given the emphasis placed by Government on
foreign trade and the potential for greater use of coastal shipping, these
traffic forecasts could well be exceeded. Coal and iron ores are expected to



- 29 -                              ANNEX 5
Page 2
grow fastest at 181 and 22X p.a. respectively between 1985 and 2000. The port
also expects to handle significant amounts of incoming bulk fertilizers.
B. Operations
Without the Project
S.        The port now operates 16 dry cargo berths, nine of which are for
ships of 20,000 DWT and the rest are limited to 10,000 DWT. Seven of the
berths are fully dedicated; two each for coal and containers, and one each for
iron ore, grain, and passenger, leaving 9 berths to handle general cargo,
which is broadly defined here as the rest of traffic not handled by
specialized berths. The number of general cargo berths will increase in 1986-
87 to 11 with the addition of two new water-to-water transport berths at Hong
Shengsha which are near completion. The port also includes 2 petroleum
berths, and two coal berths at the Xiji coal terminal which are completed and
opened to traffic in early 1987. Total throughput capacity of these 22 berths
will be about 21 million tons, which is still not sufficient to handle the
rapidly growing traffic.
6.        Like other major ports in China, Huangpu port works three 8-hour
shifts, with a net working time per shift of 5.3 hours, equivalent to 16 hours
per day. Because of the very large traffic increase in recent years, the port
has achieved a high throughput of about 400,000 tons of general cargo per
berth. Tables 3.1-3.3 summarize the operational characteristics of existing
coal, iron ore and general cargo berths including fertilizer and timber
handling capacity.
7.        Presently the average shipment size is around 13,500 tons for coal,
iron ores and timber, and 10,000 tons for general cargo, which are relatively
small. The rapid increase in traffic volume is being accommodated mainly by
an increase in the number rather than size of ships arriving at port, thus
greatly adding to the congestion. Ships now spend more time waiting for
berths than being loaded/unloaded. In 1985, the ship port day analysis
(Tables 4.1-4.3) shows the ratio of average ship berth days to average ship
waiting days in port to be 1:1 $or general cargo, 1:4 for coal, and 3:1 for
iron ore. Without the project, and with the increasing volume of traffic,
this situation would certainly become worse. Total ship waiting days for
these three categories of cargo in 1985 was 8,202 (Table 5.1-5.3). With an
average ship value per day in port of about US$5,400, this represent an annual
economic cost of US$44.3 million, or about 161 of the total project costs.
With the Project
8.        The project will provide 5 new berths, one each for coal, iron ore,
and bulk fertilizer and 2 for general cargo. These five berths constitute
Phase I (1987-1991) of the proposed development plan for Huangpu port; phase
II consists of another 5 berths (1989-1993). The "with-project" analysis of
operations and its economic evaluation are based on both phases of development
because Phase II will follow phase I without interuption, and also because the
associated road, rail and and other infrastructure provided in phase I will
serve both phases. The five berths included in the phase I project will open



ANNEX 5
- 30 -                                 Page 3
to traffic in 1992. The remaining five will open to traffic between 1993 and
1997.
9.        With the project, one existing iron ore berth and two existing coal
berths will revert to general cargo in 1992, bringing the total number of
general cargo berths in 1992 to 16. Coal will be handled on 3 specialized
coal berths (1 project berth and 2 Xiji coal terminal). Iron ore and bulk
fertilizer will each have one specialized berth. Operational characteristics
of the proposed berths are on Tables 3.1-3.3.
10.       The forecast traffic in coal, iron ore, fertilizer, timber and
general cargo is sumarized on Table 5.1-5.3 This traffic is likely to
increase rapidly between now and the project opening date (para. 4) and then
grow at around 6% p.a. for coal and timber, 41 p.a. for iron ore and about 41
p.a. for general cargo (Table 1). The low growth rate for general cargo
traffic is the result of the increase in containerization. It is expected
that by 1995, about 401 of the containerizable cargo will be containerized.
11.       Tables 5.1-5.3 also show cargo handling with and without the
proposed berths. They are based on the operational parameters of Tables 3.1-
3.3 and the forecast traffic. Without the project, traffic far exceeds the
practical capacity of existing berths. For the purpose of the economic
evaluation it has been assumed that alternative handling methods -- for
example, lightering -- would be adopted when waiting times exceed those
corresponding to 951 berth occupancy. This assumption is rather conservative
as waiting time increases more rapidly than the corresponding increase in
berth occupancy rate and congestion becomes more serious. Lightering has also
been assumed to be the means of loading/unloading traffic when it exceeds the
practical capacity of existing berths, which is assumed to be 95% for general
cargo and 901 for the rest of the traffic.,
12.       With the project, waiting time would be reduced drastically, corres-
ponding to the reduction in berth occupancy rate. However, general cargo
traffic would still use up the maximum practical capacity of the berths. At
least two more general cargo berths and two timber berths will be needed by
1995-1996. This analysis assumes the timely construction of the Phase II
development of Xinsha port, in which three more general cargo berths are to be
constructed. The occupancy rate would drop to 83X in 1996, if by that time
timber berths were ready to take timber traffic off the general cargo
berths. It would climb again to 88% by 2000, indicating that more general
cargo berths will be needed shortly thereafter unless more containerization
takes place to convert more general cargo traffic to container traffic.
C. Economic Evaluation
Project Costs
13.       Financial cost estimates have been converted to economic costs by
shadow pricing and by excluding price contingencies, taxes and duties.
Conversion factors for various cost categories have been estimated in two
ways:



- 31 -                                 ANNEX 5
Page 4
(a) for major items such as wharf construction, handling equipment and
reclamation and consolidation, by separately shadow pricing each
cost component (Tables 6 and 7); and
(b) for minor items such as utilities, auxiliary buildings and ancillary
facilities, by applying aggregate conversion factors estimated in
previous Bank studies (Table 8).
Conversion factors for major items are near one; the overall factor for the
project is 1.05. The factors derived for the various cost items have been
applied to the table of annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of
project economic costs (Table 9).
Project Benefits
14.       Quantifiable benefits attributable to the proposed project are
cargo-handling cost savings, ship time savings and cargo time savings.
Benefits build up quickly because of the prevailing congestion, but they have
been assumed constant after the year 2000 when the project facilities will be
used to their full capacity.
15.       Cargo-handling Cost Savings.  Handling costs estimated by HHB for
the existing as well as for the proposed new berths are given in Table 3.1-
3.3. Small savings are expected from handling general cargo over the itew
berths. However, without the project, the only way to handle traffic in
excess of berth capacity would be through more cosly lightering; otherwise
ship time at port would be extended, which provea K  be still more costly.
HHB estimates lightering costs to be 3 to 4 times normal handling costs,
Detailed estimates of handling cost savings are in Table 10.1-10.3.
Lightering has been assumed for cargo tonnage in excess of berth capacity at
95% occupancy for general cargo, 65% for coal and fertilizer and 50% for iron
ores, at a cost three times that of normal handling.
16.       Savings in handling costs have been converted to economic benefits
by shadow pricing the main cost components of normal handling and of lighter-
ing. Conversion factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1 for lightering are
used here. These factors were estimated in previous Bank study for the
Tianjin port project.
17.       Ship Time Savings.  These include both the reduction in shif time
while awaiting berth and at berth due to improved cargo handling. Estimates
of ship waiting time with and without the project are calculated in Table 5.1-
5.3. Ship costs in port are based on the ship cost model developed by the
Bank, updated to reflect recent world market prices. The annualized ship
resale value plus operating costs is used to calculate project benefits. This
gives a cost per day of Y 19,980 (US$5,400) for general cargo ships. The
annual resale value of ships has been assumed to reflect the presently
depressed state of the shipping industry; it gives little lower rate of return
than the annualized replacement value of ships.
18.       Cargo Time Savings.  Savings in ship time apply also to cargo:  the
benefit is in interest savings on cargo valuie. For domestic cargo, the



ANNEX S
- 32 -                                   Page 5
marginal source of working capital would be loans from PBC at 6.5-7.5%
interest. For foreign cargo, higher foreign exchange working capital would
mean more foreign borrowing and it is assumed that this would be at China's
marginal cost of capital of around 121. Roughly two-thirds of all cargo
passing through Huangpu is foreign trade cargo, and imports account for about
half of total cargo. Interest savings have therefore been calculated assuming
an average rate of interest of 9.5% p.a.
19.       Total project benefits by year for the three items discussed above
are calculated in Table 11.1-11.3. The majority of project benefits would be
in ship time savings. These would accrue first to ship owners and could be
passed on to cargo owners. As about 75% of the ships calling at Huangpu are
either Chinese owned (COSCO) or operated, most of the project benefits will
accrue to China.
Rate of Return Calculation and Sensitivity Analysis
20.       Tables 12.1-12.3 set out the rate of return calculation; Table 12.4
shows the rate of return of the entire project. Cost data are taken from
Table 8 and total benefits from Table 11.  The "base case" rate of return is
21.3%. The sensitivity of the economic returns to variations in costs and
benefits are summarized as follows:
ERR
Iron      General   Project
Coal     ores        cargo     total
Base case                                   23.2       28.6       17.6      21.3
15% increase in cost                        20.9       25.9       15.3      18.9
15% reduction in benefits                   20.5       25.5       14.9      18.5
15% increase in cost combined with
15% reduction in benefits                 18.3      22.9        12.7      16.2
The results show that the project remains well justified even with sizable
variations in project costs and benefits.   The assumption that the port could
handle all the traffic demand by measures such as lightering is a conservative
one. Some traffic might be diverted to other ports at a much higher cost, but
since these other ports are themselves congested, it would be more likely that
traffic would be curtailed, adversely affecting the economic development of
the port hinterland. The cost of such curtailment is difficult to estimate
but it could be substantial.

HUANGPU PORT PROJECT
Outline Terms of Reference for Special Designs
Introduction
1.        The port of Huangpu is the largest port in South China and serves
the provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou and Guanxi. Special designs are
needed for the port's future expansion. Consultants are to be recruited to
assist the port of Huangpu and the 4th Navigation Design Institute in
preparing the required designs.
Scope of the Designs
2.        The special designs would include:
(a) mooring facilities to withstand typhoons;
(b) floating terminals;
(c) water and power supply;
(d) computer control systems;
(e) environmental protection;
(f) marine structures, particularly cellular cofferdams.
3.        The consultant is expected to advise the Chinese engineers and
direct them in completing these required designs.
Timing and Staffing
4,        It is expected that six consultants will be needed for variable
periods of time totalling from 30-35 man-months. The assignment will start in
January 1987.

HUANGPU PORT PROJECT
UPDATING HASTERPLAN AND THE
INTERNODAL STUDY
Terms of Reference
1.   Introduction
The Port of Huangpu is the largest port in the south of the People's
Republic of China and the gateway to the industrial and consumption centres of
three main southern provinces Guangdong, Guangxi and Hunan.
Due to the fast economic growth of the People's Republic of China in
the last years, the port's throughout has increased in the last few years. It
is estimated that this development will also continue in the next few years,
in particular for bulk, general cargo and container cargo.
The port of Huangpu was not in a position to entirely cope with the
increased cargo volume, which led to a port congestion. This congestion
creates direct and indirect diseconomies for the country and it is therefore
necessary to optimize the operation in the existing facilities and extend the
facilities/capacities of the Port of Huangpu. As a planning frame the port
Xasterplan of Huangpu must be therefore updated.
2.   Description of the Project/Objective
Huangpu Harbor Bureau (HHB) has established a planning scheme for
the port with special regard to the construction of a new port facility
outside of the existing port area. This plan shall enable the port to cope
with the future requirements of the anticipated throughput. It is deemed
necessary to update these plannings payment attention to the long-term
development up to the year 2005, because of the following three reasons:
-    the increase of cargo throughput in the Port of Huangpu was faster
than expected during the last years and it becomes indispensable to
review the traffic forecast and the respective modal split of cargo
and inland transportation.
-    it is the aim of the port to deal completely with all possible
improvements and optimization measures in the existing port area
before getting engaged in major investments in new port facilities;
it is therefore important to identify and quantify the feasible
optimizations in the short- and medium run and, based on these
findings, update the plans for the long-term development of the
port.
-    one of the main reasons of existing congestion in the port is the
bottleneck in inland transport capacities and organization;
recommendations in upgrading will lead to improvements in the port
and will thereby influence the contents of the port planning.



- 61 -                                ANNEX 8
Page 2
It is therefore the overall objective of the project to establish an uplated
masterplan for the Port of Huangpu on the basis of a sound long-term forecast,
dealing with the aspects of optimization measures of existing facilities
before planning future extensions of the port.
3.   Scope of Work
Traffic forecast
According to the current Five-years' plan (1986 - 1990) the traffic
forecast is only available up to the year 1990, indicating the various
commodities separately.
It is necessary to make a review of the existing traffic forecast
for the Port and to collect necessary relevant data in order to prepare a
detailed forecast for the years up to 1995. The forecast shall be given for
each main commodity-group (for e.g. oil, coal, iron-ore, NE-ore, chemicals,
salt, grain, timber, soyabean, corn, wheat, conventional general cargo,
containers and ro/ro-cargo), separated into incoming and outgoing traffic for
each of the nine years and a further indication of the trend of each major
commodity/class shall be given for the years 2000 and 2005.
Special attention has to be paid to the trend of containerization
and possible implementation of ro/ro-services in the future as this will
affect the layout of a masterplan considerably. In this connection
investigations have to be undertaken about the development in kind and size of
ships calling most likely at the Port of Huangpu in the future.
As far as the modal split in landside transportation of cargoes is
concerned, investigations of the future infrastructural plans have to be made,
taking into consideration that the long-distance transportation will mainly be
made by rail, whereas truck and barge will dominate in the transport on
medium- and short distance.
Optimization of existing port facilities
As far as optimization measures for the existing port facilities are
concerned, it is necessary to consider the best allocation of the different
commodities between the existing facilities, to review the landuse,
suitability and layout of the present area, to analyze the operational methods
and available equipment and thereafter make recommendations for any physical
improvements to existing facilities and handling techniques. These analyses
shall include, among others:
-    operational investigations with regard to ship's pre-planning,
ship's operation, storage, methods and procedures
-    investigations regarding operational documentation including aspects
of use of computers
-    investigations regarding the port equipment and cargo handling gear



- 62 -                             ANNEX 8
Page 3
-    investigations concerning the allocation of trades/commodities
between different and specialized port areas in order to establish
special terminals which will guarantee operational improvements and
increased productivities
-    establishing of sound operational capacity calculations
-    analysis of tariff components with an impact on operational aspects
(e.g. free storage time, incentives for unitization of cargo)
-    investigations regarding workshop facilities, installations and
maintenance and repair performance
-    investigations concerning rehabilitation/relocation of existing port
facilities
-    investigations of hinterland connections (rail/waterway/road) from
the existing port facilities and recommendations for improvements
with a special view to the urban traffic of the city of Guangzhou
=    investigations concerning possible locations for future intermodal
freight terminals as cargo distribution centers outside of the port
area and identification of the effect of such terminals on the
situation in the port
-    investigations regarding improvements of rolling stock equipment for
inland transport (as far as it affects the port's performance)
Special attention shall be paid to the fact that a concentration of
the present container traffic at Huangpu seems to become indispensable
(container handling in 1984 = abt. 24,000 TEUa; present estimate for 1990 =
100,000 containers).
All recommended measures of optimization for the existing Port of
Huangpu shall be identified, quantified concerning the expected increased
throughput, timed according to priorities regarding short- and medium-term
implementation possibilities and evaluated with costs involved.
They shall also be divided into
-    measures without physical investments
-    measures with minor investments
-    measures with larger investments
Any possible changes/rehabilitation in the design of the existing port
facilities shall be laid down in preliminary designs. Preliminary costs shall
be given for the proposals to + 15X accuracy and shall be calculated on the
basis of estimated quantities and unit prices applicable for work of a similar
nature in the People's Republilc of China. Cost estimates shall be made up of
required expenditures in local and foreign currencies, which shall be given
separately.

Port extension
On the basis of the newly established traffic forecast and the
recommended optimization measures for the existing port facilities, necessary
future port extensions have to be investigated. This may lead to a
review/updating of the planned Xinsha terminal expansion which is designated
at present for bulk cargo, containers and conventional general cargo. Also
alternative locations for port extensions, others than Xinsha area shall be
investigated and throughly analyzed concerning their feasibility, taking into
account the future industrial planning of Guangzhou and the surrounding
provinces, hinterland connections as well as the draught limitations within
the entire river.
These investigations shall include any necessary subsoil
investigations, topographical surveys, hydrological investigations and any
other measures in order to guarantee the preparation of reliable preliminary
designs.
Special attention should be paid to investigations of the hinterland
connections in order to clearly identify any restrictions for waterway, road-
and rail-access. Furthermore, the plans shall give indications of possible
locations for any intermodal freight stations outside of the port area for
storage, consolidation and distribution of cargo.
All preliminary designs have to beset up and the drawings shall show
the principal dimension plans of all major structures and typical cross-
sections, indicating major features of the proposed design and shall
specifically include, where appropriate, the road- and rail-access systems
proposed.
The preliminary for any new port extension facilities shall also
include:
-    number and kind of necessary handling equipment and related workshop
facilities
-    organizational recommendations for new terminals
-    operational systems and procedures
-    sound operational capacity calculations
Cost-benefit-analysis
Finally an economic evaluation of development schemes shall be
carried out to enable the determination of optimum solution and timing of
investments in order to meet the objectives of the study. The economic
evaluation shall include a cimparison of economic benefits and costs of each
project alternative to be presented in annual tabulations for the forecast
period or for the expected economic life of the facilities.



ANNEX 8
- 64 -                                 Page 5
The feasibility study shall be based on a determination of the
estimated minimum total costs of constructing and operating the proposed
facilities and shall include the determination of the economic return on
investment (the discount rate which equalizes the present value of the benefit
and cost streams over the life of the project). For this purpose permanent
installations shall be considered to have a life of 20 years. The sensitivity
of the economic return to changes, within a feasible range, in the values of
key variaoles shall be tested.
Benefits shall include estimates of savings in transport costs
attributable to possible project alternativest e.g. reductions in ship
operating costs, cargo handling costs, delays and inland transportation
costs. Other benefits to be considered shall include reduction in port
maintenance and equipment operating costs and, where appropriate, increases in
tho. new value of industrial and agricultural output.
Furthermore, an analysis of prospective costs and revenues for the
developments has to be made, calculating the financial return on each of these
investments. The financial analysis shall include estimates of annual
capital, maintenance and operating costs and of the costs for cargo handling,
storage, vessel berthing and other port operations.
These costs shall be attributed to the various services provided in
the port facilities,
Forecasts of operating revenues and expenditures have to be prepared
as well as cash flow and pro-forma annual balance sheets for the 9-year*-
period (up to 1995) and finally the rate of return on net fixed assets and the
operating ratios for the port as a whole have to be calculated.
Masterplan
Based upon all the considerations previously described in this
section a complete masterplan shall be provided, indicating.
-    a sound traffic forecast
-    the optimum use of the existing facilities
-    improvements in organizational and operational methods in the port
-    proposed changes in existing facilities with layouts and cost
estimates
-    proposed additional investments in the port, their location, design
and capacities
-    proposals for improved land access
