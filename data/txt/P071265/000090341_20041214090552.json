The lessons learned indicate that\n            Government's strong commitment to the reforms supported\n            by a technical assistance project is a decisive factor in\n            its success. Technical assistance operations are likely to\n            be more successful if clearly linked to adjustment\n            operations. Project implementation and outcomes benefit from\n            a simple project design and a limited number of components.\n            The implementation of a project involving different\n            counterparts increases supervision and coordination efforts.\n            Institutional capacity building programs carried out by\n            developing and/or strengthening local skills result in\n            increased ownership and sustainability of the project\n            outcomes. Close donor coordination and good policy dialogue\n            with the authorities help newly established institutions\n            build their market reputation as independent and\n            professional entities. The efficient and effective use of\n            the project funding requires trainees' strong\n            participation in and ownership of training programs.\n            Effectiveness of training programs can be fully assessed\n            only sometime after their completion. In Kosovo as well as\n            in other transitional realities, the hierarchical structure\n            of the society and its systems (e.g., judiciary system,\n            education system) is particularly strong and rigid, and\n            relatively hermetic. Locally-based World Bank support plays\n            a crucial role in ensuring good project design, effective\n            supervision, and good policy dialogue with relevant\n            stakeholders, including donors."}, "docdt": "2004-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
