                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to improve the delivery of urban services through enhancing the quality of urban infrastructure and strengthening the institutional and
                         financial framework. The proposed repeater project would build on and consolidate the achievements of TNUDP II, continuing to improve urban infrastructure services in
                         Tamil Nadu in a sustainable manner. The two main objectives are:

                          to strengthen and deepen the empowerment of ULBs by continuing the decentralization process through delegation of powers from state level bodies to ULBs; and
                         through continuing and expanding the capacity building programs started under TNUDP II; and

                         to mobilize resources on a sustainable basis for urban infrastructure investments through:
                         - mobilizing private financing for ULB infrastructure investments by linking ULBs to the financial markets through the intermediation of the Tamil Nadu Urban
                         Development Fund (TNUDF);
                         - providing incentives for investments in low income neighborhoods through the use of supporting capital grants.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
