were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned are as follows:  For complex components that are\n            part of demand-driven, \u0091framework\u0092 type projects (such as\n            the Chennai urban transport sub-component), specific\n            measures may be needed to address associated risks \u0096 for\n            instance in terms requiring higher proportion (e.g. 30%) of\n            major investment components ready (i.e. ready for bidding or\n            contract award), resolution of land acquisition issues to\n            the extent possible, etc. The concept of having a state\n            level urban agency/Municipal Fund such as TNUDF, which would\n            help in dealing with the challenges of urbanization,\n            especially for smaller cities, is a good design concept. At\n            appraisal, the project/loan period should be calibrated\n            taking into account project complexity rather than it being\n            standardized to around five years."}, "docdt": "2014-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
