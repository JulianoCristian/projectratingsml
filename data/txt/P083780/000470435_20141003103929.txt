F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project is to improve the delivery of urban services through enhancing the quality
of urban infrastructure and strengthening the institutional and financial framework. The proposed
repeater project would build on and consolidate the achievements of TNUDP II, continuing to improve
urban infrastructure services in Tamil Nadu in a sustainable manner. The two main objectives are:




                                                    ii
  to strengthen and deepen the empowerment of ULBs by continuing the decentralization process
through delegation of powers from state level bodies to ULBs; and through continuing and expanding
the capacity building programs started under TNUDP II; and

  to mobilize resources on a sustainable basis for urban infrastructure investments through:
  - mobilizing private financing for ULB infrastructure investments by linking ULBs to the financial
markets through the intermediation of the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF);
  - providing incentives for investments in low income neighborhoods through the use of supporting
capital grants.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At appraisal in 2005, with nearly 300 million urban residents, India’s cities contributed over 60% of
GDP and accounted for more than 90% of government revenues. Their efficiency had a significant
and direct bearing on the country’s overall economy. Yet, few cities were able to provide the kind of
urban services required on a regular and sustainable basis. In addition, even fewer adequately
collected tariffs for the services provided or had credible financing systems that would allow them to
access India’s emerging financial markets. India’s cities could contribute more effectively to the
country’s economic growth and poverty reduction, if they did not suffer from severe infrastructure
bottlenecks, service deficiencies, weak finances, and poor local governance.

The Tenth Five Year Plan that was in vogue at appraisal estimated urban investment needs to be about
US$7 billion for the Plan period (2002-2007) of which only about a third was available through
budgetary resources. Growing concern about the ability of cities to provide the level of urban services
commensurate with their contribution to economic activity had led to significant changes in India’s
urban development policies, through complementary strategies of decentralization and financial sector
reform. The 74th Constitutional Amendment aimed to decentralize what had been highly centralized
and regulated policies which had directed investments away from cities, particularly away from long
term urban infrastructure investments. Financial sector reforms, begun in 1991, allowed for urban
local bodies (ULBs) to raise financial resources to meet their infrastructure needs independently of
state loans or grants. Together, these policies aimed to empower ULBs through greater self-
sufficiency. Part of these reform efforts and new approaches aimed at tapping additional private
resources for traditionally public investments.

Despite reforms at the central level, urban development had remained very much a state issue. The
resources provided to cities as well as the regulations governing their management had continued to be
decided largely at the state level. State governments continued to take decisions on such matters as
rates of user charges, property tax, octroi and the role of parastatals in water supply and sanitation
services with little reference to the ULBs that were affected by these decisions. Few ULBs had the
wherewithal to be demand-responsive or to access India’s emerging financial system. Despite major
reforms since 1992 and a high degree of liberalization, the financial sector was not yet able to meet the
resource needs of ULBs because of sector policies and ULBs’s institutional constraints. The result
was that urban institutions were not yet integrated into the fabric of the broader deregulation and
financial reforms of the Indian economy.

Project Background. The Bank has had a long engagement with the Government of Tamil Nadu
(GoTN) in the urban sector, starting from Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (TNUDP)
TNUDP-I. The "Municipal Development Fund" (MDF) type urban projects in Tamil Nadu (TN) that
began with the setting up of the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) started under
TNUDP-II in late 1990s. The Second Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (TNUDP II) made a
strong impact on urban reform and strengthening of ULB capacity and was rated as ‘Satisfactory’ by
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). The Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) as
established under TNUDP II had been successful in bringing ULBs to the market and exposing them
to sustainable borrowing practices. The Third Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (TNUDP-III)
sought to take forward and scale up the achievements of the TNUDP-II in terms of enhancing ULB
capacity, improving urban service delivery in a sustainable manner and expanding financial resource
mobilization beyond government budgetary sources. While TNUDP-II largely included city roads and
some water supply improvements, TNUDP-III was scaled up in terms of size as well as scope of new
urban sector interventions (such as sewerage services in ULBs that hitherto did not have them). In


                                                   1
addition, capacity building mainly involved enhancing capacity of newly formed ULBs and bringing
them on par with other ULBs that were supported under the TNUDP-II.

Rationale based on defined country/sector issues and alternatives considered: The project was
consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Executive Directors
on August 26, 2004. To achieve its primary goal of poverty reduction, the CAS aimed to foster the
decentralization process, support effective governance and promote private sector-led growth. TNUDP
III would directly contribute to these CAS objectives by extending the benefits of privately mobilized
financial resources to the financing of urban infrastructure investments of newly empowered ULBs
and by strengthening the financial and administrative capacity of ULBs to plan, finance and deliver
services in a fiscally sustainable manner. It was fully consistent with the CAS focus on working with
interested states “through both its governance dialogue and its sectoral projects in three priority areas:
(i)clarifying the roles and functions of the three levels of local governments; (ii)promoting financial
devolution and improving local taxation and cost recovery; and (iii)improving accountability to local
constituents.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) (as in Legal Agreements) and Key Indicators

The objective of the project was to improve urban infrastructure services in Tamil Nadu in a
sustainable manner through: (a) strengthening the managerial, financial and technical capabilities of
ULBs; (b) mobilizing resources and securing sustainable funding sources for urban infrastructure by
TNUDF; and (iii) providing incentives for investments in low-income neighborhoods through the use
of capital grants.

Key indicators were:
   • enhanced financial soundness of ULBs, as indicated by improvement in own source revenues
       of participating ULBs and better debt management
   • improved urban governance and accountability in ULBs, through reforms undertaken such as
       accounting and financial management reforms and e-governance
   • improved cost recovery with regard to urban services and improvements in urban services
       delivery coverage
   • reduction in travel time on key transport project corridors, and reduction in fatal accidents in
       Chennai
   • improved long- term sustainability of TNUDF through market orientation, diversification of
       its resource base and products and implementation of a business and risk management strategy

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The objective was not revised. However the results framework was refined at Mid-term Review
(MTR).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

    The expected beneficiaries of the project included:
    • ULBs and related urban and municipal sector organizations whose management capacity
       would be enhanced;
    • People living in low-income neighborhoods;
    • Chennai residents who will benefit from reduced travel time on key transport project corridors
       and they would also benefit from safer traffic measures achieved under the project;
    • Residents in participating cities / Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) who will benefit in terms of
       improved water supply and better sanitation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project consisted of two components as follows: (i) Institutional Development Component that
provided support for management improvements and institutional changes, including provision of
goods, technical assistance, workshops, and staff training to support the implementation and
sustainability of urban policy reforms, organizational performance, and urban services delivery; (ii)
Urban Investment Component aimed at developing sustainable urban investments such as water
supply, waste water collection, solid waste management, storm water drains, roads and common
facilities such as transportation networks, and sanitation facilities, based on demand-driven investment
plans developed by ULBs, besides urban transport interventions in Greater Chennai. The overall
allocation was as follows:

1.6 Revised Components

The main components were not revised, however one of the sub-components was restructured as noted
below.

1.7 Other significant changes
The project involved the following changes (restructuring):

First restructuring: August 2009. Restructuring of Chennai Urban Transport Sub-component with the
primary objective of addressing the issues arising out of the poorly performing Chennai urban
transport sub-component. Out of the 21 urban transport sub-projects that were proposed during the
initial phase of TNUDP-III implementation, during mid-term review it was assessed that only five
road sub-projects were adequately prepared and feasible for implementation during the balance period
of the project, Hence only those five road sub-projects were retained for Bank financing under
TNUDP-III as part of this restructuring and balance amounts reallocated, besides a few other changes.

Second restructuring (Loan Extension): January 2012. A level 2 restructuring was done in January
2012 to extend the closing date by two years from March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2014. The extension
was to enable GOTN/ULBs to complete about 29 on-going (mainly sewerage) sub-projects and time
for some of the innovative approaches to be demonstrated, including new contractual structures for
Sewerage Treatment Plants (STPs), new sewerage tariffs, capital contributions from beneficiaries and
market based financing by TNUDF.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Quality at Entry. There was no formal Quality at Entry Review by the Bank Group. The project was
designed and appraised in a facilitating environment and as follow-on to the previous engagement (the
Second Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project, TNUDP-II) and the basic design was straight
forward and well structured. However it was much more ambitious in scope and scale, with loan size
increasing from US$105 million for the previous project to US$300 million for TNUDP-III. As part
of project preparation, sector background was studied and the main sector issues were analyzed in
depth. The project design took into account the sector issues as well as government strategies. A
comprehensive review of the existing environmental framework was undertaken to identify the
gaps/concerns/inadequacies and opportunities for enhancing the effectiveness of the framework. The
project design supported the long term sustainability of the financial intermediary, TNUDF, by
underscoring market orientation, flexibility and range of financing instruments, the articulation of a
long term strategy including a long term business plan and risk management strategy that was to be
developed during implementation.

The Chennai Urban Transport sub-component was affected by land acquisition issues that emerged
during the initial stages of project implementation. These land acquisition issues could not have been
anticipated fully at entry, especially given the ‘framework’, demand driven nature of this project. As a
result, the scope of this sub-component was significantly reduced (from US$147.5 million to US$34
million) through restructuring of the project in August 2009 as noted earlier. The project’s quality at
entry is therefore rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects / Risks Management. The project design had
taken into account many of the risks encountered in TNUDP-II, including: (i) the need for continuing
focus on ULB capacity building and reforms; (ii) the need to ensure sufficient pipeline of sub-projects;
and (iii) better operational financial / operational flexibility and a level playing field for TNUDF.
Accordingly the following risks were identified in the PAD:

However, there were two new risks that were not identified at appraisal due to this being a ‘framework’
project and proved to be critical during implementation of TNUDP-III and were the main reasons for
the loan extension: (i) land acquisition for urban sub-projects; and (ii) complexity involved in
procurement and implementation of sewerage sub-projects.

Adequacy of government commitment. Both GOI and GOTN had demonstrated strong commitment
to urban sector reforms and to continuing the Bank’s assistance in this area, which would help ensure
project sustainability. Considerable progress had been made towards implementing the state level
policy reforms stipulated under GOI’s national urban program, viz. the Jawaharlal Nehru National
Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) in Tamil Nadu, particularly the following: (i) reduction in stamp
duty on transfer of property from 15 percent to 8 percent and further agreement to reduce the stamp
duty to 5 percent by 2007; (ii) implementation of accrual accounting system in all 107 urban local
bodies; (iii) introduction of modified area based property tax system; (iv) computerization of sub-
registrar’s offices; (v) repeal of the Land Ceiling Act, while a reformed Rent Control Act was being
considered; (vi) commitment to levy user charges, and improvement in rate setting and collection
levels for water and sanitation services. Tamil Nadu was one of the leading states in undertaking
urban reforms.

2.2 Implementation

The project was initially planned for about five and half year implementation period, which was
extended by three more years subsequently. This was to allow for completion of mainly sewerage
subprojects taken up by GOTN under the project (49% of project cost across 24 ULBs, over 1800 km
of sewer lines laid and 271 MLD of treatment capacity built) -- the scale of which was unprecedented
in India; and to allow for completion of Chennai Urban Transport component, which was restructured
during MTR and began substantive implementation only after that.

TNUDP-III has significantly transitioned from TNUDP-II in a number of ways as listed below,
deepening the Bank's urban engagement in the state:

  a. increased complexity of sub-projects, i.e., sewerage and water supply formed significant part of
     portfolio (74%) compared to Roads, Bridges and Bus-stands, which thus posed significant
     implementation challenges;
  b. major thrust under the project was to let some capable ULBs manage planning and
     implementation of sub-projects (which otherwise would be supported by state agencies such as
     TWAD and CMWSSB), whose capacities got built by doing;
  c. the project promoted improved institutional co-ordination, by centralizing the role of CMA in
     institutional capacity building and urban sub-project management, along with TNUIFSL,
     TWAD and CMWSSB. This took time to set-in.

Chennai Urban Transport Sub-Component/MTR. Chennai Urban Transport sub-component
experienced serious delays in implementation primarily for two reasons: (i) Two new departments of
GOTN were introduced that added a layer of institutional complexity.; (ii) This sub-component
involved substantial land acquisition and resettlement and the impact/costs involved became apparent
only after the Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) were prepared later during implementation and not
known at the time of approval. Hence at MTR, TNUDP-III was rated as a ‘problem’ project and this
sub-component was significantly scaled down through a restructuring as noted earlier and retaining


                                                  6
only US$37 million out of the US$140 million allocated for this sub-component under the Loan and
re-allocating the rest to the ULB investment component.
Complexity involved in sewerage sub-projects/land acquisition issues. The sewerage sub-projects
taken up under TNUDP-III posed a range of challenges along the entire project cycle starting with
procurement, land availability and implementation. There was a lack of adequate competition to bid
invitations initially with a number of them attracting only 1-2 bids. Reasons for inadequate
competition included mismatch between availability and demand of qualified contractors; inadequate
costing; and the need to look at the post qualification criteria. Land acquisition was another key issue
affecting implementation of contracts. There were changes in sites for sewerage schemes (for
pumping stations/STPs) as well as delays in obtaining the land that often involved other departments
of GOTN and involved lengthy process of land acquisition and approvals. Further, during
implementation too, sewerage sub-projects faced delays due to: (a) difficulty in excavation in hard
rock areas; (b) high rainfall and high water table in coastal areas; (c) narrow streets and densely
populated areas; (d) inadequate mobilization by the contractors to complete the work on time; and (e)
delays in obtaining regulatory clearances such as from National Highways Department (some of which
took over an year to be granted), railways etc.

Eventually during the course of project implementation, these issues were resolved through improved
institutional coordination between Implementing Agencies, enhanced monitoring by CMA/TNUIFSL,
building capacity of IAs and ULBs through various trainings and workshops, provision of operational
and technical guidelines etc. On its part, the Bank team contributed through their regular field visits
and observations, providing recommendations on critical government decisions, helping with various
checklists, guidelines on technical, institutional and operational issues, and participation in workshops.
With enhanced rigor in surveys/assessments including in preparation, and through planning ahead to
face constraints imposed by externalities such as elections, some of these challenges could have been
better mitigated. The Bank team and GOTN agencies jointly developed a new Design-Build-Operate-
Transfer (DBOT) bid document for Sewerage Treatment Plants (STPs) that proved successful in
attracting qualified bidders and completing procurement. Overall, in retrospect, the original
implementation period of five years envisaged for the project seems insufficient for the nature of
complex subprojects that the project has handled. On the other hand, project benefited from continuity
of the Bank task team, in terms of consistency, depth and follow-up in the dialogue with the
government and providing expertise to help the government analyze issues and implement actions as
they emerged during supervision.

On the Institutional Development Component, implementation was satisfactory, with many activities
such as training of stakeholders, studies (e.g., City Development Plans, GIS mapping, development of
manuals etc) progressing reasonably well in time. This component has brought 49 newly created
Grade-III ULBs on par with others through computerization of their municipal functions and
improving e-governance. This was possible through a pivotal role played by CMA.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. Since this was a ‘framework’ project and all activities/sub-projects were not identified
upfront, there was a particular complexity for M&E in terms of the difficulty in anticipating targets
and identifying specific indicators in the Results Framework. Hence the PAD laid a broad framework
for results and types indicators that would get tracked depending on the type of participating sub-
projects. Accordingly targets for these indicators were to be determined only during implementation.
Further, TNUDF being a continuing institution had adequate methods for collecting and collating data,
especially financial data (such as ULB loan repayment rates), as part of its sub-loan/sub-grant
agreements with ULBs.

M&E implementation. At MTR, the Bank team along with GOTN counterpart agencies put in place
a more elaborate and specific results framework with targets (used in this ICRR). In addition, TNUDF

                                                    7
regularly collected the following data to support implementation monitoring: (i) contract management
and sub-project completion; (ii) procurement; (iii) status of Environment and Social safeguards
implementation; and (iv) financial data and reporting, including quarterly Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMRs) and repayment of loans by the ULBs etc. and the actual figures were compared with
the target values. As service level indicators were to be monitored at the ULB levels, these indicators
were not monitored very closely at the TNUDF level, but more by the office of Commissioner of
Municipal Administration (CMA).

M&E utilization. Appropriate data collected from TNUDF’s bi-monthly reports was evaluated and
used for decision-making on certain activities, such as implementation of contracts, ULBs’ debt
servicing, procurement, and disbursements, by GOTN and CMA for their periodic internal reviews
and oversight. In addition, this M&E information was also used by the Bank team for supervision and
internal reporting as part of ISRs, etc.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Since the project consisted of several sub-projects, an Environment and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) was put in place by appraisal laying out the process and protocols to be followed
to mitigate the impacts related to environment and social impacts associated with the sub-projects.
This was disclosed and also formally approved through Government Order (GO) by GOTN.

Social Safeguards (including Land Acquisition issues): Under the Chennai Urban Transport sub-
component, the number of land owners affected was 212 title and 337 non- title holders including
resettlement of five displaced families. The cost of private land acquisition and resettlement and
rehabilitation assistance incurred was INR132.32 million (US$2.20 Million), which is 8.5 % of total
cost of this sub-component. In the case of Urban Investment Component, a total of 110 sub-projects
were implemented, of which private land acquisition was involved only in the case of seven sub-
projects and resettlement in one sub-project. In all, only 21 hectares of private land from 31 land
owners were acquired. In addition, about 45 hectares of government land was transferred including 23
acres of temple land. The R&R was involved in one town, i.e. Salem, where 65 squatter families were
resettled at multi-storied apartments. The total compensation and R&R assistance paid was INR30
million, which is 0.73% of all these eight sub-projects.

While the land acquisition and resettlement implementation was largely implemented in a satisfactory
manner, there were some instances of delays in payment of compensation and R&R assistance that
were later addressed through follow-up by the Bank team/TNUDF. At the time of loan closure, all
compensation and assistance have been paid to all affected people except the issue of titles to allotted
houses of 65 squatter families shifted to an apartment in Salem, which as per existing proviso of
GOTN laws/rules of issuing titles, would happen in December 2014 at the end of five year stay in the
new house. During project implementation, two Environment and Social Audits were carried out to
confirm implementation of safeguards as satisfactory. One of the issues encountered during
implementation was the availability of land for urban sub-projects - about 16 sites/locations were
changed (from out of over 40 sites that were required). There were many reasons for the same,
including some that were beyond the scope of the project, and included objections from nearby
residents, court cases (due to land titles not being clear in India in general), delays in land alienation
involving other departments of GOTN and failure of private land acquisition negotiations (linked to
general risk averse atmosphere within governments in India over the last few years due to fear of CAG
audits, etc.). Eventually all site-related issues were successfully addressed under TNUDP-III and there
is no pending site availability case that remains unresolved. The key social development outcome of
the project is that, it facilitated the inclusion of 400 non-title holders for R&R assistance who
otherwise would have been left out.



                                                    8
Environmental Safeguards: The sub-projects largely addressed environmental safeguards as per the
ESMF. The main environment impact that needed to be addressed related to over 30 sewerage/water
treatment plants that were taken up for implementation at ULBs. In all these cases, Environment
Impact Assessments (EIAs) were carried out as per ESMF and all regulatory clearances were obtained
from Tamil Nadu State Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) albeit with delays in some instances.
Managing construction worksites in dense urban areas was a challenge in certain cases in terms of
interactions with public, managing traffic diversions, barricading, disposal of debris, etc. and there
were also some instances of inadequacies in regular monitoring and reporting of EMP implementation
status by the respective agencies/ULBs. However it should also be noted that many of the sewerage
interventions would result in positive environmental impacts in terms of reduction in pollution of
water bodies and water reuse.

Institutional: TNUDF, which played an intermediary role in appraisal and monitoring of safeguards
impacts, has performed well in following-up safeguard implementation with local bodies concerned
and provided strong support to Highway department in successfully mitigating safeguard impacts.
Throughout the implementation, TNUDF maintained the safeguard positions and these safeguard
specialists brought out issues to the attention of ULBs and closely followed the implementation issues.
Through this process, TNUDF has also developed capacity for safeguard management.

Overall, safeguards compliance is rated as Satisfactory.

Fiduciary Compliance. The project complied with fiduciary covenants during implementation.
Internal control arrangements were in place, and adequate financial management system, procurement,
and disbursements were maintained.

Financial Management: Although the line departments maintained appropriate accounting records as
per the government prescribed norms, there were initial delays in financial reporting and submission
of SOE claims to the office of TNUDF. These were mainly due to ineffective coordination between
line departments and lack of understanding on the Bank’s reporting procedures. TNUDF had later
developed standard financial reporting formats and the issues were adequately addressed. Satisfactory
audit reports were received during all years of implementation.

Procurement: While TNUDF had adequate capacity to oversee procurement compliance, many of the
newly participating ULBs and government departments involved were less familiar with the Bank’s
procurement guidelines in the initial years of implementation and it was quite challenging to ensure
procedural compliance, collecting the list of contracts (for the purpose of post review), procurement
plan preparation, and revisions from other implementing agencies. There was also reluctance to
follow agreed procurement procedures, particularly where these were in conflict with GOTN’s
Transparency in Tenders Act, which resulted in delays in some instances. These were subsequently
addressed through training and capacity building. There was also one instance where procedural non-
compliance resulted in declaration of mis-procurement by the Bank.

The project implementation also faced challenges in the procurement of sewerage contracts due to a
combination of factors - the schedule of rates (which they were mandated to use) was not always
reflective of market prices in case of sewerage contracts, lack of adequate sewerage contractors in
India, etc. This resulted in high price bids, low participation by bidders, re-bidding, etc. leading to
delays, which was one of the main reasons for Loan extension. The Bank team worked closely with
counterpart agencies/ULBs in resolving these issues through a variety of measures, including revision
of costing practices, holding bidders’ conferences, incorporating suitable price adjustment formula in
bid documents, etc. All these issues were later addressed and the project was able to successfully bid
out all (over 50) sewerage contracts eventually.

Overall, fiduciary compliance was Satisfactory.

                                                   9
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(a) Transition arrangements. The transition arrangements for continuing the future operation appear to
be adequate, as demonstrated by the measures adopted by GOTN. In addition, the follow-on project,
Tamil Nadu Sustainable Urban Development Program (TNSUDP), which is currently under preparation
will also ensure the project's future sustainability.

•   Institutional (TNUDF):
    • TNUDF has grown as a strong financial institution which has supported over US$1.5 billion
        in urban investments in Tamil Nadu, combining public and private funds, as well as other
        donors including Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and JPY 9.824 billion from Japan
        International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
    • TNUDF continues to be a viable institution that has been consistently generating profits over
        the last decade and maintains adequate staff and governed by a Board of Directors.

•   Institutional (ULBs / Operating agencies):
    • From an institutional / O&M perspective, all sub-projects are already housed within ULBs.
    • As regards outputs from STPs, in addition to regular check-ups by the ULBs, local laws
        require regulatory compliance with regard to environmental laws that are monitored by
        TNPCB and other regulatory agencies on a periodic basis.
    • The roads completed under the Chennai Urban Transport sub-component have been handed
        over to the Highways Construction and Maintenance wing for future maintenance.
    • Sewerage O&M: After five years of operation and maintenance by the DBOT contractors, the
        projects will be handed over to the ULBs. In turn, ULBs could outsource the O&M through
        PPP contracts. Standard bid documents and contracts for O&M of sewerage systems have
        already been developed by the GOTN.

•   Financial:
    • TNUIFSL, the fund manager of TNUDF, would be overseeing and monitoring timely
       repayments of the loans and ensure that debt service from ULBs is maintained at 100%.
    • Participating ULBs are levying user charges for water supply and sewerage to meet 100%
       O&M cost recovery and debt service. A graded user charges framework has been practiced
       for underground sewerage sub-projects considering the equality and has greater acceptance
       among the general public. User charges would be revised periodically as and when needed.

•   Budget: GOTN has committed to finance completion of the balance work under the (few) ongoing
    sub-projects post closure of TNUDP III. In any event, TNUDF is an on-going institution with
    multiple sources of financing beyond the Bank and these too can be accessed by the ULBs.

(b) Follow-on project. The follow-on project TNSUDP would build on the on-going Bank
engagement with Tamil Nadu in the urban sector, in particular on TNUDP-III. It will step-up the level
of engagement by enhancing the local urban management and governance as well as further refining
the line of credit support to ULBs. Innovations envisaged under the project include: piloting a Model
Towns Concept; supporting credit enhancement; and supporting reforms in urban finance and in sector
policies. In addition, there will be a greater focus on the sustainability of urban environment under the
ULB infrastructure investment sub-component. TNSUDP is scheduled to be effective in April / May
2015.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


                                                   10
Relevance of Objective: The objective is still relevant and appropriate to the needs of Tamil Nadu’s
urban development because of deepening, on-going urbanization in the state. Among the larger Indian
states, Tamil Nadu (TN) ranks 1st on urbanization rates and has the second largest state economy in
India. As per Census 2011, TN is about 48.5% urbanized with about 35 million people residing in
urban areas and accounting for 9.6% of India’s urban population. In terms of absolute numbers of
population living in urban areas the urban growth rates have outpaced rural growth rates - the urban
population growth in the state was 27% during 2001 to 2011 as compared to rural growth of 6%
during the same period. Given the levels of urbanization, urban development remains of critical
importance to the Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) and this is clearly spelt out even in their latest
(12th) Plan Document and the TN Vision 2023 document.

It is also timely and appropriate to the needs of India’s urban sector. While the current level of
urbanization in India is around 31% (377 million persons) as 2011 census, it is projected to increase to
50% or more over the next 20 years. For the first time since independence, India has seen a greater
absolute increase in urban population versus rural and the number of towns in India has increased from
5,161 in 2001 to 7,935 in 2011, with about 53 cities having over 1 million population. The objective is
consistent with the Bank's latest India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2013-2017, directly
relevant to the development goals set out under Engagement Area Two on Spatial Transformation that
seeks to leverage the rural-urban transformation as an opportunity to reduce poverty and increase
competitiveness. The objective is also fully consistent with the urban sector priorities as outlined in
the 12th Plan of Government of India that includes: (i) Increasing investment in urban infrastructure;
(ii) Strengthening urban governance, institutional capacity, improve long-term urban planning for
sustainable and inclusive urban development; (iii) Raising environment sustainability; and (iv)
Improving financial sustainability of ULBs.

Relevance of design and implementation: The core design of the project and implementation
arrangements remain relevant. As discussed in Section 3.2, the project activities have contributed to
many achievements in the Tamil Nadu urban development sector. On the other hand, as indicated in
Section 2.1, the project design had a major shortcoming because of including the Chennai Urban
Transport sub-component at a later stage of project preparation cycle and hence not being fully
prepared at the time of Board approval. Consequently, the project had to be restructured to drop 16
road sub-projects and retain only five sub-projects.

Although there were some factors which affected implementation as mentioned in Section 2.2, the
overall implementation arrangements of TNUDP III had turned out to be effective for achieving the
project objective.

Rating: Considering these factors, the relevance of objective, design, and implementation is rated as
Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives / Efficacy

Substantial. The project was successful in achieving its Project Development Objectives (PDOs) as
can be noted from the status of Results Framework presented in Section F of the Data Sheet. At ICR,
over 82% (against a target of 80%) of 55 participating ULBs had commissioned their respective sub-
projects and reported delivery of improved urban services (covering water, sewerage, city roads, etc.)
to their city residents. This includes over 2.3 million people at these ULBs who have directly benefited
from improved water and sewerage services. TNUDP-III has supported construction (and
commissioning) of new sewerage systems in about 17 ULBs that hitherto did not have them and has
added over 299,000 new sewerage connections. TNUDF has remained a viable institution evidenced
by the 100% sub-loan repayment from ULBs achieved during each year of implementation of
TNUDP-III (against a target of atleast 95%) besides helping raise over US$52 million in non-
budgetary sources for urban infrastructure. The capacity building initiatives have successfully

    The balance 3.5 km out of the total target of 36.05 km was also partially upgraded (in terms of the right-hand side carriage
  way that is now open to traffic), but the left-hand side carriage had to be temporarily suspended to accommodate a macro
  drain to be constructed under the carriage way under a separate program to ease flooding in Chennai. This drain construction
  is now almost complete and the left-hand side carriage will also be upgraded by GoTN out of own funds.

                          Progressive empowerment of ULBs:                (a) GOTN delegated higher
                           administrative powers up to INR4 million to the City Council, up to INR5
                           million to Regional Director of Municipal Administration and up to INR50
                           million to CMA, up from earlier powers that were one fifth of these limits; (b)
                           GOTN continued its formula based devolution of taxes to ULBs that provided
                           a buoyant source of revenues and underpinned sustainable borrowing by
                           ULBs under TNUDP-III for investment sub-projects (the devolution income
                           to ULBs has more than doubled from INR8880 million in 2008-09 to
                           INR21320 million in 2012-13); (c) In July 2013, policy decisions were
                           approved by GOTN for the creation of an accounting cadre at ULBs, as well
                           as new accounting and budgeting rules/manuals for ULBs;
                          Traffic enforcement and management system introduced under Chennai urban

                           documenting and enforcement in cases of traffic violations, thereby reducing
                           the fatal accidents in Chennai area from 1449 in 2012 to 1271 in 2013, one of
                           the indicators for this sub-component mentioned in the PAD;
                          Comprehensive Traffic and Transportation Study for Chennai carried out that
                           was formally adopted and resulted in identification of a shelf of projects

investments by             contribution from direct project beneficiaries was scale-up of pioneering
TNUDF”.                    initiative started under the earlier (TNUDP-II) project;
                          TNUDF, as an urban development / municipal fund intermediary, has
                           continued to play an important role in establishing principles of financial
                           discipline for investment sub-projects undertaken by ULBs as well as
                           maintain financial sustainability of itself as an institution - evidenced by the
                           100% loan repayment from ULBs achieved during implementation of
                           TNUDP-III over which period its balance-sheet also grew in terms of loan
                           assets by 4.5 times.

  3.3 Efficiency

  Since this was a ‘framework’ project, the project at appraisal provided for a framework for economic
  analyses. Economic analyses was carried out at ICR using this framework and based on final costs
  and extent of benefits achieved. This analysis also took into account the delays caused and consequent
  cost and time impacts of the 3 year loan extension. The ERR for TNUDP-III was computed based on
                                                    13
evaluation of cost-benefit streams of sub-projects implemented under the Urban Investment
Component and was found to be higher than the threshold value of 12%. Water supply projects
exhibited the highest ERR followed by Bus terminals. ERR for sewerage sub-projects were slightly
dampened by longer time frames for completion. Cities with multiple projects secured higher ERRs
because of compounded benefits achieved. Lastly, it may be mentioned that the actual economic
benefits are estimated to be higher than the overall ERR of 19% since it does not fully account for
some of longer term environment benefits of sewerage (such as reduction in pollution of water bodies,
water reuse that has already started happening in some ULBs, etc.), reduction in fatal accidents in
Chennai and benefits to pedestrians in Chennai due to the ‘Foot-Over-Bridges’.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Relevance. As explained in Section 3.1, the objective is consistent with the Bank’s latest CPS in
terms of contributing to development goals related to urbanization and spatial transformation.
Likewise, the project design has contributed to many achievements in the Tamil Nadu urban
development sector. Further, implementation arrangements were efficient and effective for achieving
the project objectives. Based on these factors, the relevance of objective, design, and implementation
is rated as Substantial.

Achievement of PDOs / Efficacy. As explained in Section 3.2 and noted from the Results Framework
(RF), the project has met its Project Development Objectives (PDOs). It either exceeded or met all of
the PDO indicators, except one with regard to reduction in travel times for Chennai urban transport
sub-component. This (restructured) sub-component however accounts for less than 10% of overall
project cost and in addition, was able to result in reduction in fatal accidents in Chennai, not captured
by the results table but mentioned in the PAD. Based on these factors, the achievement of the PDO is
rated as Substantial.

Efficiency. As noted in Section 3.3 and Annex 3, despite the loan extension, the economic benefits
clearly outweigh the costs and the impact of delays. There were operational and administrative
efficiencies which came as a result of design choices and the actual implementation approaches
brought under the project to overcome the various challenges. The project’s efficiency is rated as
Substantial.


                                                   14
Based on the above factors and the discussion in sections 3.1–3.3, the overall achievement of
outcomes is rated as Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts/Gender Aspects. The project design did not include any direct income generating or
gender related interventions. The capital grants that were provided to ULBs were mainly linked to
environmental externalities (such as for water/sewerage) or improved urban services to low income
neighborhoods. The ULBs have put in place a subsidized connection regime for such households for
availing water/sewerage connections. As noted earlier, an estimated 440,000 households in low
income neighborhoods have benefited from such improved urban services. Where new connections
have been provided, some of this would have positive impacts for women as well – such as in
alleviating the hardships of women in fetching water from distant places. Further, there have been
instances of providing for special facilities for community activities – such as in MKT road in Chennai,
where the project has created a separate platform for vendors to sell their merchandize. The road
improvements in Chennai and bus terminals sub-projects would also benefit the poor.

Institutional Change/Strengthening. The project resulted in a substantial institutional development
impact in the following areas: (i) Public financial management reforms: This included development
of: (i) an updated municipal accounts manual in line with the Model National Municipal Accounts
Manual; (ii) a new Municipal Budget Manual; (iii) audit manual for Local Fund Audit Dept (LFAD);
(iv) government approval for creation of municipal accounts cadre and service rules for the cadre; (v)
amendment of various Municipal Acts to provide for public disclosure of the budget and annual
financial statements; and (vi) decision to move to a centralized and integrated web based Financial
Accounting System (FAS) from the decentralized IT model. The project has also continued the
practice of hiring the services of Chartered Accounting firms to update/close the books of accounts of
ULB to ensure that the back-log in accounts and audit is not significant. (ii) Empowerment of ULBs:
All participating ULBs involved in implementing water and sewerage projects under TNUDP-III
(even where the projects were being implemented by parastatals namely, TWAD and CMWSSB) were
fully involved right from the early stages. Councils of all participating ULBs have adopted resolutions
incorporating introduction of beneficiary contribution and user charges to meet 100% O&M cost
recovery. Also, even when parastatals were hand-holding the ULBs for implementation, the financing
was routed through ULBs. The implementation arrangement facilitated a relatively higher level of
ownership of the sub-projects within both elected and administrative wings of the participating ULBs.

Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) / Innovations. Although the impact of PPPs under TNUDP-
III has been relatively modest, two initiatives to introduce PPPs hold potential for replication
and wider scale-up.
1. STP in Tuticorin through PPP: In Tuticorin, a 25 MLD Sewage Treatment Plant has been bid
   out on a PPP-BOT model, where the private operator will invest in the STP and maintain the same
   and will recover the investment costs by selling treated waste-water to industrial waste-water users
   in the vicinity. This sub-project holds potential for replication in other rapidly urbanising and
   industrial regions of Tamil Nadu and other parts of India.
2. Standard bid documents contracts for O&M of sewerage systems / DBOT for STPs: The
   DBOT model for STPs was successfully developed and tested under TNUDP-III. The CMA has
   developed standard bid documents and contracts for O&M of sewerage systems. Pallavaram
   Municipality has already introduced PPP in O&M of its sewerage system. Given the number of
   ULBs that are likely to implement sewerage systems in India, both these hold replication potential.
Long term environmental benefits. The large numbers of sewerage sub-projects are expected to
provide environmental benefits over the long term in different ways including reduction in pollution of
water bodies and conservation of water through water reuse. For example: (i) the Dindugal municipal
corporation is supplying treated sewage, free of cost, to local tanners who gave 60 acres for the STP;
                                                  15
(ii) in the Chinnamannur municipality, the treated water is being provided to farmers free for
agricultural usage; and (iii) at Nagapattinam, the municipality plans to sell treated sewage to private
firms.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Annexure 6 presents the summary of two surveys that were carried out at project closing: (i)
Beneficiary survey of resettled families / project affected people through external consultants, which
highlights the positive impacts in terms of higher incomes and better standard of life for a substantial
majority. (ii) Participating ULBs survey through an external consultant for outcomes assessment of
TNUDP-III and forms the basis for many of the service delivery related indicators presented in
Section 3.2.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is moderate. The likelihood of changes that would be detrimental to
ultimate achievement of project’s outcomes is moderate. As the most urbanized among the larger
states in India, urban sector issues remains a key policy priority and focus area for GOTN and has
sought to continue its partnership with the Bank through a follow-on project. TNUDF has remained a
viable institution with adequate staff and a loan recovery rate of 100%. TNUDF continues to expand
resource mobilization through non-budgetary sources and in addition, TNUDF has also accessed Euro
157 million from KfW and JPY 9.824 billion from JICA that largely adopts Bank framework.

Considering that the ULB participation was on a demand-driven basis, the ULBs retain local
ownership of the sub-projects and expected to operate and maintain them. Financial sustainability has
been enhanced through TNUDF’s appraisal process that also requires levy of user charges where
possible (backed by council resolutions to this effect). As regards institutional sustainability, all STPs
were on a Design Build Operate and Transfer (DBOT) basis with five year O&M built into the
contracts. After five years of operation and maintenance by the implementing agencies, the O&M is
outsourced to private players by PPP contracts. The CMA has developed standard bid documents and
contracts for O&M of sewerage systems. Pallavaram ULB has already introduced PPP in O&M of its
sewerage system. In addition, the office of CMA further supports institutional sustainability,
especially for sewerage, through maintaining an ‘equipment bank’ for O&M of sewerage projects.
However O&M of sewerage is a challenging area presenting risks and since this sub-sector accounts
for a significant part of TNUDP-III, the rating is moderate despite the measures outlined.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all
major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and institutional, including procurement
and financial management. A number of alternatives were considered for the project design. In
addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier projects in the urban sector were
considered and incorporated into the project design.

Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the technical
skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a good project design. The Bank provided adequate
                                                   16
resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure quality preparation and appraisal work.
The project was consistent with the CAS and government priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank
had a consistently good working relationship with the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.

On the other hand, considering the shortcoming in project preparation as mentioned in Section 2.1, the
Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was moderately
satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory. Specifically, the task
team took the following critical actions that helped achieve the development objectives: (i) The team
downgraded the Implementation Progress (IP) rating at MTR and restructured the project subsequently
in close partnership with GoTN to address the nonperforming sub-component – as result,
disbursements went up from US$104 million at MTR to US$290 at ICR; (ii) At MTR, the team also
put in place more elaborate Results Framework / indicators; (iii) The implementation also faced
considerable challenges in the procurement and implementation of sewerage projects – the team was
able to provide support to overcome these challenges eventually.

The Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources, and the project was adequately supervised
and closely monitored. The task team regularly prepared Aide-Memoires, alerted GOTN and TNUDF
about issues found during project execution and facilitated prompt corrective action. The
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms
of achievement of development objective and project implementation. Bank’s procurement and
financial management staff worked with TNUDF staff to explain the rules and procedures to be
applied during project implementation, with regard to procurement of goods and works, and selection
of consultants, accounts and audits, based on the Loan Agreement. The overall quality of procurement
documentation and processes remained satisfactory, and compliance with agreed procurement
schedules remained high after the first half of the project. The task team also monitored safeguard and
fiduciary compliances. The task team carried out a MTR in July 2008.

One important aspect of the Bank's performance and contribution was the continuity of the Task Team,
including the TTL and other key sector specialists, from project inception through completion. This
continuity ensured consistency, and facilitated dialogue with the government to resolve implement issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

With a Moderately Satisfactory rating for quality at entry and a Satisfactory rating for quality of
supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory in accordance with IEG’s
harmonized rating criteria.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

As mentioned in Section 2.1, the government had shown its commitment to the objectives of the
project at the time of project preparation. The government consistently maintained its commitment
throughout the implementation and a favorable policy stance. Appropriate levels of review and
                                                   17
approval were usually in place both within TNUDF as well as GoTN; financial accountability and
follow-up was observed, and expenditures were duly authorized before they were incurred; and
documentation was maintained properly for periodic review. The project did not suffer from any
counterpart funding problems, as the GOTN took timely corrective measures and made appropriate
budget provisions and also ensured that TNUDF was adequately staffed throughout project
implementation.

The government officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, and
cooperated fully with the task team – for instance in completing the restructuring and addressing
sewerage related issues. Further all legal covenants under TNUDP-III were complied with.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

TNUDF/CMA were very effective in carrying out all aspects of project management, such as financial
management, procurement arrangements, reporting activities, and disbursements:

Financial Management: The project had decentralized FM arrangements due to its complex project
design and involvement of multiple line departments. The Urban Infrastructure component, which
was implemented by ULBs, Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sanitation Board (CMWSSB) and
Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage (TWAD), had performed well due to an effective oversight,
coordination and control by TNUDF. The project was regular in the submission of SOE claims and
quarterly FMRs to the Bank. The actual utilization against tranche releases were monitored separately
by TNUDF and was reported in the quarterly financial reports and validated through annual sub-
project audit reports. The transport component was implemented by CMDA through Chennai City
Traffic Police and Highways departments, and their performance was satisfactory with regard to
financial management.

Procurement Arrangements: Procurement was handled by multiple agencies, for example CMA,
CMDA, TNUDP, TWAD Board, Highways Department, Highways Research Station, Chennai Traffic
Police, Chennai Metro Water (CMWSSB), and ULBs, which was quite challenging. TNUDF
performed quite well in supervising the procurement handled by other implementing agencies under
line of credit sub-component as well as hiring consultants under PDAF.

Reporting Arrangements. TNUDF / CMA submitted all required quarterly and annual reports in a
timely manner. These reports were informative, and provided valuable feedback on how the TNUDP-
III was progressing covering all project activities. The status of performance indicators were
incorporated in all progress reports and served as valuable input to Bank supervision mission reports.

Other implementing agencies: However during the initial years of the project, there was delay in the
implementation of Chennai urban transport sub-component by the Highways Department and also
CMDA in being able to oversee and accelerate this sub-component and there could be have been more
proactive action in this regard. Consequently, the performance of these implementing agencies was
only moderately satisfactory, though the performance of this sub-component picked up after
restructuring.

On the other hand, considering that (i) the Chennai urban transport sub-component accounted for only
less than 10% of the overall project cost; and (ii) performance of TNUDF and CMA was more than
satisfactory, the overall performance of implementing agencies is rated as Satisfactory.




                                                 18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

With a Satisfactory rating for Government performance and a Satisfactory rating for overall
performance of implementing agencies, overall borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Design
• Preparatory work and risk mitigation in ‘framework’ projects. For complex components that
   are part of demand-driven, ‘framework’ type projects (such as the Chennai urban transport sub-
   component), specific measures may be needed to address associated risks – for instance in terms
   requiring higher proportion (e.g. 30%) of major investment components ready (i.e. ready for
   bidding or contract award), resolution of land acquisition issues to the extent possible, etc. Further,
   while changes to the original proposals are inevitable, implementation should adjust quickly to
   address risks / project performance.
• The concept of having a state level urban agency/Municipal Fund such as TNUDF, which
   would help in dealing with the challenges of urbanization, especially for smaller cities, is a
   good design concept. Through the series of Tamil Nadu Urban Development Projects, TNUDF
   has been able to provide both capacity building as well as financial support to ULBs while
   maintaining good repayment track record and focus on financial sustainability. However,
   evolution of such a fund is very much dependent on the process of decentralization (especially
   given the strong controls state governments exercise over ULBs in India) and overall support a
   fund like TNUDF receives from the state government and other sector agencies such as the CMA.
• Calibrating loan period to project complexity / project design. At appraisal, the project/loan
   period should be calibrated taking into account project complexity rather than it being
   standardized to around five years. In hindsight, a period of about 5-6 years was clearly an
   underestimate given the complexity of sewerage sub-projects, land acquisition related issues and
   ambitious scope that included both a metro city (Chennai) as well as large number of (smaller)
   participating ULBs. This is particularly relevant for a ‘framework’ type of project design that
   many urban development projects would tend to be, especially those ones designed for
   interventions in smaller / emerging cities. Hence, while a ‘framework’ type of project design
   would remain important for urban projects, calibrating the loan period would help in addressing
   the inherent risks arising during implementation.

Implementation
• Land acquisition/availability will remain a key risk factor for urban projects. Especially in a
   ‘framework’ project and given the context of dense urban settlements in India, this will remain a
   key risk factor for urban projects in India and often linked to factors beyond the control of the
   immediate project. In particular, there should be a mechanism for resolving the differences
   between the Bank policies and government policies on land acquisition and resettlement. Also, as
   the process for issuing clearance for land acquisition is time consuming and takes about 2-3 years.
   One approach that worked well in this context under the Chennai urban transport sub-component
   is adopting uniform negotiated price when there are different guideline values in the same village
   for compensation determination for private lands acquisition - this enhanced the acceptance of the
   compensation payments among the affected land owners.
 • Complex urban sub-sectors. Urban subprojects, especially sewerage, must take into account
   implementation challenges. As the project has demonstrated, sectors like sewerage face key
   challenges in terms of availability of qualified contractors, timely land availability, uncertain site
   conditions, capacity of ULBs to manage implementation etc. - factors which often lead to delays.
   Therefore their planning and implementation would need a focused approach on the part of both
   the Bank team as well as government counterparts, taking into account site conditions based on

                                                   19
   proper assessments, addressing them in designs, costing and making provisions in the bidding
   documents; assessment of contractors’ capacity and making provisions in the bidding documents,
   safeguards management and building capacity of ULBs.
 • Willingness to pay. Users pay when service is assured. The project has demonstrated that users
   have contributed for a portion of capital through their contribution, and they are ready to connect
   to the network and pay for O&M through tariffs; through sustained efforts on the part of
   implementing agencies.
 • Lessons for follow-on TNSUDP/other urban projects in India. All of the aforesaid are valuable
   lessons that can be taken into account while designing future urban projects. Thus, this project has
   offered a transition point for higher level of engagement in the state for Bank / other partners; and
   continues to have a demonstration effect for other states in the country.

Training: The training activities were organized by the office of the CMA for the ULB staff as well as
the elected representatives. The training programs included seminars, workshops, exposure visits etc.
and were run by experts from TNIUS, TWAD, CMWSSB, Anna University, NIWCRHT, etc. The
range of topics covered included water supply and sanitation, accounting & financial management,
operational excellence, quality control, legal aspects, and human resource management. Around 93
training programs were completed and 17,159 officials and staff and 10,122 elected representatives
were trained.

ICT initiatives: Activities undertaken under the ICT sub-component were the following:
    •   E-office system: E-file System comprised of a systematic and step-wise process of distribution
        of day-to-day correspondences, managing the inward/outward documents, movements of files
        followed by remarks and decision making by the senior officials – all through an online
        computing system. This electronic movement of important files leads to a faster decision
        making process.
    •   Standard websites and e-governance modules in 50 newly upgraded Urban Local Bodies:
        Web portal development and updating were done for CMA as well as 50 upgraded ULBs.
    •   Project Management: An MS Project-based project management system was implemented to
        monitor the progress and access project information executed by the department and the ULBs
        with respect to tracking status of capital projects executed in all ULBs.
    •   Procurement of hardware, software and networking (through ELCOT): As part of upgradation
        of the systems employed in the CMA, RDMA and ULB levels, computer hardware as well as
        server software and hardware were procured.
    •   Business Intelligence system: This web based application is utilized for understanding the
        revenue and cost trends across ULBs for each head which will help the CMA understand the
        specific interventions to be made in each ULB for greater efficiency.
    •   Dengue surveillance: This application would assist the surveyors collect information on
        house to house review for vector borne diseases (dengue and malaria) based on WHO
        guidelines and geographic mapping of the same.
    •   Water monitoring system: The Application would provide ULB level storage capacity, supply
        frequency and water usage data and provides data on water supply breakdown by source type.

Debt Monitoring Cell: DMC undertook the following tasks:
•   Database on Annual Accounts of all Municipalities and Corporations has been created for the
    years, 2001-02 to 2008-09.
•   Reconciliation of the outstanding balance of ULB loans with that of the financial institutions was
    completed till 31.03.2010. ULB-wise demand has been raised towards the Water Supply loan
    sanctioned by the Government from the year 1999 to 6/2011.
•   Guidelines have been prepared and communicated to ULBs in connection with reconciliation of
    ULBs. Set of key indicators has been compiled for assessment of new capital
    investments/borrowings.

Some of the notable initiatives under the PPF are summarised below:
    • Gasifier crematoriums: Innovative designs were developed for the construction of gasifier
        crematoriums and slaughter houses which were used to develop 67 gasifier crematoriums and
        115 slaughter houses. A newly constructed crematorium at Erode, Madurai, Trichy and
        Thoothukudi Corporations and a slaughter house in Dindigul municipality has been accorded
        ISO certification. 29 gasifier crematoriums and 25 slaughter houses are under construction.
    • Bus stands: Several bus stands have been constructed with support from the PPF
    • Water supply: 41 DPRs for water supply projects have been prepared, out of which 14 are
        nearing completion.
    • UGSS: 16 UGSS projects (6 by CMA and 10 by TWAD Board) have been prepared of which
        11 projects are under implementation under funding from TNUDP-III, KfW, UIDSSMT and
        IUDM. Another 60 DPRs are under preparation.
    • Regional clusters on PPP for Solid Waste Management (SWM): A Transaction Advisor was
        appointed under PPF for implementation of Solid Waste Management projects in 5
        Corporations and one Municipality in cluster basis. Work in Tirunelveli Corporation has
        been completed and implementation is underway.
    • Standard O&M contracts for UGSS: Standard bidding documents and contracts for O&M of
        sewerage systems which have already been instrumental in rolling out O&M contracts for
        select sewerage projects.

Geographical Information System (GIS)
Door to door surveys, mapping and data validation exercise for 12 ULBs – Erode, Vellore, Salem and
Tuticorin corporations and Krishnagiri, Pudukkotai, Sivagangai, Tambaram, Namakkal,
Udhagamandal, Dindgul and Virudhunagar Municipalities. The initiative is expected to bring more
unassessed/ under-assessed properties under property tax net and help increase ULB revenues.

Other activities undertaken by CMA
Additionally, several other studies were also conducted under project management component like:

       1. Creation of Municipal Cadre for effective implementation of infrastructure projects under
          JnNURM.
       2. Preparation of Integrated SWM Policy for Tamil Nadu
       3. Preparation of engineering manual for ULBs in consonance with other State Departments
       4. Development of urban performance indicators.
       5. Revival, Rehabilitation, and Management Strategy for Selected Water Bodies.
       6. City development plans for Grade III municipality
       7. Non-motorised transport study for providing broad level master plan for Coimbatore city.

Achievement of this component is Satisfactory.




                                                 23
Component 2: Urban Investment Component

ULB Investment sub-component
The Line of Credit sub-component covered investments in urban infrastructure projects that were
implemented under TNUDF, and managed by its fund manager, TNUIFSL. Salient features of sub-
projects implemented under the Line of Credit sub-component are discussed below:
•   Sectoral composition: In all, 110 sub-projects worth Rs. 2327 crore are being implemented in
    participating ULBs under the Urban Infrastructure sub-component. A critical feature is the focus
    on water supply and underground sewerage schemes, which accounted for 79 % of the outlay of
    sub-projects approved.
•   Share of remunerative projects: Sub-projects in water supply, sewerage and bus stands
    (amounting to 80% of outlay) have been structured with a remunerative element (where users
    finance part of the project cost and O&M expenditure through deposits and user charges/rents).
    Projects in roads, SWM and river improvement are non-remunerative in nature, and here the loans
    will be serviced from existing revenue sources of ULB.
•   Top participating ULBs: Under TNUDP-III, sub-projects have been implemented in 72 ULBs.
    The top three ULBs, Salem, Pallavaram and Theni, constitute 35% and Salem dominates the list
    with 6 projects, followed by Pallavaram with 3 projects.

Underground Sewerage
About 16 sewerage projects have been commissioned at closing.
Connections and served population: 290,000 sewerage connections have been added, enabling an
incremental access of sewerage services to 417,557. Eventually these sub-projects could potentially
add 449,465 sewerage connections, serving an estimated population of about 3,388,543, including
about 677,709 urban poor persons.

Water supply
About 17 water sub-projects have been commissioned at closing.
Some of the key aspects of the service delivery targeted under the scheme include:
Coverage:
    a. Connections and served population: As of March 2014, sub-projects are enabling
        incremental access of water supply services to 19,74,510 persons.
    b. Service access to urban poor: As of March 2014, TNUDP-III added water supply
        connections servicing about 423,000 urban poor persons.
    c. Per capita (LPCD) water supplied to ULB: The per capita supply has increased to an average
        of 115 LPCD compared to a baseline value of 63 LPCD, 8 ULBs were able to achieve the per
        capita supply norms as envisaged by MoUD (135 lpcd).
Frequency of water supply: All the ULBs where the sub-projects have been completed show a
significant improvement in the supply as water is now supplied everyday compared to an average of
once in 4 to 5 days.
Financial performance of the projects: All the ULBs with approved water supply projects have
resolved to introduce connection deposits (for financing part of the capital cost) and user charges to
achieve 100% O&M cost recovery.
Roads and street lights: Of the 24 sub-projects approved, 18 projects costing Rs. 186 crore, have been
completed as of March 2014 which accounts to 75% of the total road projects and 45% of the roads
outlay.
Length of Roads: In all, over 1500 km of roads were upgraded under TNUDP-III.

                                                  24
Bus Terminals: 7 bus terminal sub-projects have been completed
Bus bays and handling capacity: Over 208 bus bays have been modernised / added across bus
terminals in seven cities, with the total numbers of buses being handled at these terminals estimated at
4140 nos. per day.
Population served: The bus terminal projects undertaken serve an estimated 565,000 persons.

Solid waste management
32SWM sub-projects have been approved and implemented under Line of Credit sub-component
increasing the transportation capacity by 380 MT and improving the solid waste collection in
participating ULBs to over 95% from a baseline value of 87%.
Salem river improvement project
The project components included: (a) Improvements to Thirumanimuthar River for a stretch of 2800m
(b) Regularizing the cross section of the Vellakuttai Oodai and (c) construction of 3 Bridges near old
bus stand, gunpoint and oxford school. This sub-project is expected to potentially address flooding
problems in the vicinity and clean up the waste / silt accumulated along the banks.
CMDA Transportation sub-component
(a) Roads and foot-over bridge sub-projects
Under the roads investment, 5 road stretches covering 34.80 km have been upgraded under the CMDA
sub-component. From the savings in investment funds from these projects, foot-over bridges at 5
locations were completed. A service assessment undertaken by the Highway Research Station of
GoTN on all 5 completed projects validated a sharp improvement in service levels in terms of
improved road quality (smoothness), reduction in travel time and increase in travel speeds. Journey
times have declined by an average of 16% (reduction between 9.6% and 33%) while travel speeds
have gone up by an average of 33% (increase between 1% and 74%).
(b) Initiatives with the Chennai City Traffic Police
The traffic management and enforcement sub-component comprising procurement of tow-away vans,
vehicles with speed dome cameras, vehicles for emission analyser, radars guns with (out) cameras,
breath analysers, gas emission analysers, traffic signals, pelican signals, traffic signs, walkie-talkies,
computers and construction of a traffic education centre have been implemented the Chennai City
Traffic Police (CCTP).
An E-challan system introduced for traffic management in Chennai city proved to be so successful that
CCTP recovered the Rs. 2.83 crore (average of Rs. 70 lakh per month) spent on procuring and
commissioning the hand-held devices, in just four months. All the money raised through fines was
used to buy more of the devices, install traffic signal, temporary barricades and road markings. Till
February 2013, over Rs. 58 crore of fines have been collected by CCTP following this initiative.
Further, with the introduction of the system which has made registering and maintaining offence
registers easier, the average offences booked per day has increase from 3,500 to 12,000.
(c) Up-gradation and modernisation of Highway Research station:
Goods and equipment have been procured to improve the institutional capacity of the Highway
Research Station (HRS).

Achievement of this component is Satisfactory.

Overall approach
The Economic analysis has been done to compute Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value
(@ 12% discounting rate) individually for 63 sub-projects costing greater than US$500,000 and
covering 98% of the approved project cost under the Investment component. Sub-projects involving
less than the threshold value of US$500,000 (Rs.2.7 crore) have not been covered for computing the
Economic Rate of Return for TNUDP-III as a whole in view of two factors: (a) These projects
contribute to than 2% of Investment Component of TNUDP-III and therefore their economic impact
will have negligible contribution to the overall ERR of TNUDP-III and (b) The average size of these
projects is US$150,000 (Rs.84 lakh) at less than one-third the threshold size required for economic
analysis to be carried out is too small to meaningfully identify and attribute economic impact benefits.

Benefit and cost streams for Economic Analysis
Exhibit 1 summarises the parameters for arriving at the benefit streams used in the Economic Analysis
done as part of this report.
        • The Benefit streams, parameters for computation and sources / basis for computation of
            the benefit streams of sub-projects for various sectors / sub-projects are described below.
        • The capital cost streams were projected based on actual project cost and actual/ projected
            disbursements, as obtained from TNUIFSL.
        • An attribution factor is applied for some of the benefit streams to reflect that only a
            portion of the benefits are actually attributable to the project.

Factors for computing benefit streams
Reduction in fuel cost: It is the saving achieved from the reduction in fuel cost because of
improvement in road quality. The factors used in computation are
    a. Vehicle population (Nos.): Approximate number of vehicles in the city. The vehicle count is
       obtained through a household survey. For the cities not covered in the survey the value is
       extrapolated on the basis of the population.
    b. Average travel distance (km/day): Average distance travelled by a person in the city. The
       distance is assumed as 5 km for city with area less than 20 sq.km, 7m for 20 -100 sq. Km, 10
       km for 100- 150 sq.km and 12 km for area greater than 150 sq. km
    c. % of Road length upgraded: Ratio of newly constructed road length to total road length. It is
       used to get the count of vehicles in the new road. The information on the parameters is
       obtained from board notes and Census 2011 data.
    d. Fuel cost savings (Rs. per km): A reduction of 25% in fuel cost per km is assumed based on
       the survey.
Real value of water/ treated waste-water: People’s willingness to pay the user charges for improved
quality of water/treatment of waste water. The two factors used are Incremental volume of water
provided/ waste water treated (kL per day) and user charges (Rs. per kL). The values of the factors are
obtained from the board notes for on-going project and through survey for completed projects.
Coping costs of informal supply: It is the saving achieved by completely eliminating the money spent
on informal sources because of construction of new connections. The factors used are
     a. New connections (Nos.): The numbers are obtained from board notes for on-going projects
        and through survey for completed projects.
     b. Cost per month (Rs.): Money spent per month on informal sources. It is assumed to be Rs.
        25 per month per connection based on the survey.
Reduction in labour days lost: It is the saving achieved due to increase labour productivity and health
improvement. The factors used are
     a. Per day labour cost (Rs.): Earnings per day of a labour.
     b. Persons afflicted with illness (Nos.): Number of workers afflicted with water borne diseases.
        It is calculated as population of the city (nos.) X workforce participation (%) X workers
        affected (%)
     c. No. of days lost to illness in a year (Nos.): Total person days lost due to water borne illness.
        It is calculated as Avg. Days lost in sickness by a person X Persons afflicted with illness.
All the parameters are obtained through survey. For cities not covered in survey the values are taken
as that of the comparable city in terms of average income and geographical location of the ULB.
Increase in asset appreciation: Saving achieved because of the increase in land value. The factors
used are:


                                                   27
       a. Guideline value after sub-project/ value increase (Rs.): The average value of the land in the
          city. It is obtained through survey and for cities not covered in survey linear regression of the
          guideline value and city population is used.
       b. % of Area transacted: The area transacted every year is kept at 0.25% and the increase
          transaction after the implementation of the sub-project to be 0.75% based on the survey.
       c. Transactable area / Total (%): Actual area that can be transacted excluding the roads and
          public areas. It is taken as 60% of the total area.
  Increase in rental values: Savings achieved because of increase in rental values. The factors are:
       a. Assessed properties (Nos.): Total number of assessed properties in the cities obtained from
          the Census 2011 data.
       b. % of rental properties: Rental properties are assumed to be 20% of total.
       c. Average size of property (sq.km), ‘after’ rentals (Rs.) & increase in rentals (Rs.): The
          parameters are obtained through survey and for cities not covered in the survey the values are
          extrapolated on the basis of average annual income, area and population.
  Increase in economic activity: Revenue generated from shops, buses, restaurants, toilet, parking
  facilities, cloak room and advertisements in the premises of the bus stand. The revenue to be collected
  is obtained from board notes of respective ULBs.
  Attribution Factor: As discussed earlier in the chapter a factor is applied for each of the benefit
  stream to reflect that only a portion of the benefits are actually attributable to the project. As
  willingness to pay of sewerage charges, real value of water and the revenue generated in the bus
  premises is fully attributable to the project the factor is not applied to them. A higher factor is used for
  sewerage projects as new connections are provided whereas in case of most of the water supply
  projects improvement of distribution system is done. For ULBs with more than one sub-project a
  higher attribution factor is used. A conservative assumption of the attribution factor used for the
  benefit streams in the economic analysis is listed in Exhibit 2.

                                                      29
As can be seen, the weighted average of ERR in all sectors is above the threshold value of 12% with
the ULBs with multiple sub-projects having the maximum of 28%. ERR for UGSS projects are
relatively dampened by higher time frame for completion and the cities with multiple projects secure
higher ERRs because of higher benefits. ERRs of the projects under the CMDA component are also
above the threshold value of 1.

                                Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Beneficiary Survey of Project Affected Persons / Resettled Families

Two end term impact evaluations were carried out with the help of an independent consultant in 2013-
14 among the project affected families - one for Chennai urban transport sub-component and the other
among the resettled families of urban investment component. The impact evaluation for Chennai
urban transport sub-component observed that the living standards of the affected families have
improved considerably in terms of average income (3 times increase over baseline income), quality of
houses improved considerably (10% increase in those living in permanent and semi-permanent
housing) and there was also an increase in those having separate kitchen, bath room and toilets by 10-
20% over baseline situation. The proportion of those having electricity in their houses increased by
10% and those with piped water supply by 50%. Similarly, the people have also improved the
material assets in their houses in terms of grinder/mixer, televisions, two wheelers and mobile phones.
There is also shift in occupational patter from agricultural laborers to regular income earning jobs and
business. The level of satisfaction with compensation reported to good, where 75% are reported to be
satisfied with rate of compensation. The high level of satisfaction is due to consent award process
followed for private land acquisition and payment of compensation for structure without depreciation.
The compensation amounts are mostly spent for improvement of houses (40%), enhancement of
businesses (20%) repayment of old debts (9%), etc. The evaluation observed the local people have
expressed their full satisfaction with the reconstruction of affected temples and other affected
community assets. The study also observed that the grievance redress mechanism worked in the
project and one of the outcomes of this process was adoption of uniform rate of compensation for all
survey numbers in particular village even if there are differences in guidance values across various
survey number s in the same village.

The case of other end-term impact evaluation for resettlement of displaced families in Salem
Corporation revealed that there is an increase in income levels due more number of people in the
family work now compared to earlier and improvement in their housing conditions as they moved
from huts to the well-constructed flats. The study also reported that the displaced families continue to
maintain relations with the neighbors of the previous place as they continue to send their children to
schools in the old place and visited the doctor in the old place for medical requirements and most of
them continue to work in the old place. Some of the difficulties faced by those resettled households in
the new houses included drinking water as the supply was erratic and houses in the top floors did not
get water due to problems in lifting water to higher floors. Another issue raised by the people
included allotment of houses which did not take into consideration of the elders, old and sick people,
as some of the old and sick people were allotted higher floors. The issue of security and thefts was
also reported. The Bank advised the Salem Corporation to address the outcome of impact evaluation
findings as appropriate and complete the issue of titles to alternative houses as and when the
allotments were due after completion of the 5 year stay by the resettled families.

Participating ULBs Survey

Process and Methodology
The Beneficiary (ULB) Survey undertaken through an external consultant involved a combination of
field visits, questionnaire survey on ULBs participating in water/sewerage projects and review/
consolidation of findings from an earlier (Mid-Term) Service Outcome Assessment and is as detailed
below:
•   Field visits and case studies: Field visits were undertaken in over 15(out of the 55) ULBs
    participating in TNUDP-III for a first-hand assessment of the status of implementation, issues and
    project impacts from a service delivery standpoint. The field visits covered inspection of facilities
    and assets built under the project and interactions with concerned ULB officials and officials of

                                                   33
     implementing agency. Dipstick interactions with end-beneficiaries in these locations were also
     undertaken to get a sense of user feedback and an understanding of service level impacts on the
     ground. Exhibit 1 provides a list of projects for which field visits were made.

    Total                           17
•    Questionnaire survey on ULBs implementing water and UGSS sub-projects. Since78% of the
     funding under Urban Investment Component (UIC) was towards sewerage and water supply sub-
     projects, a questionnaire survey was administered with respective ULBs to confirm baseline
     information on project status, service delivery and financial performance. Refer Annexure I for a
     copy of the questions on which information was elicited from ULBs.
•    Review of earlier service assessments: The Beneficiary survey also reviewed and incorporated
     findings from Mid-Term Service delivery impact assessment report prepared at the interim stage
     of TNUDP-III which captured on-the-field impact of 73 completed projects in water supply, roads,
     bus stands, UGSS and Solid waste management.
Findings and observations

Positive service delivery and field level impacts

     1. Water Supply: The sub-projects in water supply reflected significant improvements in service
        delivery on a range of indicators including coverage, per capita supply and frequency of water
        supply. Findings from the questionnaire survey revealed that the frequency of the water
        supply improved across the participating ULBs from once in 4-5 days prior to implementation
        to daily or once in two days post implementation. Participating ULBs reported increase in
        average per capita supply from 63 LPCD pre-project to 115 LPCD post project.
     2. Sewerage: In Ooty and Pallavaram where sewerage projects were completed more than a year
        back, house service connection targets have been exceeded. 5 of the 7 sewerage projects
        visited were completed in the last six months and hence it is a little early to comment on
        service delivery impact. In these five projects, construction had been completed and provision
        of house service connections had commenced. As reported by ULBs in our questionnaire
        survey, over 65% of physical connections (required to provide the eventual house service
        connections) were completed in 25 sub-projects implemented under TNUDP-III.
     3. Roads: Road improvement works, under the CMDA component covered a range of service
        improvements including road widening, road geometry improvements, retaining walls,
        provision of signages and avenue plantation. Baseline surveys undertaken on completion in
        the roads implemented under the CMDA component reflect an average increase in speed of
        33% and reduction in travel time of 16 %.


                                                    34
   4. Bus-stands and Foot-over bridges: Bus stand sub-projects have considerably improved the
      quality of services in the bus stand premises for passengers. For instance in Hosur, the bus
      stand was modernized to tackle the situation of congestion, to ease the movement of buses and
      provide improved parking facility. The bus services increased to 2468 and revenue generation
      from the bus stand went up five-fold. The five modern Foot-over-bridges (FoBs) constructed
      under the CMDA component resulted in safe pedestrian movement, multimodal integration
      and free flow of traffic. FoBs were equipped with escalators and solar powered lighting with
      100% power backup to facilitate uninterrupted service.
   5. Solid Waste Management: Procurement of vehicles for solid waste management under the
      investment component enabled improved collection efficiency and coverage. Collection
      efficiency in the participating ULBs has increased to over 90%.
   6. Perceptions relating to service delivery: The Mid-term survey captured the positive response
      from the public on the improved service levels. A number of towns including Kuruchi,
      Kuniamuthur, Vadavalli and Koundampalayam have also witnessed significant land price
      appreciation post implementation of water supply sub-projects.

Financial performance in water and sewerage sub-projects

   1. Cost Recovery: ULBs participating in water supply projects reported an average O&M cost
      recovery of 120% as of March 2014. In case of UGSS projects, since many projects have only
      recently been commissioned, the expected O&M cost recovery, computed on the basis of user
      charges adopted by respective councils is 150%, thus reflecting sustainable financing for
      O&M.
   2. Collection efficiency in ULBs with water supply projects: High collection efficiencies were
      reported in the ULBs with water supply projects. Collection efficiency of 100% was observed
      in Pollachi and Bodinayakanur which were visited by the review team. The collection
      efficiency for UGSS projects has been moderate in the ULBs visited (with a reported average
      of 22% in the 7 ULBs visited). However, ULB officials expressed confidence that this would
      improve significantly as all house service connections are completed.

Good operating practices
   1. Effective Complaint redress system: Telephonic complaint system is in place in Pallavaram to
      record and resolve the complaints regarding the UGSS facility constructed. During our field
      visit, we observed that over 150 complaints had been recorded and resolved in previous three
      months.
   2. IT enabled systems for effective monitoring and control: Pollachi Municipality had initiated a
      real time tracking of water levels and energy efficiency through mobile enabled systems which
      significantly reduces water and energy losses in commercial centres.
   3. Avenue Plantation in roads under CMDA component: In the MKT road, avenue plantations at
      the edges in the non-built-up sections was done to prevent future encroachments and as Right
      of Way delineation while improving greenery around the road. These plantations have also
      been entrusted to the Forest Department for maintenance and upkeep. As per Highways
      department officials, this has helped improve the survival rate of the tree saplings to 80%.
   4. Stakeholder consultations for land acquisition: For the widening and strengthening of MKT
      Road under CMDA component, over 11,045 sq.m of land was acquired without litigation
      issues. Land acquisition was done transparently through a negotiation process that was done
      by constitution of a Negotiation Committee comprising local stakeholders and the
      compensation was decided through open negotiations. Local stakeholders met during the field
      visit expressed satisfaction and positive views on the project.

Challenges faced – findings from field

   1. Factors underlying delays in implementation: Change in location of STP and pumping
      stations due to land acquisition and objections from public (including litigation) were
      observed in Pallavaram, Dindigul, and Dharmapuri. Unanticipated presence of rocky terrain
      in Tiruvannamalai and Dindigul also resulted in delays and cost escalation. In a few of the
      towns, work was awarded only after 4th or 5th call due to reasons like “No Response” or
      “Single Tender” etc. In Pollachi for instance, construction work of water supply system was
      awarded in the 5th call.
   2. Need to strengthen operating processes and handover: It is critical to strengthen
      documentation at ULBs. While few of them were indeed able to produce documentation on
      all the project related information (For e.g., DPR, Loan agreement etc.), some of them cited
      that these are available with TNUIFSL or implementation agencies etc. It would be useful to
      standardise and ensure that ULBs have all required documentation relating to the project.
      Similarly, there appears to be a need to strengthen the process of formal handover of project
      post completion. In Pollachi for instance, the Bank came across fairly good documentation
      processes and ULB officials also confirmed formal process of handover of project. Greater
      rigor on these aspects coupled with upfront training and creation of standardised processes for
      the same could help strengthen operating sustainability further.
   3. Additional projects to address mid-course bottlenecks and unanticipated growth: Rapid
      growth of population led to pumping bottlenecks and need for re-sizing of mains in
      Pallavaram and Perambalur. This is being addressed with a new tender of INR9.5 crore by
      Perambalur municipality under IUDM and a proposal by Pallavaram municipality to add
      41km of additional network to connect the additional growth in population beyond what was
      anticipated at DPR stage.
   4. Greater rigor in project preparation: While there has been a great deal of focus in ensuring
      project preparation rigor, this is an area that will continue to require greater focus. For
      instance, early stage sewerage projects underestimated the challenge of land acquisition, and
      project siting and this was overcome in later projects. Greater attention is required to
      recognise externalities during project preparation as seen in the Salem river improvement
      project, where disposal and handling of solid waste along the improved river bank remains an
      area of concern.

1. Introduction
The Third Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (TNUDP-III) is a repeater project to the Second
Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project (TNUDP-II) implemented by Department of Municipal
Administration and Water Supply of Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) with financial assistance
from World Bank (WB).

1.1.    Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to improve the delivery of urban services in Tamil Nadu through
enhancing the quality of urban infrastructure and strengthening the institutional and financial
framework. The repeater project has built on and consolidated the achievements of TNUDP II,
continuing to improve urban infrastructure services in Tamil Nadu in a sustainable manner. The two
main objectives are:
     • to strengthen and deepen the empowerment of ULBs by continuing the decentralization
        process through delegation of powers from state level bodies to ULBs; and through continuing
        and expanding the capacity building programs started under TNUDP II.
     • to mobilize resources on a sustainable basis for urban infrastructure investments through
            o Mobilizing private financing for ULB infrastructure investments by linking ULBs to
                the financial markets through the intermediation of the Tamil Nadu Urban
                Development Fund (TNUDF).
            o Providing incentives for investments in low income neighbourhoods through the use
                of supporting capital grants.

1.2.   Project Performance Indicators
The project performance indicators are
     • Enhanced financial soundness of ULBs, as indicated by improvement in own source revenues
       of participating ULBs and better debt management.
     • Improved urban governance and accountability in ULBs, through reforms undertaken such as
       accounting and financial management reforms and e-governance.
     • Improved cost recovery with regard to urban services and improvements in urban services
       delivery coverage.
     • Reduction in travel time on key transport project corridors, and reduction in fatal accidents in
       Chennai.
     • Improved long- term sustainability of TNUDF through market orientation, diversification of
       its resource base and products and implementation of a business and risk management
       strategy.

1.3.    Project Components
The Project consists of two complementary components, an Institutional Development Component
(IDC) and an Urban Investment Component (UIC). The IDC provides the Technical Assistance (TA)
and training needed to build capacity to further the devolution process.

The UIC finances the following:
      • part of the ULBs urban infrastructure pipeline through a line of credit to TNUDF and capital
        grants and
      • a grant for the development of urban roads and related components in the Greater Chennai
        Metropolitan Area through the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).
The total project cost is US $ 434 mn and the component wise allocation is furnished in Table 1.

restructured during 2009 by internal reallocation of funds among the sub-components under Urban
Investment Component and extended up to March 2012. Further, considering the completion of sub-
projects under implementation and to achieve the PDO, the project has got extension up to March
2014.

2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives
TNUDP-III has substantially achieved and surpassed its Project Development Objectives (PDO).
As per its Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the objective of TNUDP-III was to improve delivery of
urban services through enhancing quality of urban infrastructure and strengthening institutional and
financial framework.

The procedure followed by TNUDF for the appraisal of the projects is as given below:
• The borrowers are first required to submit a prescribed application along with DPR and the
   audited financial statements for the previous five financial years.
• On the basis of the application and further details furnished by the applicant borrower, a quick
   initial screening would be done with regard to eligibility, repayment capacity, financial viability,
   approvals obtained and further details required for detailed appraisal.
• After initial screening, a detailed appraisal containing technical, economic, financial,
   organisational, legal, social and environmental evaluation would be completed.
• Based on the appraisal report, the proposed loan will be sanctioned. The conditions of sanction
   would specify required covenants, procurement conditions, while disbursement conditions would
   be linked to implementation schedules.
• On accepting the loan sanction conditions, loan agreement will be executed.

Of the above 110 sub-projects, as on date 106 sub-projects have been commissioned and started
delivery of (improved) urban services and the value of works completed is INR 15121.91 mn. The
balance works will be completed in the financial year 2014-15 by utilizing the counterpart funding
provided by GoTN under TNUDP III. Four of the on-going sub-projects costing INR 3063.60 mn. will
be posed under the proposed (follow-on) TNSUDP for retroactive financing.

The initiatives and outcomes of this sub-component are summarised below:

•   Access to improved water supply: Sub-projects taken up under TNUDP-III in 20 ULBs have as
    on date provided improved water supply services to approx. 1,974,510 persons. Water supply
    projects have increased the per capita supply in participating ULBs from 63 litres per capita per
    day (LPCD) to 115 LPCD along with increase in frequency of water supply to daily in most
    instances from an average of once in 4 to 5 days.
•   Access to sewerage: Major thrust has been given under TNUDP-III for sewerage. 25 ULBs have
    been provided with under-ground sewerage systems (23 are green field) at a cost of INR12177 mn.
    (about 50% of the total project size). This has resulted in improved hygiene and environment.
    Sewage treatment plants with a total capacity of 271 MLD have been created as on date with
    various advanced technologies under this programmatic plan. The sewerage schemes that have
    been commissioned have constructed 298,688 sewerage connections for households as on date.
•   Service access to slum households / urban poor: As on date, TNUDP-III has provided improved
    water services to 422893 to slum dwellers and sewerage service to 58054 to slum dwellers.
•   Other sub-sectors: TNUDP-III has contributed to asset creation and improved service delivery in
    number of other sectors including the following: (i) improvement of about 1500 km of roads in 24
    ULBs increased the speeds and reduced the travel time, (ii)procurement of waste transportation
    equipment in 32 ULBs,increased the waste transportation capacity by about 380 tonnes/day, thus
    facilitating improvement in solid waste collection efficiency to 100%, (iii) construction of bus
    terminals in 7 ULBs added 208 bus bays handling an estimated 4140 buses per day (serving an
    estimated population of over 565,000), and (iv) a river improvement scheme in Salem, which
    included improvements to Thirumanimuthar River for a stretch of 2800m, regularizing the cross
    section of the Vellakuttai Oodai and construction of 3 Bridges near old bus stand, gunpoint and
    oxford school, significantly contributed to improved urban environment.

        3.4.   Urban Investment Component: CMDA sub-component
        This sub-component aims to support grants for urban road infrastructure and traffic management
        programs in the Greater Chennai Metropolitan Area which includes surrounding peri-urban areas. The
        investments include road widening, bridges, traffic studies &traffic management and road safety sub-
        components. The sub-component comprised activities and investments under (a) Roads sub-
        component, implemented through Highways Department, GoTN (b) Traffic management &
        enforcement sub-component, implemented through Chennai City Traffic Police (CCTP) and (c)
        Comprehensive Traffic and Transportation Study for Chennai undertaken through CMDA.

        The CMDA sub-component was restructured and scaled down to US $ 41 mn from US $ 150 mn
        during restructuring of TNUDP III. Further, the bank financing was reduced by US $0.64 million due
        to the mis-procurement under CCTP sub-component. The cost of the initiatives taken under CMDA
        sub-component is INR1842.88 mn as furnished in Table below.

        The initiatives and outcomes of this sub-component are summarised below:

        •   Roads and Foot-over bridges:Of the 23 road sub-projects initially identified,5road sub-projects
            covering 34.80 km were upgraded under this component (the balance sub-projects have been
            dropped during mid-term review of TNUDP III and subsequently taken up with State funds). A
            service assessment undertaken on the 5 projects has validated a sharp improvement road quality,
            average reduction in travel time of 16% and average increase in travel speeds of 33%. In addition,
            5 Modern Foot-over-Bridges with escalators, implemented contribute to ease of movement and
            reduction of road accidents in select arterial roads with high pedestrian density & high vehicular
            traffic and also facilitated multi modal integration.
        •   Traffic Management and enforcement: Traffic enforcement and management equipments were
            procured for efficient traffic management in Chennai city. An e-challan system introduced for
            traffic management has resulted in substantial improvement in detecting, documenting and
            enforcement in cases of traffic violations, thereby reducing the accidents. A Traffic Education

                                                                   53

       house training to traffic personnel.
•      Strengthening of Highways Research Station: Lab equipments were purchased to strengthen
       Highways Research Station.
•      Project Preparation: A Comprehensive Traffic and Transportation Study (CTTS) was
       undertaken by CMDA under which a shelf of projects worth INR821200 mn. were identified with
       strategies for implementation. This study has provided the frame work for establishment of
       Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA). A few identified projects have
       already been taken up for implementation with State funds.

3.5.      Project Development Advisory Facility
The UIC includes provision of Project Development Advisory Facility (PDAF) to provide technical
assistance for innovative sub-project preparatory studies and implementation, besides for regular urban
infrastructure project, financial structuring, etc. The PDAF handled by TNUIFSL was scaled up from
an initial size of US $ 3.00 mn to US $ 9.00 mn (about INR414 mn.) and stands fully committed. As
of March 2014, 154 initiatives costing INR436.30 mn. have been initiated under PDAF. A sum of
INR355.25 mn has been disbursed (of which INR337.90 mn has been disbursed up to 31.03.2014 and
a sum of INR17.34 mn has been disbursed during April to July 2014 for works completed up to
31.03.2014).

The initiatives and outcomes of this sub-component are summarised below:

•      ULBs availed assistance under PDAF: Over 185 ULBs(12 Corporations, 112 Municipalities and
       61 Town Panchayats) availed the technical assistance under the PDAF indicating that the use of
       PDAF has been spread across the State for various categories of ULBs.
•      Nature and composition of studies: Nearly 61% of funds committed under PDAF is for
       preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPRs) and 23% on identification of city level investment
       and development needs through preparation of City Development Plans (CDPs) /City Corporate
       cum Business Plans (CCP-BP) and Comprehensive Mobility Plans (CMPs). About 3% was also

    spent on preparing PPP projects & Transaction Advisory and 3% on Environment &Social
    assessments and audits.
•   DPRs: 46 assignments have been undertaken to prepare Detailed Project Reports for specific
    infrastructure projects which includes storm water drains for large corporations, integrated solid
    waste management facility on cluster basis, road-over-bridges, grade separators, water supply,
    underground sewerage systems, etc. The total value of sub-projects for which DPR prepared is
    about INR142120 mn.
•   City level plans: City level Plans were prepared for over 133 ULBs under which over INR900000
    mn. of investment needs have been identified in a consultative manner.
•   Fructification: Of the 185 ULBs for which technical assistance have been provided under PDAF
    (154 assignments, of which few assignments on cluster basis), 103 ULBs executed the sub-
    projects translating to an implementation rate of 56%.
•   Other initiatives: A key feature of the PDAF is its focus on innovative project development
    initiatives. Some of these include i) Eco-restoration plan for Adyar Eco Park, ii) Urban re-
    development plan for Central Business District - Theyagaraya Nagar in Chennai, iii) Setting up
    Common Service centres for providing e-governance services to citizens on PPP, iv) ESCO
    models for Energy Efficiency in street lighting and water pumping, v) transaction advisory for
    construction of Multi-level car parking in front of Panagal Park in Theyagaraya Nagar, Chennai
    under PPP and vi) Infrastructure development plan for Marina Beachfront in Chennai.

3.6.    Economic Analysis
The Economic analysis has been done to compute Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value
(@ 12% discounting rate) individually for 63 sub-projects costing greater than US$500,000 and
covering 98% of the approved project cost under the Investment component.

The ERR for TNUDP-III was computed based on evaluation of cost-benefit streams of sub-projects
implemented under the UIC and was found to be higher than the threshold value of 12%. Water supply
projects exhibited the highest ERR followed by Bus terminals. ERR for underground sewerage
projects were slightly dampened by longer time frames for completion. Cities with multiple projects
secured higher ERRs because of compounded benefits achieved.

5. Financial Sustainability and Innovations
5.1.  Financial Sustainability of TNUDF

One of the aims of TNUDP-III is to ensure sustainability of TNUDF. The project has achieved its
outcome indicators on financial sustainability as reflected below:
• TNUDF reported an efficiency of 100% (as against the target of 95 %) in respect of collection of
    debt service dues from ULBs during the entire project period and has exceeded performance
    standards envisaged. There are no non-performing assets as on 31.03.2014.
• The financial sustainability of TNUDF has been established through out the period of TNUDP III.
    The Fund has paid interest at an average rate of about 7.35% to Unit holders during the financial
    years from 2009-10 to 2013-14. Further, the Fund ended up with Surplus consistently for all the
    financial years, since its inception in 1996.
• TNUDF accessed Euro 157 mn (investment component of Euro 145 mn) from KfW and JPY
    9.824 bn (investment component of JPY 8.551 bn) from JICA.
• The Loans Assets of TNUDF has been increased more than six times in the last eight financial
    years ie. INR2001.34 mn. as on 31.03.2006 is increased to INR12733.27 mn. as on 31.03.2014.

5.2.    Non-traditional financing and Financial Innovations
An amount of INR2378.48mn has been raised through non-traditional means of financing such as
beneficiary contribution, bond mobilization and PPP which surpassed the envisaged amount of
INR1840 mn.
       Table 14: Resource Mobilisation from non-traditional financing as of March 2014
                                                 Estimated amount        Actual up to March

                       Total (INR in mn)                4787.64                2378.48

All water supply and sewerage projects financed under TNUDP-III were structured to ensure financial
sustainability with about 28% of the project cost financed by beneficiary contribution. Nearly a third
of the user financing targeted through beneficiary contributions from water and sewerage projects has
already been garnered.
Bonds were raised under the Water and Sanitation Pooled Fund (WSPF), constituted by GoTN as a
fully owned trust in 2002 under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 and managed by Tamil Nadu Urban
Infrastructure Financial Services Limited (TNUIFSL). The funds were mostly utilized towards
refinancing the borrowings of seven ULBs. Amounts of INR67mn.and INR832 mn. were raised in
2008 and 2010 respectively. In Tuticorin, the STP of treatment capacity 25 MLD was awarded in the
PPP –DBOT basis to a private contractor for a cost of Rs. 22 crore

One of the major highlights of the programme was the continued focus on themes of innovations and
sustainability. A few of the operational achievements / innovative features undertaken by TNUIFSL
are summarised below:



                                                   57
•   Tapping of non-traditional resources and mobilization of Bonds under Pooled Finance
    Framework: The covenant of non-traditional financing of US$40 million was successfully
    achieved through a combination of bond financing and beneficiary contributions. During the
    course of TNUDP-III, the State has successfully raised support from KfW to scale up its bond
    program under pooled finance framework.
•   Levy of user charges: All water supply, sewerage and bus terminal projects financed under
    TNUDP III have been structured with beneficiary contribution to fund the capital cost of the
    project and user charges to cover full O&M and debt service to achieve financial sustainability.
    This was done through a series of well designed documentation process including Detailed Project
    Appraisal followed by Loan Sanction considering the debt bearing capacity of the ULBs,
    acceptance of terms and conditions of loan sanction through formal council resolutions followed
    by execution of Loan Agreement.
•   O&M sustainability: In most of the towns where new sewage treatment plant was proposed,
    DBOT (Design Build Operate and Transfer) contracts were given with five years of operation and
    maintenance after successful commissioning. On completion, the O&M of the projects is being
    outsourced on PPP contract basis. The State has developed standard bid documents for
    outsourcing of O&M. The outsourcing of O&M of sewerage system in one of the sewerage
    projects (Pallavaram Municipality) assisted under TNUDP III has already been introduced.
•   Sewerage Equipment bank: Stock of equipments for O&M of sewerage projects is being
    maintained by the CMA which can be used by the several ULBs as and when needed.
•   Mechanisms put in place to sustain collection of 100% debt service: A number of payment
    security mechanisms including execution of loan agreement incorporating conditions ensuring
    timely payment of debt service, maintenance of escrow account and creation of debt service
    reserve fund have been adopted to sustain 100% collection efficiency of debt service. Further
    issuance of demand notice well in advance and close follow up with the ULBs just before the due
    date(s) resulted in the record 100% collection of debt service from ULBs.
•   Focus on environment and social sustainability: The State has put in place a comprehensive
    Environment and Social Assessment Framework for all projects assisted under TNUDP III to
    identify and implement measures to mitigate and address all Environment and Social impacts.
    The strong thrust on environmental and social sustainability is reflected in the well-defined
    safeguards, impact assessments, Environment Management Plans and follow-up audits.
•   Consultative process and Empowerment of ULBs: The sub-projects posed for funding under
    TNUDP III have been selected based on well defined consultative process. All participating
    ULBs that implemented water and sewerage projects were involved while appraising the sub-
    projects for funding that resulted in fixation of beneficiary contributions and user charges through
    council resolutions made easy. The implementation arrangements facilitated greater ownership
    within participating ULBs, thereby enabling greater empowerment of ULBs, while at the same
    time leveraging the technical expertise of parastatals.
•   Adoption of the best practices resulted in litigation free land acquisition: Land acquisition for
    all road stretches developed under the CMDA component was done in a transparent manner with
    public participation, resulted in litigation free acquisition. The land acquisition was facilitated by
    creation of an empowered Land Acquisition Cell (formed by the Government through a separate
    Government Order) that had participation from not only key officials from District Collectorate
    and implementing departments but also had representation from local villages where land
    acquisition was done.
•   Institutional changes under CMDA sub-component: The State has established a Project
    Implementation Unit under the Department of Highways for smooth implementation of road sub-
    projects under CMDA component. The Unit comprises of officials for project implementation as
    well as officials to handle Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation.


                                                     58
•      Foot over bridges were implemented with escalators & solar powered lighting with 100% power
       backup to facilitate uninterrupted service.
•      Strengthening of Highway Research Station: Highway Research Station has been strengthened
       by providing mobile testing units for conducting site level test for monitoring and evaluation.
•      Continued thrust on e-governance and accounting/ financial management systems: The
       actions initiated under the IDC build on the thrust and focus on e-governance and improvements in
       financial accounting and management systems at the ULB level. These initiatives not only
       upgraded the existing financial and accounting systems but also facilitate to migrate to a web-
       enabled financial management system in the long run.


6. Support from Bank
6.1.       Mid-course restructuring and Project extension

Following the mid-term review, GoTN, in consultation with the World Bank, vide its Order dated 16
December 2009, implemented a set of changes by restructuring TNUDP-III. Based on the revised
procurement and implementation plans of TNUDP-III, the closing date was extended by one year to
March 2012.

The restructuring of the Project holistically factored the specific constraints and opportunities arising
following the mid-term review and was done to ensure that the PDO remained relevant and achievable
while strengthening implementation.

6.2.    Monitoring
The World Bank undertook a series of missions throughout the course of the project to track progress
and to suggest mid-course corrections and actions which contributed to successful implementation.
Implementation Support Review Missions were undertaken periodically by the Bank, followed by
detailed documentation of the status of the projects and guidance / recommendations through Aid-
memoire, to facilitate achieving the PDOs.

During the Review Missions field visits were also carried out by the Bank Mission to review the status
of the sub-project implementation and ensure compliances. Critical issues on project implementation
were identified and resolved.

7. Challenges during implementation
7.1.    Strategic factors
        a. The general economic scenario had a significant impact on the programme
            implementation. The rising interest rates and general economic slowdown resulted in
            deterioration of the financial position of the vendors/ contractor. This directly translated to
            time and cost overruns of the projects.
        b. State-level commitment to urban policy reform is essential for effective implementation
            of programme. Some of the State level policy factors which have a direct bearing on the
            implementation are Urban financing, Land acquisition, Environment, Staffing,
            Decentralization and Institutional structuring.

7.2.     Institutional factors
Institutional multiplicity and coordination challenges were faced under UIC. In the case of CMDA
component, while the PAD envisaged a multi-agency PMU, eventually a separate PIU within the
Highways Department was set-up to implement the sub-project under this component.

7.3.    Operational factors
The operational factors with respect to the implementation of the sub-projects were manifested in the
form of cost and time overruns. The escalations were due to a combination of factors right from the
planning stage to the commissioning of the sub-projects. A list of few factors is furnished below:
                  i. Changes in sub-project configuration/scope/specifications
                 ii. Availability and delay in finalization of land
                iii. Changes in location of STPs/ sewage pumping stations
                iv. Finalization and change in STP technology
                 v. Higher Tender premiums in bidding
                vi. Challenges and delays in procurement of contractor for works
               vii. Delay in obtaining statutory clearances (Pollution Control Board)
              viii. Delay in obtaining permissions from National and State Highways, National
                     Highways Authority of India, Forest Department and Railways.
                ix. Delay in establishment of PIU to implement Highways sub-component under
                     CMDA component
                 x. Non-availability of qualified contractors due to implementation of urban
                     infrastructure projects in large scale under various funding schemes
                xi. Synchronisation of sub-project implementation due to implementation of other
                     infrastructure projects with other funding source in the same project area (road
                     projects under CMDA sub-component).
               xii. Contractors’ performance during execution

7.4.      Restructuring of TNUDP III
• Need for restructuring of CMDA sub-component: The Bank’s Mid-term Review mission in
     2008 identified the need for a scaling down of the CMDA sub-component in view of environment
     and social compliance for the initial shelf of sub-projects resulting in limiting the sub-component
     to five road sub-projects.
• Enhancement of funding to ULBs projects by scaling down to CMDA’s projects under UIC:
     Even though there is no change in the outlay and Bank financing under UIC, the scaling down of
     the CMDA sub-component resulted in substantial increase in the outlay and Bank financing for
     the ULB’s projects as reflected in the Table below.

The extension of Project timeframe thus became necessary in view of the change in financing among
the sub-components under UIC and to absorb this incremental financing, the programme required
additional time for completion.

All the above factors resulted in extension of Project closure until March 2014 as against the
scheduled closure of March 2011.

8. Transition arrangements to sustain achievements post closure
During the course of TNUDP-III, mechanisms put in place to ensure sustainability of outcomes and
impacts achieved under TNUDP-III are listed below:
• Institutional: TNUIFSL and TNUDF have matured into a relatively robust institutional
   framework for urban financing and has successfully accessed funding from KfW and JICA, apart
   from World Bank. The institutional arrangements for project planning & development,
   implementation, monitoring, supervision and O&M would remain in place for all sub-projects.
• Technical sustainability: The performance of the assets created under TNUDP-III will be
   evaluated periodically to ensure the technical sustainability. Regulatory agencies such as TNPCB
   will have periodical monitoring of the outputs from the sewage treatment plants, apart from the
   regular checks by the ULBs.
• TNUDF’s financial sustainability: As the fund manager of TNUDF, TNUIFSL will oversee and
   monitor timely repayments of the loans disbursed under TNUDP-III, to maintain a 100%
   collection efficiency rate of debt service from ULBs. The loan agreements executed with the
   ULBs have incorporated conditions for credit enhancing measures including creation of escrow
   accounts and debt service reserves by ULBs. Debt serviceability of sub-projects financed is
   evaluated in accordance with lending policy guidelines of TNUDF.
• Financial Sustainability of Sub-projects: Financial sustainability has been a key focus area of
   sub-projects implemented under TNUDP-III. All sub-projects in water supply, sewerage and bus
   terminal projects envisaged levying of user charges to meet 100% O&M cost recovery and debt
   service. A graded user charges framework (user charges based on built up area of the building)
   has been practiced for underground sewerage sub-projects considering the equality and has greater
   acceptance among the general public. A framework for periodical revision of user charges has
   been put in place.
• O&M sustainability: After the 5 years of operation and maintenance by the implementing
   agencies, the projects will be handed over to the ULBs who may outsource the O&M through PPP
   contracts. Standard bid documents and contracts for O&M of sewerage systems have been
   developed by the State. Further, the State has initiated an exercise to monitor service levels in all


                                                    61
    ULBs based on the Service Level Benchmark (SLB) norms and guidelines issued by the Ministry
    of Urban Development, Government of India.
•   GoTN’s Budget for completion of balance works under ongoing projects post March 2014:
    GoTN has committed to provide finance for completion of the balance work under ongoing sub-
    projects post closure of TNUDP III.

9. Key Observations
Some of the key observations in the course of implementation are summarised below:
•   Flexibility in Project design to support mid-course corrections: Even though TNUDP-III was
    significantly larger and incorporated a number of new sub-components in relation to TNUDP-II
    (including the sewerage program and the CMDA component), it provided for a flexible project
    design which enabled mid-course corrections. For instance, even though the CMDA sub-
    component had to be scaled down, the Project design allowed re-configuration without deviating
    significantly from PDOs set forth for the Project.

•   Effective Institutional Arrangements: Implementation of the Project involved multiple
    institutions and agencies and hence called for effective institutional arrangements to ensure
    seamless coordination. Early stage coordination for the urban infrastructure component was
    facilitated through state-level committees. In case of the CMDA component the multi-agency
    PMU was complemented with a separate PIU within the Highways Department for sharper focus
    on the road sub-projects. An effort to continually review and strengthen institutional
    arrangements helped tackle operational challenges and expedite implementation.

•   Focus on programmatic impact: The implementation of the sewerage program reflect the
    challenges as well as opportunities in planning and undertaking investments in a programmatic
    manner.

•   Rigor in Project Development: While TNUDP-III benefited from the availability of a shelf of
    sub-projects, inadequate rigor in technical and financial detailing in a few of these DPRs led to
    delays and increases in project cost. While this was corrected in later stages of the Project, a
    formal review of process of scoping and preparing DPRs could be beneficial in more effectively
    institutionalising lessons learnt.

•   Firming up of land: A significant part of the delay in several of the sub-projects was due to
    difficulties in addressing land availability and earmarking. The difficulties underscore the need for
    effective integration of land-use and project planning. They also underscore the need for shifting
    from a case-to-case addressing of land acquisition to policy instrument driven approach to land
    management (involving effective master plans / land-use regulations and use of instruments such
    as land pooling). While some of these aspects are under the consideration of GoTN, scaling up
    these state-wide is critical to ramp-up investments from current levels.

•   Upfront implementation of Institutional Development actions: A review of the IDC reveals
    back-end implementation of several of the proposed initiatives, with several of the initiatives
    having been implemented in the latter half of the program. There have been substantial lags vis-à-
    vis targets particularly in the Training component and utilisation of Project Preparation Fund
    (PPF), suggesting that sustained attention to this component was possibly missing especially in
    early stage of the Project.
