unsatisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            Strong attention to project implementation readiness is\n            critical and may imply allowing for a longer project\n            preparation period. This includes a careful assessment of\n            institutional capacity and where necessary including\n            provisions for capacity building and judicious formulation\n            of the project results framework and key Project Development\n            Objective (PDO) outcome indicators. The project indicators\n            should be a set of Specific, Measurable, Attributable,\n            Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) indicators. Strong linkages\n            between the agricultural research and extension system are\n            critical for the broad dissemination of technologies\n            developed. The Bank actions cannot substitute for the lack\n            of Government commitment to properly and timely implement\n            the project activities. The stability of the project\n            implementing unit staff, particularly the procurement and\n            financial management specialists, is critical for timely and\n            quality results in project execution."}, "docdt": "2013-10-14T00:00:00Z"}
