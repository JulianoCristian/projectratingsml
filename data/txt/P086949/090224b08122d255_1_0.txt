                         The Project continues to make good progress towards meeting its revised objectives. Although not attributed to the project, the CAP funding committed to beneficiaries continued to
                         increase and even exceeded the targets set, with the indirect project support towards improving the farmers' capacity to prepare better projects financed from CAP funds through

                         data for 20009/2010 show a substantial increase of the weight of agri-food exports to EU-27 in total Gross Value Added (GVA), not only as a result of general development of
                         agriculture sector but also benefiting of the results of the project activities financed under the Competitive Grant Scheme, which have started to generate economic, social and
                         environmental impacts. A number of over 100 technologies, management and marketing practices were disseminated to the target groups and have started to be adopted. In

                         addition, 30 new technologies compatible with EU standards have been developed under 32 projects completed. The training activities in the four Training and Information Centers
                         set up with support from the Project successfully continue with funds from other sources under the close supervision of the Consultative Council, to provide training to private farmers,
                         agroprocessors, food safety inspectors, extension staff, researchers.

                         The activities targeting the reform of selected agriculture research and development institutes is underway. It includes rehabilitation and modernization of three R&D institutes

                         start based on a training plan proposed by the agency in early December 2011. In addition, Project funds will be used for procurement of IT hardware to improve the Integrated
                         Administration and Control System (IACS) and allow further upgrade of IACS, to start in 2012.
