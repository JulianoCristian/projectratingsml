1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Romania was scheduled for European Union (EU) accession in 2007. With
agricultural and food legislation making up about half of the EU obligations in the acquis
communautaire, the government faced a major challenge in creating a competitive
agricultural sector that was in compliance with EU requirements. Romania had made good
progress working closely with the EU and other development partners including the World Bank,
however, a significant unfinished agenda remained in terms of providing farmers and the agro-
food industry access to training, information, skills and technologies required to ensure access to
European markets.
2.       Despite agriculture’s dominant role in employment and land use, agricultural
production had become increasingly inefficient and fragmented, with labor and land
productivity only 6% and 27% of the respective averages in the EU. Agriculture employed
44% of Romania’s total labor force and 70% (4.8 million people) of its rural labor force, with the
latter representing 72% of total agricultural labor in all the EU-15 countries. Agriculture also
utilized 62% of Romania’s total area--one of the highest shares of cultivated land in all EU
member states. Household farms dominated, with over 4.5 million agricultural holdings varying
from less than 1 ha to 2,000 ha in size, and producing about 87% of agricultural output.
3.      The Government of Romania (GoR) requested Bank assistance to fill specific gaps
in its compliance efforts that were not being funded by the EU or other donors. Although
negotiations on agriculture had been completed, and the laws and regulations harmonized to
meet EU requirements, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Rural Development (MAFRD)
needed to strengthen its readiness to implement these policies. The Bank had gained valuable
experience in assisting Romania to implement its agriculture reform program since 1999,
through the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) and the Agricultural Support Services
Project (ASSP). The ASSP, in particular, had highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the
existing research, extension and education systems. However, ASSP had not assisted in
modernizing the Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (AKIS) to meet the needs of
farmers in the context of EU accession. MAKIS was approved on November 16, 2004 and
became effective on June 24, 2005, with a planned closing date of September 30, 2010.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
4.    The original PDO was to assist the Romanian Government to improve the
competitiveness of farmers and agro-processors in the EU accession environment.

5.      The Project had three Outcome Indicators: (i) increased adoption of improved farm
practices, marketing, post-harvest and food safety technologies leading to improved agricultural
productivity and incomes compatible with EU standards; (ii) increased agricultural exports; and
(iii) improved agricultural productivity.

1.3 Revised and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
6.      The revised PDO was to help Romania comply with the agricultural acquis
communautaire and to help the agro-food sector take advantage of the benefits and opportunities
arising from EU membership.
                                             1
7.       MAKIS was restructured three times (see Table 1). The PDO and Outcome Indicators
were revised in the first (level 1) restructuring on September 30, 2010, and was primarily in
response to: (i) a change in the country priorities in the post-EU-accession context; and (ii)
implementation issues initially identified at Project Mid-Term Review (MTR) conducted in
November 2008 and further specified during implementation support activities in 2009 and 2010.
With respect to (i) above, the benefits from EU membership could not have been objectives of
the project when it started, as Romania was not yet a member of the EU. Neither the team nor the
government could have anticipated the changes that would be brought about by Romania's EU
accession. On (ii), the implementation issues were mainly related to Component 1, whose
performance against the outcome indicators clearly showed that the project’s original targets
could not be fully achieved. With the exception of the establishment of three Border Inspection
Posts (BIPs) and procurement of equipment for national reference and regional laboratories, the
performance of the ANSVSA-led sub-components did not meet the Borrower’s and the Bank’s
initial expectations. This was mainly due to inadequate leadership at ANSVSA and weak
institutional capacity. The continuous non-performance of ANSVSA and the lack of any
concrete plan to remedy this situation led to the decision to discontinue all the activities
coordinated by ANSVSA.1 In addition to the above, the restructuring was also to allow selected
activities to be completed and a new activity added (see Section 1.6 below). The type of
restructuring can be classified both as “corrective” and “adaptive” restructuring.
8.     The revised Outcome Indicators. The new PDO and the adoption of new activities under
Component 3 necessitated a revision of the outcome indicators to: (i) increase in agri-food export
to EU 27 relative to Gross Value Added; and (ii) increase in CAP funding committed to
beneficiaries under European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and European Agricultural
Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.     MAKIS aimed to help the farming community meet relevant EU directives that would
allow them to capture the benefits of EU accession. The primary beneficiaries were expected to
be middle-sized and small farmers with the potential to become commercial. Indirect
beneficiaries included the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety (ANSVSA)
and Phyto-sanitary units through staff training, agricultural research laboratories through
modernization and reforms, Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS) recipients, and extension and
food safety specialists through training programs.

1.5 Original Components
10.     Component 1: Strengthening the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and
Food Safety (ANSVSA) and the Phyto-sanitary Units (EUR 11.38m) sought to strengthen
these institutions to: (i) implement the new food safety regulations adopted by Romania to
comply with EU requirements; and (ii) provide the necessary control and verification of fresh
and processed products to enable farmers, agro-industry and food processors to supply local and
international markets. Activities funded included: institutional capacity building; laboratory

needs under EU, Border Inspection Posts (BIPs); animal welfare; phyto-sanitary central
laboratories; and a training program.
11.     Component 2: Support for Agricultural Research (EUR 19.48m) aimed to strengthen
the capacity of the national agricultural research system (NARS) to provide agricultural
knowledge, skills and information based on the needs of the agri-food sub-sector consistent with
EU requirements. This component included: (i) establishing National Reference Laboratories
(NRLs) necessary to be functional immediately after accession for implementation of: (a) nitrates
and sludge directives, and (b) testing for Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO); (ii) a Reform
Program to assist five priority Research Institutes to become “Centers of Excellence” through
technical assistance to develop reform strategies and an investment program; and (iii)
mainstreaming of the CGS into Government (MAFRD) agricultural research funding for core
public sector activities.
12.     Component 3: Support for Advisory and Information System (EUR 8.52m) sought
to: (a) to improve the capacity of the research, extension and food safety specialists to better
serve the needs and improve competitiveness of farmers/ producers and processors in the context
of EU accession; and (b) to increase access of farmers and processors to knowledge on
technologies related to production, quality control, food safety, processing and marketing. There
were two sub-components: (i) setting up a Training and Information Center (TIC); and (ii)
improving effectiveness of advisory services.
13.     Component 4: Project Management Unit (PMU) (EUR 2.06m) aimed to provide for
project co-ordination and administration staff, procurement, financial management, reporting,
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities for all components.

1.6 Revised Components
14.    Component 1: With the exception of the completed BIPs (EUR 3.4 million), activities
under Component 1 were discontinued. Component 2 and 3: These activities remained
unchanged. One new activity was added under Component 3, i.e. support to improve the
management information systems in agricultural administration through the Integrated
Administration and Control System (IACS). This was to help Romania to ensure timely
provision of EU agriculture support funds (CAP payments). The revised components were: (ii)
Support for Agricultural Research; and (iii) Support for Advisory and Information System.

1.7 Other significant changes
15.     Other changes included the reallocation of the uncommitted loan balance under
Component 1 (EUR 6.8m) to Components 2 (EUR 6.15m) to cover increased costs of
rehabilitation works of the National Research Institutes (NRIs) and the NRLs, and to Component
3 (EUR 0.65) for the IACS, to address the most pressing issues with regard to EU acquis
compliance in the agro-food sector. The discontinuation of Component 1 and the inclusion of
new activities under Component 3 required a minor change in institutional arrangements:
MAFRD, through the PMU, became responsible for overall project management and ANSVSA’s
implementation responsibilities were halted. (See the Restructuring Papers for reallocations by
expenditure category. MAKIS cancelled a total of EUR 11.0 million from the total loan amount
of EUR 41.40 million. On project completion, an amount of EUR 3.26 million remained unused
and was cancelled, making the total amount cancelled from the loan EUR 14.26 million.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
16.     The Project was designed to help Romania with EU accession, and addressed
specific areas that had not been covered under ASSP or in ongoing EU work. ASSP had
focused on providing immediate technology based on farmers’ needs, while MAKIS was
designed to address longer-term goals such as modernizing the national agricultural research and
extension systems and harmonizing Romania’s agricultural policies and institutions in line with
accession requirements. ASSP was also not designed to deal with the significant issue of food

                                                      4
safety. MAKIS was to complement EU activities and focus on particular areas in food safety,
research and extension, and the AKIS. The Project was consistent with the Government’s
Strategy for the Development of Agriculture, Food Industry and Forestry for the medium- and
long-term (2001-2005 and 2005-2010). In view of the urgency created by the EU accession
process and client’s request for support to comply with the EU food safety regulations (as agreed
during accession negotiations) the project was prepared on a fast track (eight months to appraisal
and 12 months to Board approval).
17.     Project design reflected lessons from the Bank’s experience in agricultural support
services projects in Romania and in other countries. These included: (i) considering both
public and private sector services in designing research and extension systems; (ii) ensuring local
ownership and involving farmers in determining research agendas and priorities; (iii) enhancing
research quality through needs-based training, competitive research grants, and by involving
universities and a range of research providers; and (iv) developing methodologies to effectively
reach women and indigenous groups.
18.     The MAKIS preparation team worked closely not only with the EU, but also with
several EU member countries to draw experiences to ensure that the Project covered the
critical gaps in implementation capacity. The team reviewed compliance efforts of EU member
countries and prepared a food safety matrix comparing Estonia, Poland and Hungary. A similar
exercise was conducted for extension services.
19.    The team consulted with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including small,
medium and large-scale farmers, agro-processors, producer groups, farmers’ associations,
women groups, and NGOs. All groups displayed a high demand for information and
technology, especially to reap the benefits from EU accession.
20.     The Project introduced mechanisms to mitigate the effects of potential risks. MAKIS
focused on four priority “national institutes” that would also receive core funding from GoR, in
order to mitigate the risk of resistance to change coming from within the research community.
MAKIS also identified issues related to procurement and financial management and agreed on
corrective mitigation measures during appraisal. Although the Bank (and jointly with EC and the
IMF) addressed the risk of political instability via the continued dialogue on reforms with GoR,
frequent changes in government and the key reformers being moved aside unfortunately affected
project implementation.
21.     MAKIS failed to specify a well-structured and SMART (Specific, Measurable,
Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) PDO and a set of PDO Indicators and did not
conduct a baseline survey to help track progress of the indicators. Early on, the project
stated that the PDO indicators were difficult to attribute to the project’s activities. At appraisal, it
was agreed to do a baseline survey and use it as a benchmark against which to measure project
impact; however, MAKIS did not conduct such a survey or set up any M&E to measure the PDO
indicators (see Section 2.3 on M&E). This partly necessitated a revision of the Outcome
Indicators at restructuring.
22.     Although the team should be commended for respondin g to the government’s
urgent request to design a project to help Romania meet EU accession requirements and
preparing MAKIS in a short period for the Bank’s Board’s approval, this resulted in some
tradeoffs. MAKIS had a weak Results Framework, and in particular, it had inadequate PDO
indicators that were not easily attributable to measuring the impact of the project activities.
                                                  5
23.    The Project also did not conduct a baseline survey to help track progress of the
PDO. At appraisal, it was agreed to do a baseline survey and use it as a benchmark against which
to measure project impact; however, MAKIS did not conduct such a survey or set up any M&E
to measure the PDO indicators (see Section 2.3 on M&E). This partly necessitated a revision of
the Outcome Indicators at restructuring.

2.2 Implementation
24.     MAKIS ran into numerous problems from the time of approval in November 2004, which
contributed to severe delays in implementation, slow procurement, cancellation of activities and
the need for three project extensions (totaling 30 months) to allow for completion of activities
and contracts already procured. These factors are grouped below, in an attempt to show how they
jointly affected project achievements in several areas.
25.     MAKIS got off to a slow start. Although the Project was approved in November 2004,
it required Presidential endorsement and a legal opinion from the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to
become effective (in June 2005). However, due to a change in government and delays in
establishing the PMU, activities and operations only started in January 2006, placing MAKIS’s
implementation behind schedule from the beginning.
26.      Frequent changes in government and Ministers of Agriculture (eight in all), and the
insufficient focus on priorities in MARD affected overall project implementation. In the
early stages of implementation, this was particularly related to Component 1, where ANSVSA
had weak institutional capacity and inadequate leadership. The continuous non-performance of
ANSVSA and the lack of any concrete plan to remedy this situation led to the decision to
discontinue all the activities, and led to the cancellation of important activities in food safety. By
about 2009, it had become evident that ANSVSA lacked any conclusive enhancement plan and
ANSVSA’s performance posed a risk to achieving the PDO. ANSVSA did not follow through
on its agreement to submit a plan for future activities by January 2009. Several food safety
activities were cancelled in the first restructuring and the funds were reallocated to the other two
components. As mentioned under Section 2.1, this was unfortunate as MAKIS was to focus on
significant areas of food safety that ASSP had not dealt with.
27.    The project suffered occasionally from insufficient allocation of government funds
and in many instances from delayed allocation of funds for the project activities, which
substantially affected implementation throughout the project’s life, including during the
period prior to the financial crisis. These escalated the delays in implementation.2 This was
partly a result of the lack of commitment and government fiscal constraints. Although at
appraisal in August 2004 funds were to be allocated to cover project costs, this was not done, and
the Project lacked any financial resources (loan funds and counterpart funds) to start-up
operations.3Again, in 2008, there was uncertainty about sufficient budget allocation from MEF to
MARD for the remainder of the year, causing delays. Since the project made slower progress
than expected after the first and second restructuring, mainly due to the insufficient budget

allocation to the project in the first half of 2012 and to the frequent changes in high-level
management in the MARD, which delayed decision-making, MAKIS required a third extension
to allow for completion of contracts already procured. Although funds were allocated in August
2012 to complete ongoing contracts, new activities, i.e., to complement ongoing contracts (to
enhance their efficacy) or support the reforms in the sector of agriculture research and
development (training of the Agency for Payments and Interventions in Agriculture – APIA after
installation of the new IT hardware, printing and dissemination of Farm Standards) were further
delayed.4
28.     Two critical factors affected the government’s ability to provide counterpart
funding. First, the government suffered from serious fiscal deficits through the last years of
MAKIS implementation due to the 2008 financial crisis and the Eurozone crisis. The Project
only received a portion of the budget required at the beginning of each year and had to wait until
mid-year (for the budget ratification process) to obtain additional funding. The mid-year budget
replenishment meant a delay of six months for activities which could not be started at the
beginning of the year or a slow down until the funds were received. In addition, to mitigate the
impact of the financial crisis, the Government in 2010 imposed a 25% cut in civil servants salary,
which led to an exodus of PMU staff and difficulties in recruiting new staff.
29.     Lack of timely government decision-making combined with the lack of funds
delayed restructuring efforts. Changes in the Government in late-2009 that led to a decision
vacuum for about three months due to the lack of an authorizing environment for changes to
project activities delayed the first restructuring by over 18 months. Following the MTR, the
Bank had recommended restructuring in early-2009 and remained engaged in these discussions.
Although the Government confirmed in June 2009 that MAKIS would be restructured, the
Project was only restructured on the original closing date of September 30, 2010. This again
stalled implementation, including the processing of procurement packages. As a result, several
large construction works under Component 2 were delayed and also cancelled.
30.      Unfilled vacancies and the continued exodus of staff from the PMU affected some of
the PMU responsibilities and project implementation. At one point, the PMU was without an
M&E specialist, a research coordinator, and procurement and financial management specialists
for several months. This affected the project’s M&E. In 2009, twice- a- year progress reports
ended up being delivered one a year. Although there were complications related to signature
authority, in March 2010 the Bank recommended that the PMU at least hire an M&E Specialist
on a consultancy basis. Procurement processing was also delayed, and the PMU Director had to
fill in the procurement role on top of demanding responsibilities. The Bank also informed the
client in March 2010 of the obligation under the loan agreement to maintain a functional PMU.
31.    The Project’s first restructuring was a positive step in implementation, as it
redirected funds to better performing activities and new priorities with EU accession in
2007. The revised PDO indicator (i) on exports to EU-27 (measured by an Export Index),
however, cannot be realistically attributed to MAKIS (see Section 2.3).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.     The Project’s Results Framework included indicators to capture activities under each
component; however, during implementation, there was no reporting on the progress towards the
PDO or a system set up to monitor the PDO indicators. Although agreed on at appraisal, the
project did not conduct a baseline survey, to use as a benchmark against which to measure
progress and impact. The PDO indicators such as adoption of improved farm practices and
productivity were relevant, (although attribution might have been difficult) and would have been
relevant to measure progress towards the original and revised PDO; however, the inability to
measure and attribute these indicators to MAKIS partly necessitated dropping them at
restructuring.
33.    The Aide Memoire following the November 2008 MTR states that there were no major
issues pertaining to MAKIS’s M&E arrangements, and that M&E assessments have been
performed constantly since the project started to measure and evaluate results. The PMU and the
teams tracked regularly the progress achieved by the intermediate outcome indicators, but not the
PDO indicators because as the Aide Memoire stated, both PDO Indicators were, “impossible to
measure and insufficiently related to the PDO”.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
34.     MAKIS’s environmental rating was ‘B’. Accordingly, the Project developed an
Environmental Assessment (EA) and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). There were no
significant long-term irreversible negative environmental impacts. In addition, Romania has
very inclusive national legislation that fully transposes the EU directives with regard to
environmental protection and health and food safety measures. The potential impacts of the civil
works were recognized as local in nature and were addressed through the construction and the
permitting process. The Project’s Environmental Safeguards were rated satisfactory throughout
implementation. In October 2012, the Bank mission concluded that all works were implemented
in accordance with health and safety requirements and in compliance with the Bank’s
environmental safeguards. The mission recommended constructing a new wastewater treatment
plant at the Brasov Institute through a separate works contract.
35.     Procurement was downgraded to ‘MS’ in 2007, and to ‘MU’ in June 2008 due to the ‘U’
rating for procurement in ANSVSA and several deficiencies, i.e. delays in signing contracts in
ANSVSA beyond acceptable standards, the necessity to re-bid several contracts, and splitting of
bigger packages into smaller packages (see ISR, December 4, 2007). These also contributed to
low overall disbursements. Processing of procurement packages continued to be delayed through
2010 due to ministry and government approval procedure. The PMU’s difficulties in hiring
procurement staff further added to these problems, resulting in slow implementation during
several months of MAKIS and as late as 2012, when the Bank advised on hiring additional
procurement staff to prevent longer delays. As stated in Section 2.2, the final mission in February
2013 found that the prospects of implementation of several activities within the project’s closing
date remained questionable. The updated Procurement Plan was approved by the Bank subject to
the PMU’s assurance that prior to signing of contracts, funds from own or oth er sources would
be available. A post procurement review identified some minor issues but found contracts under
this area to be in compliance.


                                                8
36.     Financial Management (FM) arrangements remained satisfactory throughout
implementation. The counterpart contribution, however, affected project implementation.
Activities slowed again in the last quarter of 2012 due to the late receipt of the required
additional financing that was only spent partially by year end and put on hold the contracting of
several new activities.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
37.      The Government has committed to develop a comprehensive action plan aimed at
modernizing the public administration. In the agricultural sector, MADR is formulating a
comprehensive agriculture and rural development strategy, strengthening MADR management
and operational capacity and improving coordination between MADR and its subordinated
structures that will in fact also allow for a better absorption of EU funds. The Bank is assisting
MADR through Programmatic Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) to strengthen strategic
and operational management. This Technical Assistance (TA) will be in the form of four distinct
but interrelated projects, with one on Strengthening the Agri-food Sector Strategy Formulation in
the Ministry. With respect to the CGS activities, a number of sub-project types financed from
MAKIS CGS would continue to be financed from the CAP-Pillar 2. Structural reforms
undertaken in the research and development institutes would remain in place and the institutes
will continue to seek financing through competitive selection. The new provisions of the CAP
promoting the partnership for innovation (partners: farmers, research units, public
administration) would also bring new opportunities for these institutes to align their activities
with the demands of farmers. The funds for operation and maintenance of the investment
activities financed under the Project would need to be mobilized by the respective beneficiaries
(i.e. private for CGS and public for the institutes).

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
38.    MAKIS’s objectives (original and revised) are relevant to the May 2009 Convergence
Program of the Government of Romania, which has as its objective joining the Eurozone in 2014.
The agriculture policy is driven by the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the National
Rural Development Program that aim to address the significant restructuring and competitive
challenges facing farmers. MAKIS is consistent with the joint IBRD/IFC Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), July 2009-June 2013, which emphasizes raising the agriculture’s
competitiveness and helping local farmers improve efficiency through better technology.
39.      The central element of the revised PDO, to help the agro-food sector take advantage of
the benefits arising from EU membership remains valid, and the component design remains valid.
It is, however, difficult to directly attribute project activities to changes in some of the project’s
original and revised PDO indicators (agricultural productivity, agricultural income, and agri-food
exports to EU 27 relative to Gross Value Added). This is particularly the case as there is no
baseline data for project beneficiaries that would allow for before/after comparisons of
technology adoption, productivity and incomes, as mentioned in Section 2.3. The project ran into
several serious implementation issues, as described in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 5 that resulted in the
cancellation of EUR 11.00 million out of EUR 41.40 million.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
                                                  9
Achievement of the original PDO prior to restructuring (September 30, 2010).
40.     This section attempts to link how the main outputs under MAKIS (detailed in Annex 2)
were expected to benefit the designated beneficiaries and produce outcomes that enable the PDO
to be achieved. MAKIS, however, did not monitor progress towards the three PDO outcome
indicators (agricultural productivity, agricultural income, and agricultural exports) prior to
restructuring. The 9th Progress Report (June 2010) states that, “the PDO is too vaguely
formulated and is not measurable and attributable”. There are three factors that make it difficult
for this ICR to assess if Romanian farmers and agro-processors improved their competitiveness
as a result of MAKIS outputs. These are: (i) the lack of a thorough baseline survey and follow-up
monitoring of the PDO indicators (preferably of the similar households); (ii) issues with linking
project activities to macro-level variables such as productivity and incomes that are influenced
by several other variables such as relative input and output prices, infrastructure, credit resources,
exchange rates etc. For example, although about 1.3 million farmers were provided information
on CAP Pillar I and II and technologies were disseminated, it is difficult to link this to export
gains; and (iii) the fact that several MAKIS activities were significantly delayed, mainly due to
lack of budget, combined with the natural lags in observing impacts of changes in reform,
training, technology adoption etc.
41.     Due to the weakness of reporting on the PDO indicators, this ICR looks at the
achievement of intermediate outcome indicators (detailed in Annex 2) in an attempt to conduct a
fair assessment of the achievement of the PDO prior to restructuring.
42.     Component 1. Considering Romania’s commitments for EU accession, the construction
of the three Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) in Otopeni, Constanta North and Constanta South
were considered of great importance. The Project also provided funds for BIPs’ equipment. 5
Two Regional Laboratories (RLs) in Bucharest and Brasov were equipped for testing the animals
for diseases and pests and for implementation of the policy on animal welfare. As part of
building a functional phyto-sanitary laboratory network, two National Reference Laboratories
(NRLs) and 3 RLs were equipped and functional and staff trained. However, as stated in the
March 8-31, 2010 Aide Memoire, the activities initially planned to be implemented by ANSVA
under Component 1 were no longer achievable. Aide Memoires also state that the poor
implementation of Component 1 activities “posed a risk to achieving the PDO”, although at no
point was the PDO rated below an ‘MS’.
43.     Component 2 made progress towards strengthening the capacity of the national
agricultural research system to provide agricultural knowledge, skills and information to farmers
and agro-processors. At the time of restructuring, although five procurement packages for the
construction works under the research institutes had been approved with delay on the client’s
side, subsequently, MAKIS supported only four of these investment packages. The first
intermediate outcome indicator--the GMO laboratory at NRDIBH—was equipped, accredited
and fully functional and construction of the building for the soil laboratory, the National
Research and Development Institute for Soil Science, Agro-chemistry and Environment


5
 The revised amount allocated to the BIPs at the first restructuring was EUR 3.4m compared to the original of EUR
3.8m.


                                                       10
Protection (RISSA) Bucharest, was underway (see Annex 2). However, subsequently, at the third
restructuring, MAKIS dropped this activity and cancelled EUR 3.5m. The original target
indicator was not met, and it was revised to one NRL (for GMO testing).
44.      The initially identified Institutes underwent reforms, which included identifying priority
areas for research at each Institute based on its’ comparative advantage. The Institutes see project
support as critical for developing new technologies, for leveraging additional financial resources
(i.e. research grants, including European/international), for improving staff skills and for
retaining young researchers. Through the reform process, NARDI has improved the researchers-
to-auxiliary staff ratio from 1:3.3 (2005) to 1:1.9 (now), and has created a research environment
favorable for project-based teams and skills development (including through international grants).
As a result, the research institute has increased the share of own revenues to 61% of total in 2012
(from 43% in 2006), has continued to strengthen its public-private partnerships and has made
significant inroads into the research of conservation and organic agriculture in Romania, and
crop diversification, its main research themes. There were however, problems with the national
budget being unable to pre-finance the rehabilitation works, necessitating a reallocation of funds
for this activity at restructuring.
45.    On the development of new technologies, following reform of the research programs, 44
Grant Agreements (research/extension proposals) had been selected at the time of restructuring
and many of them are still under implementation. 30 new technologies had been developed (ISR
#11, October 2010).
46.     Component 3 had three 3 indicators. With respect to setting up functional Training and
Information Centers (TICs) able to train trainers, the TICs in Bucharest, Timisoara and Cluj were
fully functional. 1,900 extension consultants, 225 researchers, 400 food safety inspectors, and
5328 agro-processors/private sector were trained. The TIC in Iasi established and has started
implementing its training program.
47.    The above achievements pertain to the intermediate outcome indicators under the three
components and not to the achievement of the PDO prior to restructuring, given the lack of
information on the Project’s PDO indicators. Given the above, difficulties in attribution, and the
delays in/cancellation of activities that were expected to contribute to achieving the PDO
outcome, overall performance against the PDO prior to restructuring is rated as MU.
48.     The project cancelled EUR 11.0 million out of a total of EUR 41.4 million by the first
restructuring. Disbursement at restructuring (9/30/2010) was EUR 18.24 million or 67.22% of
the total amount disbursed (see Data Sheet, ICR).

Achievement of the revised PDO after the Level 1 Restructuring.
49.    Revised PDO indicator: (i) increase in agri-food export to EU 27 relative to Gross Value
Added. Gross value-added data for 2011 show that agri-food exports to EU 27 represented 9% of
total Romanian exports to EU 27, relative to a baseline of 3.6% and an end-Project target of
5.5%.6 Overall, Romania has experienced improving export trends since 2007. Notably primary

agriculture exports increased from 2007 onwards and imports of processed agri-food products
declined. Cereals (33%), tobacco (12%) and oil seeds (11%) dominated agri-food exports. The
overall impact is a declining trend in net food imports (see Figure 1). Since it is difficult,
however, to directly attribute this increase to activities/outputs under MAKIS, the ICR looks at
some of the complementary investments that help to lay the foundation for greater agricultural
competitiveness and exports.

50.     MAKIS activities have mainly focused on the primary agriculture sector. The project
completed the rehabilitation of three BIPs under Component 1, which can check on export
certification and hence reduce the transaction cost of exporting. Equipping the phyto-sanitary
NRLs, the Regional Reference Laboratories and the GMO lab also help towards achieving the
high food safety standards of the EU. The CGS activity has assisted in developing new
technologies that are being disseminated to farmers to promote better farming practices and
eventually raise productivity, and training of numerous beneficiaries, including farmers, food
processors and food safety specialists should increase the overall efficiency of Romanian
agriculture and the agri-food sector exports.
51.     The Research Institutes were able to develop new technologies, new varieties of plants,
develop staff skills and enhance the networking (through training and study tours, most financed
by MAKIS) leveraging additional financial resources (i.e. European/international research
grants). The institutes developed and tested over 30 new varieties of plants (cereals, potato,
sugar beet, sunflower) more resistant to adverse climate conditions (drought, rainstorms, late
freeze, etc,) and specific diseases; developed over 25 new technologies for bio-control of insects,
and reduce use of pesticides and fertilizers; developed codes for good agricultural practices,
technologies for remediation of lands polluted with heavy metals, oil and mining activities, and
nutrient management plans in Nitrate vulnerable zones to contribute to compliance with the
Romanian and EU environment requirements. These technologies are being transferred to
farmers through programs implemented by each institute.
52.    The Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS) financed projects for adaptive research and
extension. The maximum value of a grant for an adaptive research project is 250,000 Euro (80%
                                             12
of total value), and the beneficiary institution is required to contribute the balance 20%. A total
of 44 Grant Agreements were signed under the CGS. The CGS Impact Assessment of 2011
looked at 40 projects under the CGS. These included the areas of agro-environment (12), quality
control (1), introduction of new technologies and ideas (12), crisis management (1), marketing &
management (4), bio and traditional products (6) and food safety (1). Farmers comprised the
largest target group. Out of 126 technologies disseminated to the target group, 89 were perceived
as new by farmers. The main impacts mentioned by farmers were improvements in farming
practices and production and quality increases.7 Farmers reported productivity increases of 25%,
based on low starting values and a high degree of innovation and disseminated technologies.
The adoption rate was reported as 49.8%.8
53.     Under the TIC program, the project supported training as detailed in Annex 2. The
training modules developed and implemented covered specific elements related to EU standards,
new technologies related to production, quality control, food safety, and processing and
marketing. The Assessment concludes that the extension packages developed were relevant and
the modules were specific to the impact areas for most of the specialists/participants.
54.    On farmers receiving information and training on EU standards, comprehensive
information on Pillars 1 and 2 of the EU program were provided to approximately 1.3 million
farmers (against a target of 33,000). There were 11 multimedia campaigns against a target of 2.
55.     The ICR also looked at several studies on post-accession trends in Romania’s agri-food
trade.9 Agri-food imports as well as exports (intra-EU 27 and extra-EU 27) have increased since
2007 up to 2011. Net exports to EU Member States were found mainly in live animals, cereals,
oilseeds and tobacco and tobacco substitutes. The studies also look at unit values and high-value
agri-food exports. The evidence also suggests that there are several factors, including trade
policy and exchange rates in recent years that have favored high levels of exports.
56.     The above shows that MAKIS did support several activities that can indirectly contribute
to increasing exports. Since these are only intermediate steps and outcomes, and cannot be
directly linked to overall exports or agri-food export to EU 27 relative to Gross Value Added, the
ICR regards the achievement of revised PDO Outcome indicator (i) as MU.

57.     PDO Outcome indicator (ii): increase in CAP funding committed to beneficiaries under
European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) from a baseline of 90% to a target of 95%; and
European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) from a baseline of 20% to a
target of 40%. Funds committed under EAGF and EAFRD respectively increased to 99.81% and
74.65% as at February 15, 2013.10 The farmer trainings on what the EU CAP pillars 1 and 2 are
about and what activities are eligible for CAP funding, would in part have contributed to the
increased commitment in CAP funding. Notably the training reached 1.3 million farmers. The
final Aide Memoire and ISRs do not provide any details on these funds’ commitments. The
project investments helped to more easily track these commitments. Hardware provided under
MAKIS to the APIA is the core element of implementing the new EU requirements regarding the
IACS for EU-CAP funds, to improve the processing of applications for area payments, enhance
the management of farmers’ database and support the implementation of the EC-GOR agreed
action plan towards improving the administration of EU rural funds. Installation of the system
was done in December 2012 and became operational in early February 2013. It is unclear if this
activity had time to contribute to the achievement of the PDO indicator. 11 Due to the problem of
attribution, the overall, achievement of the PDO after restructuring is considered ‘MU’.
3.3 Efficiency
58.     A large share of resources under MAKIS was allocated to institutional development of
the national agricultural research and extension system. Therefore, at the time of appraisal, an
economic analysis for the whole project was not considered very useful. Due to the long-run
nature of reforms, and difficulties in linking cause and effect, the PAD focused on analyzing the
returns from 20 aggregated research and extension projects using data from the previous ASSP.
The final Impact Assessment of MAKIS, at the time of the ICR, calculated the Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) for 32 CGS projects using a discount rate of 8% (see Annex 3 for details). The
ERR calculated is 88%. Notwithstanding the benefits from the 32 CGS projects, the
transformational institutional reforms of the national agricultural research system would have
significant and lasting impact in the country.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
59.     MAKIS was relevant at the time of appraisal and continues to be relevant. Its
components were linked and applicable to the original and revised PDO, however, the PDO
outcome indicators were not well-specified, as described in Section 3.1. As presented in Section
3.2, the achievement of the PDO is rated ‘MU’ prior to restructuring on September 30, 2010, and


10
   The final Impact Assessment reports these as follows: EAGF (committed/allocated) at 94% and
EAFDR (committed/allocated) at 50%.
11
   No additional budget was allocated in October 2012 (supplementary to the budget sufficient to finance
the ongoing contracts); therefore, the start of the other activities to compliment ongoing contracts (to
enhance their efficacy) or support the reforms in the sector of agriculture research and development, but
not undermine the achievement of the project objectives, was deferred to 2013. Contracting of these
activities started and their completion was expected before the closing date, as sufficient budget was
allocated for these in 2013 (ISR #17, March 2013).


                                                   14
after restructuring. The ICR therefore concludes that the final rating for PDO is MU. In terms of
efficiency, a large share of resources under MAKIS was allocated to institutional development of
the national agricultural research and extension system and an economic analysis for the whole
project was not considered very useful at the time of appraisal. Due to the long-run nature of
reforms, and difficulties in linking cause and effect, the PAD did not conduct any other analysis
except for looking at the returns from 20 aggregated research and extension projects using data
from the previous ASSP. At the time of the ICR, the ERR calculated for 32 CGS projects is 88%
(final Assessment). The IRR in the PAD for 20 research and extension projects was 134%.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
60.    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
As stated in the PAD, MAKIS was not a poverty-focused operation, and therefore welfare
indicators were not measured. However, the Project did aim to help small and medium-sized
farmers to meet relevant EU directives and capture the potential benefits of EU accession.
61.    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
MAKIS helped to increase long-term capacity in several areas. The reform program
implemented at the four research institutes helped these institutes to obtain high ratings in their
certification, which opens up these institutes’ access to national public funds for fundamental
research. The institutes are also able to leverage additional financial resources (i.e. research
grants, including European/international) for improving staff skills and for retaining young
researchers. The implementation of the institutes’ investment program is also underway, and
should strengthen longer-term capacity.
62.     The TICs set up under MAKIS helped to set up a knowledge resource base and training
center for trainers, food safety inspectors and researchers in all EU directives. The project also
contributed to strengthening and upgrading the IACS. Training of APIA staff on the EU-
compliant IACS, although put on hold, should also further strengthen the processes for
disbursing future EU funds.
63.    (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative).
The project contributed to MARD requesting additional support through a multi-year RAS to
strengthen its ARD strategy as described in Section 2.5.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
None

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
64.     The Institutional risk to development outcome is moderate. While the reform of the
research institutes represents a critical achievement, the Government will have to safeguard the
sustainability of the research sector beyond the MAKIS project. For example, in 2010, due to
budget constraints, no training was provided to staff of these institutes. These institutes need
adequate funding in order to focus on core research activities that are considered crucial for


                                                15
achieving their overall objective to deliver the needed technologies to improve competitiveness
of Romanian farmers.
65.      The economic and financial risk to development outcome is moderate. As seen
throughout implementation, inadequate budgetary resources severely affected several project
activities and outputs. Given the economic importance and potential of the agriculture sector in
Romania, and the need to become competitive in the context of the EU, a significant increase in
public funding for agricultural research and extension is essential. MAKIS provided a step in the
right direction. For further transformation of the rural sector and to sustain the outcomes of
MAKIS, the investments needed would have a significant fiscal impact, and this remains a risk
66.     The environmental risk to development outcome is low. MAKIS’s environmental rating
was ‘B’. As described in Section 2.4, the environmental risk is considered low, due to MAKIS
not having irreversible negative environmental impacts, and Romania’s inclusive national
legislation that is in compliance with EU directives with regard to environmental protection and
health and food safety measures.
67.     The social risk to development outcome is low. A Social Assessment was done primarily
for the advisory component to establish a baseline of farmers’ knowledge and technology needs,
in order to develop the best strategies for small- and medium farmers to comply with EU
regulations. It is likely MAKIS will enhance the socioeconomic status of farmers through
enhanced technology adoption and productivity.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
68.     The Bank team responded to the Government’s urgent request to prepare a project to
address the gaps in Romania’s agricultural system in terms of EU accession. The team worked
closely with the client and with the EU to design MAKIS to cover areas such as food safety
regulations and standards that had not been tackled under the previous ASSP or in ongoing EU
work. The team took into account lessons from the previous project, identified risks, and
incorporated appropriate risk mitigation measures. The team also consulted with a broad
spectrum of stakeholders. However, this rush to respond to the client came with some trade-offs;
although the Bank’s incentives at the time of MAKIS’s preparation may not have emphasized the
need for a strong Results Framework, MAKIS could have done better in designing a better
Results Framework that clearly specified its PDO and PDO Outcome Indicators. The
Framework, as it was, was not adequate, and its’ PDO Outcome Indicators could not be easily
attributed to project activities (especially in the absence of a thorough Baseline Survey). Thus,
the impact of the project activities could only be indirectly and partially linked to PDO indicators.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
69.     The Bank remained engaged with the client throughout, however, was unable to improve
implementation in the face of frequent changes in political leadership and executive staff, and
insufficient budget allocation to the project that delayed activities all the way through. The
                                               16
former left decision vacuums for months on occasion, while the lack of funds led to cancellation
of activities and extension of the closing date by 30 months. Although as early as June 2008 (ISR
#7) the team identified the inability to attribute agricultural productivity to the project due to
exogenous factors that impact productivity, and the impossibility of relating the PDO outcome
indicators to the PDO (see ISR #8 and Aide Memoire of November 2008), this issue was not
rectified until the project was finally restructured on the original closing date of MAKIS--
September 30, 2010. The revised PDO outcome indicator (one of three indicators) relating to
exports to the EU 27 countries, as described in Section 3.2, however, cannot be reasonably
attributed to the project either. The project’s Aide Memoires and ISRs are descriptive but fail to
report or mention any progress towards the PDO for the above reasons. The PDO, however, was
never rated below an ‘MS’ over the project’s life until the last ISR.
70.     The Bank was proactive in identifying issues related to procurement, especially with
respect to Component 1 (see Aide Memoire, November 2008) earlier on in the project, and also
in recognizing and requesting correction of the updated procurement plan in November 2012.
The MTR did not conduct a post-review as the project was included in a limited overall fiduciary
review in November 2008. At that time, the financial management team confirmed that FM
arrangements were satisfactory and that control procedures were in place. In March 2010,
ANSVSA’s FM arrangements were rated unsatisfactory, and this component was discontinued.
71.     As described in Section 2.4, MAKIS’s environmental rating was ‘B’ and no significant
long-term irreversible negative environmental impacts were envisaged under the Project. The
main potential adverse impact on both human health and safety and environment was considered
by the EMP for the laboratory operations under MAKIS that may involve the use of handling and
hazardous chemical substances. In March 2010, the project faced issues about land ownership for
the new RISSA building. Therefore, the first batch of laboratory equipment procured under the
project for the nitrates and sludge testing was installed in the main building of the institute. The
procurement of the second batch of equipment (for soil testing), intended to be installed in
another, secondary building was deferred until the seismic risk assessment of that building was
completed. But, because the seismic risk assessment found structural weaknesses which could
not be addressed by the project, the procurement of the second batch of equipment was cancelled.
As mentioned in Section 2.4, the Bank recommended construction of a new wastewater
treatment plant at the Brasov Institute. At project closure, the team confirmed that
technical/engineering aspects and environmental protection and mitigation measures were
compatible with national and international practice and Bank safeguards.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. This reflects the ‘MU’ rating for both ensuring Quality at
Entry and Quality of Supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
72.    As described in Section 2.2, there were many shortcomings in GoR’s performance that
negatively impacted project’s implementation and achievements. These include the following:
although GoR engaged closely during preparation, it failed to allocate the resources agreed on at

                                                17
appraisal (equivalent of EUR2.0m in the 2005 budget to cover GoR’s contribution to project
costs), thus delaying the start of MAKIS activities. The project was approved in November 2004,
signed on January 28, 2005 but activities commenced in January 2006; insufficient and/or
delayed funding allocated to the project throughout continued to delay implementation and
introduce much uncertainty, with some activities needing to be cancelled due to inadequate time
for completion; and frequent changes in leadership, decision vacuums, and lack of commitment,
especially to major food safety activities that resulted in their cancellation, affected overall
project achievements. Notably, the financial and Eurozone crises were an unexpected factor that
impacted negatively upon the financial resources allocated to the project implementation. The
Government, however, did make reforms to the agricultural research system, which should have
long-lasting effects on Romania's research capabilities, including the enhanced ability to attract
and train researchers, and improving the dissemination of technologies to farmers.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
73.      The PMU in ANSVSA, the agency responsible for food safety was designated to
implement Component 1, while the MAFRD PMU was responsible for the other two components.
As described in Section 2.2, MAKIS activities started late, in January 2006 (while the Project
was approved in November 2004), and within one year, ran into implementation difficulties.
Project implementation was downgraded to ‘MU’ in December 2007 due to ANSVSA’s
performance. Even prior to the MTR, it had become evident that ANSVSA’s continuous non-
performance and weak capacity to provide institutional leadership was jeopardizing the
achievement of project objectives. The November 2008 Aide Memoire notes that, “over the past
supervision periods, it repeatedly appeared that PMU performance suffered from lack of
leadership from ANSVA management”. Despite discussions with the Bank on alternative
initiatives, ANSVSA did not pursue the agreed steps and completely lacked any concrete plan to
remedy the situation. This led to a restructuring to discontinue the activities coordinated by
ANSVSA (see Aide Memoire, September 10, 2009) and the termination of ANSVSA’s
implementation responsibilities.
74.      On December 3, 2009, the food safety responsibilities were transferred to the Food Safety
Agency, which was set up as an independent agency under the Prime Minister’s office. This
move made it a separate agency with the mandate to perform its professional directives to
conduct food safety and border inspection independent of any ministry. However, the new
management of this agency showed limited commitment to continue to implement the project
activities. .
75.     With regard to MAFRD and the PMU, activities started late due to the delay in
establishing the PMU. In December 2007, Project Management was downgraded to ‘MS’ due to
the lack of PMU abilities to resolve independently bureaucratic bottlenecks in ANSVSA, and
because of insufficient focus on priorities in MARD. Procurement was also downgraded due to
reasons mentioned in Section 2.4 above. Some of the delays in procurement due to the lack of
GoR counterpart funding were, however, beyond the control of the PMU. The PMU performed
the financial and accounting functions adequately, having also become familiar with Bank
procedures during the implementation of the previous ASSP. With regard to M&E, the PMU did
not conduct a baseline survey as planned at project design, and overall project M&E is weak,
also due to the absence of an M&E Specialist in the PMU for long periods of time. There has
                                               18
been no monitoring of the Project’s original or revised PDO Indicators, and the Impact
Assessment, which was discussed in 2010, was conducted only in February/March 2013 and
completed in June 2013.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. The rating reflects the ‘MU’ rating for Government
Performance and Implementing Agencies’ Performance.

6. Lessons Learned
76.    Strong attention to project implementation readiness is critical and may imply allowing
for a longer project preparation period. This includes a careful assessment of institutional
capacity and where necessary including provisions for capacity building and judicious
formulation of the project results framework and key PDO Outcome indicators.
77.    The Project indicators should be a set of Specific, Measurable, Attributable,
Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) indicators. Projects should also emphasize baseline
surveys if they are necessary to show project impact.
78.     Strong linkages between the agricultural research and extension system are critical
for the broad dissemination of technologies developed. The expected beneficiaries of the
project results need to be identified and the tangible results from practical implementation of
research outputs properly monitored.
79.   The project M&E system should be in place from the beginning of project
implementation including indicators directly related to the project objectives.
80.    In case civil works are considered, the feasibility studies and engineering designs
should be available at appraisal, to secure that the works contracts can be procured as early as
possible in the implementation calendar.
81.    The Bank actions cannot substitute for the lack of Government commitment to
properly and timely implement the project activities. Any major change in policy or
implementation arrangements affecting the project implementation should trigger immediate
project restructuring before these become real obstacles to meeting the PDOs.
82.     The stability of the project implementing unit staff, particularly the procurement
and financial management specialists, is critical for timely and quality results in project
execution. The project suffered of the poor performance of the part-time procurement staff and
financial management staff which resulted in delays in contracting and unclear/unreliable
financial evidence.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      Component 1-- Strengthening the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and
Food Safety (ANSVSA) and the Phyto-sanitary Unit. The objective of the project support was
to strengthen the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety (ANSVSA) and
Phyto-sanitary units so that they are better able to: (i) implement the new food safety regulations
adopted by Romania in compliance with EU accession requirements; and (ii) provide the
necessary control and verification of fresh and processed products to enable farmers, agro-
industry and food processors to supply local and international markets. Within the ANSVSA,
these national reference labs (NRLs) and regional labs (RLs), and the BIPS were to ensure no
breakdown in food safety, monitor and enforce food safety, maintain consumer confidence and
flag any risks of failure and corrective action.Activities to be funded included: institutional
capacity building; laboratory needs under EU, Border Inspection Posts (BIPs); animal welfare;
phyto-sanitary central laboratories; and a training program.

2.      The indicators under this component were:
(i)     Functional network of ANSVSA’s NRLs and RLs;
(ii)    BIPS to monitor food quality and the movement of animals; and
(iii)   Phytosanitary National Reference and Regional laboratories
The above indicators were less than partially met, as most of the component activities were
cancelled at restructuring on September 30, 2010.

Achievement of Outputs/Indicators:
3.      (i)    Functional network of ANSVSA’s NRLs and RLs.Establishment of National
Reference Laboratories Sub-component: None of the planned activities under this sub-
component was actually implemented. The problems related to the implementation of this sub-
component occurred mainly due to two factors: (i) initial needs to clarify ownership issues with
respect to the land allocated for the construction of the new building for the Institute for
Veterinary Hygiene and Public Health (IVHPH); and (ii) the lengthy process for obtaining all the
documentation necessary to launch the bidding process for the design and feasibility study for
the building (required in order to subsequently launch the bidding process for the actual
construction works). In addition to the implementation delays, there was a financing gap between
the project allocation for this activity (EUR 2 million) and the estimated actual cost of the
building according to the pre-feasibility study (EUR 9 million). This financing gap was indicated
to the Bank in February 2007, and no agreement on potential financing sources to cover the costs
associated with the design and construction of the IVHPH building was reached.
4.      Strengthening Regional Laboratories Sub-component: This sub-component has only been
partially implemented. The equipment required by the Bucharest and Brasov laboratories was
delivered and installed. As regards the regional laboratory in Prahova, the procurement of the
equipment under MAKIS was postponed due to building rehabilitation works that were
undertaken in order to facilitate the necessary flow of activities. In the end, although the
rehabilitation works were completed (with support obtained under the European Commission’s
Special Accession Program for Agriculture and Rural Development, SAPARD), the procurement
of the lab equipment was not launched.
                                                21
5.     (ii) BIPS to monitor food quality and the movement of animals. The project was to
provide for investments in civil works and equipment at two-three Border Inspection Posts.
MAKIS helped to construct 3 BIPs at Otopeni, Constanta North and Constanta South that are
functional.
6.     (iii) Phyto-sanitary National Reference and Regional laboratories. Phyto-sanitary Central
Laboratories: The project was to support the Phyto-sanitary Department’s two National
Reference Laboratories (NRLs) and three regional laboratories (RLs). The National Reference
Laboratories are (i) the Central Laboratory for Phyto-sanitary Quarantine and (ii) the Central
Laboratory for Pesticides Residues Control for Plants and Plant Products. Both laboratories
needed strengthening through additional laboratory and IT equipment in order to receive
accreditation. The Regional Laboratories required additional equipment in order to implement
the national monitoring programs. Activities under this sub-component were successfully
implemented. The equipment required by the Central Laboratory for Pesticides Residues Control
for Plant and Plant Products and by the Central Laboratory for Phyto-sanitary Quarantine was
purchased and installed.
7.      Animal Welfare: Implementation arrangements under this sub-component underwent
several changes relative to the original project design. Initially, this sub-component was to be
implemented through the Pasteur Institute, which was to carry out a program for animal welfare
in livestock production to demonstrate the EU-relevant requirements. This approach was dropped
in the first year of the Project, being replaced by a contractual arrangement between ANSVSA
and the MAKIS-supported Training and Information Centers (TICs) for the same purpose. In
January 2007, ANSVSA decided to conduct the animal welfare activities through its own county
offices. To this end, a detailed strategy, training plans and pertaining budget were discussed and
agreed upon by ANSVSA and the Bank. However, the only activity that was actually completed
was a training-of-trainers session that was provided by the Danish Food Safety Authority to 10
ANSVSA specialists on EU requirements and legislation on animal welfare.
8.      Institutional Building: Under this subcomponent, several activities were initiated, very
few of them being successfully completed. The bidding process for the development of an IT-
system for the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) was dropped after several
attempts were made by all concerned parties within ANSVSA to reach an agreement on Terms
of Reference and Technical Specifications to meet the ANSVSA communication needs and the
EU relevant standards. In addition, the bidding process for hiring a company to assist ANSVSA
in implementing public awareness activities was cancelled at the stage of proposals evaluation.
The proposed contract was aimed at: (i) assisting ANSVSA’ s communication and information
department in daily activities; (ii) designing and organizing several public awareness campaigns
on selected topics; and (iii) undertaking capacity building activities on communication and
public relations. Although the above mentioned contract was never concluded, part of the
ANSVSA public awareness needs were addressed through several brochures and posters that
were printed and supported with support from the Project. The brochures included guidelines for
breeders on animal welfare and protection of animals during transportation, while the posters
included constructions for border crossing points and prevention and control measures on
classical swine fever. The Project also financed a one year contract for publication of a monthly
news bulletin. As regards the training activities, ANSVSA staff and the phyto-sanitary personnel
of the MAFRD benefited of several training sessions/ study tours in other EU countries. The

                                               22
ANSVSA staff was also enrolled in the training program developed and implemented by the
Training and Information Centers (TICs) set up under the same MAKIS project.
9.      Training Program: The project was to support ANSVSA in implementing its staff training
program for information technology, while training of food inspectors was to be done by the
Training & Information Center (TIC). Training outputs planned were: 48 staff weeks training for
ANSVSA trainers (16 specialists for 3 weeks); 400 food safety inspectors trained at TIC; and
(iii) 60 ANSVSA staff was to receive international training. (i) was achieved fully; 488 food
safety inspectors were trained; and 32 ANSVSA staff were trained internationally.

10.     Component 2: Support for Agricultural Research. The objective of the agricultural
research component was to strengthen the capacity of the national agricultural research system
(NARS) to provide agricultural knowledge, skills and information based on the needs of the
agro-food sub-sector and in line with the EU requirements. This component included: (i)
establishing National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) necessary to be functional immediately
after accession for implementation of: (a) nitrates and sludge directives, and (b) testing for
Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO); (ii) a Reform Program to assist five priority Research
Institutes to become “Centers of Excellence” through technical assistance to develop reform
strategies and an investment program; and (iii) mainstreaming of the CGS into Government
(MAFRD) agricultural research funding for core public sector activities.
11.    For agricultural research and Romania’s farmers to qualify for benefiting from EU
accession, agricultural research needed to urgently address broader environmental issues and
show impact as well as to be involved in implementation of the “Acquis Communautaire” by
                                                  23
establishing NRLs for implementation of nitrates and sludge directives and GMO testing. The
project was to provide initial equipment and operating costs to enable the two laboratories to
gear-up to provide the analysis services required in respect of EU requirements. One of these—
RISSA, was dropped in the third restructuring.

12.    The indicators under this component were:

  i.   laboratories able to carry out the required analyses and meeting demand for soils (nitrates
       & sludge directives) and GMO testing;
  ii. Number of Research Institutes reformed, development of coordinated and cost effective
       system for: (a) Field Crops Research; (b) soils research; (c) development of
       biotechnology; (d) animal production systems; and
 iii. Development of technologies compatible with EU standards—(a) New technologies
       developed; and (b) Number of research contracts funded.
13.    At the third restructuring on September 21, 2012, the Results Framework was modified.
Under Component 2 , support to the construction of a new insect-proof greenhouse at the
National Research and Development Institute for Potatoes and Sugar Beet (INCDCSZ) after two
unsuccessful attempts to procure the civil works.

Achievement of Outputs/Indicators:
14.     (i) Laboratories able to carry out the required analyses for soils (for compliance with the
nitrates and sludge EU directives) and GMO testing. The GMO lab was equipped and accredited.
This lab continues to maintain the required standards to perform the qualitative analyses to assess
the status of genetically modified/unmodified crops.                   Due to the seismic risk
assessment/structural weaknesses of the building designated to host the laboratory equipment for
the National Research and Development Institute for Soil Science, Agro-chemistry and
Environment Protection (RISSA) Bucharest, procurement and installation of the respective
equipment did not take place. The equipment financed from the project and other sources was
installed in the lab accredited as the reference lab for nitrates and sludge test. The project offered
to finance the preparation of designs for structural retrofitting, for further implementation of
works with budget financing. But, unfortunately, the lack of funding prevented the contracting
of the feasibility study.
15.     (ii) Research Institute Reform Program. The National Research Institute for Animal
Biology and Nutrition (INBA) Balotesti, and the National Agricultural Research and
Development Institute (NARDI) Fundulea obtained got A+ ratings during the evaluation process
coordinated by the National Agency for Scientific Research (under the Ministry of Education,
Research, Youth and Sports) in 2011/2. The research institutes in Bucharest received an A rating
while the ones in Brasov and Stefanesti received A- ratings. These certifications are valid for 5
years for the first two, 4 years for the third mentioned above and 2 years for Brasov and
Stefanesti. This opens up these institutes’ access to national public funds for (fundamental)
research. MAKIS activities have contributed to this achievement through the implementation of
the reform programs tailored to the specificity of each institute. The reform program was based
on the “Strategy for Sustainable Development – Horizon 2025” and its’ priorities for achieving
Sustainable Agriculture and Food Industry focused on EU accession. Four priority research
programs were selected for support under MAKIS, and five priority research institutes were

                                                 24
identified to become “Centers of Excellence”. The program identified priority areas for research
based on comparative advantage. MAKIS supported international consultants to develop work
plans, research areas and training for researchers. The Institutes see project support as critical for
developing new technologies, for leveraging additional financial resources (i.e. research grants,
including European/international), for improving staff skills and for retaining young researchers.
Among 2007-11 outputs, IBNA quotes: 30 products resulting from research activities, and 15
technology transfer projects, an average success rate of about 45% in participating to calls for
proposals under national and international research programs, and a participation in some 12
internationally-funded research projects (of which about half under the European Framework
Program). Similarly, through the reform process, NARDI has improved the researchers-to-
auxiliary staff ratio from 1:3.3 (2005) to 1:1.9 (now), and has created a research environment
favorable for project-based teams and skills development (including through international grants).
As a result, the research institute has increased the share of own revenues to 61% of total in 2012
(from 43% in 2006), has continued to strengthen its public-private partnerships and has made
significant inroads into the research of conservation and organic agriculture in Romania, and
crop diversification, its main research themes.

16.     The National Research and Development Institute for Potato and Sugar Beet (NIRDPSB)
Braşov has reformed its governance, supported researcher participating in skills development
grants internationally, and received an A rating certification. These reforms have helped the
institute to develop 6 new potato varieties with special features like resistance to late blight
disease, potato virus resistance, potato with better processing quality (now with patent from the
Committee for Registration and are ready to be distributed to the farmers), and is strengthening

its partnership with the agro-food industry. The institute’s capacity was strengthened by research
equipment procured under MAKIS. The procurement of the last batch of equipment is currently
pending due to lack of approved funding.
17.    The Research Institutes’ Investment Program at three of the research institutes supported
under the project was completed in December 2012. The final mission visited the three institutes
and noted that all outstanding finishing works at NARDI, Fundulea and at NIRDPSB, Braşov
have been completed. Following works completion, the staff of the institutes started moving into
the new laboratories and offices. The procurement of the furniture for the rehabilitated facilities
at NARDI Fundulea and the waste water treatment plant at NIRDPSB (to improve the waste
management at local level) planned in fall 2012 could not be completed in absence of the
required funding but these activities are included in the plan for 2013.
18.     The works contract for rehabilitation of three buildings at the National Institute for
Animal Biology and Nutrition (IBNA) Balotesti has also been completed. However, as in the
case of the other two institutes, the lack of funding in fall 2012 did not allow for the procurement
of the independent power generator for the rehabilitated building hosting the research activities.
This equipment is to be procured before the closing date.
19.      Due to the seismic risk assessment of the building designated to host the second batch of
laboratory equipment (for general soil testing) for the National Research and Development
Institute for Soil Science, Agro-chemistry and Environment Protection(RISSA) Bucharest
identified structural weaknesses, which did not allow for procurement and installation of the
respective equipment, the project offered to finance the preparation of designs for structural
retrofitting, for further implementation of works with budget financing. But, unfortunately, the
lack of funding prevented also the contracting of the feasibility study. However, the first batch of
laboratory equipment for nitrates and sludge testing was installed in the main building of the
institute and is fully used, so the functions intended are being performed under the National
Reference Laboratory for the Implementation of the EU Nitrates and Sludge Directives. It
primarily focus on research and development in the fields of mineral and organic nitrogen
fertilization management, strategies to improve nitrogen use efficiency, livestock waste disposal
and management, monitoring of the environmental pollution caused by nitrogen losses in
vulnerable zones, production and dissemination of “Codes of Good Agricultural Practices”..
20.    While the list of research equipment for the institutes in Braşov, Baloteşti and Fundulea
was approved by MADR in 2012, their procurement has remained on hold in absence of
adequate funding and pending the adoption of the new state budget law for 2013. Only a small
number of critical equipment could still be procured for IBNA Balotesti until the closing date.
21.    (iii) Development of technologies compatible with EU standards—(a) New technologies
developed; and (b) Number of research contracts funded. Under the Competitive Grants Scheme
(CGS), funds were made available to fund any research enterprises, including National Institutes
under MAFRD, other institutes under Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences (ASAS)
and the private sector. The Operational Manual of the CGS was approved and published on
September 4, 2006. The first bid was launched in March 2007. In total, the CGS has funded 44

22.     Component 3: Support for Advisory and Information Systems. Activities under this
component sought to: (a) to improve the capacity of the research, extension and food safety
specialists to better serve the needs and improve competitiveness of farmers/ producers and
processors in the context of EU accession; and (b) to increase access of farmers and processors to
knowledge on technologies related to production, quality control, food safety, processing and
marketing in order to meet EU requirements. There were two sub-components:(i) setting up a
Training and Information Center (TIC); and (ii) improving effectiveness of advisory services.

23.      The key outcome indicators and outputs under this component were:

      (i) functional training center able to train ANCA, CJCA, CLCA, ANSVSA and private
           sector personnel, and ultimately achieve cost recovery from trainees;
      (ii) number of farmers receiving information/training regarding EU accession;
      (iii)number of multimedia information campaigns.

24.     TIC performance and agricultural advisory services: The Project Impact Assessment
examined the main objectives for establishing TICs. i.e. to improve competitiveness of
farmers/producers and processors in the context of EU accession through improving the
capacity/training of the research, extension and food specialists; and to increase effective access
of farmers and processors to database containing relevant information and research on the EU
standards in the agricultural field/food sector, information on the technologies related to
production, quality control, food safety, processing and marketing. The Assessment used final
reports from the TICs in Bucureşti, Timişoara, Cluj-Napoca and Iaşi and also information from
interviews with TIC managers, websites, and documents provided by PMU-MAKIS. TICs were
established as follows: November 2006 - USAMV Bucureşti; September 2008 – USAMV
Timișoara; October2008 - USAMV Cluj-Napoca; February 2010 – USAMV Iași.

From the established TIC’s activities, it can be observed that training was undertaken for trainers,
specialists from the field of agricultural extension/consulting, food safety and research.
According to the activity reports, training and extension packages were delivered, and training
modules emphasized areas that were specific to trainees’ agro-farming areas.
Information/knowledge was also provided on new technologies from abroad according to the EU
requirements. The following specialist’s categories were trained:

25.    The participants were selected by the representatives/staff of the beneficiary organisms –
ANCA, OJCA, CLCA, CAJ, ANSVSA, research institutes from the network of the Romanian
Academy - ASAS, representatives of some professional associations and graduate students from
the participant agricultural universities. After graduation, participants received postgraduate
study diplomas or certificates with transcripts specifying the graduated modules, the number of
study hours/module and the obtained grades(according to the education legislation, consultants
were eligible to receive such diplomas/certificates endorsed by the Ministry of Education,
because the course had a duration of more than 120 hours – for the inspectors in food safety and
researchers accreditation was done according/based to a postgraduate study certificate, because
the courses had a duration under 120 hours).

26.     Dissemination of Farm Standards: The Farm Standards elaborated under the project had
not been printed due to the lack of adequate funding. Subject to this being resolved, they would
be printed in a sufficient number of copies to be distributed to all county-based directorates for
agriculture for further dissemination to the interested farmers.

27.    Improving the existing Public Advisory System - Improving the Management Information
Systems in the Agricultural Administration. Project funds initially allocated for procurement of
software and technical assistance for improving the Integrated Administration and Control
System (IACS) were reallocated to the procurement of IT hardware (server and database) for the
Agency for Payments and Interventions for Agriculture (APIA) in December 2012 and installed
in January 2013. APIA staff completed the data migration from the old equipment to the new one,
and received adequate training to utilize the new system. The improved operational conditions
with the new server were highly appreciated by the respective staff and management.
                                                    29
28.    Training of APIA staff on the EU-compliant IACS has been put on hold due to lack of
funding. While preparatory activities to contract the training and information centers (TICs)
have been made, the contracts could not be signed given the current state budget situation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The aim of the economic analysis (EA) is to quantify the benefits generated by the
projects funded through CGS. These projects included activities of applied research and
extension. The disseminated results led to improvement of technologies and farming, increase of
marketing skills (so better access on agricultural markets) and better farm management.

Approach and Methodology

Approach

2.      The EA has been done by computing two indicators: economic rate of return (ERR) and
economic net present value (ENPV). Although, generally a financial analysis is also performed
for investments projects, for CGS this was dropped for the following reason: the financing
structure of a CGS project consists of 80% non-reimbursable funds (grants) and 20% of co-
financing (that can be both in cash and in kind). Therefore, the financial analysis would take into
account only beneficiary’s effort, i.e. 20% as the rest of 80% is subsidy and is not financed by
the respective entity. The financial rate of return (FRR) would record extremely high values and
would not reflect the real dimension of economic benefits.

3.      The ERR is also adequate for such projects (research and extension) as the analysis
follows the benefits for research and the beneficiaries’ community and not just the financial
flows, i.e. the financial profitability. The ERR refers to 100% project costs as this type of
analysis eliminates subsidies. Another reason that economic analysis is used is that it does not
include market distortions, such as grants, taxes, budget transfers, which are very common in
agricultural sector.

4.       The economic impact assessment is based on ex-post evaluation, as the projects are
already completed, with most of them finalizing their activities two years ago. Therefore a more
realistic dimension on the outcomes can be obtained. On the question of whether to a “with and
without” scenario or a “before and after” method, post evaluation has been chosen, the “before
and after” method was considered more appropriate as results can be measured.

5.    The ERR indicator is chosen as it provides a comparison basis. First, a project is
economically efficient if the ERR is higher than the discount rate. Second, the ERR allows to
compare similar projects and to see which one is better in economic terms.

6.      For CGS, the ERR will be compared with average returns on research and extension
projects. According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the average return on such
projects is 79%, and this is used as a benchmark.

Methodology

7.     The economic analysis has been performed for a panel of 32 CGS projects out of a total
of 41, which represent 78%. For the other 9 projects, the evaluation could not be done either
because they were focused on marketing, management or information systems (and it was not


                                                31
possible the quantify costs and benefits) or they did not provide accurate data. The projects
included in portfolio cover the vegetal, livestock and natural resources sectors.

The ERR and ENPV 13 (economic net present value) have been computed for each of the 32
projects. The evaluation is based on the following variables and hypothesis:

     a. Total project costs: it takes into account 100% of costs, both the CGS funding (80%) and
        beneficiary contribution (20%). The project costs have been adjusted by using conversion
        factors (see below). They include only the actual spent funds and their spread among
        implementation years, information being provided by the PMU database;

     b. Adoption: it refers rather to physical units (i.e. number of hectares, number of heads or
        agricultural production) than number of adopters. It reflects better the reality as it points
        out the units under adoption. The number of adopting farmers would have some bias, as it
        is possible that not all the agricultural area or the livestock would generate economic
        outcomes as result of the project;

     c. Operational revenues and costs: they were obtained from the calculation of specific gross
        margins. The gross margins were provided by beneficiaries in the applications, and they
        were adjusted by the Consultant during field trips and interviews with farmers;

     d. Discount rate: 8%. This rate is similar with the one used in financing applications for EU
        funds under EAFRD (i.e. funds for agricultural and rural development).

     e. Time period: 15 years.

Conversion Factors

8.      For the purpose of the economic analysis, the conversion factors have been used to adjust
the financial flows. They apply both to project costs and operational revenues and costs (gross
margins). With respect to project costs, their structure is as follows (in compliance with the
Operational Manual):
                       a. Personnel costs: max. 30%;
                       b. Operational costs: 30-40%;
                       c. Capital costs: 30-40%.

9.     Total project costs include VAT for operational and capital costs, and social contributions
for personnel expenses. Therefore, the VAT and social contributions were eliminated as they
represent budgetary transfers. On the other hands, some of the gross margins were computed



13
  The ENPV is a complementary indicator to ERR. While ERR is measured in percentages, the ENPV is
quantified in monetary units. When ERR is higher than the discount rate, then ENPV is positive.


                                                 32
initially by including the agricultural subsidies, which were also eliminated from the
computation of ERR and ENPV.

10.      The conversion factors used were:

                    0.8065 for costs that include VAT, i.e. the operational and capital costs;

                    0.7050 for personnel expenses, such that to exclude the social contributions;

The gross margins were computed free of VAT, so the only correction was to eliminate the
agricultural subsidies, where the case.

An example of how the ERR and ENPV were calculated

11.    The following analysis refers to the project implemented in the SW of Romania by a
research station that belongs to a university. The beneficiary is University of Craiova, through its
Research and Development Station from Caracal.

Overview

12.      Project objectives are:

      a. Extension of information and know-how on agricultural technologies of varieties of straw
         cereals, canola, sunflower and maize, more specifically of those varieties that proved to
         exploit to a large degree the natural potential of the area and conserve the soil fertility for
         a sustainable development of agriculture;

      b. Maintain and increase soil fertility in the long run, promote technologies that lead to a
         rational water consumption;

      c. Test and select varieties, which are the most adapted to natural conditional from project
         area, for straw cereals, canola, sunflower and maize;

      d. Develop agricultural technologies for the selected varieties, based on integrated
         management of natural resources, which is the base for obtaining sustainable
         development.

13.     The project contributed to a greater promotion of the regular operations of Caracal
Agricultural Research and Development Station. This has been obtained by working together
with large producers (companies) of seeds. This association contributed to project sustainability.
The objectives were accomplished through specific actions, such as distribution of printed
materials, workshops, and field days. It is estimated that 500 farmers participated at the actions
promoted by the Caracal Station within the project. The most significant participation refers to
the events regarding canola. According to APIA data collected for the period of implementation,
the canola increased in Olt county, i.e. the project area compared to Dolj county (which is in the
same region). It should be emphasized that at the beginning of the project, the two counties
recorded similar canola areas.

Economic Analysis

14.     As most farmers participated in events referring to canola technology, the economic
analysis was done for this crop. The analysis is based on evaluation with a “control group”. The
project area is represented by Olt County, while the control group includes the Dolj county. The
APIA data show that at the beginning of the project, the cultivated canola areas were similar in
both counties. After one year of implementation, the area starts to increase compared to Dolj,
reaching a difference of over 2,000 hectares. After the second year, the difference drops to 1,909
ha, but still the project area has more canola than the control group. Also, after the first year of
implementation, the canola area in total arable area in Olt was 8.0%, while in Dolj was 5.5%.
The share increases for both counties in the following year, with 9.3% in Olt and 6.8% in Dolj.
The total project costs are EURO 241,796, of which EURO 192,000 is CGS funds and EURO
49,796 are co-financing. These are financial costs. After applying conversion factors (CF), the
economic costs are EURO 187,646 (Table A.3.1).

15.     The analysis has been performed in Lei. For this purpose, the values in euro were
changed to lei at an average exchange 1 euro = 4.35 lei. The total costs of the project are 816,259
Lei. With respect to operational incomes and costs, the “with” and “without” method has been
used in order to compute gross margins for canola. As result, the net incremental benefit for
canola is 549 Lei/ha (Table A.3.2).

16.      As seen above, the incremental area decreases from year to year. The reason is the
following: if in 2009, the difference between the canola areas in Olt and Dolj county was 2,945
ha, in 2010 the respective difference was 1,909 ha, i.e. a decrease of 35%. It was assumed that in
the following years, the trend will be the same. This does not mean however that the canola in
Olt County will diminish, but the areas in Dolj will start increase more, as the advantages of
proposed technologies will be extended in time in the “without project” hypothesis.

18.     The ERR for the whole Competitive Grant Scheme is 88%. The ENPV is also consistent,
that is 331.8 million. Lei. At the rate of 4.35 lei for 1 euro this means an ENPV of EURO 76.2

million. If we take into account that the total value of projects included in the panel is 6 million
Euros, then we can appreciate this value as substantial.
19.     The economic analysis indicates a high economic performance of CGS. However, one
should compare the ERR of MAKIS CGS with the one from similar projects, i.e. to compare
with a benchmark. As discussed in the first part of this chapter, there are reference values in the
PAD. Many ex-post economic analyses have shown high rates of return to investments in
agricultural research and extension. According to a study conducted by Alston et al. (“A Meta-
Analysis of Rates of Return to Agricultural R&D, 1999”), the average return was 79%. The PAD
mentions that there is no evidence of declining rates of return in the following period (i.e. after
1999). Rates of return were similar across all research categories except for natural resources
research where lower rates of returns were mainly due to the longer production cycle. The rate of
return for the CGS confirms the fact mentioned above as ERR is 88%. This value is higher than
the average of 79%, showing the significant economic performance. The recorded values of ERR
and ENPV have been influenced by several factors:
         Beneficiary extension capacity. The economic results are influenced to a large extent
          by the quality and power of extension. The projects with high returns benefited from
          implementation of proper extension actions. Such projects were implemented mainly
          by the agricultural research institutes and universities. There are some exceptions.
          There is a company that promoted a project about the advantages of buffalo breeding
          for milk, which was ranked as highly satisfactory (10 points) and the ERR is 153%.
          On the opposite, there is a project implemented by the Institute for Research of Soil
          and Agro-chemistry a return of 14%. Even though the quality of research was high, the
          project lacked in dissemination of results.
         Beneficiary main activity. The evaluation of CGS showed that beneficiaries whose
          regular activity is agricultural research (institutes, stations etc.) are performing better
          than those who practice other activities as well, such as NGOs and commercial
          companies. The economic analysis confirms this outcome, the agricultural research
          institutes and stations, as well as some projects implemented by agricultural
          universities recording higher returns than average, in general greater than 100%;
         Complexity of disseminated technologies. The CGS under the MAKIS Project had a
          relatively higher degree of innovation compared to ASSP Projects. Several projects
          tried to promote some ideas and solutions that turned out to be sophisticated for the
          end users/beneficiaries. As final beneficiaries did not fully assimilate the information
          or they didn’t have enough money to implement such ideas, adoption in these cases
          was rather low, leading also to small returns. At the same time, the projects which
          promoted agricultural technologies focused on productivity increase, on obtaining
          products demanded on market, or on respecting EU standards, had greater success.
          The farmers incorporated better the information and such projects recorded high
          returns. It is also clear that projects promoting ideas with a high degree of innovation
          need a longer time frame for implementation, which is also required to adjust those
          technologies based on farmers’ feedback.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results (provided by the Borrower)

A sociologic research was conducted over the components for which it was assessed the impact:
(a) Reform Program, (b) Reference Laboratories, (c) Grant Competitive Scheme, (d) Training
and Information Centers.

Methodology

The survey envisaged the components for which it was assessed the impact: (a) Reform Program,
(b) Reference Laboratories, (c) Grant Competitive Scheme, (d) Training and Information Centers.

The scope of the survey is to obtain data and information regarding the results of the
beneficiaries as an effect of the project implementation. There were face-to-face interviews
relying on Interview Guide with the beneficiaries’ representatives or phone interviews with the
persons attended in CGS projects extension events as well as with the adopters of the research
results produced under CGS.

Research Institutes. Reference Laboratories

Objectives. Collect information and data regarding: (a) Investments under MAKIS; (b) Research
products before and after the project; (c) Dynamics of research products: tests, patents, analysis,
technologies; (d) Dynamics of clients; (e) Dynamics of incomes; (f) Dynamics of research
projects; (g) Procedures in implementing MAKIS.

Rolling. The survey was of a qualitative type relied on collecting information and data through
face-to-face interviews, into a controlled discussion following an interview guide. The targeted
population was the representatives of the institutes: general director, scientific director, project
team leader. The consultant obtained from PMU the contacts, and then the representatives were
phoned to be proposed a meeting at the institute head-office. An interview lasted between 60-90
minutes.

Panel. The survey carried out by interviewing 11 persons as representatives of eight institutes,
presented in the table below. In assessing the project impact among the institutes, there has been
introduced a control group, formed of institutes which didn’t benefit of MAKIS Reform program.
In order to be included in the Control Group, the institutes must have similar
characteristics/activities with the Project Group ones.

Therefore the following have been selected: IBA Bucharest (as it was the only remained national
institute under MADR, not part of the MAKIS), ICDLF Vidra (as it presents similar activities
with NRDIBH Ștefănești, even though not the same scientific and financial level) and ICDPP
Bucharest (similar with INCDA Fundulea). Within these three institutes there were interviewed
the general and scientific directors. Initially, within the Control Group, there were introduced
also ISPIF Bucharest (similar with RISSA) and ICDCOC Palas (similar with IBNA), but
eventually, they refused the collaboration. A request to provide activity and financial results was
sent to them, after the interview.

The Borrower’s comments on the ICR included the following: (i) that it was incorrect to state
changes in financing arrangements after 2009 affected the availability of project funding. The
Government stated that the new system, introduced in 2009 allowed for more flexibility in the
use of funds, as long as both the amounts which were to be covered from the loan and the
contribution of the state budget were provided together under the same budgetary title; (ii)
editorial changes to some dates, and also removal of a reference to political instability (to be
replaced by changes in the government); and (iii) the removal of the reference to the 18-month
delay in restructuring. These changes have been incorporated in the final ICR.

Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal

The project Modernizing the Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems (MAKIS) was
implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Rural Development (MAFRD) and, in
the initial stage, also by the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety
(ANSVSA). The Loan Agreement 4758 RO was signed in Bucharest on January 28, 2005 and
ratified through Law 175/2005, published in the Official Gazette No. 526/June 21, 2005. The
Project implementation lasted from September 2005 till March 2013.

Since the issuance of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) on the Proposed Loan (Report No
30274-RO) in October 18 2004, significant positive changes occurred in the Romanian
agricultural sector but contingent with some outcomes beneath the expectations raised one
decade ago. By that time, agriculture employed 44% of the total labor force of Romania and 70%
of the rural population was employed in agriculture. The potential for agricultural production
was considered high but productivity levels were extremely low (the productivity per employed
person in agriculture represented 6% of the average level in EU). With over 4.5 mill agriculture
holdings, the sector was inefficient, fragmented and dominated by the individual and household
farm that constituted around 70% of the farming community.

Concerning the issues addressed by the MAKIS Project, at the starting point of the
implementation, the food safety regulations and quality standards did not match EU standards,
the capacity of the AKIS was inadequate in assisting farmers and agro-food industry to meet
relevant agriculture EU directives, the public funding of the agriculture research was declining
(in 2003, the Government spent only 0.16% of the GDP on Research and Development) and the
public agricultural advisory and extension services were unable to discharge their responsibilities.
By that time, Romania was already scheduled for accession to EU in 2007. After this important
change of its European status, some of the gaps in the agricultural sector have started to diminish.




                                                46
Six years later, in 2010, the population employed in agriculture and forestry accounted a much
lower but still a consistent share (19%)14 in comparison with other EU countries (average UE-27
= 4.7%), reflecting a still low level of labor productivity15. An amount of 3.9 mill individual
holdings have farmed 54% of the utilized agricultural land while roughly only 31000 legal
holdings operated the other 46%. Despite the fact that the agricultural productivity is considered
fairly weak2 (with still low yield levels and low growth)-meaning that Romania hardly can face
the foreign competiveness, particularly EU competition. Some increases of the labor productivity
in agriculture were recorded 16 . However, productivity per employed person in agriculture in
2008 was 4 times lower than the average level in EU-2717.

Animal production tends to increase (mostly the sheep and goats sector) but overall, in the recent
years, agricultural performance seems to be continuously unstable, mostly due to the more
frequent and more severe natural calamities (drought, floods). Performance of the food industry
has increased significantly but much more remains to be done in terms of restructuring the sector
in order to attain competitiveness and meet EU food safety, hygiene and quality standards. The
recent EU scandals regarding the aflatoxins or horse meat found Romania surprisingly well
prepared to face the “food scares”, with a good impact on the public confidence.

After funding peak in 2008, followed by the sharp decrease of public allocation to research
competitive programs (due to the 2009-2010 severe economic contraction), the research and
innovation funding started slowly to grow again reaching in 2012 a similar level as in 200718.
An indication on Government determination to perform a real restructuring of the research sector
is the recent Governmental Decision 19 placing all the national research and development
institutes under the coordination of the Ministry of National Education.

Advisory and training services are still not properly developed and equipped to respond to the
needs of farmers and to help them restructure and improve their agricultural performance
(technical performance, EU food safety, hygiene and environmental standards). Recently, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has taken important steps towards the provision
of the legal frame for independent Agricultural Chambers as well the organization of the election
process for farmers’ representation. However, since the delivery of guidance and advice to
farmers is one of the key elements for a successful implementation in Romania of the Common
Agricultural Policy post-2013 program, it is expected that the still equivocal status of the public
system has to be terminated.

The signs of the timidly growth of Romanian agriculture sector as well the better performance
recorded on the scope areas of concern for the Project, namely food safety, agricultural research,
and advisory and extension, can be attributed, among many others, to the satisfactory
implementation of some MAKIS Project components.

The initial development objective of the project (PDO) was “to assist the Romanian Government
to improve the competitiveness of farmers and agro-processors in the EU accession
environment”. This was planned to be achieved through: (i) strengthened National Authority for
Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety and better implementation of measures for inspection
control, risk management and communication in food safety matters; (ii) modernized and
strengthened national research and extension system to provide staff in the food safety authority
as well as within the research and extension organizations with necessary agricultural
knowledge, skills, and technology facilities; (iii) improved technology development and advisory
services to ensure access to relevant information and technology by the farming community; and
(iv) increased access of farmers and processors to knowledge of technologies related to
production, quality control, food safety, processing and marketing in order to meet EU
requirements.

Outcomes of the project would be measured by the following key indicators: (i) increased
adoption of improved farm practices, marketing, post-harvest and food safety technologies
compatible with EU standards and (ii) improved agricultural productivity.

The results indicators for each component would be measured by: (i) functional network of
national reference and regional laboratories and BIPs established within a strengthened
ANSVSA to monitor food safety indicators and build consumer confidence, with reduced risk of
breakdown in food safety; (ii) five Research Institutes reformed, development of coordinated and
cost effective system for field crops research, soils research, biotechnology research, virus free
grapevine and horticultural planting material, animal nutrition systems; (iii) laboratories able to
carry out the required analyses and meeting demand for soils and GMO testing; (iv) development
of crops, livestock and natural resource management technologies compatible with EU standards;
(v) number of farmers receiving information/training regarding EU accession; (vi) number of
multimedia campaigns.

1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators (KI), and reasons/justification

In September 2010, the Project was subject of a restructuring process, mainly due to the
underperformance of ANSVSA and the new PDO was formulated as follows: “the objective is to
help Romania comply with the agricultural acquis and to help the agro-food sector take
advantage of the benefits and opportunities arising from EU membership”.

Parts of indicators were dropped, such as: (i) increased adoption of improved farm production,
marketing and post-harvest and food safety technologies compatible with EU standards; (ii)
increased agricultural productivity. New indicators were formulated as: (i) increase in agri-food
export to EU 27 relative to Gross Value Added and (ii) Increase in CAP funding committed to
beneficiaries under EAGF and EAFRD.

                                                48
The results indicators were maintained, yet with revised targets and a new one was brought
up:”EU compliant IACS”.

1.4. Original Components

Component 1: Strengthening the National Authority for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety
(ANSVSA) and the Phyto-sanitary units. It aimed to strengthen the ANSVSA and Phyto-
sanitary units so that they are better able to (i) implement the new food safety regulations
adopted by Romania in compliance with EU accession requirements and (ii) provide the
necessary control and verification of fresh and processed products to enable farmers, agro-
industry and food processors to supply local and international markets

Component 2: Support for Agricultural Research. It aimed to strengthen the capacity of the
national agricultural research system to provide agricultural knowledge, skills and information to
farmers and agro-processors based on the needs of the agro-food sub-sector and in the line with
the EU requirements.

Component 3: Support for Advisory and Information Systems. It aimed to (a) improve the
capacity and food safety specialist to better serve the needs and improve competitiveness of
farmers and processors in the context of EU accession and (b) to increase access of farmers and
processors to knowledge on technologies related to production, quality control, food safety,
processing and marketing in order to meet the EU requirements.

Component 4: Project Management Unit would provide for project coordination and
administration, procurement, financial management, reporting, monitoring and evaluation
activities for all components.

1.5 Revised Components

Following the Mid-Term Review Mission (November, 2008) during which the Bank noted little
progress in the implementation of the support for the Food Safety Authority, in an official
correspondence between the ANSVSA, MARD, Ministry of Finance and the Bank, it was agreed
to discontinue the Component 1 and to reallocate funds. The Component 3 was revised by
including a new subcomponent: Improving the Management Information Systems in the
Agricultural Administration.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

During the implementation, a new project Avian Influenza & Human Pandemic Preparedness &
Response was approved through the Law 57/2007 (published in the Official Gazette
183/16.03.2007) which modified the Law 170/2005 (through which the MAKIS project was
approved) in the sense that the implementation of the ANSVSA component of MAKIS (except
the sub components Support for Border Inspection Posts and Phyto-Sanitary Units, successfully
implemented by PMU MAKIS) were to be undertaken by a separate Project Management Unit
from the Authority (founded through Order of the President of ANSVSA no 1/05.01.2007). An
Order delegating the authority and competencies to the ANSVSA-PMU was signed 11 months
later, on November 16, 2007. Among other factors, the lack of the proper experience with the
Bank’s procedures of the new assigned PMU has played its role to the Component 1
                                              49
discontinuation (triggered during September 2009 mission). One of the missed targets was the
construction of a new building for the Institute for Veterinary Hygiene and Public Health
(IVHPH).

Initially, the NRDIBH Ştefăneşti made a certain progress in implementing the reform plan but
the institute’s main problem was its debt to the state budget and it could not receive further
support from the Project.

The RISSA institute had some ownership problems with the land for the new building which
were partially resolved, when it was signed a long-term lease contract with the neighboring
University for Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Bucharest to complete the area
necessary for constructing the new building. Finally, the construction of RISSA new building
was cancelled due to the delay in approval of the feasibility study.

Another missed target refers to the construction works for “insect proof” greenhouse at PSRDI
Braşov. The organized bid was single tendered. The re-launch of the bid was once again single
tenderd. During the evaluation process, the Evaluation, Selection and Awarding Committee
identified a range of non-conformities and non-compliances with the eligibility criteria of the
bidding. Finally, the submitted bid was rejected and the Bank endorsed the bidding cancellation.

The Technical Unit for the Competitive Grant Scheme was included in MAFRD structure (GD
414/March 29, 2006) and staffed accordingly. In 2010, due to the restructuring of the public
administration, MADR confined its staff, reshaped its organigram and dismantled the Technical
Unit of the Competitive Grant Scheme and for a fair progress of the planned activities; the
Project PMU took over most of the former TUCGS responsabilities.

In the same year of 2010, due to the Bank’s concerns related to the former public advisory
system decentralization (“Law on Decentralization of Selected Institutions under the Sub -
Ordination of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Rural Development through the
Reorganization of Agricultural Directorates for Agriculture and Rural Development and Setting-
up of Agricultural Chambers”), the support given to the reform of the advisory system was
dropped.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Achievements by components

Component 1: Strengthening the National Authority for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety
(ANSVSA) and the Phyto-sanitary Units

In the initial stage of the Project implementation, a pack of IT equipment was procured in June
2006 for strengthening the Communication and Food Safety Departments of ANSVSA, three
regional laboratories were equipped in DSVSA Bucharest, Prahova and Braşov and buildings
that shelter the Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) were constructed in Otopeni, Constanţa North and
Constanţa South. The construction of the BIPs was finalized in November 2006 and the EU’s
Food and Veterinary Office approved their operations. For the phyto-sanitary subcomponent,
93% of the requested equipment’s were purchased and delivered to the beneficiaries (by the end
of 2006).
                                                50
IT and laboratory equipment, training and technical assistance were provided to Phyto-sanitary
Department in MAFRD, including two National Reference Laboratories (Central Laboratory
for Phyto-sanitary Quarantine and Central Laboratory for Pesticides Residues Control for Plant
and Plant Products). Support was also provided for elaboration and printing of the brochure The
New Hygiene Package – the warranty for safe food (24,000 copies distributed to inform the
food industry processors regarding new legislation on food safety), the publication of a
monthly information bulletin addressed to the veterinarians, DSVSAs, and to the local
administration officials in general (with information on legislation in force, notifications on
outbreaks and measures to be taken in emergency cases), printing 4 brochures for the breeders
and transporters comprising guidelines on animal welfare and for the border crossing points,
leaflets and posters regarding the food and feed that may be introduced in Romania,
respectively the protection measures against classical swine fever. Several other brochures and
posters were prepared and printed within the public awareness subcomponent to support the
strengthening of ANSVSA’s communication system.

The project supported trainings and study tours for the ANSVSA staff and the phyto-sanitary
personnel of MARD: study tour in UK to the Department for Environment Food and Rural
Affairs, training on food safety organized by ABC Food Safety-UK, study tour in Bratislava for
food safety inspectors to the Food Safety Authority from Slovakia, training in France on
notification and reporting infectious diseases organized by the World Health Organization and
study tour in UK on hygiene and public veterinary health.

Component 2: Support for Agricultural Research

Establishing the National Reference Laboratories

The project provided part of the equipment and operating costs to enable two laboratories to
become accredited by the EU and also provide the analytical services needed with respect to
the requirements for implementation of the EU nitrates and sludge directives, and testing for
the presence of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). The National Reference Laboratories
(NRL) were established at National Research and Development Institute for Soil Science,
Agro- chemistry and Environment Protection (RISSA) for nitrates and sludge directives
implementation and at National Research and Development Institute for Biotechnology in
Horticulture, Ştefăneşti (NRDIBH Ştefăneşti) for GMO detection.

The National Reference Laboratory for the Implementation of the EU Nitrates and Sludge
Directives in RISSA was fitted in order to be compliant with the EU Nitrate Directive. Today
the lab is part of the Implementation Plan of the “Council Directive 91/676/EEC (called
Nitrates Directive) of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of the waters against
pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources” and continues to focus on research and
development in the fields of mineral and organic nitrogen fertilization management, strategies
to improve nitrogen use efficiency, livestock waste disposal and management, monitoring of
the environmental pollution caused by nitrogen losses in vulnerable zones, production and
dissemination of “Codes of Good Agricultural Practices”.

With Project support researchers from RISSA lab attended several training programs and
conferences regarding soil and plant analysis and data handling at International Agricultural
                                              51
Center, Wageningen - the Netherlands; the “International ESSC Conference on Soil and Water
Conservation under Changing Land Use” organized by the University of Lleida, Catalonia –
Spain; the course “Soil and Water Assessment Tools” organized by the UNESCO IHE Institute
for Water Education, Delft - the Netherlands; the Standard nr 17025–general competence
requirements for the personnel working in the calibration and testing laboratories, organized by
the Soil Service of Leuven - Belgium; laboratory equipment usage, methods for sample
collection and preparation, organized by the Soil Service of Leuven - Belgium, the training
program Solid Waste Management and Engineering in the Institute for Water Education, Delft -
the Netherlands; Environmental Soil and Groundwater Research in Van Walt Limited &
Eijkelkamp Training and Consultancy, Haslemere, Surrey – UK; Capacity building in
monitoring and assessment of erosion and nutrient losses from agricultural dominated
catchments in Bioforsk – Norway; the conference “Green5, Conference for a Sustainable
Development” in Vilnius – Lithuania; and a documentation visit at the Federal Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Waters, Vienna, Austria.

The National Reference Laboratory for GMO Detection at Ştefăneşti was fully equipped by the
end of 2007. Two consultants from ScanBi Diagnostics, Sweden were contracted for a technical
assistance mission (five days in November 2007), to verify the laboratory technological flow,
equipment calibration and for establishing the work parameters, thus ensuring the compatibility
with the European procedures for GMO detection and identification whilst one week study tour
was organized for the lab specialists at ScanBi Diagnostics AB, Alnarp, Sweden. The lab
coordinator attended a 3 weeks course organized by the University of Udine, Italy. Since 2010,
the lab complies with the requirements of the standard SR EN ISO/CEI 17025/2005 and is
acredited to perform ADN qualitative analyses to assess the status of genetically
modified/unmodified crop for soya-bean and corn.

Reform program

Five Research Institutes have been identified, at time of project appraisal, to become “Centers of
Excellence”: National Research and Development Institute for Soil Science, Agro-chemistry and
Environment Protection – RISSA (specialized on research on fertilization practices, soil surveys,
soil fertility, soil pollution and good agriculture practices), National Research and Development
Institute for Biotechnology in Horticulture, Ştefăneşti - NRDIBH Ştefăneşti (high quality
seedlings for horticulture, legume farming and decorative plants), Potato and Sugar Beet
Research and Design Institute, Braşov – PSRDI (fodder and potatoes), Animal Biology and
Nutrition Institute, Baloteşti – IBNA (profitable nutrition systems and animal safety) and
Agricultural Research and Development Institute, Fundulea - ARDI (diversified arable crop
systems). The selection of these institutes was jointly agreed upon by MAFRD, ASAS, MER as
well as the relevant stakeholders. All five institutes received in 2006 the “National Institute”
status. A team of consultants form the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) drafted and finalized
the research reform plans for each institute. Meanwhile, NRDIBH Ştefăneşti was excluded from
the Project due to its debt to the state budget. In 2009, the remaining four MAKIS supported
institutes, have successfully implemented the agreed reform program, research is responding to
priority needs of producers and agro-processors, and the role of the private sector role in
technology development and information dissemination has been strengthened.


                                               52
Laboratory and field equipment were provided and support was made available for trainings and
participation to international events. Researchers from IBNA were trained in Animal Biology
Institute from Dummersdorf - Germany; in INRA, Clermont - Ferrand-France; in Belgium’s
Gent University; in the Summer School „Linear Models and Genetical Parameter Estimation” in
Herrsching - Germany; and participated to the IVth Congres Latino-American „Phyco &
Mycotoxins” organized in Merida, Yucatan - Mexic. Researchers from PSRDI were trained in
International Potato Center in Lima - Peru; in Instituto Vasco de Investigación y
DesarrolloAgrario, Bilbao - Spain; in Walloon Agricultural Research Center, Libramont -
Belgium; and International Agricultural Center, Wageningen - the Netherlands. Researchers
from RISSA were trained in Centro Interdipartimentale di Spettroscopia di
RisonanzaMagneticaNucleare, in Università di Napoli Federico II, Facoltà di Agraria, Portici –
Italy. Several young researchers from ARDI were trained at CIMMYT, Mexico. Moreover, the
Project supported the organization of international scientific events for the institutes
(International Symposium of Biology and Animal Nutrition 2008, 2009 and 2010 in IBNA,
Conference of the European Association for Potato Research 2008 and Potato’s Day in 2009 and
2010 in PSRDI, the International Conference “Crop Biotechnologies, present and perspectives -
Genetic modified crops in Romania and the national bio-security frame” in 2009 in NRDIBH,
the XIXth National Conference for Soil Science “Evaluation and Use of Soil Resources,
Environmental Protection and Rural Development in the North-Eastern Part of Romania” in
2009 and the XVth International Congress for Fertilizers “Covering the fertilizers demand within
the context of global change: bio-fuels, climatic change and contaminants” in RISSA.

In terms of financial disbursement, the most consistent support of the Project was given for the
rehabilitation works for NARDI Fundulea building, 12 research laboratories at PSRDI Braşov
and two research pavilions at IBNA Baloteşti.

In 2012, according to the Governmental Decision 1062/19.10.2011 regarding the evaluation and
ranking methodological procedures for certification of the research units and institutions within
the Research & Development System, the national research institutions have been visited and
evaluated by independent international research teams. The evaluation process was coordinated
by the National Agency for Scientific Research under the Ministry of Education, Research,
Youth and Sports (there are 5 classification levels: A+, A, A-, B and C and only the A ranked
institutions benefit of an open access to institutional research funding). The national research
institutes supported by MAKIS Project received evaluation ranking from A- (PSRDI) to A+
(IBNA and ARDI). In all the international Evaluation Commission reports, the MAKIS Project
support was acknowledged and appreciated.

Mainstreaming the Competitive Grant Scheme

The subcomponent’s aim was to mainstream into MARD’s regular activity a Competitive Grant
Scheme (CGS), following the model implemented successfully by a former Agricultural Support
Services Project (ASSP). A number of 41 applicative research and extension projects were
financed on competitive bases, that clearly defined the beneficiaries of research results and
which were enlisted in the research priorities periodically established by the Board for the CGS,
an independent organism including representatives of the public and private sector, together with
MADR. The CGS set the foundation for new cooperation’s between farmers and the scientific

                                               53
community. 20 new technologies were introduced out of which 7 in the continuously growing
organic agriculture sector.

Component 3: Support for Advisory and Information Systems

Setting up the Training and Information Center

The Training and Information Center, as a knowledge resource base, accreditation and training
center for trainers, extension agents (agricultural consultants), food safety inspectors and
researchers in relevant EU directives, as well as new agricultural technologies, was initially
planned to be set up by linking four major Romanian agricultural universities: Bucharest
Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine (USAMV Bucharest), Cluj Agricultural Sciences
and Veterinary Medicine (USAMV Cluj), Iaşi “Ion Ionescu de la Brad” Agricultural Sciences
and Veterinary Medicine (USAMV Iaşi) and Timişoara Agricultural Sciences (USAB
Timişoara). These Universities were identified by the Government as the best option since they
are uniquely qualified. After several meetings with the parties involved in the Project, based on
the most feasible developed scenario according to the existing legislation, the option to set-up
one independent TIC in each region was accepted and specified in a General Agreement,
prepared and signed on May 8th 2006 between the Ministry of Agricultural and Rural
Development (MARD), National Agency for Agricultural Consultancy (ANCA), National
Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA), Agricultural and Forestry Science
Academy (ASAS), the agricultural universities from Bucharest, Iaşi, Cluj and Timişoara and the
MAKIS PMU.

A team of 16 trainers for food safety was trained in Van Hall Larenstein, Wageningen, The
Netherlands. Another team of 41 trainers for agricultural consultants was trained by the Danish
Agricultural Advisory Service (DAAS) in Horsens, Bygholm College, Denmark (aggregate 57
trained trainers).

A TICs database was initiated with documentation regarding the following EU regulations:
arable crops, cereals and technical plant, flax and hemp, seeds, processed fruits, tobacco, wine,
dairy products, beef meat, sheep meat.

Along the entire Project life, the total number of trainees trained and accredited in all four TICs
reached 2080 agricultural consultants, 488 food inspectors and 252 researchers. Another 5328
agro-processors and representants of the privat sector were “spilled over” trained. Once the
funding from MAKIS Project ended, the TICs staff has continued to perform with applications
on EU funded projects.

Improving Effectiveness of the Advisory Services

The subcomponent provided support for information campaigns, studies and surveys using
contracted service providers.

The first information campaign started in 2006 with editing and distributing the brochure
“Guidelines for the Farmer Program” and the leaflet “Farmer Program for any understanding:
5 important steps to be taken” in 10,000 copies each.


                                                 54
The second information campaign was initiated regarding the implementation in Romania of the
Common Agricultural Policy. Two target groups were considered: semi-subsistence farms (with
up to 8 ha arable land) and farms that have potential to become commercial (with over 8 ha
arable land). During May and June 2007, 150,000 information flyers regarding the Single Area
Payment Scheme funds were printed and distributed amongst the farmers. Also, the brochure
“Single Area Payment Scheme – The Farmer’s Guide” was printed in 250,000 copies and
disseminated to the potential beneficiaries.

Following the request of the General Directorate for Rural Development from MARD to support
the Management Authority for the National Rural Development Program (GDRD-MA-PNDR),
with the Project support, there were printed the following brochures: Practical Guide for Public
Investments (8,000 copies), Practical Guide for Other Type of Support (15,000 copies), Practical
Guide for Agro-Environment Measures (25,000), the PNDR poster (10,000 copies), Increasing
the added value of agricultural and forestry products (2,000 copies), Modernizing the
Agricultural Exploitations (2,000 copies) and Villages Rehabilitation and Development,
Improving the Basic Services for the Rural Economy and Population and Highlighting the Rural
Heritage (2,000 copies).

A high priority was given to communicate potential advantages of farmers’ participation in (i)
producer groups and (ii) agro-environmental schemes under Pillar 2 of the CAP, through a set of
commercials (audio/video spots) broadcasted via specific media local and national level channels,
with the large participation of the staff of MARD and ANCA county and local structures. The
evaluation of the impact of campaign estimated that at least 1,300,000 farmers were reached and
informed about the producer groups and agri-environmental measures.

Two national seminars (January 2008) were organized with Project’s support, one regarding the
founding of the National Rural Development Network and the other regarding the agri-
environmental measures.

A study tour was organized in 2006 to familiarize a group of ANCA, OJCA personnel and
farmer association representatives with organizational aspects (national network, central,
regional and local levels) of the Agricultural Chambers in France and Austria. The Project also
supported the procurement of IT equipment’s, vehicles and furniture for ANCA as well as the
design of a new ANCA web page.

Two international consultants were hired to work with ANCA/OJCA Working Group to finalize
the strategy to reform the public agricultural consultancy services. The international consultants
proposed 2 separate paths (i) to develop farmer organizations – agricultural chambers and (ii) to
develop advice services supply. The preferred option for development of agricultural support
services was of the “one-stop shop”, where farmers can find one single place to receive advice,
to contact inspectors and to fill up applications for EU funds. Consequently, the Project funded
the establishment of 4 (four) pilot Integrated Agricultural Offices (Tecuci/Galaţi, Mediaş/Sibiu,
Pucioasa/Dâmboviţa and Truşeşti/Botoşani), representing local ‘one stop service centers’ that
bring together, under a single roof, agricultural advisory and administration services. These IAOs
became the main service point for the filing of applications for CAP support schemes and the
access to relevant information and advice on all aspects of support programs, farm management

                                               55
and technical advice. The IAOs were supported by the Project with the procurement of IT
hardware and software, vehicles, office furniture and funding for communications and transport.

The Project also provided support for the elaboration of “farm standards” to be used as project
application appraisal material for agricultural paying agencies. The outputs of the contracted
services consists in five different handbooks on housing systems for livestock, two handbooks on
storage facilities for fodder and manure and two handbooks on construction examples for pigs
and cattle as following: Housing systems for Cattle, Construction Examples for Cattle, Housing
Systems for Pigs, Construction Examples for Pigs, Housing Systems for Poultry, Housing
Systems for Sheep, Housing Systems for Horses, Farm Standards for Feed Storage and Farm
Standards for Manure Storages. The handbooks were printed and disseminated to the interested
stakeholders.

Improving the Management Information Systems in the Agricultural Administration

The subcomponent aimed to support the review and upgrade of the Integrated Administration
and Control System (IACS) implemented by APIA to become fully compliant with EU CAP
requirements. The project supported APIA with the procurement of 100 pcs GPS top devices and
an IT high performant hardware-server and database.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

The performance indicators adopted to measure the achievement of the Project Development
Objective were (a) the increase in agri-food export to EU-27 relative to Gross Value Added and
(b) increase in CAP funding committed to beneficiaries under EAGF and EAFRD. Both
indicators marked an increase since their baseline, so that the agri-food export to EU-27
increased from 1.8% (2011) to 2.1% in (2012)20 and CAP funding committed under EAGF met
50%, exceeding the expected target of 40%, whereas, the funds committed under EAGF was
94%, almost meeting the expected target of 95%.

Many of the performance indicators proposed for each component have been met and/or
exceeded, while one fall slightly shorter than expected and another one was not achieved.
Indicators being met include: (i) four institutes reformed, (ii) two labs able to carry out analyses
and meeting demand for soils and GMO testing, (iii) 20 new technologies developed, (iv) 41
research contracts vs. 40 targeted, (v) trainers trained 36 vs. 30 targeted, (vi) food-safety
inspectors trained 420 vs. 400 targeted, (vii) researchers trained 225 vs. 180 targeted, (viii) agro-
processors and private sector trained 5,328 21 vs. 2,050 targeted, (ix) farmers receiving
information/training regarding EU accession: 1,300,000 vs. 33,000 targeted, (x) multi-media
information campaign: two vs. two targeted, (xi) GPS procured for the LPIS : 100 vs. 100
targeted. The number of extension staff trained in the Training and Information Centers was of


20
   Note: the initial baseline for agri-food export to EU-27 relative to Gross Value Added was 3.6% and the expected
result was 5.5%. Later analysis indicated the figures had to be adjusted.

   Includes the trainings carried out by ANCA afterits staff was trained under MAKIS.




                                                        56
2,040 persons vs. 2,160 targeted. There was an indicator which wasn’t met and that is the
number of 300 APIA staff trained on IACS.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The evaluation of the project summed up the components two and three performance. Sub-
components 2.a. and 2.b. Evaluating the performance of the institutes was accomplished by
comparing the institutes activity results with the activity performed prior to the MAKIS
implementation, but also by comparing them with the activity of institutes that have similar
activities (control group). In the control group ICDPP București, ICDLF Vidra and IBA
București were included. The analysis had at its basis the face-to-face discussions (interview
guide) held with the representatives of those respective institutes, financial and operational data,
and synthesis and activity reports of the institutes. Through the previously analyzed aspects and
considering the objectives mentioned in PAD, the results obtained by the institutes included in
the reform program and the reference laboratories of the project, are evaluated as Satisfactory.
The following factors represented the basis of the evaluation: (a) assured sustainability by
obtaining the “national institute” was rated as Highly Satisfactory; (b)reference laboratories
sustainability for GMO’s and nitrates was rated as Moderately satisfactory and (c) performance
of institutes included in the reform program: Satisfactory (IBNA Balotesti – highly satisfactory,
INCDA Fundulea -highly satisfactory, PSRDI Brasov - satisfactory, RISSA Bucuresti –
moderately satisfactory).
For the evaluation results of CGS financed projects (component 2.c.) four indicators considered
objective were identified which represent the financing principles in accordance with PAD.
There were analyzed 33 projects out of 41, having face-to-face open discussions (on the basis of
an interview guide) with the project director and for the confirmation of the application of
results, talks were held for each project with at least one adopter, in total 251 interviews with the
participants of the extension activities of the sub-projects results. The analyzed indicators are (a)
achieving objectives, (b) project sustainability, (c) the adoption rate of project results, (d) EU
standards. The analysis of the evaluation indicators for each project determined the component
2.c. to be evaluated as Satisfactory. It is noted that 14 CGS projects received the “Highly
Satisfactory” score.
The sub-component Training and Information Center (3.a.) was evaluated as moderately
satisfactory, being analyzed factors linked to the objectives set up accordingly: (a) bring
knowledge on agricultural technologies from the country and abroad in order to meet both the

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Effects of project impact
Sustainability of four research institutes: INCDA Fundulea, IBNA Balotești, PSRDI Brașov,
RISSA București. Through the reform program undertaken, together with the rehabilitation
financing and equipment procurement, the MAKIS program has contributed to setting the
institutes on a sustainable path, indicated by income consolidation, the accessing of new projects,
obtaining new research products.
Compliance with the EU Nitrate Directive: By successfully implementing the MAKIS program
at RISSA Bucureşti, Romania complied with the compulsory requirements of the Nitrates
Directive.
Accessing new financing programs: Through the equipment procured through the program, for
the institutes included in the program access to new programs of national and international
research was assured.
Farming consultant:. Through the projects implemented, it can be stated that another major
effect of the MAKIS program was the fulfillment of a farming consultant role, through the
technologies introduced, the events to which farmers, processors and representatives of the
scientific environment participated. Furthermore, the program passed on this role to the research
teams that worked closely with the farmers.
Consistent support in accessing Measure 214 – Agro-environment in PNDR through a CGS
project:
Funding new technologies extension, of which the most welcomed by farmers and processors
were: (a)Varieties of canola adapted to conditions in Oltenia; (b) Recipes for processing low
quality wheat; (c) Ecological varieties of wheat and sun-flower; (d) Mixed race of cattle; (e)
Apple stronger varieties; (f) Grafted vegetables; (g) Biogas use in producing energy within the
cattle farms.
Intensifying the contact between the research sector and farmers: As it was mentioned in a
previous paragraph, through the MAKIS program, for many research team was first time when
they were imposed the compulsory extension of results. Thus, through the implemented projects
the foundation for new cooperation’s between farmers and the scientific community has been set,
prompting the sustainability of many projects.
Increasing the visibility of entities to potential donor: The research teams that have benefited
from the CGS had the chance to become more visible and to present their activity to potential
donors, starting from MADR up to private companies and farms. As a result, for those respective
research entities certain analysis, tests, works are being requested, once their activity, results and
the equipment that they had was advertised. Thus, an improved image was created and presented
for the research sector, where the out-of-date image was slightly cleared up by the new
tendencies.


                                                 58
Increasing collaboration between research units: Through the obtained results and the extension
events they presented, the research units had the chance to find out what some of their other
colleagues are doing. This fact led to a series of successful collaborations in obtaining financing,
requesting analysis and laboratory tests, collaborating for the development of studies and
scientific communications.
Participating in studies and international conferences with competitive means: The research
teams that regularly develop collaborations with their counterparts from abroad have confirmed
the fact that as a result of applying the project, through the results obtained and the new
laboratory equipment, they can participate at a higher level of studies and scientific events to
which previously they could only attend as participants. ”Now we can go in Hungary with a new
image. If before 2007 we felt ashamed when we met our colleagues from Hungary, now we can
say that we actually surpassed them” (Daniela Iliescu – SCDB Arad); Similar examples are also
at USAMV Timișoara, USAMV Cluj, INCDA Fundulea, PSRDI Brașov and others.
Creation of specialist in modern training: The group of consultants / trainers acting within the
Training and Information Centers further used their experience and attracted funds from various
sources to implement training programs.
(b) Economic return
The economic analysis was calculated for the projects funded through CGS, which included
activities of applied research and extension. The disseminated results led to improvement of
technologies and farming, increase of marketing skills (so better access on agricultural markets),
better farm management. The Economic Rate of Return for the whole Competitive Grant Scheme
is 88%, proving the opportunity of implementing this sub-component. The value of Economic
Net Present Value is also consistent, that is LEI 331.8 million. At the rate of 4.35 lei for 1 euro
this means an ENPV of EURO 76.2 million. If we take into account that the total value of
projects included in the panel is EURO 6 million, then we can appreciate this value as substantial.
The economic analysis indicates a high economic performance of CGS. Many ex posts economic
analyses have shown high rates of return to investments in agricultural research and extension
and according to a study conducted by Alston et al. (“A Meta-Analysis of Rates of Return to
Agricultural R&D, 1999”), the average return was 79%. The PAD mentions that there is no
evidence of declining rates of return in the following period (i.e. after 1999). The rate of return
for the CGS confirms the fact mentioned above as ERR is 88%. This value is higher than the
average of 79%, showing the significant economic performance. The recorded values of ERR
and ENPV have been influenced by several factors: (a) Beneficiary extension capacity, (b)
Beneficiary main activity, (c) Complexity of disseminated technologies.
4. Lessons Learned
Extension of results. A number of projects targeted demonstrative lots, however they were only
limited to these lots, stating as an objective those respective lots, without trying to extend
research results beyond these demonstrations. In fact, there were projects where a major focus
was put on research and very little on extending results, the adoption rate being a collateral
element. The extension of results must be included as an activity of the same level of importance
as the actual research.
Support technologies that require governmental regulations. Research that needs further
governmental regulations for extension has difficulties in extending.
                                                59
Experience and qualification in Project Management and Extension: The lack of funds for
research has become a stereotype in the sector, through which the lack of research results is
being justified. The program offered sufficient funds (confirmed by the implementation teams),
however difficulties in spending them were noticed or the funds were spent to obtain weak
results or inexistent results for some projects, which may indicate not only the lack of funding in
research, but also the lack of ideas, management and extension of results. MAKIS represented for
many researchers a novelty regarding the requirement of extension, application of results; this
lack of experience was visible. On the other hand, “the program represented a school” for certain
research teams in the project management. Many researchers are accustomed only to do the
research and not to manage projects, which involved another set of knowledge, aptitudes and
experience. However, there is also the category, smaller, of some collectives coming from the
large institutes/research stations and agricultural universities where the implementation was
conducted properly.
Identifying adequate partners: The very good results of certain projects, with a very good impact
in applying results and which were very well received by farmers, but which were faced with the
impossibility of getting the products on the market, either because the chosen partner for
implementation did not have the necessary financial means or because the partner they chose was
not the right link in the distribution chain.
Short time period for implementation in the vegetal sector: Research from which results are seen
on longer terms, mainly in the vegetal sector, need a time period longer than 2 years to mark all
results.
Correlation between the current activity of the Applicant and the project objective: Projects that
have obtained the best results were the ones implemented by those entities, where the current
research activity is similar to the project objectives. When it is stated this way, the fact that an
entity currently conducting research activity may be able implement any research project is not
understood, but only those projects whose objectives are similar to the current activity. The
stronger the correlation between the current activity of the Applicant and project objectives is, a
much better sustainability is assured.
