IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
HAITI
EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
(CREDIT NO. 2670-HA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the EMERGENCY
ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT (EERC) in Haiti, for which Credit 2670-HA in the
amount of SDR26.8 million (US$40 million equivalent) was approved on December 20,
1994 and made effective on December 23, 1994.
The credit was closed on December 25, 1995, six days before the original closing
date, December 31, 1995. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on
June 6, 1995,
The ICR was prepared by Axel Peuker, task manager (LA3C2), and reviewed by
Robert Crown, project advisor (LA3DR).
Preparation of this ICR was initiated during an IDA mission in January 1996.
Following a change in Government in March 1996, it was continued during a mission in
June 1996. It is based on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to
preparation of the ICR with comments on the project and statistical data, and prepared a
complementary Project Completion Report, which is included as an appendix.

HAITI
EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY CREDIT
(CREDIT NO 2670-HA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.   In the aftermath of a coup d'etat in September 1991, in which elected President
Jean Bertrand Aristide was forced from office and into exile, Haiti experienced a dramatic
deterioration in economic and social conditions. After three years of military dictatorship,
a negotiated solution was reached which allowed President Aristide to return to Haiti on
October 16, 1994, and on November 7, 1994, Parliament confirmed the appointment of a
new constitutional Government. At that time, Haiti was in a state of economic and social
emergency, characterized by debilitated institutions, large macroeconomic imbalances, a
severely dilapidated infrastructure, depleted productive assets, alarming social indicators,
and pervasive poverty.
2.    In November 1994, the Government prepared an Emergency Economic Recovery
Program (EERP) in close cooperation with IDA, IDB, IVF, specialized agencies of the
United Nations, and USAID, building on the work of a first multi-agency mission in June
1993. The objective of the EERP was to provide for basic emergency needs through
import finance, civil works, and technical assistance. This program, together with the
reactivation of ongoing projects, for which the Government received initial pledges of
some US$1.2 billion, provided the main stimulus to growth during 1994/95.  On
December 19, 1994, Haiti's arrears to multilateral agencies of US$82 million were
eliminated, allowing IDA, IDB and IMF to resume their operations. This paved the way
for the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC), IDA's key initial contribution to
the EERP. The Credit was approved by the Board the following day, on December 20,
1994, and became effective on December 23, 1994.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.    The objective of the EERC was to provide urgently needed balance of payments
support to reactivate Haiti's economy and initiate the economic recovery process in the
context of the overall EERP. Specifically, the EERC was designed as a quick-disbursing
emergency operation which would finance the CIF value of imports based on a positive list
identified as necessary to the EERP. Within the confines of a positive list, EERC funding
was not earmarked for specific sectors or activities. The project objective was clearly
relevant in view of the binding balance of payments and budgetary constraints which the
country was facing. While the overall recovery program was ambitious, the specific
objectives of the EERC were modest and attainable.



- Iv -
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
4.    The project was highly successful in achieving its objectives. It rapidly provided
the country with the required external financing to initiate the economic recovery, and was
fully disbursed by June 1995, six months earlier than expected.  The EERC also
demonstrated the commitment of the international community to the Government's effort,
thus sending an important confidence-building signal to the private sector in Haiti. In
addition, the policy dialogue accompanying the preparation of the project, helped to set
the stage for a medium-term economic policy reform program. The EERC was further
instrumental in establishing a successful Central Implementation Unit (CIU) for emergency
projects.
5.    The contribution of the EERC needs further to be viewed in the context of the
performance of the overall recovery program. Initial donor commitments of US$1.2
billion exceeded by far the estimated requirements of US$402 million for the EERP and
US$261 million for arrears clearance, humanitarian aid and governance. In the course of
Haitian fiscal years 1994/95-95/96, commitments for Haiti's development even increased
to over US$2 billion. The level of disbursements over the first two years amounted to
over US$1 billion, also exceeding expectations.
6.    As a result of the recovery program, together with sound economic policies,
Haiti's economic performance in 1994/95 was encouraging. Real GDP growth amounted
to 4.5 percent, consumer price inflation declined from 52 percent by end-September 1994
to 18 percent by end-September 1995, and the Gourde recovered from over G20/US$
during the emergency to G14.5/US$. The Government also proceeded to implement
important structural reforms along the lines of its "Framework for a Sustainable Economic
Recovery," which accompanied the EERC.
7.    Sustainability of the project and program achievements is closely linked to the
sustainability of economic reform and recovery in Haiti. In spite of a six month hiatus
following a change in Government in October 1995, Haiti's economic reform program is
on track. The economic recovery in Haiti remains fragile, but there are signs of a revival
of private sector interest. Nonetheless, as in many post-conflict societies, it is likely to
take years until political stability will be ensured and the loss in welfare recuperated.
8.    The performance of IDA through the project cycle is rated highly satisfactory.
Overall, IDA demonstrated strong commitment, responsiveness and flexibility in
preparation and implementation of the project. The performance of the borrower was fully
satisfactory. Its participation in the preparation was highly satisfactory, which was
reflected in the speed with which the operation was designed and made effective.
Implementation, too, was highly satisfactory, as reflected in rapid disbursements.
Compliance with covenants was satisfactory, even though the aforementioned change in
Government led to delays in the preparation of the audit and the comments on the project
for this ICR.



- v 
9.    The outcome of the project is considered to be highly satisfactory. The EERC was
presented to the Board within two months after the return to constitutional rule, and
within a day of clearance of Haiti's arrears to IDA. It was fully disbursed within six
months after Board approval. It fully achieved its objectives, and the objectives were
highly relevant to address Haiti's state of emergency.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERA1TIONS AND KEYLESSONS
LEARNED
10.   The implementation record of the project was highly satisfactory due to (i) simple
project design; (ii) strong commitment by the Government; (iii) satisfactory management
by the Government's Central Implementation Unit together with the Ministry of Finance;
and (iv) technical assistance provided by IDA.
11.   The EERC was part of an emergency assistance strategy by IDA to provide basic
goods and services to address urgent needs and initiate the rehabilitation of priority
infrastructure. As the restructuring of ongoing operations took longer than expected, IDA
decided to launch another emergency-type operation, the Employment Generation Project,
which focused on labor-intensive works. To sustain the economic recovery, IDA is
emphasizing the need for sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. To this
end, IDA is currently preparing a policy-based Second Economic Recovery Credit (ERC
II), preceded by a Second Technical Assistance Project (TAP II) which was approved on
September 17, 1996.
12.   The crisis in Haiti was comparable to other emergency situations in post-conflict
societies for which the World Bank Group has provided support through emergency
recovery operations. The key lessons learned from this operation confirm that projects of
this type can work well if they have well-defined objectives and a simple design. For the
rapid preparation and successful implementation of this emergency recovery operation,
strong Government commitment and very close communication proved essential. Another
critical factor for the success of the EERC was its focus on most immediate needs. This
indicates that medium-term development issues should be addressed in follow-up
operations, and emergency operations themselves should not be seen as a mechanism to
achieve those objectives. At the same time, however, the experience with the EERC
suggests a pay-off for initiating a medium-term policy dialogue during the preparation of
emergency operations.  A final major factor in this operation was flexibility and
responsiveness by IDA in the preparation of this operation. Nonetheless, the extent to
which emergency recovery operations should focus on financing critical imports relative to
implementing rehabilitation works should be judged in the context of the overall
emergency program addressing the various needs of a post-conflict society.

EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
(CREDIT NO. 2670-HA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
INTRODUCTION
1.   In the aftermath of a coup d'etat in September 1991, in which elected President
Jean Bertrand Aristide was forced from office and into exile, Haiti experienced a dramatic
deterioration in economic and social conditions. After three years of military dictatorship,
a negotiated solution was reached which allowed President Aristide to return to Haiti on
October 16, 1994, and on November 7, 1994, Parliament confirmed the appointment of a
new constitutional Government. At that time, Haiti was in a state of economic and social
emergency, characterized by debilitated institutions, large macroeconomic imbalances, a
severely dilapidated infrastructure, depleted productive assets, alarming social indicators,
and pervasive poverty. Already during 1980-91, the population had suffered a continuing
decline in its standard of living, with real GNP per capita falling by about 2 percent per
year. Between 1992-94, Haiti's real per capita income declined at a multiple of this rate,
to well below US$250 -- making Haiti by far the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere.
2.    Following the return to constitutional rule, the first priority of the Government
was to address the overwhelming economic crisis. To this end, it: (i) prepared an
Emergency Economic Recovery Program (EERP) to provide for basic emergency needs
through import finance, civil works and technical assistance; (ii) cleared its external
arrears; and (iii) initiated measures for an economic policy reform program.
3.    In November 1994, the Government prepared the EERP in close cooperation with
IDA, IDB, IiMF, specialized agencies of the United Nations, and USAID, building on the
work of a first multi-agency mission in June 1993. This program, together with the
reactivation of ongoing projects, for which the Government received initial pledges of
some US$1.2 billion, provided the main stimulus to growth during 1994/95.  On
December 19, 1994, Haiti's arrears to multilateral agencies of US$82 million were
eliminated, allowing IDA, IDB and IMF to resume their operations. This paved the way
for the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC), IDA's key initial contribution to
the EERP. The Credit was approved the following day, on December 20, 1994, and
became effective on December 23, 1994. On March 31, 1995, the Government entered
into a stand-by arrangement with the IMF, reflecting its commitment to economic policy
reforms as outlined in its "Framework for a Sustainable Economic Recovery," which
accompanied the EERC (see Appendix B).

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.    The objective of the EERC was to provide urgently needed balance of payments
support to reactivate Haiti's economy and initiate the economic recovery process in the
context of the overall EERP. Specifically, the EERC was designed as a quick-disbursing
emergency operation which would finance the CIF value of imports based on a positive list
identified as necessary to the EERP. The imports were to support emergency activities in
all sectors covered by the EERP. Within the confines of a positive list, EERC funding was
not earmarked for specific sectors or activities and would finance imports of consumption
or capital goods for both the public and the private sectors.
5.    The project objective was clearly relevant in view of the binding balance of
payments and budgetary constraints which the country was facing. While the overall
recovery program was ambitious, the specific objectives of the EERC were modest and
attainable.
ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
6.    The project was highly successful in achieving its objectives. It rapidly provided
the country with the required external financing to initiate the economic recovery, and was
fully disbursed by June 1995, six months earlier than expected. The proceeds of the credit
were utilized within the confines of the positive list as follows: 25 percent for industrial
equipment and spare parts; 24.7 percent for petroleum products; 17.7 percent for
infrastructure equipment; 6.1 percent for health and nutrition products; 5.3 percent for
agricultural equipment and inputs; 4.2 percent for power generation, and 17.7 percent for
mniscellaneous products.  The EERC  also demonstrated the commitment of the
international community to the Government's effort, thus sending an important
confidence-building signal to the private sector in Haiti. In addition, the policy dialogue
accompanying the preparation of the project, as reflected in the policy letter, helped to set
the stage for an economic policy reform program transcending the immediate
preoccupation with the emergency.  In the context of the EERC preparation, the
Government also established a Central Implementation Unit (CIU) in the Office of the
Prime Minister, which became a key agency for the implementation of ongoing IDB
emergency projects and IDA's Employment Generation Project.
7.    The contribution of the EERC needs further to be viewed in the context of the
performance of the overall recovery program. Initial donor commitments of US$1.2
billion exceeded by far the estimated requirements of US$402 million for the EERP and
US$261 million for arrears clearance, humanitarian aid and governance. In the course of
Haitian fiscal years 1994/95-95/96, commitments for Haiti's development even increased
to over US$2 billion. The level of disbursements over the first two years also exceeded
expectations (text-table 1). However, in some key sectors, disbursements in the first year
were slow.  In part, this reflected the extreme weakness of the corresponding line
agencies. It also, however, reflected the fact that project restructuring proved more
difficult than expected.

Haiti's economic performance in 1994/95 was encouraging. Real GDP growth amounted
to 4.5 percent, consumer price inflation declined from 52 percent by end-September 1994
to 18 percent by end-September 1995, and the Gourde recovered from over G20/US$
during the emergency to G14.5/US$. Central Government current revenues reached 7
percent of GDP in 1994/95, compared to 3 percent in 1993/94, while current expenditure
amounted to about 11 percent of GDP. Capital expenditure of the public sector, nearly all
of which financed with external grants and concessional loans, amounted to 7 percent of
GDP, compared to less than 1 percent in 1993/94. As anticipated, the current account
deficit soared to about 20 percent of GDP as a result of the largely donor-financed
recovery effort. Imports increased dramatically to US$430 million, whereas exports
recovered more slowly, reaching US$85 million. In spite of the large current account
deficit, net international reserves exceeded by far the initially programmed level of about
US$70 million.



9.    The Government also proceeded to implement a number of structural measures.
Petroleum subsidies were eliminated and all public sector wage contracts signed with the
unconstitutional Government established after May 11, 1994 were canceled. The sales tax
was extended to cover services. The first phase of the trade reform was put into effect:
the 40 percent export surrender requirement and the remaining restrictions on imports
were eliminated; the import valuation basis was changed to the market exchange rate; and
import tariffs were essentially reduced to the 4-19 percent range.  The reserve
requirements applicable to commercial banks were unified, and the statutory ceilings on
interest rates were eliminated. To facilitate private sector development, the Government
entered into an agreement with the IFC to increase efficiency of key public enterprises
through private sector participation in management and ownership. In this context, the
Government established an independent privatization unit under the Office of the Prime
Minister. It further reduced staffing in the public electricity company and raised tariffs as
envisaged. Also, the Government moved quickly to establish a Presidential Commission
for Growth and Modernization with representation from a wide range of private sector
interests. The principal objective of this commission, is to develop a framework
conducive to private sector development.
10.   Following a hiatus in the economic reform effort during the last 4 months of the
term in office of President Aristide, and delays in the implementation of donor projects
which resulted in a slow down in economic activity, economic performance recovered
again under the successor-President Preval, who took office in February 1996.
Nonetheless, real GDP growth for 1995/96 is estimated to have reached only 2 percent,
and inflation to have remained at 16 percent by end-1995/96. Also, in spite of slow
progress in the area of private sector participation in public enterprises, the key reforms
envisioned in the "Framework for a Sustainable Economic Recovery" have been or are
being implemented.
IMPLEMENTATION RECORD
11.   The implementation record of the EERC was highly satisfactory due to (i) simple
project design; (ii) strong commitment by the Government; (iii) satisfactory management
by the Government's Central Implementation Unit together with the Ministry of Finance;
and (iv) technical assistance provided by IDA.
12.   As a balance of payments operation, the EERC was compatible with the very weak
institutional capacity of the Government.  It benefited considerably from  strong
Government commitment. The Minister of Finance followed personally very closely the
preparation and ratification of the project. It was presented to Parliament and ratified in a
record time of only two days after Board approval. Incidentally, it was the first project
ever to be approved by a democratically elected Parliament in Haiti's history. The CIU
and staff assigned from the Ministry of Finance supervised the eligibility of goods
imported by public or private entities. While the EERC did not include a technical
assistance component, IDA assisted the Government in its implementation through



supervision by staff and the assignment of a procurement specialist to help in the review of
invoices and the preparation of withdrawal applications.
PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
13.   The recovery program supported by the project appears to have taken hold. In
spite of the hiatus referred to above, the Government's economic reform program is on
track. The Government recently agreed on a three-year Policy Framework Paper, and on
October 18, 1996, the Board of Directors of the IMF approved an ESAF arrangement for
1996/97-1998/99. A policy-based adjustment operation, the Second Economic Recovery
Credit (ERC II) is currently under preparation by IDA, and is expected to be formally
negotiated by end-December 1996. The economic recovery in Haiti remains dependent on
donor assistance, and vulnerable to political developments, but there are signs of a revival
of private sector interest. Nonetheless, as in many post-conflict societies, it is likely to
take years until political stability will be ensured and the loss in welfare recuperated.
IDA PERFORMANCE
14.   The performance of IDA through the project cycle is rated highly satisfactory.
Overall, IDA demonstrated strong commitment, responsiveness and flexibility in
preparation and implementation of the project. This is reflected, for example, in the speed
with which the EERC was presented to IDA's Board of Executive Directors following
arrears clearance, and in the decision to authorize exceptional retroactive financing of 50
percent of the credit amount for eligible imports effected prior to Board approval. IDA's
decision to take advantage of the EERC preparation to engage in parallel on a policy
dialogue on medium-term reforms also facilitated the sustainability of the recovery
process. IDA's contribution would have been further enhanced through more rapid
project restructuring.
BORROWER PERFORMANCE
15.   The performance of the borrower was fully satisfactory. Its participation in the
preparation was highly satisfactory, which was reflected in the speed with which the
operation was designed and made effective. Implementation, too, was highly satisfactory,
with the Ministry of Finance and the CIR demonstrating a strong commitment to ensure
rapid disbursement of the Credit. Compliance with covenants was satisfactory, even
though a change in Government led to delays in the preparation of the audit and the
comments on the project for this ICR.
ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
16.   The outcome of the project is considered to be highly satisfactory. The EERC was
presented to the Board within two months after the return to constitutional rule, and



- 6 -
within a day of clearance of Haiti's arrears to IDA. It was fully disbursed within six
months after Board approval, six months before the expected closing date. It fully
achieved its objectives, and the objectives were highly relevant to address Haiti's state of
emergency. In the context of the overall EERP, it alleviated the import financing
constraints and helped initiate the recovery. It also established IDA's role in the policy
dialogue, and, through the program it supported, allowed the country to move from
overcoming the emergency to addressing medium-term objectives.
FUTURE OPERATIONS
17.   The EERC was part of an emergency assistance strategy by IDA to provide basic
goods and services to address urgent needs and initiate the rehabilitation of priority
infrastructure through this credit and the restructuring of ongoing operations. As the
restructuring of the ongoing operations took longer than expected, IDA decided to launch
another emergency-type operation, the Employment Generation Project, to create 40,000
jobs per month from September 1995 to early 1997. Unlike the EERC, this operation
focused strictly on labor intensive works, and did not need to include further balance of
payments support. To sustain the economic recovery initiated with the help of the EERP,
IDA is emphasizing the need for sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.
As already envisioned in the policy letter accompanying the EERC, IDA is currently
preparing a policy-based Second Economic Recovery Credit (ERC II). This operation is
supported by a recently approved Second Technical Assistance Project (TAP II), which
was presented to the Board together with the World Bank Group's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) on September 17, 1996.
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
18.   The crisis in Haiti was comparable to other emergency situations in post-conflict
societies for which the World Bank Group has provided support through emergency
recovery operations. The key lessons learned from this operation confirm that projects of
this type can work well if they have well-defined objectives and a simple design. For the
rapid preparation and successful implementation of this emergency recovery operation,
strong Government commitment and very close communication proved essential. This
implied higher than average staff resources being devoted to preparation and supervision.
Judging by the delays in restructuring ongoing projects, which needed to reconcile
emergency and medium-term objectives, another critical factor for the success of the
EERC was its focus on most immediate needs. This confirms that reconstruction itself
should not be seen as a mechanism to achieve medium-term objectives, which should be
addressed in follow-up operations. At the same time, however, the experience with the
EERC suggests a pay-off for initiating a medium-term policy dialogue during the
preparation of emergency operations, to take advantage of the good-will created by a
rapid donor response.  A final major factor in this operation was flexibility and
responsiveness by IDA in the preparation of this operation. This included streamlining
review procedures and, in particular, allowing exceptional retroactive financing of 50



percent of the credit amount, which provided timely foreign exchange resources to rapidly
finance critical imports. Nonetheless, the extent to which emergency recovery operations
should focus on financing critical imports relative to implementing rehabilitation works
should be judged in the context of the overall emergency program addressing the various
needs of a post-conflict society.

(DTS26.800.000) consistant en un appui a la balance des paiement et au Budget de la
R6publique.
Objectifs du Programme.
L'objectif du Programme etait d'initier des reformes institutionnelles et de politique g6nerale afin
d'am6liorer le fonctionnement de l'Etat, de parvenir a une croissance durable dans un contexte
macro-6conomique stable, et de reduire la pauvrete et les in6galites sociales.
Ce Programme est decrit dans la lettre du Ministre de l'Economie et des Finances de la Republique
d'Haiti au President de la Banque Mondiale en date du 18 Novembre 1994.
Ruts du projet 2670-0-HA
Le but du projet etait de fournir un appui d'urgence n6cessaire a:
*     La reactivation de l'Economie HaYtienne,
=     La mise en place du processus de recouvrement de cette Economie,
et,
*     La stimulation immediate de la croissance economique.

Parlement le 23 D6cembre 1994 et le premier d6caissement a pour date de valeur le jour suivant.
Cette efficacite a ete principalement due au climat de grace qui a entoure le retour du President
Aristide.

Toutes les parties concernees 6taient intimement convaincues du fait qu'il fallait aller vite compte-
tenu de l'etat de d6labrement dans lequel se trouvait 1'economie du pays apres les trois annees du
coup d'6tat:
Du c6te de la Banque Mondiale, les repr6sentants et 6missaires ont collabor6 avec une
efficacit6 et une comprehension qui m6ritent d'etre soulignees.
Du c6t6 du Gouvemement, les responsables et representants n'ont m6nag6 ni leurs efforts,
ni leur temps, pour arriver a mettre en place ce programme dans les meilleurs delais.
Du c6te du Parlement, qui etait en vacances, les membres de la Chambre des Deputes et du
Senat se sont r6unis des publication de la convocation a l'extraordinaire et ont ratifi6
l'Accord de Cr6dit avec c6lerit6.      N
Ex6cution du Contrat.
Le contrat a ete execut6 dans les d6lais et conditions pr6vus initialement. L'assistance de la firme
"CARRINT", engag6e par la Banque Mondiale pour realiser la compilation des documents de
douane devant servir de base aux demandes de d6caissement, a 6t6 d6terminante en ce qui concerne
la facilit6 et la rapidit6 avec lesquelles ces decaissements ont et effectues.
De meme, la coop6ration des membres des diverses missions de la Banque Mondiale, a ete complete
et sans faille.
Le fait que les documents justificatifs des importations 6ligibles aient ete compiles par une firme
ind6pendante specialisee choisie par la Banque Mondiale a ete certainement la principale raison du
climat de confiance qui explique la rapidit6 avec laquelle les decaissements concemant l'Accord de
Credit 2670-0-HA ont ete effectu6s.
En raison de son efficacite. cette maniere de proceder meriterait d'etre retenue,

Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President
Intemational Development Association
Washington, D.C 20433
A FRAMEWORK FOR A SUSTA INABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY
Dear Mr. Preston
1.   The Republic of Haiti has suffered through a long period of economic decline and
political instability. This period was marked by high inflation, rising poverty and a critcl
deterioration in the ability of the state to provide basic services. On the occasio of the
return of President Aristide and the restoration of a constitutional government, we bave the
opportunity to begin anew. Out first and fundamental objective is the restoradon of law and
order within the country, the amelioration of social conditions, and the resusction of the
economy in the context of the Emergency Economic Recovery Program (EERP). Onec this
has been assured, our economic objectives will focus on policies that wifl impfe the
functioning of the state, achieve sustainable growth in a stable macroeconomic context, and
reduce poverty and social inequalities. I would like to take the occasion of this letter to
outline an economic policy framework for the next twelve to eighteen months, deigned to
ensure the sustainability of the economic recovery process supported by the EERP.
EMERGENCY ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
2.   In 1993, a multi-agency task force, including panicipation by the Internatinal
Development Association (IDA), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other
multilateral organizations, laid out the basis of our EERP which we are beginning to
implement, taking into account the findings of the recent up-dating mission. This progm
has identified about USS394 million of budgetary/balance of payments support, techni
assistance and emergency measures to be carried out uver the next twelve to eihteen
months. It focuses on social programs directed at poverty alleviation, repair of basic



infrastructure, protection of the environment, support for private sector development andi
restoration of key central government functions. We estimate quick-disbursing funds of at
least US$130 milion will be required during the first year, in order to restore the functions
and services of the central government. A small part of the program, amounting to about
US$28 million, is aimed at providing technical assistance to help reorganize the public sectoi,
strengthen economic management and assist in carrying out the EERP. Of the remaining
USS236 million for sectoral programs, nearly two-thirds involve expenditures for labo)r
intensive works. In the social sectors, our activities will be aimed at improving the supptr
of basic supplies, such as drugs and school books, increased staff training, and targetecd
programs of nutrition and maternal and child health. In infrastructure, our objective is tci
rehabilitate existing infristructure which has been neglected in the past, including roads,
water supply, ports and electric power. In order to carry out the EERP as expedidously a*;
possille, an emergency implementation unit (EIU) will be established linked to the officc,
of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will provide general oversight of the EERP,
supported by a Steering Committee including the Ministers of Finance and Planning, ancl
the Governor of the Central Bank. Also, existing sectoral implementation arrangements vwll
be utilized, and all sectors of the Civil Society will be invited to participate in the
implementation process.
3..  We hope that this program will attract support of multilateral and bilateral donors.
The proposed Emergency Economic Recovery Credits of IDA and 1DB will be impotan
contnrbutions which will permit us to finance critical imports for the private and public sector
under the umbrella of the EERP. We intend to make a full report on progress on the
EERP, and discuss additional financing needs, during the forthcoming Consultative Group,
meeting in early 1995.
4. In addition to the emergency measures described above, the Government will need
external support in the areas of governance and humanitarian assistance, as well as funds
to clear Haiti's arrears. To clear arrears with the multilateral lenders, a support group
meeting chaired by the U.S. Treasury has been convened, and a financing plan for the
clearance of these arrears has been established. The Government of Haiti has allocated
US$13 million of its own funds to this effort, and we expect the clearance of arrears to be
effected soon.
MACROECONOMIC STABILITY
5.   In order to ensure a stable and productive environment for the private sector, we are.
taking steps necessary to stabilize the economy. Working with the IMF, we are identifying,
measures necessary to contain the overall public sector deficit. We are also taking steps to
reduce monetary growth based on credit by the Central Bank, and expect overall inflation
to be substantially reduced in 1995. Ceilings on interest rates will be abolished so as to
effect market determined interest rates on loans. The Government will at the same time
explore ways to revitalize the system of credit unions and broaden access to credit. We hope
to finalize our overall macroeconomic program in the next few weeks and reach agreement
with the IMF on a new Stand-by Arrangement by early 1995. This agreement will outline



-3-
our objectives for monetary growth, the public sector deficit, and external accounts, within
the objective of reducing inflation and laying the basis for economic recovery.
THE ROLE OF THE STATE
6.    The past decade has seen a marked deterioration in the ability of the state to provide
basic services. While public sector employment increased considerably, government revenues
declined, resulting in a deterioration of services, particularly in the social sectors. At the
same time, the Government expanded its reach into the productive sectors through public
enterprises, which preempted private investors. We are committed to refocus the role of
the state on its legitimate functions of providing security, justice, basic economic
infrastructure and essential social services targeted at the poor. To do this, we must make
some fundamental changes in the way the state operates.
7.    Revenues. Tax evasion, avoidance and corruption have become endemic, and we
estimate that the tax to GDP ratio has fallen to 4 percent in 1994, one of the lowest in the
world. We intend to raise this ratio at least to the level of 8 percent of GDP attained in
1991. The priniary focus will be on tax administration and compliance. First, overdue
payments to the Treasury will be collected and steps taken to reduce tax delinquency.
Second, the high cost of tax collection, relative to revenues generated, will be reduced
through budget reallocations, administrative reforms and staff training. Third, in view of the
high concentration of tax payments on a few entities, we will immediately establish a unit
specializing on the largest taxpayers. This will improve the ability to cross-check fiscal
information with the customs administration as well as within the internal revenue
administration. Fourth, we want to broaden our tax base, specifically through including
professionals. Finally, steps will be taken to eliminate bribery and corruption in tax and
customs administration.
8.    Expenditures. The level of public expenditures has been so eroded by inflation that
the Government is unable to adequately discharge most of the basic functions that are the
proper responsibility of the public sector. Furthermore, the current pattern of public
expenditures is inappropriate in view of the urgent needs of the social sectors. The
Government intends to make major steps to improve delivery of health, nutrition and
education services. Particular focus will be given to increasing non-salary operating and
maintenance expenditures, including medical supplies and equipment, school textbooks and
supplies, and targeted nutrition programs. High priority will be extended to augmenting
allocations throughout the public sector for maintenance and operating expenditures, so as
to prevent further deterioration in the stock of infrastructure. We will also undertake a
major review of the public sector investment program, focusing on high priority rehabilitation
investments in infrastructure. Our overall objective is to have a significant increase in public
sector investment in fiscal year 1995, consistent with our overall macroeconomic targets
which will be outlined in the IMP Stand-by Arrangement. At the same time, the
Government will eliminate unnecessary and wasteful expenditures, particularly by eliminating



4 -
spending from discretionary accounts and fraudulent employment practices, and tly
introducing procurement procedures that ensure accountability.
9.    Civil Service Reform. We intend to transform the civil service to make it an efficiernt
instrument for the delivery of services to society. To this end, cmi service management will
be improved, the size of the civil service reduced, and the level of professional competence
increased. Personnel management practices will be revamped to make processes
transparent, clear criteria and qualifications for employment will be established, and more
up-to-date personnel records will be assembled. Voluntary separation and early retiremert
schemes wil serve as a means to eliminating redundant employment. The phasing of thM
cil service retrenchment will depend critically on the financial means available to thc.
Govenmnent to cover up-front costs. In order to attract qualified people to the civil
service, part of the medium-term savings realized from the above programs wull be used to)
increase key salaries. On a pilot basis, and to improve the effectiveness of government
services, we will start decentralizing some positions and functions to the local authorities.
10.   Democratization of Asset Ownership. State control of substantial productive asset;
has resulted in mismanagement and corruption and imposed serious political, economic anm!
financial costs on Haiti's society and economy. The consolidation of a democratic order anm!
the desire to foster economic growth and efficiency compels the Government to dispose of
these assets.
11.   The intended comprehensive divestiture needs to be accompanied by this
inplementation of an appropriate regulatory framework and anti-trust legislation. To
prment undue concentration of wealth within the country, the Govemment will seek out
foreign investors, members of the Haitian Diaspora, and small domestic savers. Additionally,
arrangement will be made to ultimately transfer part of the ownership to traditionally
excluded segments of society, including the victims of the unconstitutional rule. To further
support the redistribution objectives, the Government will give priority to investing proceed;
from the divestiture so as to benefit the poor, including in infrastructure, low-cost housing,
and a permanent trust fund for education and health.
12.  International Trade. The country's exchange system is free of restrictions and
transactions are taking place at the free (Interbank) market rate. The Government i;
committed to continue this policy and to allow the Central Bank to purchase foreigu
exchange only for its operations.
13.   While steps have been taken in the past to reduce effective protection, our trade:
regime compares unfavorably to that of many other countries, and thwarts our goal of
achieving a competitive and open economy. In addition to having many different rates and
exemptions, the import duty structure is too high and encourages contraband and corruption,
and benefits domestic monopolists. High tariffs on agricultural products particularly raise
the price of food for the poor. To correct this situation and promote economic efficiency,
the Government plans to eliminate the remaining quantitative restrictions and move towards



the elimination of all tariffs except for those on a small number of sensitive goods including
rice, corn, beans and sorghum. The tariff reform will be phased so as to facilitate the
transition to a free trade regime with a view to a concurrent reduction in the relative tariff
dispersion. In conjunction with the tariff reform, the system of import valuation wil be
modified and moved to the free market exchange rate, and the duty-free franchise sytem
will be reviewed to eliminate abuses. To reduce uncertainty, the respective legislation will
be submitted to Parliament by early 1995. We will ensure that these reforms take place in
the context of a viable fiscal regime. To this end, we already revised taxes for petroleum
products and eliminated the implicit subsidy by making sales to the private sector at the
market exchange rate.
14.   Any revenue losses from the trade reform will further be offset by implementing
higher excise duties on luxury consumer goods, alcohol, tobacco, and automobiles. As we
undertake the liberalization process, we will also negotiate with our major trading partners
better access to their markets, including maximum favorable treatment with respect to
quantitative restrictions and tariffs for the next ten years. In addition, the Government
intends to mobilize international assistance to improve the competitiveness of the agricultural
sector, particularly focusing on rice production. The legislation incorporating the tariff
reductions for agricultural products would be introduced concurrently with measures to
support this sector.
15.   Poverty and the Social Sectors. Regretfully, Haiti remains the poorest country in the
western hemisphere. While a strong and sustained recovery of growth will do much to raise
incomes and provide employment for the poor, this must be complemented with effective
programs in health, nutrition and other social services that will eliminate the worst
manifestations of poverty, and provide a safety net for those most affected by the current
severe recession in the Haitian economy.  As stated above, we will make a major
reallocation within our budget to increase the funding for health, education, nutrition and
other social programs, although we hope that some of these expenditures will be financed
by foreign grants as well. We intend to revitalize the Economic and Social Fund, instituting
more flexible procedures and seeking additional external financing. We appreciate the role
of grass roots organizations and NOOs in delivering essential services, and will continue to
count on their support. To more effectively integrate these organizations in our effort to
alleviate poverty, we would like to request that IDA and IDB undertake a Poverty
Assessment, to assist in the formulation of social development and poverty alleviation
policies and programs.
AID COORDINATION
16.   We sincerely appreciate the support of IDA and IDB, as well as other multilateral
and bilateral agencies during the recent transition period. We recognize, however, that steps
are necessary to improve our aid coordination efforts, in order to ensure that aid funds are
used to maximum effect and that aid projects are consistent with implementation capacities



-6-
and avaiable counterpart funds. We look forward to the forthcoming Consultative Group
Meeting for Haiti in early 1995 as an opportunity to further explain our program and
objecdves, and to dicit support from the donor community. In addition, we intend to
develop, with the staff of the relevant multilateral agencies, a Policy Framework Paper (PFP)
which will lay out in more detail our policy objectives descnbed here and a timetable for
their implementadon. We hope that the PFP would provide the basis for a future dialogue
on adjustment lending from MDA, IDS, the IMP and other donors.
