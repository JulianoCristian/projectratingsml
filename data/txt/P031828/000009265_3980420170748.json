{"cdata!": "This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Emergency Economic Recovery Credit\n            (EERC) in Haiti. The objective of the EERC was to provide\n            urgently needed balance of payments support to reactivate\n            Haiti's economy and initiate the economic recovery\n            process in the context of the overall Emergency Economic\n            Recovery Program(EERP) . The project was highly successful\n            in achieving its objectives. The performance of\n            International Development Association (IDA) through the\n            project cycle is rated highly satisfactory. The performance\n            of the borrower was fully satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned from this operation were: (i) for the rapid\n            preparation and successful implementation of this emergency\n            recovery operation, strong government commitment and very\n            close communication proved essential; (ii) judging by the\n            delays in restructuring ongoing projects, which needed to\n            reconcile emergency and medium-term objectives, another\n            critical factor for the success of the EERC was its focus on\n            most immediate needs; (iii) reconstruction itself should not\n            be seen as a mechanism to achieve medium-term objectives,\n            which should be addressed in follow-up operations; and (iv)\n            a final major factor in this operation was flexibility and\n            responsiveness by IDA in the preparation of this operation."}, "docdt": "1996-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
