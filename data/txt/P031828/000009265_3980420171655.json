The imports will support emergency activities\n            in all sectors covered by the Program. Within the confines\n            of the positive list, EERC funding will not be earmarked for\n            specific sectors or activities, and will finance imports of\n            consumable or capital goods by both public and private entities."}, "docdt": "1994-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
