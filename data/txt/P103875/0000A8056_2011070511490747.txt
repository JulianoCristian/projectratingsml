                         The objectives of the additional financing grant are to (i) restore basic services and rebuild priority public infrastructure in the affected municipalities and
                         villages, (ii) support local economic recovery and development in the municipalities that have suffered the heaviest damage, and (iii) provide technical
                         assistance to and build the capacity of municipalities to mitigate the impact of the hostilities on municipal finances (within the broader context of developing the
                         municipal sector).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the project is on track. Despite difficult working conditions in 2007 and during the first half of 2008, the reconstruction or repair of damage municipal infrastructure (under
                         Component 1) received the highest priority during the early years of project implementation in order to address the population's most pressing needs and is now substantially
                         completed. Implementation is now concentrating on local development (Component 2) and capacity building activities (Component 3). Because the time and efforts required to carry

                         Government of Lebanon (GOL). A partial extension limited to Components 2 and 3 of the FMIP Grant was granted to complete the final deliverables by project's closing date

                         (December 30, 2011). The momentum observed during the mission should ensure that the development objective of the Grant be fully achieved.

                         Both the revised implementation plan and the project management performance are satisfactory. The procurement of the physical work is complete. The procurement processes for
                         Components 2 and 3 are now well advanced and reaching final completion. The disbursement is increasing substantially as the contractors are in the execution phase of the 16 local
                         development projects funded under Component 2 (for a total amount of US$9 million). The capacity building activities under Component 3 are now functional (Municipal Observatory)
                         or have entered the dissemination phase (Municipal Finance Cell Studies).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As the extension of the Grant closing date will favorably impact the delivery of the development objectives, and as the reallocation among categories does not modify the current
                         overall allocation or the project design, the Bank has responded favorably to the GOL request to extend the Grant closing date to December 30, 2011.
