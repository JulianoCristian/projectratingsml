                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the additional financing grant are to (i) restore basic services and rebuild priority public infrastructure in the affected municipalities and villages, (ii)
                         support local economic recovery and development in the municipalities that have suffered the heaviest damage, and (iii) provide technical assistance to and build the
                         capacity of municipalities to mitigate the impact of the hostilities on municipal finances (within the broader context of developing the municipal sector).
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is now complete. Physical reconstruction (Component 1) was the first priority and the first component to be completed, with a total of 213 contracts. The Local
                         Development Projects (Component 2) and the Capacity Building Activities (Component 3) haveencountered delays, notably in Southern Lebanon as regard the local development
                         projects, which led to the extension of the project. These two components are now completed.

                         capacity building activities implemented under Component 3 are complete (Municipal Observatory and Municipal Finance Cell Studies) .

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Grant Closing Date was first extended to December 30, 2011 in May, 2011 in order to favorably impact the delivery of the development objectives. Given the delays experienced
                         on the local development projects in Southern Lebanon, the Government of Lebanon requested a final four-month extension of the Grant Closing Date limited to the local
                         development projects component. This request was granted. The project loan will be closed on April 30, 2012, with all components completed.
