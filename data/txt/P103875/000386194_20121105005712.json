Some lessons learned includes:\n            keeping the scope of the project straightforward and simple\n            while including some forward looking, developmental\n            elements, and allowing for maximum feasible flexibility of\n            implementation greatly facilitates successful implementation\n            of projects of such nature. The project's design\n            included flexible and adaptable elements that helped it\n            thrive in difficult circumstances and laid the groundwork\n            for continued improvements to municipal finances and overall\n            municipal strengthening. Taking advantage of existing\n            implementation capacity and extending the life of an already\n            proven and tested Project Completion Unit (PCU) rather than\n            creating new structures, helped improve the success of the\n            project in a difficult environment. This project built on\n            what was already there and working, rapid response from the\n            Bank project staff based in Lebanon for a large part,\n            contributed to the success of project. They were able to\n            quickly respond to problems when they arose and facilitated\n            project restructuring as needed. The success of the project\n            is linked to the overall effort that was sustained over\n            time, in a context of political turmoil and uncertainty.\n            Whilst focusing on emergency needs, the project was also\n            able to address capacity building issues and to set the\n            basis for effective municipal strengthening and\n            decentralization. It also contributed to improving the life\n            of people on a daily basis. Such an approach can only be\n            developed and implemented over time as it is essential to\n            establish meaningful reforms and achieve concrete progress\n            on the ground. The short time allotted to the preparation of\n            emergency operations, coupled with a rapid preparation\n            process may require further development of the monitoring\n            and evaluation framework at the early stages of\n            implementation. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            framework is a key element of the project design which can\n            only be well apprehended and developed after the initial\n            steps of implementation of emergency reconstruction\n            projects. It then can be at the core of project monitoring."}, "docdt": "2012-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
