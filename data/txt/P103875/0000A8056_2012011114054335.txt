                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the additional financing grant are to (i) restore basic services and rebuild priority public infrastructure in the affected municipalities and
                         villages, (ii) support local economic recovery and development in the municipalities that have suffered the heaviest damage, and (iii) provide technical
                         assistance to and build the capacity of municipalities to mitigate the impact of the hostilities on municipal finances (within the broader context of developing the
                         municipal sector).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has entered its completion phase. Physical reconstruction (Component 1) is now fully completed. There are no pending projects and the temporary/final handovers are
                         completed for the 213 contracts. The Local Development Projects (Component 2) and the Capacity Building Activities (Component 3) are in their final stages. However, several local
                         projects have encountered delays, particularly in Southern Lebanon.

                         The procurement of the physical work is complete. The procurement processes for Components 2 and 3 are reaching final completion but are still delayed. The disbursement is
                         increasing substantially as the contractors are in the execution phase of the 16 local development projects funded under Component 2 (for a total amount of US$9 million). The
                         capacity building activities under Component 3 are now functional (Municipal Observatory) or have entered the dissemination phase (Municipal Finance Cell Studies).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Grant Closing Date was extended to December 30, 2011 in May, 2011 in order to favorably impact the delivery of the development objectives. Given the delays experienced on
                         the local development projects in Southern Lebanon, the Government of Lebanon has requested a final four-month extension of the Grant closing date limited to the local
                         development projects component. This request is now under review.
