                    LB – ADDITIONAL FINANCING GRANT FOR THE
                    FIRST MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT

                                               P103875

                                       Grant TF057505-LE

                                       Restructuring Paper

1.      The Bank’s Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Trust Fund for
Lebanon (TFL) on September 7, 2006, with a transfer of US$70 million from IBRD
surplus1 following the July 2006 hostilities. To help alleviate the severe impact of the
conflict on municipalities, an ADDITIONAL FINANCING GRANT FOR THE FIRST
MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT (FMIP-AFG - P103875) from the TFL
for US$30 million was approved on November 3, 2006.

2.     The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to extend the LB – ADDITIONAL
FINANCING GRANT FOR THE FIRST MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
closing date and reallocate the FMIP-AFG proceeds as follows:


Category of Expenditure                         Allocation                       Percentage
                                                                                  Financed
          Current                      Current2        Revised                     Current
    (no revisions made)                                                      (no revisions made)
    (1) Goods                       US$600,000    US$525,000                        100%

3.     Overall, the project is on track. During the early years of project implementation
the reconstruction or repair of damage municipal infrastructure (under Component 1)
received highest priority in order to address the population’s most pressing needs.

  See Board of Directors Resolution IDA/2006-0176/2. The transfer from surplus was subsequently
approved by Board of Governors Resolution 580 of September 20, 2006.

  Following an earlier reallocation approved on July 21, 2010, these are the current allocations.
Similarly, the capacity building activities (Component 3) have also been fully delivered.
The launch of the Local Development investments (Component 2) had, however, been
intentionally postponed to fully concentrate the local implementation capacity on the
most urgent activities until the emergency work was sufficiently advanced. Because of
the political uncertainties and security conditions experienced in 2007 and 2008, the time
and efforts required to carry out the agreed scope of work were much greater than
initially anticipated. As a result of the delays faced during the initial stage of the project,
and in response to a request by the Government of Lebanon (GOL), the Bank approved
on December 16, 2009 an 18-month extension of the Grant’s closing date. This additional
time allowed for the completion of emergency reconstruction work and advancing the
more complex implementation of the municipal investments. As the project enters in its
final phase, there are now only 15 ongoing works contracts aimed at reviving the local
economy, fostering social integration and promoting local development, which will need
a little more time to reach completion.

4.      The remaining scope of work, though small, was delayed because of the
municipal elections which took place in May 2010. As a result of the election process,
some adjustments were required to respond to the request of the incoming municipal
authorities. However, the changes in the design and work contracts were kept to the
minimum limiting the negative impact on the overall project performance.

5.      Although the FMIP-AFG has been previously extended for an 18 months period,
there is a solid rationale to favorably consider this second extension of the Grant closing
date, in order to ensure the completion of the ongoing local development investments.

6.      Based on the progress observed, it is estimated that the outstanding work would
require about six to eight months to be fully executed. Because the time needed to
complete the work extends beyond the current FMIP-AFG closing date (June 30, 2011),
the GOL has requested (Letters from the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Finance
dated December 17, 2010 and December 22, 2010 respectively) a second extension of the
FMIP-AFG closing date until December 30, 2011. This adjustment would allow to fully
reap the FMIP-AFG expected development outcomes.

7.       Both the revised implementation plan and the structure of project management are
satisfactory and will ensure that the development objective of the FMIP-AFG be fully
achieved. While disbursement was slower than expected, the ratio remained stable as the
project shifted to the more complex local development components. All the procurement
processes are now substantially completed. With project implementation reaching its
final stage and all operational costs identified, the reallocation of grant proceeds becomes
necessary in order to fund the reduced staff of the Project Management Unit (PCU) over
the extension period and supervise the work for a timely delivery of the project benefits.

8.     More specifically, the proposed reallocation would allow covering the financing
requirements of Components 3, as costed in its Procurement Summary Table (Annex 1 of
the Project Paper). There will be no additional activities added to the project
implementation schedule. Based on the project implementation status, the initially
estimated amount of US$1.0 million allocated under the Project management costs will
no longer be sufficient. As all the expenditures are now identified and there are no more
uncertainties, it is proposed to transfer the US$75,000 from the Goods Category and
US$150,000 from the Works Category to increase the Project Management Category
(Category 4), from US$1.0 million to US$1.225 million.

9.     Consequently, the proposed extension would have no impact on the current
program design and the proposed reallocation of funds stays within the Board of
Directors approved costing parameters of the FMIP-AFG, as described in the Project
Paper, with the total cost of works estimated at US$27 million and split as follows:
Component 1 (US$18 million) and Component 2 (US$9 million).

10.     The Project Team concurs with the Government’s request as the Project
objectives continue to be achievable, and the implementation performance is rated
satisfactory. Moreover, the Government of Lebanon has prepared a specific action plan
and detailed schedule, to fully reap the Grant’s expected outcome. There is no
outstanding audit and all the audits submitted are unqualified.
