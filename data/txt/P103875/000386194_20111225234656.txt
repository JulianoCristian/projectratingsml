SUMMARY
1.      The Bank’s Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Trust Fund for
Lebanon (TFL) on September 7, 2006, with a transfer of US$70 million from IBRD
surplus following the July 2006 hostilities. To help alleviate the severe impact of the
conflict on municipalities, an Additional Financing Grant for the First Municipal
Infrastructure Project (P103875) from the TFL for US$30 million was approved on
November 3, 2006. The proposed changes to the Project, TF057505, P103875, as
requested by the Borrower in their letter dated November 28, 2011, are as follows:

   (i) A reallocation of grant proceeds among categories; and
   (ii) A four-month extension of the Grant’s closing date from December 30, 2011 to
        April 30, 2012.



PROJECT STATUS
2.      Overall, the project is on track. The reconstruction or repair of damaged
municipal infrastructure (under Component 1) and the capacity building activities (under
Component 3) are completed. Sixteen local development projects under Component 2 are
still not completed, however, and are at risk of remaining incomplete for lack of
investment funds at the municipal level. The remaining procurement progress and
financial management activities remain satisfactory. Project management is rated
moderately satisfactory. Despite adverse conditions during most of its implementation
phase, the Project is still achieving its Development Objectives and Implementation
Progress moderately satisfactorily. The project objectives remain relevant and are largely
achieved: basic services have been restored; priority public infrastructure has been
rebuilt; and an increased share of the municipal budgets is now allocated to investments;
the ratio of municipal revenues over Government transfers has been reduced significantly
and a Municipal Observatory has been established. Following the additional delays
experienced during the period June – September 2011, all remaining local development
projects are now under execution and progressing well.

3.     The Grant, in the amount of US$30 million, was approved on November 3, 2006,
and declared effective on November 29, 2006. The project was restructured three times,
mainly to account for the delays associated with the volatile situation in Lebanon,
coupled with changes in municipal governments in 2010. The first restructuring
(amendment) took place in December 2009, and extended the Grant’s Closing Date from
December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2011. A second restructuring was done in July 2010 and

                                           -4-
entailed a reallocation of grant proceeds. The third restructuring was done in June 2011
and entailed an extension of the Grant’s Closing Date from June 30, 2011 to December
30, 2011 and a reallocation of Grant proceeds.

4.     At this stage, 100% of the Grant is committed with all the outstanding activities
already procured. As of December 20, 2011, disbursements amount to 93.74% of the
Grant amount. There is no outstanding audit and all the audits submitted are unqualified.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Reallocation of Grant Proceeds:
5.       The proposed reallocation is necessary in order to effectively maintain the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) for a longer duration than originally envisioned and which is
required to deliver the municipal investments. The reallocation will ensure funding of the
reduced staff of the PCU over the extension period to carry out proper supervision of all
works remaining for a full delivery of the local development projects. All the
procurement processes are now substantially completed. There will be no additional
activities added to the Project implementation schedule. Based on the project
implementation status, the estimated amount of US$1.225 million allocated under the
project management costs will no longer be sufficient. Given that most of the
expenditures under the Civil Works Category will not be needed, it is proposed to
transfer US$150,000 from the Civil Works Category (Category 2) to increase the Project
Management Category (Category 4) by US$100,000 from US$1.225 million to US$1.325
million and also to increase the Goods Category (Category 1) by US$50,000 from
US$525,000 to US$575,000 to cover the costs of a pending goods contract under one of
the local development projects (Municipality of Makneh).

Closing date:
6.      An extension of the closing date is being sought from December 30, 2011 to April
30, 2012. In accordance with OP 13.30, the team confirms that: (a) the project
development objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the
implementing agency is satisfactory; and (c) an action plan has been prepared by the
implementing agency and agreed with the Bank to ensure successful completion of the
Project.

7.     The original Project (an IBRD Loan for US$80 million) was approved in June
2000. An Additional Financing of US$30 million was approved in November 2006,
whereby the original Project Closing Date was December 31, 2008 and that of the
Additional Financing was December 31, 2009. The proposed restructuring would bring
the cumulative closing date extensions of the Project to 40 months.

8.      Under OP 13.20, additional loans must close within three years from the closing
date of the original Project at the time of Additional Financing. However, in exceptional
cases the Bank may consider extending the closing date of an Additional Loan beyond
this three year limit. According to paragraph 15 (n) of the "Processing Additional
Financing: Guidance to Staff" dated 1/24/2011, "when implementation of the additional
loan activities is delayed because of a factor that is clearly external to the operation and
outside the control of the borrower or implementing agencies (e.g., delay in additional
loan effectiveness, natural disaster, major political change), the task team may request an
extension of the closing date for a period that is equal to the delay due to the responsible
factor. The RVP approves such a request." In the case of the FMIP, OP 13.20 clearly
applies as project implementation was greatly affected by political uncertainties and
deteriorating security conditions throughout the implementation period from 2007-2011.
This included a series of events related to political instability and security incidents
which were outside of the control of the project. The project was further delayed by the
municipal election process of 2010 and the consecutive changes in municipal teams who
were not familiar with the Project. The delays associated with the first extension of the
Grant’s closing date (24 months) were all due to external factors.

9.      During the early years of project implementation, the reconstruction or repair of
damaged municipal infrastructure (under Component 1) received the highest priority in
order to address the population’s most pressing needs. All works financed under
Component 1 are fully completed. Similarly, the capacity building activities (Component
3) have also been fully delivered. Implementation of local development projects
(Component 2) was first delayed due to the municipal elections of May-June 2010. As a
result of the elections, some adjustments were needed to respond to the request of the
incoming municipal authorities. However, the changes in the design and work contracts


                                            -6-
were kept to the minimum in order to limit the negative impact on the overall project
performance.

10.     Despite the two extensions and reinforced supervision of and assistance to local
development projects by the PCU, a number of local development projects suffered
significant delays in the implementation of activities over the June – September 2011
period. These delays are also outside of the control of the PCU. They are mainly
attributed to the adverse local, national, and regional environment throughout 2011, most
notably: (i) the regional context and the security threats in Syria, which largely affected
the availability of adequate labor force (mostly Syrian) in the construction sector; (ii) the
sudden large scale and illegal construction of housing units (roughly estimated at around
3,000 to 4,000 buildings) on public land in Southern Lebanon during the care-taker
Government has considerably distorted the construction sector from January to June
2011, and has led to a severe shortage of construction material followed by rapid prices
increases; (iii) the restriction in the transport of construction material transport banned
from entering Southern Lebanon from April-May 2011 to gradually stop the proliferation
of illegal construction further reduced construction works. Against this background and
the repeated security incidents witnessed in Southern Lebanon during the summer of
2011, the delays incurred earlier by the change of municipal teams could not be mitigated
and were at times even reinforced, thus impacting the overall revised timetable.

11.     The proposed extension is thus necessary to ensure the completion of the ongoing
local development investments and achievement of their full development benefits. It is
noteworthy that both the revised implementation plan and the structure of Project
management are satisfactory (the rating is MS due to the delays) and will ensure that the
Project Development Objective is fully achieved. The Government of Lebanon has
prepared a specific action plan and detailed schedule to fully support the Grant’s
expected outcome. This document was sent to the Bank and has been reviewed and found
acceptable by the task team. While disbursement was slower than expected, the ratio
remained stable as the Project shifted to the more complex local development
components. All the procurement processes are now completed.

12.    At this stage, and with the approval of this restructuring, the Project objectives
continue to be achievable; the performance of the Borrower and other Project
implementing agencies is satisfactory.


APPRAISAL SUMMARY
13.    Financial and Economic Analysis: None of the proposed changes would have a
major effect on the original economic, financial or technical of the project as appraised.

14.   Social and Environment: The proposed restructuring would not result in any
changes to the social and environmental aspects as defined at appraisal.

15.   Risks: The proposed restructuring does not trigger new risks or exceptions to
Bank policy.
