Overall, the project is on track. The\n            reconstruction or repair of damaged municipal infrastructure\n            and the capacity building activities are completed. Sixteen\n            local development projects are still not completed, however,\n            and are at risk of remaining incomplete for lack of\n            investment funds at the municipal level. The remaining\n            procurement progress and financial management activities\n            remain satisfactory. Project management is rated moderately\n            satisfactory. Despite adverse conditions during most of its\n            implementation phase, the project is still achieving its\n            development objectives and implementation progress\n            moderately satisfactorily. The project objectives remain\n            relevant and are largely achieved: basic services have been\n            restored; priority public infrastructure has been rebuilt;\n            and an increased share of the municipal budgets is now\n            allocated to investments; the ratio of municipal revenues\n            over government transfers has been reduced significantly and\n            a municipal observatory has been established.  Following the\n            additional delays experienced during the period June -\n            September 2011, all remaining local development projects are\n            now under execution and progressing well. The reallocation\n            is necessary in order to effectively maintain the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) for a longer duration than\n            originally envisioned and which is required to deliver the\n            municipal investments.  The reallocation will ensure funding\n            of the reduced staff of the PCU over the extension period to\n            carry out proper supervision of all works remaining for a\n            full delivery of the local development projects."}, "docdt": "2011-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
