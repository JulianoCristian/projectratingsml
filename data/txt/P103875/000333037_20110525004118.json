Overall, the project is on track. During the early\n            years of project implementation the reconstruction or repair\n            of damage municipal infrastructure (under component one)\n            received highest priority in order to address the\n            population's most pressing needs. Similarly, the\n            capacity building activities (component three) have also\n            been fully delivered. The launch of the local development\n            investments (component two) had, however, been intentionally\n            postponed to fully concentrate the local implementation\n            capacity on the most urgent activities until the emergency\n            work was sufficiently advanced. Because of the political\n            uncertainties and security conditions experienced in 2007\n            and 2008, the time and efforts required to carry out the\n            agreed scope of work were much greater than initially\n            anticipated. As a result of the delays faced during the\n            initial stage of the project, and in response to a request\n            by the Government of Lebanon (GOL), the Bank approved on\n            December 16, 2009 an 18-month extension of the grant's\n            closing date. This additional time allowed for the\n            completion of emergency reconstruction work and advancing\n            the more complex implementation of the municipal\n            investments. As the project enters in its final phase, there\n            are now only 15 ongoing works contracts aimed at reviving\n            the local economy, fostering social integration and\n            promoting local development, which will need a little more\n            time to reach completion."}, "docdt": "2011-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
