Project is designed to:\n            (i) strengthen the major institutions in the power sector by\n            supporting management and financial reforms; (ii) assist in\n            the financing of investment needed to expand production and\n            distribution of electricity; and (iii) support the carrying\n            out of priority engineering studies. The project will be\n            executed by three institutions: ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU,\n            AND HIDRANDINA. ELECTROLIMA will be responsible for the\n            largest component of the project comprising the 1982-1986\n            expansion plan for its distribution system, construction of\n            the Yuracmayo dam, three engineering studies and a training\n            program. ELECTROPERU will carry out engineering related to\n            the preparation of the Mantaro transfer project, will\n            receive technical assistance in financial management and\n            will carry out a training program. The HIDRANDINA component\n            will consist of engineering related to preparation of the\n            high-priority Mayush hydroelectric project."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
