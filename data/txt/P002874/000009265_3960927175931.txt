MIMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Togo for SDR 12.4 million ($16
million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The proposed credit, which
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, would help finance
the extension of Togo's telecommunications network and strengthen the
institutional framework fcr the management of the post and
telecommunications sector. The project would be cofinanced by the European
Investment Bank for $10.4 million equivalent, the African Development Bank
for $4 million equivalent, the Canadian International Development Agency
for $2.3 million equivalent, the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation of France
for $0.3 million equivalent, the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
of France for $0.6 million equivalent and the United Nations Development
Program for $0.1 million equivalent.
2.       Background.  Public domestic postal and telecommunications
services in Togo are managed and operated by the Office of Posts and
Telecommunications of Togo (OPTT), with international services provided by
a separate entity, Satelit. The Ministry of Equipment, Post and
Telecommunications oversees both institutions. OPTT was created in
September, 1986 and is organized on a commercial basis with limited
financial autonomy. It has been profitable in 1987 and 1988. The two
major issues affecting the appropriate development of the
telecommunications sector, are firstly, the sector institutional framework
which needs to be strengthened and better defined, and secondly, the very
low level of investment in the sector in the recent past. The creation of
OPTT has dramatically improved the sector institutional framework but the
relation between OPTT, Satelit and the Government remains to be clarified
and formally defined. OPTT is still in a transitional state and needs to
become a full fledged independent operating entity with appropriate
expertise in all areas of corporate activities. Moreover, OPTT management
needs to have explicit technical and financial objectives. Estimated
network investment since 1980 has been CFAF 3-1 billion with an annual line
expansion rate of 22, which is extremely low by regional standards (e.g
Benin at CFAF 11.1 billion). At least 502 of expressed demand for
telecommunications services remains unsatisfied, which is high when
compared to an average 30? for Africa. A new telecommunications investment
program through 1993 has been identified with feasibility and design
studies for specific components to be undertaken.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA is actively supporting the
ongoing structural adjustment program for the Togo economy. This program
calls, inter alia, for the strengthening of the efficiency of those
institutions, such is OPTT, which are expected to remain in the public
sector. IDA has i nsiderable cross-country experience in the



telecommunications field and is thus in a position to assist GOT in the
appropriate development of the TC sector. In particular, IDA has been
requested by GOT to coordinate donor assistance to the sector, to help
reduce investment cost by promoting international procurement of
telecommunications equipment and to assist in the preparation of coherent
and comprehensive action plans for management and institutional
improvement. Moreover, IDA will assist appropriate sector development by
(a) reviewing on a regular basis the TC sector investment program, (b)
advising on appropriate pricing policies and Ic) developing performance
monitoring systems.
4.       Protect Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to increase the availability and scope of TC services so as to sustain
the country's structural adjustment effort and the likely demand increase
resulting from private sector development and enhanced external trade; and
(b) to develop and implement a program of management improvement and
manpower development as well as strengthen the financial performance of the
TC sector thereby increasing public resource mobilization and advancing the
process of public enterprise reform supported by the structural adjustment
program.
5.       Proiect Description.  The project supports: (a) the execution of
Togo's 1989-93 telecommunications investment program; and (b) a program for
institutional development. The main components are: Ci) technical
assistance in the area of human resource development as well as finance,
planning and project management that will strengthen OPTT; (ii) technical
assistance to study sector restructuring issues focusing on regulatory
functions, commercialization, possible merger of the TC operating entities;
(iii) expansion of local networks in Lome and Kara; (iv) construction of a
Lome-Kara transmission link; (v) rural telephone systems in the Lome and
Kara regiong; and (vi) a maintenance plan for the TC sector. The total of
the project, which is expected to be executed over five years, is estimated
at $44.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $34.4
million (772). A breakdown of costs and financing plan are given in
Schedule A. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank group operations in Togo are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7721-TO dated
June 12, 1989 is also attached.
6.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreements were sought along
two main directions aiming at (a) the implementation of an appropriate
institutional framework and (b) adequate management of the physical and
financial aspects of the project. Regarding the institutional framework,
it was agreed that GOT and OPTT would fulfill their respective obligations
under the performance contract, the execution of which will be reviewed
annually by all parties, including IDA. In addition, OPTT statutes will be
revised to reflect the outcome of the ongoing public enterprise management
study which is undertaken under SAL III. Concerning pruject management, it
was agreed that OPTT would report progress with respect to implementation
against relevant indicators/targets on both a quarterly and annual basis.
Lastly, it was agreed that OPTT should cover at least 352 of its investment
from internally generated resources, aad that the annual return on its
average net fixed assets should be no less than 152. Before credit
effectiveness, it was agreed that the following would be achieved:



- 3 -
ti) finaliz&tion and signature of the performance
contract by GOT and OPTT;
(ii)   signature of the agreement for onlending the IDA
credit from GOT to OPTT;
(iii) all conditions for effectiveness of the EIB loan
and;
(iv)   signature of contract for the LomE and Kara local
network to be financed by IDA.
7.     Benefits.  The project is expected to have a satisfactory
economic rate of return of 32Z. The prnect will promote the
rehabilitation and expansion of the TC sector which is considered
important for the success of the structural adjustment program
and the country's efforts to boost the productive sectors of the
economy. Satisfied demand for TC services will be increased from
502 to 702 as a result of the project.
8.      Risks.  The risk that poor investment planning and coordination
could result in delays and cost overruns will be minimized by the
provision, under the credit, of adequate technical assistance to assist
OPTT in project supervision. The risk that inappropriate or weak
institutional structures and poor management could negate expected benefits
has been reduced by the establishment of OPT? as an autonomous entity and
will be minimized further by agreement on a comprehensive management
improvement plan and a operformance contract' between GOT and OPT?.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
