efforts to expand its existing generating and transmission\n            facilities to help meet Bangladesh's demand for power\n            from 1985/86 till 1990; contribute to foreign exchange\n            savings through the substitution of power generated with\n            domestic natural gas in place of imported fuel; and address\n            a number of institutional issues which are critical for the\n            long-term efficient development of the power sector. The\n            project would include: the expansion of the existing steam\n            power plant at ASHUGANJ through the addition of two new\n            steam gas-fired units of 150 MW each, including boilers and\n            ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment; the\n            construction of a 230 kV double circuit 48 km transmission\n            line between Ashuganj and Ghorasal, including a 230/132 kV\n            substation; and the financing of a simulator to train\n            BPDB's staff in the operation of steam power plants."}, "docdt": "1982-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
