PREFACE
This iS the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Ashuganj
Thermal Power Project in Bangladesh, for which Credit 1254-BD in the amount of
SDR 82.7 million (US$92.0 million equivalent) was approved on June 30, 1982.
The Credit closed on June 30, 1990. The last disbursement was made on
October 11, 1990, and the uzidisbursed balance of SDR 4.0 million (equivalent
to US$5.7 million) was canceled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Energy Division,
Country Department 1, of the Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I
and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the IDA's supervision
mission of the ongoing power projects in May 1990 and is based, inter alia, on
the Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit and Project Agreements,
supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower, progress
reports of the Borrower and internal IDA memoranda.

BANGLADESH
ASHUGANJ THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(CREDIT 1254-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) is responsible for
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, except for rural
areas served by the Rural Electrification Board (REB) Since 1977.  In 1976 a
consortium of foreign consultants carried out the Bangladesh Energy Study
(1976) financed by UNDP and ADB and provided the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB) with a macroeconomic planning framework f£r the energy sector and
reconmended sector development programs and specific subsector projects.
For the power subsector the study recommended the early construction of the
East-West Interconnector and the development of gas-based generation in the
easterm zone. The Ashuganj Thermal Power Project was conceived as a part of
the least cost generation expansior. program and was the Bank Group's second
lending operation in Bangladesh's power sector. The project was cofinanced
by KfW, ADB, KFAED and OPEC (para. 3.03).
ObJectives
2.       The project's main objective was to provide assistance to BPDB in
augmenting its base load capacity and building transmission facilities to
transfer additional energy from the east to the western power system of the
country and to support institution building effort in the power sector
initiated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (para. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
3.       The project was completed on schedule.  Commissioning of the
generating plants was ahead of schedule but because of delays in completing
the transmission lines and associated works, the full capacity of the
Ashuganj plant could not be utilized until September 1990 when the East-West
Interconnector started operating at 230 kV. A major highlight of the
project was a significant increase in project scope within the available
credit amount. The project as originally defined consisted of augmenting
the Ashuganj Thermal Power Station by two units of 150 MW each. Since there
was a need to install a third unit and in view of the attractive prices
received for the first two units GOB requested the Bank along with the other
cofinanciers to finance a third 150 MW unit using the savings. All the
donors agreed to their request and the project scope was increased to cover
three units of 150 MW each (para. 4.02).
ProJect Results
4.       The project was successful in meeting its principal objectives
(para. 3.01) by augmenting the gas-fired generation capacity in the east and



- iii -
saving on expensive oil-fired power generation through transfer of
additional energy from the east to the west zone. The projects physical
targets were achieved largely because of the timely commissioning of the
generating units. However, delays in the commissioning of the transmission
component at 230 kV constrained the transfer capacity to the west zone until
the East-West Interconnector was upgraded to 230 kV in July 1989.
5.       BPDB's financial and institutional performance has been
disappointing, and most of the relevant credit covenants have not been
complied with.
Proiect Sustainability
6.       The project is a part of BPDB's least cost generation expansion
program originally based on the Bangladesh Energy Study undertaken in 1976.
The extension of Ashuganj Thermal Power Plant was in line with GOB's policy
of substituting expensive generation (using imported fuel) in the west zone
by low cost generation in the east zone (using indigenous) natural gas) ani
transferring the energy through the East-West Interconnector. System demand
'GWhl is estimated to grow at an average annual rate of 10.8? p.a. for the
period 1990-2000. The institutional/financial improvement aspect of the
project was not very successful. BPDB's institutional/financial improvement
continue to be a major challenge. Needed improvements are expected through
the ODA-financed *Action Plan for Performance Improvement* currently being
implemented and from the joint IDA/ADB proposal on "Financial Management
Strengthening Package."
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.       The main lessons to be learned from the project are:
(a) the evacuation of available power from Ashuganj was delayed mainly
because the upgrading to 230 kV of the East-West Interconnector
(not included in the project) was delayed. Early planning and
better co-ordination could have allowed earlier achievement of
project benefits (para. 5.02(b));
(b) the appraisal team had failed to question the validity of the
project cost (prepared by the consultants) which was overestimated
by 50X. Also, if bids for major components had been received
before Board presentation, the project cost could have been
modified appropriately (para. 5.04);
(c) greater focus needs to be made on institution building and
technical assistance aspects. Close coordination among donors is
necessary to bring about appropriate institutional changes.
(para. 6.01); and
(d) the initial performance targets (system losses, accounts
receivable) were overly optimistic and not adequately supported by
detailed action plans. This, as a result, and in conjunction wish
serious lack of financial discipline had resulted in BPDB's non-
compliance with most of the financial covenants (paras. 6.03, 6.04,
9.02).

2.   Background
2.01      Prior to 1971, the control of water resources and power development
in the area that was to become Bangladesh was vested in the East Pakistan
Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA). After independence in 1971,
the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) created the Bangladesh Water Development
Board (BWDB) to manage water resources and the Bangladesh Power Development
Board (BPDB) to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Subsequently,
in 1977 the Rural Electrification Board (REB) was created to take over
responsibility for electricity distribution in the rural areas. Both agencies
(BPDB and REB) were and continue to be under the direct supervision of the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR).
2.02      Bangladesh's principal commercially exploitable energy resources
consist of substantial reserves of relatively low-cost natural gas (currently
estimated at 15 tcf) and limited hydropower potential (estimated at about 1500
GWa/year). The country is divided into two separate zones (East and West) by
the Brahmaputra/Ganges river systems, and both natural gas and hydropower are
located in the country's eastern region. During the events of 1971, power
facilities suffered substantial damage. Electricity generation and supply
facilities collapsed, and maximum demand dropped from 233 HW to 30 MW. Apart
from rehabilitating damaged facilities, there was a critical need to upgrade
and expand electricity supply for productive use. In these matters and in its
energy sector policy, GOB was strongly influenced by a UNDP-financed Energy
Study carried out for Bangladesh in 1976 by a consortium of foreign
consultants under ADB's guidance. The Study provided GOB with a macroeconomic
planning framework for the energy sector and recommended sector development
programs and specific subsector investment projects. The Study concluded that
the known gas reserves should only be used to supply luternal energy
requirements and fertilizer production and recommended early construction of
gas transmission pipelines and the expansion of gas distribution facilities to
minimize oil imports.  For the power subsector, a major recommendation was the
early construction of the East-West Interconnector and the development of gas-
based generation in the eastern zone.
2.03      In 1980 BPDB's available capacity was only 626 MW (426 MW in the
east zone and 200 MW in the west) of a total installed capacity of 736 MW



-2-
while the total demand was 462 MV (338 MV in the east zone and 124 MW in the
west increasing at about 11? p.a. and 21Z pa. respectively). Due to the
distribution of energy resources in the country, all power plants in the west
zone were using imported oil, while most of the power generation in the east
zone was based on indigenous natural gas and hydropower. Arising from this
situation, the average fuel cost per unit generated in the west was about Tk
1.7/kWh, while in the east (due to favorable gas prices) it was only Tk
0.10/kWh. With the commissioning of the first double circuit East-West
Interconnector (energized at 132 kV in December 1982 and subsequently upgraded
to 230 kV in September 1989), generation could be transferred from the east
zone to the west, thus substituting expensive generation in the west by low
cost generation in the east.
2.04      BPDB's investment program up to 1985 was based on the 1976 Energy
Study and provided the system expansion needed to meet demand until 1990. At
the time when the project was identified the investment program consisted of a
number of projects which included an additional hydroelectric unit at Kaptai
(50 MW), an oil/natural gas-fired unit at Chittagong (60 MW), both in the east
zone, and an oil-fired steam unit (110 MW) at Xhulna in the west zone. In
addition, steps were taken for the installation of a 90 MW combined cycle unit
at Ashuganj for conuissioning in 1983/1984. Ongoing transmission and
distribution projects included about 500 km of 132 kV lines and Distribution
Projects for Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna Districts, as well as the initial
construction for the REB Rural Electrification Program. A comparison of
capacity and demand balances, which took into account the East-West
Interconnector, showed that the addition of 210 MW at Ghorasal and 300 MW at
Ashuganj by 1985 and 1986 were critical for an adequate supply. The project
was planned to provide the 300 MW at Ashuganj. Subsequently in 1985 (after
the project had been approved), BPDB developed a twenty-year master plan for
generation and transmission (Power System Master Plan--PSMP) with the
assistance of ACRES International of Canada, which included the installation
of an additional 150 MW (Unit No. 5) at Ashuganj as well as other investments
included in the third five-year plan (1985-1990).
2.05      IDA's first involvement in the power subsector took place in 1979
and provided a Credit of USS 28 million (Credit No. 934-BD) to help finance
rehabilitation, reinforcement and expansion of the distribution networks in
the Greater Ehulna area. The Ashuganj Thermal Power Project, which was co-
financed by KfW, ADB, OPEC Fund and KFAED, was IDA's second lending operation
to the Bangladesh power subsector. Subsequent lending operations in the power
subsector are listed in Part III, Section 1 and include an Energy Sector
Adjustment Credit in 1989. At present a Power Rehabilitation Project (FY92)
and Second East-West Interconnector Project (FY93) are under preparation.
3.   Proiect Objectives and Description
3.01      Project Objectives.  The project's objectives were to (a) increase
the base load generation capacity to enable BPDB to meet the country's
expected power requirements beyond 1985; (b) further interconnect and
reinforce BPDB's transmission systems in order to transfer the power generated
by the project; (c) assist the Government in its efforts to reduce dependence
on imported crude oil by using locally available natural gas as the main fuel
for power generation; and (d) support institution building efforts initiated
by ADB. During project preparation, it was recognized that BPDB was a utility



-3-
with substantial deficiencies which, under normal circumstances, would have
required a major institution building component on IDA's part. However, under
the prevailing circumstances it was considered preferable to reinforce ADB's
endeavors rather than initiate new activities.
3.02      Prolect Description.  The project'- major components as defined in
the SAR were as follows:
(a)  extension of the steam power station at Ashuganj with two natural
gas fired units of 150 MW each, including boilers, turbogenerators
and ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment;
(b) construction of a 230 kV, 48 km long do":Ae-cl,6cuit transmission
line between Ashuganj and Ghorasal including a 230/132 kV
substation and switch yard at AshLganj; nd
(c)  provision of a simulator to train BPDB's staff in the operation of
steam power plants.
The project scope was extended in 1985 to include a third 150 MW gas-fired
unit at Ashuganj.
3.03      Co-financing and Donor Co-ordination.  In view of the large project
financing requirement (US$ 372.8 million), co-financing with other donors was
necessary. An agreement among the co-financiers established the allocation of
packages to be financed by each donor and procedures for exchange of
information concerning project implementation. As the lead financing agency,
IDA provided a credit of SDR 82.7 million (equivalent USS 92 million), KfW a
grant of DM 115 million (equivalent US$ 48 million), ADB a loan of US$ 30.6
million and KFAED/OPEC Fund jointly a loan of US$ 65 million. GOB/BPDB agreed
to provide the local currency requirement of about US$ 112.0 million. To
ensure adequate donor coordination, IDA made fulfillment of the effectiveness
conditions of the OPEC Fund, KFAED and ADB loan agreement and execution of the
KfW grant agreement a condition of credit effectiveness for the IDA Credit.
4.   Project Design and Organization
4.01      The project had a clear conceptual foundation and was designed
primarily to augment the growing needs of BPDB's generating capacity and to
ensure availability of electricity for transfer from the east to the west
zone. The project was justified on the basis of a detailed feasibility report
prepared by BPDB's consultants, Lahmeyer International (LI) of Germany, under
funds made available from the Third Technical Assistance Credit (Credit No.
872-BD). In this study, various locations, unit sizes and types of plants
(coal-fired and gas-fired steam combustion turbines and combined cycle) were
examined in detail, and the study concluded that there was a need to install
2x1WM MW gas-fired steam units at Ashuganj. BPDB retained the same consultant
to prepare bidding documents and specifications, review the detailed design,
and assist in construction supervision. At the time of project preparation,
the existing generating facility at the site included two natural gas-fired
thermal units of 64 MW each, and a combined cycle unit of 90 MW (2s30 MW gas,
ls30 MW steam) was under construction. The site was adequate to accommodate
three additional units of 150 MW each. The project envisaged that the
additional power generated from Ashuganj would be transmitted to consumers in



-4-
the eastern part of the country through the existing 132 kV grid and in the
western part through the East-West Interconnector, initially to be operated at
132 kV with 200 MW transfer capacity and to be upgraded to 230 kV and 500 MW
transfer capacity.
4.02      While BPDB's electricity demand was growing at an average rate of
about 13? p.a., the cost of power generation in the west zone was becoming
increasingly more expensive compared to the east zone. With the commissioning
of the East-West Interconnector in December 1982, the timing, scope and scale
of the project were anpropriate as prepared/appraised in early 1982. The
Power System Master Plan (PSMP) study, completed in 1985, recommended that to
meet the growing demand, an additional 150 MW base load unit was necessary by
June 1988 at Ashuganj. In August 1984, the consultant LI had examined the
adequacy of cooling water, fuel supply and transmission system and other
necessary details of an extension in Ashuganj of one 150 MW unit and had
established that it was a technically sound proposal. IDA had included
financing for this unit, initially to be commissioned by December 1989, as
part of a subsequent lending operation (FY85). However, when the bidding for
the first two units (Units 3 and 4) was completed in 1984, the prices
submitted were much lower than expected, and substantial savings were
generated from the loans provided by IDA (US$ 46 million), KFAED (US$ 14.5
million), OPEC Fund (US$ 12.5 million) and ADB (US$ 24 million).
4.03      In view of the attractive prices received in the bids for the first
two units, BPDB and GOB proposed to order an additional unit by exercising
options available in the bids and using the savings under the various loans.
All donors Lgreed to BPDB's request ir. a meeting in Dhaka on October 8, 1985,
and the options available in the contracts were used to order the third unit.
Although KfW had no savings from ita grant amount, it agreed to allocate
additional funds (DM 21.3 million) out of the Federal Republic of Germany's
(FRG) annual financial contribution to Bangladesh. The advance ordering of
the equipment both resulted in lower capital costs and took advantage of
having a third unit identical to the first two units. In view of the above,
inclusion of the third unit (Unit 5) within the project scope and financing it
out of project savings was justified.
4.04      BPDB was responsible for the project's implementation with the
assistance of the consultant LI. In view of the project's importance, in
February 1985 BPDB upgraded the position of the Project Manager, Ashuganj, to
Project Director, Ashuganj, reporting directly to the Member Generation and
Transmission. In retrospect, the early appointment of the consultant LI to
assist BPDB in all phases of the project resulted in overall smooth project
implementation.
5.   Prolect Implementation
5.01      Credit Effectiveness and Proiect Start Up.  While IDA's Board
approved the credit on June 1, 1982, it did not become effective until
June 20, 1983. The delay was primarily due tot (a) late fulfillment of
effectiveness conditions of the ADB, KFAED/OPEC loan agreements and late
execution of the KfW grant agreement; (b) delay in signing the on-lending
agreement between GOB and BPDB; and (c) delay in GOB's approval of the Project
Proforma. It was possible, however, to complete the project on schedule



-5-
despite this delay because LI was appointed as consultants for project
implementation in October 1982 and commenced work without delay.
5.02      Implementation Schedule.  The project was originally scheduled to
be completed by June 30, 1986, and the credit closing date was June 30, 1987.
With the extension of the project scope to include an additional unit, the
completion date was revised to January 31, 1989, and the closing date extended
to June 30, 1989. Subsequently, in order to facilitate payment of retention
money, IDA agreed to GOB's request to extend the closing date to June 30,
1990. The major highlights of project implementation are summarized below:
(a)  Power Plant.  Because of some initial delays in credit
effectiveness and award of contracts, the commissioning of Units 3
and 4 was delayed in relation to the SAR schedule. However, the
units were commissioned on time, and Unit 5 was even commissioned
ahead of the contractual schedule. The table below briefly
suimmarizes the units' commissioning dates:
Commissioning Dates
Unit No.        SAR            Contractual         Actual
3          June 1986         February 1987       01/29/87
4         June 1986          July 1987           06/07/87
5          January 1989      July 1988           04/28/88
Minor start-up problems occurred just after commissioning on all
three units which included inter alia: (i) excessive vibration of
the high pressure turbine control valve spindle; and (ii) abnormal
axial shaft displacement caused by defective seal ring of turbine
dummy piston. The supplier promptly made the necessary design
modifications, and all three units are now operating
satisfactorily.
(b) Transmission. The 230 kV Ashuganj-Ghorasal transmission line
financed by the KFAED/OPEC Fund and scheduled for completion by
September 1986 was actually commissioned at 230 kV only in July
1989. The 34 month delay was caused mainly by shortages of
construction equipment and skilled manpower, resulting in poor
contractor performance. Further, the commissioning of other
transmission and substation components, required to upgrade the
system (including the East-West Interconnector) to 230 kV but not
included in the project, was also delayed. BPDB therefore had to
resort to temporary emergency plans for evacuating as much power as
possible at 132 kV, although the full output capacity of Ashuganj
could still not be utilized. Taking advantage of the unused
generating capacity, BPDB decided in September 1987 to carry out a
major overhaul of the two 64 MW steam units (Units 1 and 2) at
Ashuganj and to repair the 90 MW combined cycle plant which was
experiencing major problems.



(c) Training Simulator. Commissioning of the simulator to train BPDB's
staff in operating steam power units was also delayed by eighteen
months. The delay was mainly because of late signing (delay of
about 13 months) of the civil works contract for the training
center building. The training simulator contract was awarded on
January 15, 1986, and the equipment was commissioned in May 1987
instead of November 1985, as envisaged during appraisal.
The other impediments which caused delays in project completion in general
included inter alia: (a) delays in release of GOB's annual budgetary
allocation for local cost financing; (b) late finalization of the construction
contracts; and c) delays in clearance of equipment through customs. Although
two major labor strikes occurred in 1987 in the civil works contract, they did
not significantly affect the construction schedule.
5.03      Procurement.  The project works were divided into seven contract
packages to suit parallel financing arrangements by the various donors.
Except for the 'turbogenerator" package procured from Germany under KfW grant
financing, all other packages were procured under ICB on the basis of the co-
financiers' respective procurement guidelines. Except for some delay in
awarding the contract for the civil works package, procurement was carried out
without major problems.
5.04      Project Costs.  The total cost for the two 150 MW units and
associated works included in the project was estimated at appraisal to be
US$ 328.4 million. This included USS 228.1 million in foreign currency and
US$ 100.3 million in local currency. As explained above (para. 4.02), the
project scope was expanded to include a third (150 MW) unit, at an estimated
cost of US$ 82.4 million comprising US$ 67.0 million in foreign currency and
US$ 15.4 million in local currency. The actual total cost for the three 150
MW units was USS 290.6 million, including US$ 229.7 million in foreign
currency and US$ 60.9 million in local currency. A comparison of project cost
components at appraisal and actual is shown in Part III, Section 5A. The
above cost estimates do not include interest during construction. The
significant project cost underrun realized was due mainly to unanticipated
favorable world market prices and strong competition among bidders. It
further appears that the consultant's feasibility study somewhat overestimated
the cost of this project, which was an extension of an existing site.
5.05      Disbursement.  The estimated and actual disbursement of Credit
1254-BD are given in Part III, Section 3. The original closing date was
June 30, 1987, but with the addition of the third unit, the closing date was
extended to June 30, 1989.  Subsequently, in order to facilitate payment of
retention money, the credit was extended by one year to June 30, 1990.
Disbursements against commitments were made until December 31, 1990, and an
outstanding balance of SDR 4.0 million (equivalent to US$ 5.7 million as of
December 1990) was canceled.
5.06      Credit Allocations.  The original and revised allocations and
actual disbursements for Credit 1254-BD are shown in Part III, Section 5B.
The original allocations were revised in January 1986 to take into account the
modifications made to the project scope.

6.   Project Results
6.01      Project Objectives.  The project was successful in meeting its
principal objectives (para. 3.01) by augmenting the gas-fired power generation
capacity in the east and saving on expensive oil-fired generation through
transfer of additional power from the east to the west zone. The project did
not include a specific institution building component but endorsed the actions
financed by ADB aimed inter alia at further refining BPDB's accounting systems
and pursuing BPDB's management and organizational strengthening. The results
achieved in institution building, however, have been disappointing. Further
actions supported by IDA along with other donors in subsequent lending
operations include a power sector tariff studyl', BPDB system loss reduction
program>, computerization program for BPDB!/ and BPDB institutional reform
study Y, but these too have not produced all expected results. As a
follow-up to the institutional reform study, with the assistance of ODA-
financed consultants, an Action Plan for Performance Improvement is being
implemented which inter alia aims at decentralizing the electricity
distribution function, primarily to control system losses and accounts
receivable and improve collections; a key element of this plan is the creation
of a Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA) to takeover responsibility for
distribution in the Greater Dhaka area from BPDB. In November 1990, in view
of BPDB's rapidly deteriorating financial performance, IDA and ADB jointly
proposed a financial management strengthening package (para. 9.02).
6.02      Physical Results.  The project's physical targets were largely
achieved in commissioning the generating units on time. However, delays in
coumissioning the transmission component at 230 kV and upgrading the East-West
Interconnector to 230 kV constrained BPDB's transfer capacity to the west zone
until September 1989. Only then could the 150 MW additional capacity of the
third unit at Ashuganj be fully utilized to reduce imported fuel consumption
in the west.
6.03      Financial Performance.  BPDB's financial statements comparing
appraisal estimates and actuals for FYs 82-90 are shown in Annex 1. In the
late 1970s, BPDB's finances had in a deplorable state due to high system
losses, excessive payroll, doubtful accounts and accounting practices,
inadequate tariffs and poor revenue collection. To arrest the deteriorating
trend, GOB had prepared (in 1977) a Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) designed to
achieve a gradual cost coverage by revenue earnings through specific steps.
These includedt (a) restructuring of BPDB's debts; (b) reducing system losses;
(c) setting up programs for revising tariffs from time to time; and
(d) establishing programs for system rehabilitation and management
improvement. Building upon the findings of the Greater Khulna Power
Distribution Project, the Ashuganj Thermal Power Project identified the major

financial issues, and as a tool for monitoring BPDB's financial position,
several financial covenants were established. These included: (a) a revenue
covenant (cash generation covenant); (b) an accounts receivable covenant, and
(c) a debt equity ratio covenant. Subsequently, in order to provide a better
and more dependable measure for formulating long-term financial policy, the
cash generation covenant was superseded by a rate of return (on revalued
assets) covenant (Credit 1648-BD). As shown in the table below, although the
rate of return and accounts receivable targets were subsequently relaxed, BPDB
was not able to comply with most of the financial covenants.

6.04      The appraisal estimates (Annex 1) on which the above covenants were
based appear to have been overly optimistic. Although actual generation
figures (GWh) and the average tariff levels were close to appraisal estimates,
high system losses and higher than anticipated generating costs (particularly
fuel and operation, maintenance and administration costs) led to reduced
earnings. In addition, the high level of accounts receivable associated with
poor collections performance seriously affected BPDB's cash flow position.
Apart from the three major covenants indicated above several other measures
were agreed to improve BPDB's overall performance. These included inter alia
implementation of an action plan to reduce system losses and adoption of
measures to improve collections performance. Again, the results achieved have
been disappointing, and both system losses (40.62 for the period March-March
1990) and accounts receivable (5.3 months as of May 1990) continue to remain
at unacceptable levels.
6.05      In late FY88, IDA learned that BPDB (among other public sector
entities) was paying its debt service to GOB in accord with the terms and
conditions of repayment between GOB and the donor instead of the terms
included in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) and was therefore violating
the SLA conditionality. This issue was brought to GOB's notice and necessary
adjustments were made with conversion into equity of BPDB's arrears of payment
on outstanding debt to GOB for all IDA financed projects. GOB/BPDB have
assured IDA that such violations will not recur in the future. Starting in
FY89, BPDB has reflected payments due to GOB on account of its debt service
requirements properly in its accounts, but because of its severe cash flow



-9-
problem, the payment actually made in FY90 was only about 4.5t of the amount
due.
6.06      Proiect Economics.  The project's location and the type and size of
the units were defined as being the least cost in the SAR. The third unit was
recommended in the least cost generation and transmission master plan in 1985.
The project's economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the
first two units in the SAR using (a) tariff revenue and (b) economic valuation
of electricity inputs by consumers (willingness to pay--WtP) as a proxy for
project benefits. On the cost side, a notional amount for transmission and
distribution investment beyond the project's direct transmission component was
added to the project cost to reflect system investment needs when comparing
costs to benefits at the retail level. A constant fuel price and a 3? real
increase in fuel price were considered. The simulation was carried out over
20 years after project completion (1988-2008). The EIRR was found to be about
13Z using tariff revenue for benefits and 20? using the WtP. For the third
unit, a justification of advancing the commissioning by 18 months was
provided, using a time slice analysis of incremental costs and benefits.
6.07      While the methodology used in the SAR was technically correct, a
time slice method would have provided a more thorough analysis of BPDB's
investment program. Further, since the tariff used to value benefits was
below the LRHC, the EIRR would have been expected to be below the discount
rate of 10 to 12Z. This may be explained by overestimated sales due to
underestimated system losses and an overly optimistic plant utilization
factor. Also, some of the sales were accounted for as benefits, while these
sales could have been obtained from the existing system, hence carrying only
fuel savings (i.e. burning gas instead of oil) as economic benefits. However,
in view of the low prices quoted, the installed capacity is 50? higher for
about the same project costs, which offsets the overestimated sales figure.
6.08      The EIRR has been recalculated using a time slice of BPDB's
investment program, taking into account only the incremental sales and actual
figures for costs and benefits for the three units. Using tariff valuation
for benefits, the EIRR is found to be 10?. Since the tariff is about 65? of
LRMC, the KIRR is reasonable. A more economically correct approach, however,
is to value the benefits of the incremental sales using the Willingness to Pay
and to include only fuel savings in the early years. This method yields an
EIRR of about 21?, which compares relatively well with the 20? obtained at the
time of appraisal.
6.09      Impact of Project.  Except for the transmission component, the
project was mostly completed ahead of schedule. Along with the upgrading to
230 kV of the East-West Interconnector, the project has helped to improve
power supply and reduce load shedding and widespread interruptions prevailing
since 1978. Thus the rapidly growing and suppressed demand during the period
up to 1990, particularly in the western zone, has been met adequately by the
additional generation capacity. The training simulator has also provided
effective training to BPDB personnel in the operation of steam power plants.
BPDB's institutional and financial performance has been unsatisfactory,
however, and its improvement remains a significant challenge.
6.10      Environmental Impact.  The project did not cause any significant
adverse environmental impact. Ashuganj Power Station is burning natural gas



-10-
fuel from the Titaw and Habiganj fields which has a low sulphur content (less
than five ppu) and no other harmful ingredients. The power plant emissions
are within permissible limits, consistent with internationally adopted
regulations. During the dry season, the plant cooling water discharge is used
with great success for irrigation in the vicinity of the power plant. The 230
kV double circuit transmission line is only 48 km long and was constructed
along the existing 132 kV line right-of-way, thus avoiding any ecologically
sensitive areas such as protected wildlife or forests.
7.   Project Sustainability
7.01      The project is a part of BPDB's generation expansion program
originally based on the Bangladesh Energy Study undertaken in 1976 (para.
2.04). Between 1976 and 1981, electricity consumption had grown at an average
rate of 13.22 p.a. (11.2? in the east zone and 20.82 in the west zone). Based
on historic trends of demana and taking into account specific developments in
various sectors of the economy, electricity sales during 1981-1990 were
forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 15.8 p.a. (actual growth was
13.9Z p.a.). Until the end of 1982 when the East-West Interconnector was
commissioned, the power supply in the west was precarious, depending on the
availability of the 60 HW plant at Khulna as the only base load unit. As
explained above (para. 2.04), the addition of 450 MW at Ashuganj as base-load
generating capacity was therefore critical for an adequate supply.
Furthermore, the extension of Ashuganj Thermal Power Plant was in line with
GOB's policy of substituting expensive generation (using imported fuel) in the
west zone by low cost generation (using indigenous natural gas) in the east
zotne and transferring the energy through the East-West Interconnector. System
demand (GWh) is estimated to grow at an average annual rate of about 11? p.a.
for the period 1991-2000. In this context therefore the project's physical
components are expected to provide a steady level of net benefits throughout
the project's economic life, provided BPDB carries out adequate repair and
maintenance of the plant and maintains its facilities at Ashuganj in optimum
condition. BPDB's staff are expected to continue their training on steam
plant operations, and therefore the benefits from the simulator are expected
to continue.
7.02      The project's institutional/financial improvement aspects were not
very successful. Some senior staff of BPDB were trained in organization and
methods. As a result, BPDB's organization was defined along functional lines
with more delegation of power to the operational personnel; job classification
and professional staff advancement was improved. However, the issue of over
staffing at lower levels has not been addressed. Moreover, much needed
improvement in BPDB's accounting system was not achieved because of a hiring
freeze which led to promoting unqualified staff from within BPDB to senior
accounts positions. BPDB's institutional/financial improvement continues to
be a major challenge. The required improvements are being pursued through the
ongoing ODA-financed Performance Improvement Action Plan and the joint IDA/ADB
proposed Financial Management Strengthening Package (para. 9.02).
8.   Bank's Performance
8.01      The main strengths of the Bank's performance on this project
include inter alias (a) preparing the project in a timely and efficient
manner; and (b) being quickly able to allocate the potential savings out of



-11-
the project by changing the project scope and including a third unit (150 MW)
which was originally scheduled as part of the Bank's next operation in the
Bangladesh power sector. In terms of implementation vis-a-vis physical
facilities, throughout the appraisal process and supervision phase, the Bank's
performance vas satisfactory. However, in the areas of
institutionallfinancial performance, BPDB remains weak while IDA and other
donors continue their efforts to identify and assist with appropriate remedial
measures.
8.02      The following lessons can be learned from the experience gained
under the projects
(a) Greater focus needs to be made on institution building and
technical assistance aspects. Close coordination among donors is
necessary to bring about necessary institutional changes and exert
pressure on the Government on important decisions to be made;
(b) The targets set for accounts receivable and system losses were
never attained although they have been relaxed during negotiations
of subwequent lending operations. It appears that the initial
targets were overly optimistic and not adequately supported by
detailed action plans, which could be closely monitored and revised
as necessary during project implementation;
(c) The evacuation of available power from Ashuganj was delayed mair.ly
because the upgrading to 23C kV of the East-West Interconnector
(not included in the project) was not commissioned on time. Early
planning and better coordination between cofinanciers could have
allowed earlier achievement of project benefits, including the
transfer of a greater amount of energy to the west and thus savings
on fuel cost; and
cd) The project cost was overestimated by over 502. In estimating
project costs due cognizance was not given to the existing sluggish
market conditions that had resulted in a keen competition between
suppliers. In addition, the non-inflationary market conditions
were not taken into account. The above factors were responsible
for such large cost over estimates. Further, if bids for major
components had been received before Board presentation, the project
cost could have been modified.
9.   Borrower's Performance
9.01      BPDB was the executing agency for the project.  In terms of the
project's technical aspects, BPDB's performance was satisfactory. Upon
realizing the importance of the project and its implementation, BPDB elevated
the position of the Project Manager to Project Director with the
administrative and financial powers of a chief engineer. All procedures
required for obtaining approvals of evaluation reports, contracts and project-
related documents which had to be submitted to various government institutions
were carried out in a timely manner. Co-ordination meetings between the
Project Team (BPDB) assisted by the consultant (LI) and the contractors and
suppliers were held regularly. In view of the transmission line bottleneck,
BPDB's quick decision to make temporary alternative arrangements to evacuate



-12-
available energy from Ashuganj at 132 kV demonstrated BPDB's ability to
respond to emergency situations. The consultant, LI, who carried out the
feasibility study was retained by BPDB for supervision of project
implementation as well; in retrospect, this was a good decision as LI played a
key role during project implementation.
9.02      BPDB's institutional and financial performance has been dismal.
Although most of the covenants agreed during project negotiations have been
relaxed under subsequent lending operations, BDPB was not able to comply.
More recently, serious deficiencies in BPDB's overall financial management,
control and accounting practices have surfaced, resulting in inconsistencies
between BPDB's audited financial statements and commercial operations reports.
In view of this as well as BPDB's sharply deteriorating performance during
1990, the Bank and ADB have jointly proposed a financial management
strengthening package to GOB/BPDB and emphasized that future lending
operations to BPDB would be contingent upon BPDB improving its performance and
implementing the proposed program.
10. Project Relationship
10.01     IDA's relationship with the Government and BPDB on the project has
generally been good.
11. Consulting Services
11.01     The consultants, suppliers and contractors played extremely
important roles in the project. The consultant for the power station
extension maintained effective control and monitoring of the contractors' and
suppliers' activities and gave productive assistance to BPDB's Project
Director. Although the civil contractor did not meet the target dates for
some structures, joint efforts to make up for the lost time resulted in
completion of the project within the scheduled timeframe. The supplier for
the training simulator effectively supervised its installation and
com issioning. Competent personnel were sent to train and advise BPDB
training instructors and to supervise the start-up phase of the training
program.
12. Project Document and Data
12.01     The legal documents for the credit were adequate and appropriate
for achieving project objectives in the key organizational, technical and
financial areas. The SAR provided a useful framework to both the Bank and
BPDB for project implementation. BPDB provided Part II of the project
completion report.

PART II: Proiect Review from Borrower's Perspectivel/
A.   Bank's Performance
Bank's performance during whole implementation period was found
satisfactory and encouraging. Bank's mission regularly visited Bangladesh
held meeting with GOB as well as BPDB's officials where discussions were held
freely in respect of all the issues faced while implementing the project. No
major problem was faced.
IDA's allocation for Lot 'BO and part of consultancy of Unit 3 & 4 was
much higher than the actual requirement. Timely approach by GOB for related
expenditure of an additional unit of 150 MW was duly honored. Function of
KFAED fund was suspended because of taking over of Kuwait by Iraq resulting in
postponement of payment of Lot "CO and Lot-Trans. IDA was requested to make
that payment out of savings of earlier allocation but there was no response.
Had this been done it would have a better effect.
B.   Lessons Learned
IDA loan was specifically allocated for meeting expenditure of Lot 'IB
and part of consultancy service. The terms of loan should have been relaxed
to the extent that the savings may, upon request, be utilized for meeting
expenditure of other lots as and when required.
C.   Borrower's Performance
BPDB was entrusted with the execution of the project. The project was
one of the largest projects executed by BPDB. Two project Directors were
entrusted with the execution of the project. One in the rank of Additional
Chief Engineer for Lots *C', "B", 'E", 'T' and Simulator and another in the
rank of Superintending Engineer for Lot-Trans. Three numbers of
Superintending Engineer and three numbers of Executive Engineers with
sufficient numbers of related officers and stafi assisted the first Project
Director i.e. Additional Chief Engineer while two numbers of Executive
Engineer with sufficient number of related officers and staff assisted the
second Project Director i.e. Superintending Engineer. All procedures were
carried out for timely obtaining various approvals, preparation of required
documents etc. Other departments of PDB assisted the Project Directors in all
the related matters. Regular coordination meetings were held between the
borrower assisted by the consultant and the contractors of different lots.
Bottlenecks were discussed and overcome. All effort and full cooperation from
all sides helped in implementing the project in due time.
1/   Part II is the Borrower's unedited product and its content are not
attributable to IDA.



- 14 -
D.   Lessons Learned
(a) It was a large project financed by multi-donor agencies each agency
had separate loan agreement with different terms and conditions.
Entire turnkey work was divided into six lots; each lot has
separate contractors. Terms and conditions of each contract were
different in nature. If the terms and conditions of all the loan
gifing agencies as well as those of all the contractors were
similar in nature, less inconveniences would have been faced.
(b) Frequent transfer of Project Directors as well as officers affected
to some extent with regard to furnishing information in times of
need. Officers selected and entrusted with the project should not
be normally transferred until completion, so that sufficient
knowledge and information could be furnished right on time.
(c)  ProjecL authority should have its own store and accounts department
separately so that sufficient related information could be
available. All expenditure relating to particular project like
CDST, other local and as well as foreign currency expenditure may
be routed through this accounts department which will enable them
to prepare project cost independently.
E.   Relationship between the Bank and Borrower
Relationship between the Bank and BPDB had been satisfactory.
F.   Performance of Cofinanciers
The performance or cofinanciers were satisfactory. However, the
function of KFAED fund was sus?ended in the last part of FY1990 due to taking
over of Kuwait by Iraq when some due payment of Lot IC", "Trans" and
Consultant were awaiting disbursement. Attempt is being made to clear the
same now.

8.    For the calculation of the actual EIRR the following Cost and Benefits
have been assumed:
Cost.
-     Inveetm_nt costs considored for generation and tranamission are the actual costs of the
project, not of taxes and dutioe and price contingencies, the local coats being converted
In to econowic costs by using of a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.80.
-     Investment coats In Distribution and Miocollineous have ben estianetd using the latest
time-slice analysis done in Bangladesh for th 'PoPwr Rehobilitation Project'. The
following ratios have been used, applying to the total generation and trnsmission
investnent costs considered: Distribution U4, Miscellaneous 11.
-     Unskilled labor coat are valued by using the standard wage rate equal to 6OX of the market
price, and convorted by using the SCF.
-     The current economic cost of natural gas, estimted at Tk. 36.77/MUf Is used for the
present evaluation, together with the latest Bank projctions for oil prices.
Benits
-     The 68/8  current tariff has been used for the eovluation of the tariff adequacyI th-
revenue not beino converted by th- SCF, and no fuol savings being considered. Th. weighted
average tariff rovenue reached Tk. 2.07/kWh.
-     The Economic Rate of Roturn has ben evaluated on the basis of the latest WtP evaluation
under tho proposed Power Rehabilitation project applied on incremental sales and converted
into economic bnef Ita by using of the SCf.  For whatever fuel movings that result form the
comparison betwomn generation cost with and without the projects considered in the time-
slice, th fuel prices considered wher derived from the latest Bank projections.
-     The totel weighted economic value of electricity In averaging at Tk. 4.63/kWh In dometic

Note: For FY 89 while the derived figure for sale of electricity (GIw) is about 4035 Gwh, BPDB's coxistercial statistics indicate that it was 4695 GUh. Ihis higher
sales (resulting in higher revenues) would result in a R.O.R. of above 2 X. Diccrepancies between the fY 89 audited accounts and comaercial statistics are stili
under review by BPDB.
