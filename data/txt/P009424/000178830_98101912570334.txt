I. ENERGY AND THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Consumption
1.01    Annual energy consumption in Bangladesh has been estimated at
about 10.5 million tons standard coal equivalent; (kg ce)l/ in 1979.
Between 70% and 75% of the country's energy requLirements are met from
traditional, non-commercial sources such as firewood, and vegetable and
animal wastes; commercial energy constitutes the remainder. Besides local
natural gas and very limited hydro power potential, imported crude oil and
petroleum products are the main commercial energy sources. Bangladesh's
per capita consumption of commercial energy is i:he eighth lowest in the
world, amounting to only 41 kg ce in 19792/. The per capita consumption
of commercial energy in the world ranged from 14 kg ce (Nepal) to 13,453
kg ce (Canada).3/ Total energy consumption per c:apita in Bangladesh
including traditional fuels, amounted to some 1.30 kg ce in 1979.
Natural Gas
1.02    Natural gas is the main known commercial energy resource of
Bangladesh. There are seven fields, all located in the eastern part of
the country (east of the Brahamaputra/Jamuna River), with aggregate
reserves of about 260 billion cubic meters (cu m). Although preliminary
exploration indicates that natural gas may be found in the west zone, no
commercial quantities of gas have so far been identified. Gas consumption
in 1979/80 amounted to about 1,2 billion cu m of which 75% is used for
power generation and fertilizer plants in the east zone. At an assumed
annual consumption growth rate of 10%, the gas reserves will last for some
33 years, even if no new deposits are found.
Hydro Power
1.03    Although two of the world's largest rivers, the Ganges and the
Brahmaputra, flow through Bangladesh, the potertial for hydroelectric
power is limited as they flow over a flat deltaic area. Only the
1/   1 kilogram standard coal equivalent (kg ce) = 7,000 kilocalories.
2/   Nepal (14 kg ce), Burundi (17 kg ce), EthLopia (20 kg ce), Chad (24
kg ce), Upper Volta (29 kg ce), Mali (30 kcg ce) and Rwanda (30 kg
ce).
3/   World Development Report, 1981 - The Worli Bank, August 1981.



-2-
Karnafuli river has been developed to an installed capacity of 80 MW, with
a further 50 MW under construction at the Kaptai dam, and expected to be
commissioned in 1983. Two additional units of 50 MW each are planned for
1985. The energy from these projects must be utilized during the monsoon
season for reservoir control, and the flow of water from the reservoir
during the dry season is constrained by irrigation requirements. An
overall survey of the hydroelectric potential of the country has not yet
been carried out, and although some additional potential may be
identified, it is not expected to be substantial.
Coal and Peat
1.04    Good quality coal with a heat value of about 6,200 kcal/kg exists
in northwestern Bangladesh, in the Bogra district, with total reserves
estimated at over 1 billion tons. While this exceeds the equivalent of
the proven natural gas reserves, the deposits are at a depth of 850 to
1,060m under soft water-bearing strata. Their extraction would require
sophisticated and costly soil-freezing techniques, which would make their
exploitation under current conditions uneconomic and would require more
than a decade before meaningful quantities could be extracted. The
underground gasification of the coal also does not appear to be
technically feasible. Currently, small quantities of coal are imported
from India. There are some peat deposits in the Faridpur and Khulna
districts. However, the individual fields are relatively small and lie
under prime agricultural land. For these reasons, the mining of peat
appears to be neither technically practical nor economic.
Oil
1.05    Extensive exploration for oil has been going on for more than 15
years, but so far without positive results. Areas for offshore
exploration have been identified following recommendations of commercial
studies by foreign experts in 1973. At present, the country s petroleum
products requirement is covered by imports, partly in the form of crude
oil, which is refined in Bangladesh's only refinery, located at
Chittagong. The refinery which has been in operation since 1968 has a
rated processing capacity of 1.5 million tons. Heavy oil and other
petroleum products from the refinery are used for power generation in the
western zone where no local alternative fuel is available and for peaking
and stand-by fuel in gas-fired plants in the eastern zone.
Power Sector - Background
1.06    Bangladesh is divided into two zones -east and west- by the
Ganges/ Brahmaputra basin. In the past, the annual flooding of rivers has
hindered the construction of road and rail communications as well as
electric power interconnections between the two zones.



-3-
1.07    At the time of partition from India in 1947, the installed power
generating capacity in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) was about 21 MW, of
which 12.5 MW was owned by industry, 7 MW by private utilities and the
balance by various small enterprises. The arnual per capita consumption
of electricity was only about 0.33 kWh. During the following decade, the
Government took over most of the private utilities and developed
additional power facilities, mainly in the fcrm of local generating
stations. Between 1961 and 1970, major generation stations have been
constructed and an integrated transmission system has been created in the
eastern zone through the 132 kV transmission lines Kaptai - Chittagong -
Siddhirganj, and Siddhirganj-Sylhet. In 1970 the total installed capacity
was 535 MW which generated 1,106 GWh, satisfying a maximum simultaneous
demand of only 233 MW. During the events of 1971 which led to the
independence of Bangladesh, power facilities suffered substantial damage,
electricity generation collapsed and maximum demand dropped to 30 MW. It
has since grown to about 460 MW in 1980.
Institutions
1L.08    At the policy making level, the two main Government institutions
involved in the power industry are: (i) the ]?lanning Commission which
coordinates development of the power sector with that of other sectors
and sanctions all the schemes costing more than Tk5 millionl/; and (ii)
the Ministry of Power, Flood Control and Watar Resources which supervises
the sector and to which all power generating and distributing institutions
are accountable.
1.09    The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) was established in
1972, as a statutory Government corporation, to carry out nationwide
responsibilities of generation, transmission anc distribution of electric
power besides the responsibility of system planning and development. BPDB
was the sole authority responsible for the above mentioned functions until
1977, when the Rural Electrification Board (REB) was created to take over
from BPDB the distribution of electricity in rural areas. At present, all
consumers are supplied directly by BPDB except for those areas in which
new rural electrification schemes have been completed by REB.
1/  Projects costing up to Tk5 million are Eubmitted to the Planning
Commission which may recommend changes, but the final decision rests
with the Ministry. Projects costing more than Tk5 million are
evaluated by a Project Evaluation Committee (PEC), chaired by the
Member Planning Commission, in charge of the'sector and submitted to
the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) for
approval.



-4-
1.10    The establishment of REB was the first major step in GOB-s policy
to electrify rural areas. REB's mandate is to embark on an ambitious
rural electrification program using the principle of comprehensive area
coverage through cooperatives. During its short existence, guided by U.S.
experience in rural electrification and with USAID finance, REB has
created 13 cooperatives (Palli Bidyut Samities-PBSs) of which five systems
have been partially energized and the other eight are under construction.
1.11    GOB is also considering the creation of independent entities to
take over, from BPDB, power distribution in major urban areas. Thus,
BPDB, in the long run, is expected to be responsible for generation and
transmission, while distribution of electricity would be the
responsibility of the rural cooperatives and the urban entities, each in
their respective area.
External Assistance
1.12    Bangladesh has been successful in the past in securing foreign
funds for the development of the power sector from various sources. In
1980, foreign loans and grants available for the then ongoing projects of
the sector amounted to about US$430 million equivalent, covering
generation, transmission, distribution, rural electrification, system
rehabilitation, and technical assistance. Since most of this foreign
finance is provided by donors to cover only the foreign costs of BPDB
projects, GOB provides the local cost components, of which 50% is in the
form of equity and 50% as loans.
Existing facilities
1.13    The two separate (eastern and western) power systems will be
unified in a nationwide grid after the completion of the 230 kV east-west
interconnection by the end of 1982. For the time being, and due to the
unequal distribution of energy resources in the country, all power plants
in the west zone are using imported oil while most of the power generation
in the east zone is based on indigenous natural gas and hydro power.
Hence, the average fuel cost per unit generated in the west zone is nearly
Tkl.7/kWh, while it is only TkO.10/kWh in the east zone (due to favorable
gas prices) with an average of TkO.52/kWh for all BPDB's power generation
in 1980/81. This average fuel cost per kWh is expected to decrease after
the completion of the east-west interconnection to TkO.42/kWh in FY1982/83
and to TkO.37/kWh in FY1983/84, as east zone gas fueled generation is
substituted for oil fueled west zone.
1.14    The two existing separate systems cover all four of the country's
administrative divisions which are subdivided into 19 districts. In
FY1980/81, BPDB's installed capacity (including isolated systems) totalled
776 MW, 519 MW (67%) in the east zone and 257 MW (33%) in the west zone
(Annex 1). In addition there is some 188 MW of captive power, owned by

the paper mills in Khulna (24 MW) and Chittagorg (28.5 MW), the steam
station at the fertilizer plant in Fenchuganj (36 MW), the combustion
turbine station at the fertilizer plant in Ghorasal, and a combustion
turbine station with two 15 MW units at the new fertilizer plant in
Ashuganj.
1.15    In 1980, the overall power system incltded some 1,345 km of 132 kV
transmission lines of which about 485 km are dcuble circuit, 5,020 km of
66 and 33 kV sub-transmission lines and 14,280 km of 11 kV and low voltage
distribution lines. A new adequately equipped dispatch center was
installed at Siddhirganj in 1980 to meet the future requirements of the
interconnected system.
1.16    During FY1979/80 and 1980/81, REB, with the finance of USAID, has
completed the construction of 1,030 km of 11 kVr and low voltage
distribution lines for five PBSs which have been energized and initially
supply about 6,500 rural consumers.
Access to Service and Status of Supply
1.17    Total energy generated by BPDB's power plants in FY1979/80 was
2317 GWh, 1729 GWh (75%) in the east zone and 588 GWh (25%) in the west
zone. At the end of FY1979/80, the total number of consumers supplied by
BPDB reached some 522,000, still very low in relation to total population.
Only 1,596 out of a total number of 65,000 vil'Lages have been electrified
which indicates that about 98% of the population in rural areas (about 60
million) don't have access to electricity serv:ice. Because of this, the
per capita consumption was only 16 kWh in 1979/80.
1.18    Of the installed capacity of 736 MW in 1980, only about 626 MW
(85%) were the maximum actually available (426 MW in the east zone and 200
MW in the west zone). This compares with a maximum demand in 1980 of 338
MW in the east zone and 124 MW in the west zone. Although during 1980,
the installed capacity in the west zone has been increased by about 76 MW
of gas turbines which are operated as base load units, the available
capacity in the zone is still critical. Two main factors are expected to
improve capacity availability in both zones; t'ie first is the completion
of the east- west interconnection which will eLiminate the need to operate
combustion turbines as base-load generating units; the second is BPDB-s
power stations rehabilitation program, recommeaded in a study developed in
1980 with ADB finance, for which GOB has already made arrangements to
secure the finance required for implementation.
1.19    At present, the power system suffers from frequent power supply
outages, and voltages as well as frequency are sometimes low and
fluctuating. One main reason for unreliability of supply, in addition to
insufficiency of base load generating capacity in the west zone, is the



-6-
inadequacy of BPDB's distribution facilities, especially in major urban
areas, where lines are too long and overloaded and there is a great need
for additional substation capacity. To improve this situation, the
distribution networks in major urban areas are being rehabilitated and
extended with assistance from external donors such as: IDA/OPEC (Greater
Khulna Power Distribution Project, Credit 934-BD), Asian Development Bank
(Greater Chittagong Power Distribution Project) and the United Kingdom
(Greater Dacca Power Distribution Project). Another cause of the
unsatisfactory supply is the lack of regular preventive maintenance by
BPDB, particularly for generating facilities, due to lack of spare parts
and materials and insufficient numbers of trained personnel. To rectify
the problem of spare parts, BPDB must become financially viable to be able
to finance its import needs and GOB must provide the needed foreign
exchange resources. The problem of manpower can be solved only by
developing adequate training facilities and training large numbers of
personnel, not only for BPDB's own needs but to compensate for emigration
to lucrative positions in the Middle East countries and elsewhere. These
problems are expected to be solved through the ongoing system
rehabilitation program, the ADB financial training program which has been
agreed upon with the two power utilities in Thailand for training BPDB's
staff in Thailand and Bangladesh, and the training program expected to be
financed by the Federal Republic of Germany.
System Losses
1.20    For the past few years, power system losses including station
consumption have been over 35%, which is abnormally high. According to
BPDB's estimates, these losses which reached about 40% in fiscal year
1980, comprized some 26% technical losses, the rest being attributed to
unbilled and unpaid consumption. It is is also estimated that losses in
urban distribution networks (33 kV and lower voltages) are about 18% of
total generation, reflecting overloaded facilities as well as unpaid
consumption due to pilferage, under-billing, and defective metering.
Although BPDB agreed under IDA Credit 934-BD (Greater Khulna Power
Distribution) to carry out a program of system loss reduction, and the
recent GOB "Financial Recovery Plan" requires a gradual system loss
reduction, total system losses have increased from 37% in 1978 to 40% in
1980.
Pattern of Consumption
1.21    Following independence and after the surge in oil prices since
1973, the consumption of electricity has increased at an average annual
rate .of about 13.2% between 1976 and 1981; the average annual rate was
11.2% in the east zone and 20.8 % in the west zone. The annual growth
which was 13.3% in 1979 declined to only 3.9% in FY1980 due to supply
constraints; meanwhile, preliminary figures for FY1981 indicate a growth
of about 21%.



-7-
1.22    Electricity consumption patterns (as a percentage of total
consumption) in FY1974 and FY1980 were as folLows:
Table 1.1: PATTERN OF ENERGY CONSUMP7'ION IN FY1974 AND FY1980
FY1974      FY1980
Agriculture                      0.3          2.;
Industry                        68.3         63.-
Commercial                       8.9         14.0
Domestic                        20.4         16.2
Others                           2.1          3.6
While industrial consumption, as the largest single category, remained
relatively unchanged, the most rapidly growing category was agriculture
which consumed about 15 times in 1980 what it consumed in 1974. The
domestic consumers accounted for 20.4% of total consumption in 1974 but
their share has declined to 16.2 % in 1980 (Annex 2).
1.23    Electricity consumption in rural areas is less than 7% of total
BPDB sales. Only 2% of the population have access to electricity supply,
and not more than about 3,000 pumps out of more than 70,000 irrigation
power driven pumps are run by electricity. To extend access to
electricity in rural areas, REB was established in 1977. Its task is to
carry out the implementation of the Rural Electrification Program with the
objective of providing electricity to households, irrigation pumps, and
small industries in rural areas. REB has effi.ciently carried out its
responsibilities since 1978, and it is expected that by 1985 the total
rural consumption (including BPDB-supplied irrigation) will be more than
300 GWh as compared to about 100 GWh in 1980.
Forecast of Electricity Consumption
1.24    BPDB has based its power market projections on the extrapolation
of recent historic trends, adjusted to take account of specific
development projects in the various sectors oi the economy. For the
period 1980-1990, sales of electricity are expected to increase from 1,462
GWh to 6,318 GWh, at an annual average rate of 15.8% (Annex 2). Assuming
that by 1990 the share of REB-s Rural Cooperat:ive Societies would be about
16% of BPDB's total sales, the pattern of electricity consumption in 1990
would be as follows:

100.0   100.0   16.0   100.0
This comparison reflects the impact of the rural electrification program
on the pattern of electricity consumption due to the expected growth in
rural consumption which is expected to reach about 19% of the total sales
in 1990 as compared to 7% in 1980.
BPDB's Development Program
1.25    BPDB-s program for power development is based on the
UNDP-financed, ADB administered Bangladesh Energy Study, undertaken in
Bangladesh in 1975/76 by a consortium of foreign consultants.l/ The major
objectives of the study were: (i) to assess the prospects of utilizing
natural gas for meeting internal needs, and to determine the foreign
exchange earning potential of natural gas; (ii) to analyze various
interrelated energy supply projects and determine their relevance and
priority for implementation up to the end of the century; and (iii) to
recommend an immediate investment program for energy related projects in
the period up to 1985.  The study concluded that the presently known
reserves of gas will be used to meet internal requirements of energy and
fertilizer production only. Fertilizer should be used locally and
exported only if the domestic demand is lower than the total production.
Liquefaction of natural gas for export, or alternatively production of
methanol was not recommended for immediate implementation. The study
recommended early construction of further gas transmission pipelines, and
the expansion of gas distribution facilities to minimize imports of oil.
A major recomendation of the Energy Study related to the power system
concerned the early consideration of the East-West interconnector; this

-    Italy; and Carlo Lotti Associates, Italy.



-9-
project is under construction and expected to be comfleted by the end of
1982.
1.26    BPDB's investment program up to 1985 (Annex 3) is based on the
Energy Study and the requirements of system expansion to meet the expected
demand till 1990. It consists of a number of ongoing projects which
include an additional hydroelectric unit at KaDtai (50 MW), an oil/natural
gas fired steam unit at Chittagong (60 MW), both in the east zone, and a
large (110 MW) oil/fired steam unit at Khulna in the west zone (the unit
can also burn gas but none is available). These units totalling 220 MW,
are expected to be commissioned in FY1982/83. In addition, initial steps
are now being taken to install a 90 MW combined cycle unit (combustion
turbine/steam turbine) at Ashuganj, which is expected to be commissioned
in FY1983/84. Ongoing transmission projects include the construction of
about 500 km of 132 kV overhead lines to make power available to isolated
areas, especially in the west zone. The major ongoing distribution
projects are Greater Dacca Power Distribution, Greater Chittagong Power
Distribution and Greater Khulna Power Distribution.
1.27    Comparisons of capacity and energy balances estimated and demand
are presented in Annexes 1 and 2. Until the end of 1382 when the
east-west interconnecting transmission line is expectad to be
commissioned, the power supply in the western zone will be precarions,
depending on the availability of the 60 MW unit in Khilna, the only
existing base load unit in the western zone. The capacity margin in the
eastern zone, of only 10% in 1981/82, will rise to cover the margin for
the total interconnected system, reaching 32% in 1985/86 and decreasing to
18%1 by the end of the decade. The addition of 510 MW at Ashuganj and
Ghorasal in 1985 and 1986 is therefore critical for an adequate supply.
1.28    The power sector investment program FY1981-1990 (in million US
dollars) is as follows:

A substantial part of BPDB's investment program as shown in detail in
Annex 3 consists of projects which were started in the past when the
shortage of funds and the total dependence on foreign aid for imported
equipment prevented BPDB from adhering fully to the least cost investment
program suggested in the energy study. A 125 MW nuclear unit shown in
earlier investment programs and found extremely uneconomic by the
Association does not appear in BPDB's current program. In order to place
power system planning on a sound basis, the Government, with the
assistance of BPDB's planning department, established in 1980 a long-range
power development plan for the country which is based on least cost
solutions and the availability of local fuel resources. The Government
agreed, under the Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (Credit
934-BD), on an annual review of the plan in consultation with IDA. The
plan was recently reviewed by BPDB1/ and found acce-table by the mission.
1/ Demand forecasts were reviewed and revised by three firms of local
consultants, using survey, extrapolation, and regression methodology.
Based on th'is forecast, a development program was developed by BPDB
that takes into account interconnection and fuel substitution.



-11-
II.   THE BENEFICIARY.
Historic Background
2.01    Prior to the 1947 partition, the power sector of East Bengal
developed on a private basis. Between 1947 and the late-1950s, a gradual
involvement of the Government in the sector occurred, at first through the
Government's Electricity Department and later through its Electricity
Directorate. During this period, the Government took over a number of
private utilities and also developed additional power facilities, mostly
in the form of isolated generating stations feeding local distribution
networks. In 1959, the East Pakistan Water and Power Development
Authority (EPWAPDA) was created to assure control of water resources and
power development throughout the area. In combining power and water
(irrigation) operations, the Government expected that the operation of
multipurpose hydroelectric dams and the agricultural demand for power
could be closely coordinated. EPWAPDA's power wing took over the
Electricity Directorate with all Government-owned power facilities and
gradually expanded by absorbing more private utilities. It also commenced
the task of establishing power grids in the east and west zones of the
country.
BPDB's Corporate Existence and Responsibilities
2.02    Since there was no major site in the country suitable for economic
development of multipurpose hydro projects, and roalizing that EPWAPDA's
power wing could be operated on a commercial basis whereas the water wing
is dependent on the Government budget, the Government decided to separate
the two activities. Consequently, President's Order No. 59 of 1972 (as
amended) created the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB),
responsible for the development and utilization of the country's water
resources and flood control, and BPDB, both under the supervision of the
Ministry for Power, Flood control and Water Resurces.
2.03    Although conceived as a semi-autonomous body with corporate
status, BPDB in fact functions as a Government department charged with the
responsibility of carrying out Government instructions which are not only
concerned with policy decisions but also with day-to-day matters. BPDB's
main responsibilities are:
(a) preparation, for Government approval, of a comprehensive
plan for the development and utilization of power resources
as well as schemes for construction, maintenance and
operation of power facilities;
(b) construction and operation of generation, transmission and
distribution facilities; and



-12-
(c) control over the operation of private power facilities, when
necessary.
Organization and Management
2.04    BPDB's management consists of a Chairman and not more than five
members, all appointed by the Government. They are responsible for
planning and development, generation/transmission, distribution, finance,
and administration. The period, terms and conditions at which the
Chairman and the members are appointed are solely at the discretion of the
Government. Appointments and dismissals can be made by GOB at any time.
This has led in the past to frequent turnover and, despite the fact that
most of the persons promoted to top management positions have been chosen
from among the members of BPDB's staff, has resulted in lack of
continuity.
2.05    BPDB's organization as illustrated in Annex 4 suggests well
defined lines of responsibility. In fact, however, this is not so.
Although there has been some improvement during the last 2-3 years, there
is still insufficient delegation of authority within BPDB leading to
excessive concentration of decision making at the level of top management.
Overstaffing creates inefficiency and cumbersome administrative
procedures, and, last but not least, the lack of an efficient internal
reporting system leaves managers at all levels insufficiently informed
about the actual status of BPDB's operations and finances.
2.06    As indicated in paragraph 2.03, BPDB has only limited autonomy.
GOB has retained responsibility not only for policy formulation concerning
electric power development within the framework of the country's overall
development plans, but also for day-to-day matters such as creation of
personnel positions and appointment of BPDB's officers, salary levels and
structures as well as budget approval and control. Although undesirable
in the context of effective management, this considers GOB's policy to
control the major sectors of the economy. However, the Government has
indicated that it wishes to use BPDB's expertise in system planning for
continuous updating of the long-range power d-velopment plan for the
country (para. 1.28). This is an important assignment for BPDB, the most
suitable entity for developing power sector plans.
Management Improvement Effort
2.07    ADB has taken the lead among aid agencies in trying to improve
BPDB's efficiency. In the context of four previous loans, ADB has
financed a thorough review of BPDB's management (para. 4.04).



-13-
2.08    Recognizing that BPDB's improvement cannot be achieved solely
through managerial changes, ADB initiated the following additional
activities:
(a) preparation of the Bangladesh Energy Study (para. 1.25),
which includes extensive recommendations concerning the
power sector;
(b) preparation of a countrywide Power System Rehabilitation
Program (para. 4.02);
(c) provision of consulting services for establishing and
introducing an accounting system based on commercial
accounting principles (para. 4.16); and
(d) provision of consulting services for studying BPDB's
level and structure of tariffs (para. 4.05).
2.09    BPDB is still a utility with substantial deficiencies which under
normal circumstances would suggest the introduction of a major institution
building effort on the part of IDA. However, under the prevailing
circumstances, reinforcement of ADB's endeavors rather than initiation of
new activities is considered more conducive to BPDBs recovery.
Personnel
2.10    At the end of 1980, BPDB had a staff of about 22,000 of whom about
32% were unskilled (messengers, sweepers). This translates to about one
employee for 25 customers and less than 40 kW installed capacity per
employee. This is excessive even when considering that BPDB's supply area
is widespread and that most of the recording, in particular accounting and
billing, is carried out manually. Salary and wage scales are set by the
Government and are substantially lower than those in the private sector.
2.11    The management consultant financed by ADB (para. 2.07) has made a
number of recommendations on how to improve per3onnel management.
However, the Government's practice of imposing its ideas about personnel
management and structure, which may be appropriate for Government
departments but are counter-productive when applied to a public utility,
make progress very slow. The introduction of a promotion system that is
based not only on seniority but also on performance would be an
improvement.



-14-
Training
2.12    Despite BPDB's large number of staff, there is a shortage of
trained personnel. This is mainly due to insufficient training because of
shortages of training material and staff resignations, usually the more
highly qualified, ambitious employees.
2.13    Annex 5 describes in some detail the educational and training
facilities available in the country and within the Board for the kind of
personnel required for an electric power utility. In addition, under the
Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (Credit 934-BD), assistance for
the implementation of a training center with an annual capacity of about
300 employees, is being provided to cover BPDB's needs for training staff
in the operation and maintenance of distribution networks. The ongoing
training programs financed from different external sources would also have
a significant contribution in solving the personnel problem (para. 1.19).
The proposed Project includes the installation at Ashuganj of a simulator
to train BPDB-s staff in the operation of steam power plants (paras. 3.01c
and 3.07).



-15-
III.   THE PROJECT
Description
3.01    The Project consists of
(a)  the extension of the Ashuganj steam power plant with two
gas fired units of 150 MW each, including boilers and
ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment;
(b) a 230 kV double circuit 48 km transmission line between
Ashuganj and Ghorasal including a 230/132 kV substation;
and
(c) a simulator to train BPDB's staff for the operation of steam
power plants.
3.02    The Ashuganj power plant is located on the left bank of the Meghna
river, about 70 km north-east of Dacca (see attached maps). The plant
currently is equipped with two gas fired steam tnits of 64 MW each, which
were commissioned in 1970, and a further 90 MW combined cycle unit will be
added by 1983.
Fuel Supply
3.03    Natural gas for the existing Ashuganj power plant is being
supplied from the Titas gas field, located about: 12 km south-east of the
power plant. The gas, which has a methane content of 97%, is extracted by
the Bangladesh Oil & Gas Corporation (Petrobangla) and transported and
distributed by one of its subsidiaries, the Titas Gas Transmission and
Distribution Company Limited. There is a 96 km main pipeline leading from
the Titas field via Ashuganj and Ghorasal to Dacca. The Titas field has
four wells in operation and a fifth well is under construction. Recently,
the Titas pipeline has been connected with the Habiganj gas field. The
total need for fuel at the Ashuganj power plant by the3time the proposed
project will be completed in 1986, is about 155,000 Nm /h. 3Taking into
account the capacity of the existing pipeline of 206,500 Nm /h, it is
obvious that the total gas requirements in the area including the Ghorasal
power plant which is planned to be extended with two 210 MW units, as well
as other existing and future consumers, could nct be covered by this
pipeline alone. Consequently, GOB is planning to install a second
pipeline and to increase the number of wells in the Titas gas field.
During negotiations, GOB agreed to take the necessary steps to ensure an
adequate gas supply for the efficient operation of the Ashuganj power
plant throughout its life.



-16-
Cooling Water
3.04    Water for cooling purposes, fire fighting, preparation of make-up
wat:er and drinking water, is abundantly available from the Meghna river.
Experience with the existing power plant has shown that there are no
sedimentation problems above the water intake.
3
3.05    The cooling water demand of the existing power plant is 22,000 m3/h
and of the planned extension, 34,200 mh, at full capacity operation. The
existing water intake structure was designed for future extension and is
suitable for the proposed operating level. During the period of low water
level, usually from December to April, an inversion of flow occurs when
the water level falls below 2.5 m. The intensity of the upstream directed
flow depends on the actual mean water level and the tidal fluctuations.
In order to avoid cooling water recirculation during periods of low water
levels, the cooling water discharge system was designed and constructed
with a main channel provided for discharging during periods of low water
levels and a secondary channel for discharging at high water levels, when
no inversion of flow direction will occur. It was intended to use the
discharge of the main channel as irrigation water, but the planned
irrigation project has not been realized and therefore the main channel
was not used. Consequently, cooling water is now returned to the river
through the secondary channel, both during high and low water levels.
After the proposed 300 MW extension of the power plant, the utilization of
the two existing channels would be inappropriate, although their capacity
would be sufficient because: (a) the discharge through the main channel
would very likely flood a large plain downstream of the channel outlet
and, moreover, this channel is in a very bad state of repair; and (b) the
discharge through the secondary channel would result in excessive heating
of the water in the river due to recirculation of the cooling water during
low water levels. For these reasons, the consultant has recommended a
solution using outfall pipes.
Transmission of Power
3.06    The generated power will be transmitted from Ashuganj through the
existing 132 kV grid to the consumers in the eastern part of the country
and, through the 230 kV double circuit line included in the proposed
project and the east-west interconnector, to the western part. This would
significantly reduce power generation based on imported oil in the western
part.
Training Simulator
3.07    The training simulator included in the proposed project will offer
training to BPDB's control board operators and plant operators for steam
power units. This system will impart effective training which will help
in more efficient and reliable operation of power plants. It will

inculcate correct and quick operator reactions under emergencies by
simulating abnormalities encountered in the actual operation of a plant,
and by helping to avoid such outages which are the outcome of delayed
reaction by the operator. The simulator would also enable operators to
face all crisis more confidently, and could, in addition, be used to
assess the capability of operators. Board operators as well as plant
operators could be normally trained in operations of steam power units
such as: normal start-up, normal shut-down, synchronisation and loading,
normal control, and operations during emergencies. The training simulator
is expected to have a major contribution in increasing the capability of
BPDB's operational staff.
Project Cost Estimate
3.08    The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during
construction, is Tk 5,911.2 million (US$328.4 million) of wich Tk 4,105.8
million (US$228.1 million) are foreign costs and Tk 1,805.4 million
(US$100.3 million) local costs. The Project cost estimate is set out in

3.09    The estimated Project cost is based on January 1982 figures
deve:Loped by consultants (Lahmeyer International - Federal Republic of
Germany) at the feasibility stage and subsequent'Ly adjusted by the mission
to reflect current price contingency projections.  Physical contingencies
of 5% on civil works and transmission costs and of 10% on plant costs have
been allowed to provide for unforeseable factors.  Price contingencies of
8% in FY1983, 7.5% in FYs1984 and 1985, 6.75% in FY1986 and 6% in FYs1987
for foreign costs, and 12% in FYs1983, 1984 and 1985, 6.5% in FY1986 and
6.3% in FY1987 for local costs were allowed for. Technical assistance
cost estimates - US$10,000/man month in foreign exchange to cover
consultants salaries, overhead, fixed fees and international travel
expenses; and US$1,800/man month in local currency to cover consultants
living allowance, support staff and other local exenditures - reflect cost
of power sector consultancy services in Bangladesh.
3.10    The resulting unit base cost for the power plant, (duties and
taxes not included) Tk 13,330/kW (US$740/kW), is reasonable.
Project Financing Plan
3.11    The proposed project would be financed from the following sources:
Local    Foreign    Total
--US million equivalent--
IDA                           5.3        E6.7      92.0

1/   Approximate US$ equivalent of proposed FRG grant of DM 115 million.
The amount of the FRG grant is based on esi:imates by the KfW of the
cost of the two turbines, and generators anid selected equipment to be
procured in Germany.
2/   Not including interest during construction.



-20-
Because of their different procurement procedures, the participants would
finance separate packages of the Project. The proposed IDA Credit (US$92
million) would cover about 28% of the total cost of the Project and would
be used for financing the foreign cost of the two boilers with ancillary
equipment, part of their local cost, the cost of design of related civil
works and part of the cost of consultants' services. The FRG (KfW)
contribution (DM115 million) would be a grant to BPDB through the
Government, and would be tied to procurement from German manufacturers of
the turbo- generator units including condensers and direct ancillary
equipment. ADB's contribution (US$30.6 million) would cover the total
foreign cost and part of the local cost of the lot of auxiliary electrical
equipment and of the training simulator. The KFAED would contribute with
US$35 million and would also be the administrator of OPEC's contribution
(US$30 million). Their combined participation would cover the total
foreign cost and part of the local cost of the 230 kV line, the
substations and the civil works, as well as part of the consultants'
services. The Government would provide, as necessary, all funds required
to close the financing gap.
3.12    The proposed IDA credit would cover about 40% of the foreign cost
of the Project and about 39% of its total cost. Appropriate cross
effectiveness conditions would be provided in the respective credit
documents pertaining to the funds from other financiers. Agreement will
be reached with the co-financiers that would provide for mutual
cooperation during execution and supervision of the Project.
Environmental Consideration
3.13    As shown in the feasibility study, the operation of Ashuganj power
plant at full capacity should present no environmental problems. The
available natural gas consists of almost pure methane (97.11%) with an
insiginificant content of sulphur (less than 5 ppm) and no other harmful
components.
3.14    Facilities for cleaning up waste waters from the plant would be
provided so that the only polution would be thermal from the heat
discharged from the plant condensers into the Meghna river. The results
of the investigation of cooling water recirculation, carried out by the
consultant by means of a mathematical model, have shown that the maximum
natural temperature of the river water (32.20C) might be exceeded only in
April by about two degrees for a few hours per day. The maximum
temperature increase in the outlet area would be 3.50C but would be
confined to an area of 2002m . The area with a temperature increase
higher or equal to 2 C would extend approximately 400m up-and downstream
from the outlet.
3.L5    The salt content in the water of the river will only rise to a
negligible degree. Chemicals from the water treatment plant will be



-21-
discharged into the river about once in 36 hours. The pH - value of this
water will be between 7 and 9, and a quantity of approximately 120m3will
be discharged during one hour if all four units (existing and extension)
are in operation. Before discharging the waste water into the river, it
will be neutralized in the neutralizing basin of the water treatment
plant. With minimum river flow of about 50,000m3per hour the impact of
the waste water quality of the water treatment plant of 120m3 per each 36
hours, on the total river water salt content can be neglected.
3.16    As far as noise levels are concerned the turbine hall of the power
station, which is the noisiest area of a power plant, would have a sound
pressure level of less than 90 decibels which is well below the maximum
acceptable threshold for the normal 8 hour/day shift worker. The control
room will be provided with sound proof doors, w'"ndows and walls.
Implementation
3.17    Project preparation was partly financed from funds made available
from Credit 872-BD (Third Technical Assistance Credit). BPDB has engaged
consultants (Lahmeyer International), to review detailed design, prepare
bidding documents and specifications, assist in managing all supply and
construction contracts and coordinate all work 1:o ensure timely completion
in spite of probable difficulties that may arise due to the nature and
magnitude of construction capability required by the Project. During the
initial stages of their work the consultants would review the basic design
developed in the feasibility report to confirm :he proposed technical
solutions. The consultants would also finalize, as part of their initial
work, BPDB's proposal concerning suitable bid lots to accommodate the
procurement arrangements with due regard to project timing and cost.
3.18    Unless specific action is taken early by BPDB to expedite
decision-making connected with management of the Project, construction
delays are a distinct possibility on account of BPDB's still cumbersome
administrative procedures. Therefore, BPDB has appointed a project
manager exclusively for the implementation of the Project.
3.19    Bidding and-award of contracts for all main parts of the Project
is expected to be completed by mid-1983. Field work would start beginning
of 1983. The first unit would be placed in commercial operation by
end-1985 and the second unit by mid-1986. An estimated Project
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 7.
Procurement
3.20    All contracts for supply and installation of equipment to be
financed from the IDA Credit would be awarded under Bank Group procurement
guidelines. The items to be financed by the AD3, the Kuwait and OPEC
Funds would be procured in accordance with thei:r own guidelines. The



-22-
contribution of the Federal Republic of Germany to the financing of the
proposed project would be in form of a grant and tied to procurement from
German suppliers of the two turbo-generator units with ancillary
equipment.
Disbursements
3.21    IDA funds would be disbursed against the foreign exchange cost of
contracts awarded under Bank Group procurement guidelines. The
participation of the Federal Republic of Germany (KfW) in the financing of
the Project would be in form of a tied finance. In this case
international competitive bidding would not be applied for the goods
procured from this grant which would be used for the two turbo-generator
units with ancillary equipment. The expected disbursements from the
proposed IDA Credit are shown in Annex 8. Although the expected
disbursement period is shorter than the typical disbursement profiles for
power projects in South Asia in general and in Bagladesh in particular,
it is considered realistic since: (a) the Project is an extension of an
existing power plant; and (b) the proposed Credit would be used for main
equipment (boilers) to be procured in the early stages of implementation.
Risks
3.22    Due to scarcity of local construction capability and BPDB's
cumbersome administrative procedures, some delays may be experienced in
the implementation of the Project. It is, however, expected that the
possible delays would be kept to a minimum through careful coordination
and supervision during construction in which the consultant would have a
major role.
Project Approval
3.23    Project approval involves various steps within the Government and,
consequently, can be a time consuming process. The proposed project has
been included in Bangladesh's Annual Development Program and authorization
for incurring expenditures has been granted: however, approval of the
Project by PEC and ECNEC (para. 1.08) is still outstanding.  Since full
Government support is essential for the successful implementation of the
Project, Government approval of the Project Proforma (summary of project
data) is a condition of Credit effectiveness.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Financial Performance
4.01    BPDB's past financial performance is difficult to evaluate because
of serious deficiencies in recording and the inadequacy of accounting
practices. Moreover, its tariffs were not reflecting the cost of power
supply which has resulted in BPDB's inability to cover its cash operating
expenses in FYs78, 79, and 80, and in total cash deficits of about US$14.5
million in FY78, US$11.9 million in FY79, and US$11.4 million in FY80.
BPDB's accumulated losses at the end of FY79 were about Tk 753.7 million
(US$41.9 million) representing 17.8% of its equity.
The Financial Recovery Plan
4.02    To arrest BPDB's deteriorating financial situation, GOB prepared
in August 1977 a Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) designed to achieve,
through specific steps, gradual cost coverage by revenues in FY82. The
main elements of FRP were: (i) restructuring of BPDB's debt to GOB and
rescheduling of its foreign debt; (ii) reducing system losses; (iii)
revising the tariffs from time to time; and (iv) setting up programs for
system rehabilitation and management improvement. According to FRP, GOB
was committed to provide the local costs of BPDE's investment program (50%
as loans and 50% as equity). Most of the FRP's targets have been achieved
such as: (i) conversion of GOB's pre-liberation loans and 50% of post
liberation loans to BPDB's equity; (ii) conversion of foreign loans
obtained after June 30, 1977 to 25-year loans ircluding five years of
grace; (iii) revision of tariffs which resulted in two tariff increases in
1979 and 1980; (iv) separation of rural electrification investment and its
financing on the basis of GOB grants; and (v) the implementation of system
rehabilitation and management improvement programs. Unfortunately, BPDB
has had insignificant success in reducing system losses.
System Losses
4.03    Section 3.03 of the Project Agreement oi-  Credit 934-BD requires
BPDB to implement a program of system loss reduction. BPDB agreed that it
will take all steps necessary to ensure that the following levels of
system losses, including station consumption, are reached:
Table 4.1: REQUIRED REDUCTION OF SYSTEII LOSSES
System Losses as Percentage
FY                                         of Gross Generation
1979  (actual)                                      37%
1980  (target)                                      34%
1981                                                31%
1982                                                29%
1983                                                27%
1984                                                25%
1985                                                23%



-24-
Instead of being reduced to 34%, losses increased to 40% in FY80. The
impact of such high system losses on BPDB's financial performance is very
serious and offsets any measure of its future improvement including the
past and expected tariff increases. Consequently, and as was required by
IDA, GOB and BPDB submitted before negotiations, a plan of specific
measures designed to gradually reduce the system losses to around 23% in
FY85 and to 20% in FY90. The plan, which was found satisfactory to the
Association, includes the separation of technical and financial losses and
proposals to reduce each category; it also sets out annual targets against
which BPDB's performance can be monitored. It was agreed that
commencement of loss reduction measures is a condition of credit
effectiveness.
Management Improvement Effort
4.04    With financial assistance from ADB, an independent consultant,
assisted by the Institute of Business Management of the Dacca University,
completed a study for BPDB's management improvement in August 1980. The
consultant has recommended a partial reorganization of BPDB with the
objective of providing more delegation of authority, spreading the load of
wgork more evenly, removing overlaps of responsibilities and establishing
new office procedures as required. Some of the recommendations of the
consultant have been accepted by BPDB, but others are still under
discussion. To ensure a time limit for the implementation of all these
recommendations GOB and BPDB submitted - before negotiations - a plan of
action satisfactory to the Association aimed at implementation of the
consultant's recommendations regarding management improvement. It was
agreed that BPDB shall carry out the implementation of the plan and GOB
shall take all such action as may be necessary to enable BPDB to implement
the plan.
Tariffs
4.05    During the Appraisal of the Greater Khulna Power Distribution
Project (Credit 934-BD) it was found that BPDB's poor financial
performance was not only due to its inefficient operation but also to the
insufficient earning levels. The average revenue of US$0.03 per kWh sold
was considerably below the economic cost of supply and it was among the
lowest averages if compared to neighbouring countries. Because of this
situation a tariff increase of about 38% was introduced in September 1979.
In October 1980 a further tariff increase was introduced and at the same
time the tariff structure was changed, resulting in an average rate
increase of 47% (Annex 9). As a result of these two increases the average
revenue per kWh sold is expected to be about Tk 0.99 (US$0.055) in FY82
instead of Tk 0.47 (US$0.03) prior to September 1979. The existing tariff



-25-
of October 1980, although lower than that developed in a studyl/ based on
long-run marginal cost, is considered a real achievement towaras
realization of a financial break-even situation despite the constraints of
increased system losses and the surge of fuel prices. However, this
tariff will not realize, starting from FY83, a nE!t internal cash
generation sufficient to finance a reasonable percentage of BPDB's
investment program as required by Section 4.04 of Credit 934-BD. GOB and
BPDB agreed, to review the existing tariff to enEure a realization of net
internal cash generation sufficient to finance at; least 20% of BPDB's
capital expenditure in FY83, 25% starting from FY84 and 40% starting from
FY87. With the assumed reduction in system losses, a substantial tariff
increase is required early in FY83 to achieve these objectives. The
tariff increase required to meet the covenant in FY87 will depend on the
new tariff structure which shall be introduced orL July 1, 1985 (para.
4.13).
Rural Bulk Tariff
4.06    In October 1980 GOB approved a new tariff for all consumers of
BPDB including a bulk tariff for the Rural Electricity Cooperatives (PBSs)
of Tk/kWh 0.78. REB disagrees with this tariff for the following main
reasons: (i) the rate is significantly higher thLan BPDB's retail tariff
to its domestic consumers which creates problems in areas where BPDB
supply and PBSs supply are in the immediate neighbourhood; and (ii) the
rate is based on a study in which the high system losses of BPDB (about
37%) with no assumed improvement are incorporated, increasing the cost of
supply.  During appraisal, GOB indicated its readiness to solve the
problem through granting a Government subsidy which would cover the
difference between the realistic cost of supply of power from BPDB and
what could be charged to PBSs according to their financial capabilities.
Accordingly, GOB submitted as a condition of negotiations, a subsidization
formula satisfactory to the Association (Annex 10). This subsidization
formula is based on a method which was suggested previously by the
Association and agreement was reached that the subsidy shall be provided
by GOB to REB and shall be phased out after the :-irst five years of each
PBS's operation. It was agreed during negotiations that as long as the
subsidy for PBSs is much less related to the Project than it is related to
the Rural Electrification Project, which was negotiated at the same time,
the subsidy covenant is to be included in the latter Project.
Fuel Adjustment Clause
4.07    During the past two years, domestic and Lmported fuel price
increases affected heavily the financial performance of BPDB. Fuel costs
1/ Tariff study by Cooper & Lybrand Associates Ltd. and financed by ODM.



-26-
represented about 50% of BPDB's total operating expenses in FY79 and about
71% of total operating expenses in FY81. The average fuel cost per kWh
generated in FY79 was Tk 0.20 while in FY81 it is Tk 0.52. Due to this
tremendous surge in fuel prices the two tariff increases of September 1979
and October 1980, though substantial, have not had the expected impact on
BPDB's financial results. To mitigate the impact of fuel cost increases
in the future, it was agreed that, on the basis of quarterly review,
BPDB's tariff would include provisions satisfactory to the Association for
necessary adjustments to cover changes in domestic or foreign fuel prices.
Desirable Financial Performance (Annex 11)
Operating Ratio
4.08    Section 4.03 of the Project Agreement of Credit 934-BD requires
BPDB to achieve certain operating ratios. As a result of two tariff
increases in September 1979 (about 38%) and in October 1980 (about 47%),
operating ratios have been or are expected to be as follows compared with
the covenant:
Table 4.2: EXPECTED OPERATING RATIOS
1978/79    1979/80    1980/81    1981/82
Operating Ratio Covenant        -          135%        120%       100%
Actual (through FY80) and
Forecast                      146%      132%        120%        116%
According to BPDB's actual figures of FY80 and its provisional figures
of FY81, the required operating ratios have been achieved in the past.
Despite the expected differences between the covenant requirement and the
expected results for FY82, a gradual improvement towards break-even is
occuring. Moreover, the operating ratios in FY81 and FY82 are heavily
affected by the higher than expected increases in fuel prices. The
comparison between fuel prices considered at appraisal of Credit 934-BD
and actual fuel prices in 1980 and 1981 is as follows:

Except for these extraordinary increases in fuel prices, the two tariff
increases of September 1979 (38%) and of October 1980 (47%) were expected
to realize the required operating ratios through FY82.  Recent
information, however, shows that this could be accomplished only with an
additional small tariff adjustment. As described in para. 4.05 however,
realization of the 20% internal cash generation in FY83 requires a
substantial tariff increase early in that fiscal year.
Net Internal Cash Generation
4.09    Section 4.04 of the Project Agreement of Credit 934-BD required
BPDB to take all action necessary to ensure that, with effect from FY83,
tariffs are set at levels that provide revenues sufficient to (i) cover
its administration and operating expenses; and (ii) produce an annual rate
of return on BPDB-s currently valued net fixed assets in operation
sufficient to cover all interest payments and cther charges on debt, and
repayment of debt when due as far as such repayment exceeds depreciation,
and to finance a reasonable portion of BPDB's investment program. For the
proposed Credit, and as long as the operating ratio covenant does not
extend beyond FY82, the covenant of Section 4.C'4 of the Project Agreement
of Credit 934-BD should continue with agreement as to reasonable
percentages of BPDB's investment program to be financed from its net
internal sources. During negotiation it was agreed that BPDB shall cover
at least 20% in FY82/83, 25% in FY83/84 and 40% from FY86/87 (para. 4.05).
In calculating the percentage of net internal cash generation versus
investments, a three-year average comprising two actual and one forecast
year for the average investment expenses will be used. For the net
internal cash generation the result of the respective second actual year
will be included.
Debt Equity Ratio
4.10    According to the Financial Recovery Plan, BPDB depends on the
following sources to finance its investment program:



-28-
(a) Foreign loans granted to GOB and onlent to BPDB
to finance the foreign currency component.
(b) Taka loans from GOB to finance 50% of the local
capital expenditure.
(c) Taka equity from GOB to finance 50% of the local
capital expenditure.
As a result of the tentative financing arrangement for BPDB's heavy
investment program, its debt/equity ratio is expected to rise from 60:40
in FY81 to 74:26 in FY87. To avoid such a high debt/equity ratio, GOB
agreed to revise, its arrangement of financing BPDB's investment program
by increasing its equity contributions to maintain a debt/equity ratio of
not more than 60:40. The required debt/equity ratio has been considered
in the financial projection as well as in the financing plan.
Revaluation of BPDB's Fixed Assets in Operation
4.11    Under Sectin 4.04 of the Project Agreement of Credit 934-BD, BPDB
is required - starting from FY83 - to produce a rate of return on its
currently valued net fixed assets in operation sufficient to cover
interest expenses and repayments of its debt as far as such repayments
exceed depreciation and to finance a reasonable portion of BPDB's
investment program. As BPDB has not yet revalued its fixed assets in
operation, it was agreed that BPDB shall, commencing its fiscal year 83,
annually revalue in a manner satisfactory to the Association its fixed
assets in operation. For the assessment of BPDP's future performance, a
separate statement (Annex 12) is attached which shows the expected rates
of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation during the projected
period.
Long-term Debt Revaluation
4.12    BPDB has not increased its long-term debt liability to reflect
current rates of exchange. Therefore, BPDB agreed to recalculate,
starting from FY83 its debt payable in foreign currency on the basis of
the current exchange rate.
Future Financial Situation
4.13    BPDB-s financial situation as it is expected to develop during the
financial projection period FYs81 to 87 (Annex 11) is summarized in the
following table:

(b) On currently valued average net fixed assets in operation.
The above results are based on assumptions for BPDB's performance as
stipulated in this report. In addition to the financial considerations,
two additional factors have a crucial effect on BPDB's financial
performance. First, the system loss reduction (para 4.03) and, second,
the completion of the interconnection between the eastern and western
zone. The absence of both factors are not only limiting BPDB's financial
improvement, but they are also hindering BPDB to undertake a fully
meaningful tariff study that avoids charging consumers with additional
avoidable costs. Therefore, during negotiations, it was agreed that GOB
shall: (a) by December 31, 1984 (i) carry out a study, under terms of
reference and with the assistance of consultants satisfactory to the
Association, of the bulk and retail tariffs to be applied in the power
sector taking into account the long-run marginal cost of supplying
electricity and other financial considerations, and (ii) furnish to the
Association the findings and recommendations of such study; and (b) by
July 1, 1985 or such later date as the Association may agree, implement
the tariff structure and such other recommendations of said study as the
Borrower and the Association shall have agreed.
1/ The declining rate of return is due to substantial pent up demand in
investments, particularly for distribution. It is expected that the
rates will again increase when BPDB's network will have been fully
rehabilitated.

BPDB may be able to finance about 29.7% of its requirements from  internal
sources during FYs82-87. GOB finance for BPDB's investment program during
the same period is expected to be Tk 6,805.2 million of which Tk 2,821.5
million (41%) as long term loans and Tk 3,983.7 million (59%) as additions
to BPDB's equity. The foreign borrowings will be about US$1,032 million
of which US$228 million represent the foreign component of the project



-31-
cost. The balance of US$804 million is required for other projects
included in BPDB's investment plan for which GCB has succedded to make
available about US$400 million.
Onlending Terms
4.15    The Borrower (GOB) shall relend the prcoceeds of the proposed IDA
Credit to BPDB under a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered into
between GOB and BPDB under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association. The loan should be for a term of 25 years (including 5 years
of grace). The Financial Recovery Plan (para 4.02) which is currently
implemented by GOB includes the requirement that all foreign loans are to
be onlent to BPDB at an interest rate of 5%. As this rate no longer
reflects the real cost of borrowing, it was agreed that the onlending rate
of interest for the proposed Credit shall be 11.5% with the exchange risk
to be borne by BPDB. Signing of the onlending agreement between GOB and
BPDB with terms and conditions acceptable to IDA would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
System of Accounts
4.16    BPDB has followed unacceptable accounting practices under which
the recording of revenues was on an accrual basis whereas expenditures
were recorded on a cash basis. Materials and supplies were frequently
charged to expense and not to inventory; fixed assets accounting was
inadequate. Aiming at accounting system reform, BPDB, with ADB's
assistance, has appointed the firm of Sycip, Gores and Velayo (SGV) of the
Philippines to design and implement a commercical accounting system
appropriate for a public utility enterprise. Although the consultants had
completed the design stage in 1979, some of their essential
recommendations were not accepted by BPDB while ADB was urging BPDB to
implement the new system as developed by the consultants. In September
1980 BPDB and ADB reached agreement on all the controversial issues;
moreover, they agreed that the contract with Su:V should be revised to,
first, ensure timely and effective implementation of the accounting reform
including guidance and training of BPDB's staff; second, to issue a set of
office orders for the implementation of the system; and third, to change
over to the new system by January 1, 1981 on a trial basis until it would
be fully operational by July 1981. The consulting firm completed (on May
30, 1981) its additional assignment by developing five manuals for system
implementation, updating the accounts of FY75 to FY78 including fixed
assets, inventory, accounts receivable, bank rE!conciliation, subsidiary
records and conducting formal training for abot.t 658 of BPDB's staff
besides on-the-job training and guidance. BPDE has also issued the
necessary office orders and developed a new organizational chart for the
financial and commercial activities under the 'Member Finance" according
to the consultants' recommendations. However, despite the considerable
effort which has been devoted to implement the new system, it is obvious



-32-
that: intensive efforts are still needed to ensure the proper
implementation of the new system including meter reading, billing and
collection. Accordingly, and in line with the requirement of Section 4.01
of the Project Agreement of IDA Credit 934-BD (Greater Khulna Power
Distribution) which requires BPDB to maintain records that adequately
reflect its operation and financial conditions, BPDB submitted, before
negotiation, a plan of action satisfactory to the Association for
completing the implementation of the new accounting system in the head
office and regional offices, including steps towards realizing the
consultants recommendations for both the financial accounts and the
commercial activities of meter-reading, billing and collection. During
negotiations it was agreed that BPDB shall by December 1983, implement
fully throughout its entire operation an accounting system satisfactory to
the Association.
Billing and Collection
4.17    At the end of FY80 BPDB had about 522,000 customers of which
213,000 were classified as industrial and commercial, 293,000 as domestic,
3,000 irrigation pumps, and 11,500 miscellaneous customers. During the
appraisal of Credit 934-BD, it was found that BPDB bills only about 67% of
its consumers. Therefore, BPDB was required to improve billing and
collection procedures through carrying out a program of action which in
fact was one of the tasks assigned to the accounting consultant. Because
of the delay in implementing the consultant's recommendations, recent
assessment of billing and collections does not show a significant
improvement in either. Actual figures of the period from July 1980 to
March 1981 indicate that not more than 70% of BPDB's consumers are being
billed. Visits to the commercial regional offices showed that the
implementation of the consultant's recommendations is still at the initial
stage and the system is suffering from inadequate procedures and recording
besides shortage of capable staff.
4.18    Sales and collections during the period from July 1980 to April
1981, as recent reliable indicators of BPDB-s commercial activities, are
as follows:

1,416.0    1,123.1   79        927.0         T2-65.
The above table shows that billing represents only 79% of the sales
target.  Although collections are about 82.5% of the billed consumption,
they represent only 65% of the sales' target which :'s considered serious
for both efficient cash budgeting and availability of sufficient cash to
cover the operating expenses. BPDB's provisional fi'gures at the end of
FY81 indicate that unpaid billed consumption is about TK 670.0 million
(US$37.0 million), equal to the average billing of 4.6 months. Most of
these arrears represent the unpaid consumption of Government Agencies and
Public Sector Corporations for which Government action is necessary.
Consequently, GOB agreed to take all necessary action to cause Government
Agencies and Public Corporations to settle their delbts to BPDB by December
1983 and to pay their electricity consumption in future in a manner that
does not allow their cumulative unpaid consumption to exceed - at any time
- the average consumption of two months. BPDB also agreed to take all
action to keep its accounts receivable from sales of power, at any time,
within a maximum of 20% of its sales- forecast as ccnsidered in its
approved annual budget. It was also agreed that, as a condition of Credit
effectiveness, BPDB shall furnish a program, satisfEctory to the
Association, to improve its collection procedures aed carry out the
implementation of such program taking into account the Association-s
comments.
Audit
4.19    Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement of Credit 934-BD (Greater
Khulna Power Distribution Project) requires BPDB: (i) to have its accounts
and financial statements for each fiscal year audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association; (ii) furnish to the Association
not later than six months after the end of each such year commencing with
fiscal year 1982, (a) certified copies of its financial statements for
such year as so audited and (b) the report of such audit by said auditor.
This requirement considered that no audit had been carried out during
three years before the appraisal, which took place in the first half of
1979. Recently, BPDB has appointed independent chartered accountants
(S.F. Ahmed & Co.) to carry out its audit starting from FY76 and three



-34-
audit reports covering FYs76-78 were prepared by March 1981. Review of
these audit reports revealed that the audit has been carried out in a
satisfactory manner and cover all aspects of BPDB's activities as a
commercial entity. For this reason, and due to the fact that BPDB is now
shifting to the new accounting system, it was agreed that the requirement
of Section 4.02 of Credit 934-BD shall continue except that the six-month
period, allowed after the end of each year for furnishing the financial
statement and the audit report, is extended to nine months.



-35-
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01    The proposed project is justified as t:he least-cost solution to
provide new base load capacity of 300 MW in Bangladesh by 1985/86.  Specific
aspects are discussed below.  The minimum internal rate of return of the
project is about 13%, if tariff revenue is used as proxy for benefits, and
about 20% in economic terms including part of consumers surplus.
Location
5.02    As work on the transmission line connecting the eastern and western
grids of the country is progressing well, there is no immediate need to place
further base load capacity in the west where no natural gas is available.
The interconnector is scheduled for completion in 1982/83, and will enable
BPDB to maximize generation in the east and tr-ansfer energy to the west.
Accordingly, any major base load additions should utilize the natural gas
fields in the east. The economic cost of using natural gas is estimated to
be about Tk 0.97/cm, as compared to about Tk 1.45/cm-equivalent for imported
oLl that would have to be utilized in the wesi:.
5.03    The choice of sites in the east is limited: the consultants' report
indicates that expansion of existing plant is considered most feasible at
Chorasal, Ashuganj, and Chittagong. Other sites either do not have
sufficient expansion capacity or are otherwiseo unsuitable. The Ghorasal
expansion by two 210 MW units is already planned to be implemented
concurrently with the proposed project, leaving Ashuganj and Chittagong as
aLternative locations. The pipeline from the Bhakrabad gas field to
Chittagong (currently under implementation) wLll allow significant expansion
of generation in the Chittagong area.  However, the site is not suitable for
expansion by the full 300 MW, as a further unLt of 150 MW is planned for
commissioning at Chittagong by 1989.  The only realistic alternative to
placing the full 300 MW in Ashuganj, therefore, is a splitting of this
capacity between Ashuganj and Chittagong which would be more costly than
concentrating it at Ashuganj, which is also c:Loser to major load centers and
the east-west interconnector.
Unit Type and Size
5.04    The consultants have examined various types and sizes of generating
units, and have determined that the selection of two 150 MW gas-fired steam
thermal units is the least-cost solution under the circumstances prevailing
in Bangladesh. Within a wide range of discount rates and fuel price
assumptions, the present value of the cost of the proposed project is lower
than that of three 100 MW units, two 150 MW combined cycle units,l/ or two
150 MW coal-fired steam units (Annex 13). 15') MW is the largest admissible
1/ A useful life of 9 years has been assumed for the 4x50 MW combustion
turbine components of the combined cycle ;1s compared with 25 years for
the 2x150 MW (2x100 MW) steam power units.



-36-
unit size in the system which would ensure sufficient flexibility of
operation, in view of the expected maximum demand at the time of
commissioning. The 210 MW unit to be installed at Ghorasal during the same
period (see Annex 1), has been accepted by GOB under a bilateral agreement
since a smaller unit was not available.
Overall Least-cost Solution
5.05    Having determined that two 150 MW steam units are the best type and
size, the two major alternative solutions (300 MW in Ashuganj, or 150 MW each
in Ashuganj and Chittagong) were examined including different transmission
requirements. The gas pipeline to Chittagong is considered sufficient to
supply an additional 150 MW of gas-fired generation there. Costs are
expressed in CIF terms or border price equivalents, and unskilled labor is
shadow priced (Annex 14). While the Ashuganj solution requires double
circuit 230 kV transmission lines between Ghorasal and Ashuganj, and Ashuganj
and Comilla, the alternative requires an additional single circuit 230 kV
line between Comilla and Chittagong. Cost streams of the project and the
alternative are presented in Annex 15. The Project's discounted cost is
lower than that of the alternative at any discount rate, and within a
realistic range of assumptions about the relation between the costs of the
Project and the alternative (Annex 17). (The costs of either plant would
move together-except perhaps for foundations).
Internal Rate of Return
5.06    The internal rate of return of the Project has been calculated by
using (i) tariff revenues, and (ii) economic valuation of electricity inputs
by consumers (including part of consumers surplus) as proxy for project
benefits. The expected 1982/83 average revenue per kWh sold is assumed to
represent the minimum value attached to electricity by consumers. The
economic version of the benefits values electricity at the cost of using an
alternative energy source, the value declining to the tariff level with
increasing consumption (Annex 14). On the cost side, the base case assumes a
real increase of fuel prices of 3% p.a. Additional cost of transmission and
distribution has been allocated to the project to reflect valuation at the
retail level (Annex 14). The cost and benefit streams are presented in Annex
16.
5.07    Using tariff revenues as the benefit proxy, the internal rate of
return is about 13%. The rate of return increases to about 14% if fuel
prices are assumed to remain constant in real terms, and decreases to about
11% if costs are 10% higher or benefits 10% lower. The economic estimate of
benefits results in a rate of return of about 20% (Annex 17). The rate of
return is satisfactory, even if based on tariff revenues only, indicating
that tariff levels, if maintained in real terms, are generally adequate in
economic terms to support the project.



-37-
Tariffs and Cost of Supply
5.08    Recent consultants' studies and other es;timates 1/ indicate that
long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of power supply in Bangladesh ranges between Tk
1.0/kWh and Tk 2.30/kWh in domestic terms, depending on supply voltage and
consumption pattern. It is likely that the LRMC for domestic and
agricultural consumers is between Tk 1.80 and Tk 2.30/kWh, while high-voltage
industrial supply would have a significantly lowrer cost. The sales-weighted
LRMC for the BPDB system is estimated to be about Tk 1.75/kWh. The expected
average tariff increase from Tk 0.99//kWh to about Tk 1.39 in 1982/83, and
Tk 1.54/kWh in 1983/84 constitutes a significant: step towards the long-term
goal of approaching the weighted LRMC level. Fturthermore, tariffs have been
restructured recently to reflect different costs associated with peak and
off-peak supply: a changeover to time-of-day met.ering for large consumers is
under implementation. However, significant cross-subsidization of urban
domestic consumers by other consumer categories is still evident. During
negotiations, GOB agreed to address this issue, together with an updating of
the analysis of the overall tariff structure in the sector, in a power tariff
sector study, to be prepared by consultants by Dlecember 1984. The findings
of the study will be implemented by July 1, 1985. The timing is appropriate
to enable the study to take into account system operation characteristics

Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB)
Training
This annex describes GOB's and BPDB's educational and training
facilities available in Bangladesh as far as they are of importance for
electric power utilities.
A.      Public Institutions
2.      Bangladesh has the following public ecucational institutions:
(a)   4 colleges in Dacca, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahid.
Dacca has university status;
(b)   18 polytechnic institutes; and
Cc)   about 30 vocational training centers.
Colleges
3.      All four colleges offer a wide variety of courses among which are
those for engineering sciences, commerce and accounting. Depending on the
kind of course, studies take 2-4 years. About: 800 engineers per year
graduate from all colleges. The breakdown of the graduating engineers is
about as follows:
(a)   300 electric engineers;
(b)   200 mechanical engineers; and
(c)   300 civil engineers.
In addition, the graduating classes include a few chemical engineers.

Politechnic Institute
4.      The polytechnic institutes offer 3-year courses for technicians
with a total of about 2,400 graduates per year. About 30% are electrical
technicians, 20% mechanical, 30% civil and the remainder are technicians
for other trades.
Vocational Training Centers
5.      There are about 30 vocational training centers in the country with
about 200 students per institute. On average 60% of the students who
enter classes eventually finish the training.
Quality of Public Training Institutions
In the opinion of the staff members of the Power Board who the
wission interviewed, the quality of the training in the university and
colleges is very good. Teachers are first rate and adequate training
e4uipment and material is available. Unfortunately, this is not so for
the polytechnic institute and vocational taning centers which suffer both
£r-'m insufficiently trained teachers as well as a shortage of trainaing
equipAent.
Cost of Training
7.      Although tuition is subsidized by the Goverament, the total cost
of education in Bagladesh is expensive when compared to prevailing
fmily iacome.  This is pirticularly true for families living outs'ie the
major urbar centers, especially  Dacca, who, in addition to the tuition
fees, have to defray the cost for boarding and subsistence. The
approximate motbhly cost per student is as follows:
(a)   Coll6ges:  tuition               Tk 40.00
boarding                3*00.0
TW40Q.Q  (about US$22.00)
(b).  FQlytedhmic lastitutem:
tuition             Tk 3G.00
boarding              20(Q .00

Wee to the sufficteat mwmber of vQcatimal traitnig centers, only
a small nuimber of students must use boarding facilities.

8.      Although not substantial in absolute terms, the cost of education
is high when compared to family income levels in Bangladesh. The
monthly salary of middle management employees in BPDB is about US$70.00
per month.
B.      BPDB's Training Facilities
9.      At present, BPDB operates the following training centers:
Kaptai Engineering Academy
10.     The Kaptai Engineering Academy is BPEB's largest training center
and offers the following classes:
(a)   induction training for engineers recruited from college;
(b)   training for power plant operators and cable jointers;
(c)   special programs (refresher courses) for senior engineers;
(d)   management training for administrative officers; and
(e)   seminars for accountants and finance officers.
The center can accomodate 150 participants at a time.
Donghi (Dacca)
11.     This center offers seminars on selected topics for senior
engineers. It has a capacity for 150 participants and can provide
accomodation for 50 persons.

Notes on Financial Statements
Average Revenues Per kWh Sold
Based on the existing tariff, the average revenue per kWh sold in
FY82 will be Tk 0.99. Increases of around 402 in FY83, 11% in FY84 and
25% starting from FY87 are assumed to meet the requirements of para. 4.09.
Fuel
In 1980/81 BPDB paid the following prices for fuel:
Furnace Oil              Tk -per Imp. Gal.      16.68 (US$0.93)
High Speed Diesel        Tk -per Imp. GA1.      22.50 (US$1.25)
Titas Gas - (Local)      Tk -per 1000 cft        9.30 (US$0.52)
The following increases in fuel prices are assumed in the financial
projection:
Local Gas           :   10% every year
Imported Fuel Oil  :    8% every year
Personnel
The actual number of BPDB's staff is about 21,973 of which 8,193
(37%) are unskilled and support staff who have minor functions in BPDBs
main or subsidiary activities. Meanwhile, recommendations of consultants
in both management and accounting system revealed shortages of staff in
some professional and technical specializatior.; further, additional
professional and skilled staff will be needed to meet the requirement of
system expansions as reflected in BPDB's investment program. This as well
as recruitment of new technical and professional staff require an annual
increase of 15% to cover the cost of additional staff, cost of living
adjustments and promotion.
Operation, Maintenance, and Administration
An annual increase of 10% has been assumed for FYs82-83, 11.5% for
FY84-87, and 12% for FYs88-90.



ANNEX 11
Page 5 of 5 pages
-60-
Depreciation
The assumptions are based on an annual depreciation rate of 3.2%
- on straight line basis - on average fixed assets in operation and in
line with the Financial Recovery Plan requirements.
Interest Expenses
Interest rate has been assumed at 11.5% for both the local and
foreign borrowings starting from FY82/83.
Rate of Return
Besides the calculation of the rate of return on fixed assets at
historical cost, a separate table is provided in which fixed assets in
operation are revalued and the rate of return is calculated on that basis.
Financing of Local Project Costs
According to the Financial Recovery Plan 50% of the local cost of
BPDB's investment program is to be financed by GOB as equity contribution
and 50% as long-term loans. However, to maintain a debt/equity ratio of
not more than 1.5:1, GOB's contribution to BPDB's equity should be revised
from time to time to meet this covenant.
Accumulated Profit and Loss
As a result of the past accounting deficiency of charging material
and supplies directly to expenses, BPDB - during FY80 - increased its
inventories with the materials and supplies (amounting to Tk 840.7) which
had been erroneously charged to expenses during previous years
Recording these as assets eliminated all its accumulated losses through
the end of that fiscal year.

Cost and Benefit Assumptions
Costs
1.     Foreign components of costs are estimated in CIF terms and are
unchanged from project cost estimates.
2.     Local cost components are converte,l to border price equivalents
by using a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.75.
3.     Unskilled labor costs are valued at 50% of market price, and
converted by using the SCF.
4.     For   both project and alternative, a mid-1981 economic cost of
natural gas (extraction and distrizution cost plus depletion premium)
of Tk. 16/MCF is estimated. Separate fuel cost streams for the
assumptions of (i) constant fuel price in real terms, and (ii) real
increase in fuel prices of 3% p.a. (base case) are prepared.
5.     Operating and maintenance cost for the general plant is obtained
from the consultants' feasibility report (lahmeyer International)
and suitably border-priced. O&M cost for new transmission lines is
assumed to amount to 2% of cumulative capital cost.
6.     The cost of the extension of an existing generating plant by only
one 150 MW unit is calculated as about 61% of the cost of an exten-
sion by two such units.
7.     The cost of transmission lines in lomestic terms is assumed to be:
230 kV double circuit          US$ 160,000/km
230 kV single circuit          US$ 130,000/km.
8.     The average annual investment on transmission and distribution in
Bangladesh amounts to about 100% of generation investment between
1981 and 1985, and about 85% of geaeration investment thereafter.
A notional amount for transmission and distribution investment beyond
the project's direct transmission zomponent is added to the
project cost to reflect system investment needs when comparing costs
to benefits at retail level.
Benefits
9.     The expected 1982/83 average tarif:- revenue, adjusted to border
price equivalents by using the SCF, is used as proxy for the minimum
observable benefits.

10.     Beyond this minimum benefit, part of consumer surplus is identified
by expressing the value of power supply to the consumers as the cost
of using an alternative energy source for the same   purpose, the
valuation declining with increasing consumption along a downward
sloping demand curve to the minimum value represented by the tariff
(or, in appropriate cases, by the tariff plus private cost of elec-
tricity use). The valuation is conservative, as only a negligible
share of consumption is valued at the full cost of the alternative,
neglecting a possibly large share of replacement demand.
