The key areas covered by\n            the SPAL are social insurance (including pensions and\n            short-term insurance for sickness and maternity),\n            unemployment assistance, social assistance, and child\n            allowances. In addition, the SPIL will support a broader\n            program for social protection including monitoring systems,\n            data analysis, and reviews of on-going programs for\n            unemployment and social protection. The SPIL will be\n            disbursed in three tranches, the first of which will be\n            released upon loan effectiveness. The first of the five\n            components, pension reform, includes technical assistance\n            and training in managing worker accounts, establishing a\n            regulatory framework, auditing, implementing an action plan\n            to improve collections, preparing legislation, designing and\n            implementing a public information campaign, and organizing\n            actuarial activities. The second component, social\n            assistance, will provide technical assistance and training\n            to help the government design and implement programs,\n            including some pilots, in certain oblasts; conducting\n            national evaluation and dissemination programs; reviewing\n            social benefits and other allocations; and reviewing the\n            system of local delivery of social services. The third\n            component, social protection, will help the government put\n            in place a system monitoring all regional and national\n            social transfers; analyze data and monitor poverty and\n            nutrition levels; survey household welfare and program\n            participation nationally; and review governmental and\n            non-governmental programs aimed at child protection, the\n            handicapped, and the homeless. The fourth component, child\n            allowances, provides technical assistance, training, and\n            equipment supporting pilot programs. The fifth component,\n            unemployment assistance, provides technical assistance and\n            training to design and implement a system monitoring\n            unemployment and changes in response to new laws or\n            measures; and to establish an adequate system of social\n            assistance during heavy unemployment."}, "docdt": "1997-09-10T00:00:00Z"}
