The lessons learned\n            indicate that Social Protection Implementation Loan (SPIL)\n            had a sufficient degree of flexibility to provide adequate\n            reform-oriented technical assistance to the government in an\n            uncertain environment. SPIL had many small-scale Technical\n            Assistance (TA) contracts which made project management more\n            complicated. The regional governments in which SPIL pilot\n            projects were implemented were actively involved in\n            preparation of assignments which contributed to the success\n            of project activities, most notably on child allowances\n            program. Although the project involved numerous activities\n            to disseminate materials through seminars and publications,\n            more could have been be done to provide access to the\n            experience obtained, for example, putting materials on\n            internet. SPIL itself would have benefited from a PR\n            campaign to explain to a wide audience, especially the State\n            Duma and other state agencies, the purpose and objectives of\n            the project. Given the high volume of procurement for the\n            project, the contract with the external procurement firm was\n            of great assistance. Outsourcing of some procurement work in\n            such a complex project helps assure that procurement moves smoothly."}, "docdt": "2004-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
