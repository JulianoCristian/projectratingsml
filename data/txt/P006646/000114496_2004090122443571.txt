Re:
CHILE:   -  Loan No. 3331-CH (Second Valparaiso
Water Supply and Sewerage  Project) -  First Amendment
Dear Sir:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated August 13, 1991 (the Bank Loan 
Agreement), between International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) 
and Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de
Valparaiso S.A. (the Borrower), for the Second Valparaiso Water Supply and Sewerage 
Project (the Project).
Considering that (i) the Borrower has entered, on November 20, 19929 into a Loan 
Agreement (the OECF Loan Agreement) with The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, Japan 
(OECF) for the financing of the Project; (ii) OECF and the Bank have entered into the 
Procedural Arrangement, dated December 24, 1992, for purposes of the coordination of 
the administration of the Bank Loan Agreement and the OECF Loan Agreement and the 
exchange of information between the Bank and OECF on matters concerning the Project; 
(iii) as a consequence of the cofinancing of the Project by OECF, certain amendments 
to the Bank Loan Agreement need to be made; and (iv) the description of the Project 
should be clarified to reflect it as the Borrower's 1992-1997 capital investment 
program, we propose to amend the Bank Loan Agreement as follows:
1.
Section 5.02. (a) is modified to read as follows:
 
"Section 5.02. (a) Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower 
shall produce 
for its fiscal years 1993 through 1997 funds from internal 
sources equivalent to not less than 
20% of the annual average of the 
Borrower's capital expenditures-net of import duties and 
taxes-incurred or 
expected to be incurred for that year and the next following fiscal year."
2.
In Section 6.01, the following paragraph (d) is inserted:
 
"(d)
(i)
Subject to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph:
 
(A)
the right of the Borrower to withdraw proceeds of the loan 
provided under 
the loan agreement, dated November 20, 
1992, between the Overseas Economic 
Cooperation Fund, 
Japan and the Borrower shall have been suspended, 
cancelled or terminated in whole or in part, pursuant to the terms thereof; 
or
(B)
such loan shall have become due and payable prior to the 
agreed maturity 
thereof;
 
(ii)
subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall not apply if the 
Borrower 
establishes to the satisfaction of the 
Bank that:
(A)
such suspension, cancellation, termination or prematuring is 
not caused by 
the failure of the Borrower to perform 
any of its obligations under the loan 
agreement referred to in 
subparagraph (i) above; and
(B)
adequate funds for the Project are available to the Borrower 
from other 
sources on terms and conditions consistent 
Page  2
with the obligations of the 
Borrower under this 
Agreement."
3.
Section 6.02 is modified to read as follows:
 
"Section 6.02. Pursuant to Section 7.01 (h) of the General Conditions, 
the following 
additional events are specified:
 
(a)
any event specified in paragraphs (a) or (b) or (c) of Section 
6.01 of this 
Agreement shall occur; and
 
(b)
the event specified in paragraph (d) (i) (B) of Section 6.01 of 
this Agreement 
shall occur, subject to the proviso of paragraph (d) (ii) of 
that Section."
4.
In Schedule 1, the table in paragraph 1 thereof is modified to read as follows:
 
                              Amount of the

                                                  expenditures and
                                                  50% of local
                                                  expenditures

5.
In Schedule 2, the second paragraph is modified to read as follows:
 
"The Project, which is the Borrower's capital investment program for the 
years 1992 
through 1997, consists mainly of the following parts, subject to
