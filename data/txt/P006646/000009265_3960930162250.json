conditions in the Greater Valparaiso\n            Area; and (c) to restructure Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de\n            Valparaiso (ESVAL) so that it will be able to successfully\n            carry out its investment and development program resulting\n            from the above objectives.  The proposed project covers the\n            bulk of ESVAL's investment program for the period\n            1991-97, and deals mainly with the urgent water supply and\n            sewage disposal needs.  It includes four main components:\n            (1) sewerage and pollution control, including construction\n            of secondary collectors, pumping stations, and sewage\n            treatment and disposal facilities; (2) water supply,\n            including construction of production facilities, a\n            transmission main, water treatment facilities, distribution\n            pipes and storage tanks; (3) institutional improvements,\n            including acquisition of O&M equipment and office\n            equipment, a consumers' survey, the preparation of a\n            development plan, technical cooperation and training; and\n            (4) consulting services, including engineering and\n            supervision, monitoring of the marine sewage disposal system\n            before and after project completion, feasibility studies and\n            designs for water supply and sewerage systems of the\n            northern and the southern coast of the Fifth Region."}, "docdt": "1991-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
