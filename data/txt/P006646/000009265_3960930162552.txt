MENORANDUM AND ECOIOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR REONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$50 MILLION
TO THE EMPRESA DE OBEAS SANITARIAS DE VALPARAISO S.A. (ESVAL),
WITH TIM GUARANTEE OF Ti$ REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR THE SECOND -ALPARAISO WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE POJSET
1.   The following memorandum and recoLmndation on a proposed loan to the
Empresa de obras Sanitarias de Valparaiso S.A. (AVAL), with the guarantee of the
Republic of Chile, for US$50 million equivalent is submitted for approval. Tho
proposed loan would have a term of 17 year, with S years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable rate, and help finance a water supply and sewerage project.
2.   Backgaround. Chile has made significant progress in the last two decades
in expanding and improving its water supply and sewerage services. This is
reflected in very high water and high sewerage coverage levels (the highest in
Latin America), a low ratio of employees to water connections (among the lowest
in Latin America), and the adoption of the firat steps towards a sound tariff
policy based on long-run average cost. Nevertheless, there are still two major
problems to be addressed in the water sectort (a) high rates of unaccounted-for
water, which result in poor utilization of existing resoures as well as
unreliable service; and (b) serious water pollution problem  resulting from the
discharge of large quantities of untreated sewage into natural water courses,
particularly in the largest urban areas of the country.
3-    In the Greater Valparaiso area, the country's third largest urban area,
water and seer:2ge coverage is at present 9S% and 8S%, respectively. The water
cupply system has insufficient production and treatmnmt capacity to satisfy the
peak-day demand during the summer season, and the average-day demand in years of
low flow in the Aconcagua River. The water distribution system suffers from
serious deflciencies and high water losses caused bys inadequate layout,
bottlenecks, insufficient storage capacity, and leakage and bursts from old
plpes - some of which may have been adversely affected by the frequent
earthquakes occurri!  ln the area.  Moreover, large quantitLes of untreated
sewage are discharged Into streams and the Pacific ocean in an area that includes
the sea resort city of Villa del Mar. This creates a public health haxard and
reduces the area's attractiveness for recreation, fishing and tourism, which
constitute major sources of income for the population of the region. The GoCh
is aware of the urgent problems facing the water supply and the sewerage system
of Greater Valparaiso and has attached high priority t- solving thm.
4.   The agency responsible for the planning, management,  construction,
operation, and sale of urban water and sewerage services ln Chile's Fifth Region
is BSVAL. Until recently RIVAL operated as a public sector company controlled
by the MOP. In June 1989, it was transformed into a stock corporation with all
shares held by the Republic of Chile, either directly (35%) or indirectly (65%),
through CORFO, a Government Bank. in 1986, the Bark granted a first loan to
ESVAL of US$6 million for a US$12 million project, which included a major water
treatment plant and other water supply facilities, as well as the preparation of
feasibility studies and designs for the improvement and expansion of the Greater
Valparaiso water supply and sewerage systems, in preparation of the proposed
project. This project was successfully completed in 1990. ESVAL's institutional



and financial capabilities are at present satisfactory, but will have to be
considerably upgraded to carry out the project. This includes improving the
operation and maintenance systems, administrative systems and management
practices, and further increasing water and sewerage rates.
5.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project is an integral part of the
Bank's assistance strategy to Chile, which includess optimization of invsstments
in infrastructure by improved maintenance and rehabilitation, increased
efficiency in the delivery of public services, implementation of a financial
policy of full cost recovery based on long-run marginal cost of least-cost
solutions, and alleviation of environmental pollution problems that affect
adversely public health and hinder economic development of the area. An adequate
and efficient water and sewerage infrastructuro is neccseary to improv health
conditions of the population and to provide access to services and employment to
the low-income segments of the population.
6.   Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are: (a) to
optimize the operation of the existing water supply system and improve water
supply conditions in the Greater Valparaiso Area by reducing water losses,
creating uniform service pressure, and improving the quality of the water
supplied to the consumers; such optimization would also permit expanding the
supply area and preclude the large capital investments that would otherwise be
required; (b) to improve sanitary conditions of water streams, public beaches and
the marine environment in the Greater ValparaSso Area, which are important
recreational facilities for the population of the area, as woll as valuable
economic resources of the region for tourism and fishing; and (0) to increase
RsvAL's operational efficiency and capacity to implemont successftlly lts
proposed investment and development program.
7.   PrMoect Descrition.  The Bank loan would finance the bulk of ESVZL's
1991-97 least-cost capital investment program, which includes: (a) improveseat
of the Greater Valparaiso sewerage system, including an environmentally
acceptable marine sewage disposal system (47%); (b) expansion, i prov emnt and
optimization of the Greater Valpara8so water supply system (36%)i
(c) institutional and operational improvinnts of ISVAL (9%) and (d) consulting
services for supervising and monitoriAg the implementation of the project and for
preparing studies and designs for future projects in the Fifth Region (9%). The
construction of the main sewage collection and disposal system, the most
sophisticated project component from a technological point of view, which
incorporates works in which ESVAL in particular and Chile in general have no
experience, will have to be supervised at least partly by foreign consultants,
The water supply component of the project will be supervised by local consultants
in joint venture with foreign consultants (to be used mostly for the water
treatment component), as in the first project financed by the Bank. A
comprehensive marine monitoring program is included in the project to ascertain
whether the sewage disposal solution adopted will provide the expected
environmental results and to determine if any additional measures ned to bo
taken at a later stage. This monitoring program would be carried out by a joint
venture of local specialized entities (including the three universities of the
Region), local consulting firms, and foreign conSultants.



8.   Total project cost is estimated at US$141.5 million equivalent (including
local duties and taxes), with a foreign exchange cost of US$50 million
representing 35% of the total cost or 45% of the project cost net of local duties
and taxes. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in schedule S. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Chile is given in Schedules C and D,
respectlvely. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9384-CH dated
May 7, 1991 is also attached.
9.   A maximum amount of US$3 million (6 of the total loan) will be used for
retroactive financing of expenditures made after January 1, 1991 for the
*       construction of a water treatment plant needed urgently, and *ome sewage
collectors and pumping stations that are in the critical path of the Greater
Valparaeo sewage disposal system, whose early completion would alleviate serious
environmental pollution problems.
10.  The Government of Chile (GoCh) has recentlv requested the Government of
Japan to consider the cofinancing of this project, as part of a package of
several investmeni projects.  If and when this operation materializes, an CXC?
loan of about US$40 million may be granted to 3S'AL. In such an event, the Bank
loan amount would remain the same, but the total external financing would
increase from 45% to 80% of the project cost (net of dutles and taxes). OZCC
board approval is contingent upon Bank approval of the loan.
11.  Aared Actions. During negotiations, assurances were obtained as follows:
From the GoCh that it would: (1) not make changes to the existing water supply
or water tariff legislation that would materially and adversely affect DSVAL's
ability to carry out the Project ; (2) enter into a Shareholders' Agreement with
CRPOR, satisfactory to the Bank, allowing distribution of cash dividends to the
shareholders only from the amounts available after eompliance with SVAL's self-
financing and debt-equity ratio requirementsl (3) review yearly the system of
direct income subsidies for water and adjust it as needed, in a manner
satisfactory to the Dank; and (4) carry out not later than June 30, 1993, an
environmental study to assess the impact of municipal and industrial sewage
discharges into the Aconcagua River and the Pacific Ocean, and to propose
industrial effluent discharge criteria.
From ZYZC that it would: (1) continue to increase its water and sewerage tariffs
to the maximum provided by the current tarlff legislation; (2) carry out a plan
of action acceptable to the Bank to improve its operational and administrative
efficiency, and a training program for its staff; (3) carry out tho planned
changes in its organizational structure; (4) contract additional insurance to
expand its current coverage, in terms and amounts acceptable to the Bank; (5)
provide sufficient personnel, funds and other resources to ensure tho adequate
functioning of the Project Coordinating Unit; (6) generate funds from internal
sources equivalent to not less than 55% for fiscal years 1991 through 1994, and
70% for fiscal years 1995 though 1997, of its annual average capital expenditures
for that fiscal year and the next, and maintain during the term of the loan a
debt-equity ratio not greater than 60:401 (7) take necessary measures to met a
series of operational and financial targets each year; (8) carry out an in-depth



m 4 -
mid-term review of the project by September 30, 1994; and (9) carry out a
comprehensive environmental monitoring program satisfactory to the Bank before,
during and aittr the construction of the Project' sewage disposal system.
It was also agreed that, in the event that funds (other than the Bank loan) are
made available for the financing of the Project, EVIL would finance with
internal funds at least 20% of the Project costs net of duties and taxes, and any
funds from net internal sources that are not needed for self-financing would be
used to either pay dividends to the shareholders or make investments acceptable
to the Bank in addition to those included in the Project.
Condition of Effectiveness. The signing of the Shareholders' Agreement between
the GoCh, in its capacity as both Guarantor and shareholder of the Borrower, and
CORFO (the other shareholder), is a condition of loan effectivenss.
12.  Ben2fits.  The project would yield econoaric, environmental and social
benefits.   Economic benefits include increased revenues from  water *ales
resulting mostly from increased water and sewerage rates as well as additional
connections, and decreased operational costs resulting from the optimisation of
the system and the reductlon of losses. Environmental benefits will be achloved
by alleviating the pollutlon of the area's stream and the ocean. Xt is expected
that- the presently contaminated beaches in the resort area of VLfia del Mar would
become clean and safe for public use. Social beneflts include ensuring uniform
quality of the water servlce, which wll directly beneflt the urban poor (who
suffer most from the present deflciencles), public health lmprovements, and the
provision of local employment during ecnstruction.
13.  RLsku and Sfeauards. Two types of risks can be foreseen. The flrst L
related to the limLted capacLty and expeLorien of ZSVAL to carry out a project
of this magnitude adequately and in a timely manner, so that delays and cost
overruns could occur.  To minimLse thls rLsk, agreeemet was reached during
negotiations that USVAL would carry out a orles of institutional improvements
its planned reorganization, and a comprhensive training program for lts staff.
The second risk pertains to the limited availability of funds generated by BSVaL,
if present legislation on water and sewerage tarlffs is altered or lnadequately
implemented, and/or lf the soclal subeLdy for low-income water users is not
successful. To eliminate thli risk, agreement was reached during negotiations
that current tarlff policLes would be fully applied by ESVAL and maintained by
the GoCh, and that the present system of subsldles to the urban poor would be
adjusted, lf needed, to make lt more effectlve.
14.  Recmmendation   I am satisfLed that the proposed loan complLes wlth the
Artliles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Sxecutlve Dlrectors
approve it.
