provides balance of payments assistance to\n            Pakistan in implementing a stabilization program and\n            structural reforms in a distressed banking sector. This\n            operation supports implementation of major short-term reform\n            measures in the banking sector that have arrested the flow\n            of bad loans, curtailed loss-making, and conserved the\n            assets of nationalized commercial banks and development\n            finance institutions while they were being prepared for\n            privatization. reforms measures include bringing prudential\n            regulations and financial disclosure standards to\n            international levels to increase transparency; reducing\n            market distortions to increase the efficiency of financial\n            intermediation; and strengthening legal and judicial\n            processes to enable a more effective enforcement of\n            financial contracts. The BSAL supports fiscal stabilization,\n            improves the private sector s access to banking services,\n            and helps protect those directly affected by the reform\n            process. Moreover, the BSAL centers around the core issue of\n            governance in banking."}, "docdt": "1997-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
