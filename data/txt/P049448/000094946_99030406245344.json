 ADJUSTMENT LOAN", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4257", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Banking Sector Adjustment Loan\n            (BSAL) was rated as highly satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned are: 1) BSAL provides strong evidence to prove the\n            principle that program ownership must underpin reform\n            implementation for it to be successful. 2) The economic\n            crisis or near crisis situation in Pakistan provided the\n            opportunity for taking strong reform measures. However,\n            gains from reforms taken in response to a crisis have to be\n            consolidated quickly because, as the crisis eases, vested\n            interests quickly return to slow reforms, if not reverse\n            them altogether. 3) BSAL is among the first projects in the\n            Bank that deal directly with the issue of governance and\n            corruption. Key reform measures correctly revolved around\n            insulating the banking system from vested interests. 4)\n            BSAL's preparation was a case of very close\n            collaborative process with International Monetary Fund and\n            the productive partnership that such a collaboration\n            engenders to the benefit of the client. 5) BSAL correctly\n            tackled the flow problem first. 6) In view of the banking\n            problems in Pakistan, the primordial objective is to achieve\n            improved corporate governance by selling the nationalized\n            commercial banks and development finance institutions to the\n            most reputable and qualified private investors. To help\n            achieve this objective, participation by reputable\n            international banks is encouraged."}, "docdt": "1998-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
