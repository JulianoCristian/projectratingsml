objective of the First Phase of the\n            Basic Education Project for Uzbekistan is to improve\n            learning conditions in pre-school and the first four grades\n            of general secondary education. The project is currently\n            performing satisfactorily and has picked up speed\n            considerably in the past eight months and has both reached\n            all its indicators and is close to completing all of its\n            ongoing activities. The two month extension is being sought\n            so that only one remaining activity, the procurement of\n            computers to schools throughout the country in order to\n            support the per capita financing reforms, may be completed.\n            In light of savings accumulated due to the appreciation of\n            the SDR in relation to the USD, the Government has asked the\n            Bank to allow them to purchase additional computers to\n            expand their availability to all schools. The extension will\n            help ensure greater utilization of the credit proceeds.\n            Moreover, should this two month extension be granted, the\n            strong commitment shown by the Ministry of Public Education\n            makes it likely that this one remaining activity will be\n            completed satisfactorily and would contribute further\n            towards the efficiency reforms which this project\n            jumpstarted. It bears mentioning that second phase of the\n            project is being implemented effectively and is being\n            implemented satisfactorily. There are no outstanding audit\n            reports and the last audit report was found satisfactory to\n            the Bank."}, "docdt": "2010-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
