Further enhancing the\n            economy's potential over the medium term and reaching\n            high-income status will require more structural reforms,\n            particularly at the micro level, to bolster competitiveness\n            and boost private savings. This document describes a Euro\n            624.1 million (USD 800 million equivalent) Competitiveness\n            and Savings Development Policy Loan (CSDPL) to Turkey. It is\n            a one-tranche stand-alone operation. The objective of the\n            program supported by the proposed operation is to facilitate\n            Turkey's growth to high-income status by bolstering\n            competitiveness and boosting domestic savings, thus reducing\n            external vulnerabilities over the medium term. This\n            operation is a critical part of the new Country Partnership\n            Strategy (CPS), which was endorsed by the Executive Board on\n            March 27, 2012. The DPL will contribute to the following\n            expected CPS outcomes under the competitiveness pillar: (i)\n            sustained macroeconomic and financial stability and\n            strengthened exports, domestic savings, and external\n            resilience and (ii) improved investment and business\n            climate; deepened and broadened access to finance. The\n            operation will also contribute to deepening reforms for\n            improved competitiveness, one of the main strategic\n            priorities in the 2012 Europe and Central Asia (ECA)\n            regional strategy."}, "docdt": "2013-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
