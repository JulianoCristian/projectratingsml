Project for Turkey were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the decision to proceed with a\n            single tranche operation was driven largely by country\n            exposure constraints at the time of preparation. The risk\n            this design posed for sustainability of the impact of the\n            DPL were mitigated by the strong ongoing analytical\n            engagement, resulting in a new DPL series once the single\n            borrower limit had been revised. Nonetheless, greater medium\n            term certainty over the Bank\u2019s available headroom would be\n            desirable to avoid the risks to sustainability resulting\n            from a one-tranche design. This ICR confirms the conclusion\n            of the DPO retrospective that higher middle-income countries\n            with stronger institutional capacity can successfully\n            implement DPO programs covering more sectors and a bigger\n            number of prior actions. In hindsight, the ICR team believes\n            that a more focused approach may have been more efficient,\n            including avoiding areas where the Bank had less engagement\n            or ability to influence the policy dialogue such as the\n            reforms in the investment climate supported by the CSDPL.\n            Given the significant business climate challenges Turkey\n            faces, the team had to balance the risk of a contested\n            agenda against the benefits that will have resulted from\n            making faster progress. Thorough political economy analysis\n            is recommended going forward to make sure decisions on these\n            kinds of trade-offs are well informed. Compliance with good\n            international practice, while advisable, should not be the\n            sole and critical factor in the decision to support certain\n            reform efforts. This decision should be informed by detailed\n            analysis of the reform and supported by extensive\n            stakeholder engagement as was done in the case of the prior\n            action on the new Leasing, Factoring and Financial Companies Law."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T23:29:00Z"}
