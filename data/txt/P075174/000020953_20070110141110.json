 and depth since the last operation, to: (a) improve the\n            state's investment climate; (b) strengthen revenue,\n            public expenditure, and financial management; (c) usher in\n            improved governance practices and raise the quality of\n            service delivery in the health, education, and power\n            sectors; and (d) better target antipoverty programs through\n            more effective monitoring and evaluation. Consistent with\n            the objectives laid out in the Bank's India country\n            strategy, the proposed operation is a step toward achieving\n            the aspiration of the people of Andhra Pradesh to create a\n            modern, prosperous, and equitable society with improved\n            living standards for all. More specifically, the benefits\n            from the operation include: (a) greater investment and more\n            job opportunities due to improvement in the state's\n            investment climate; (b) increased fiscal space for\n            development expenditure through better public budget and\n            financial management; and (c) improved delivery of public\n            services through better governance and effective targeting\n            of programs."}, "docdt": "2006-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
