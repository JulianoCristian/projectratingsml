the State of Andhra Pradesh medium term\n            development program. It focuses on the actions taken by the\n            Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) to meet the specific\n            conditions for the release of the second tranche of the\n            Third Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform Loan/Credit Project\n            (APERL3). APERL3 is the third in a series of programmatic\n            budget support operations to Andhra Pradesh (AP). It\n            provides financial support for the implementation of a\n            policy and institutional reform program of the GoAP, which\n            has been under implementation for over a decade. The first\n            of these loans, Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform Loan (APERL1)\n            was approved in March 2002, APERL2 in February 2004, and\n            APERL3 in January 2007. While the first two budget support\n            operations comprised only one tranche, APERL3 was designed\n            as a two-tranche operation in accordance with the Government\n            of India's guidelines for policy-based assistance to\n            states. The next section describes the overall\n            macro-economic policy framework in India as well as recent\n            trends in development outcomes in Andhra Pradesh. Section\n            three discusses progress in the implementation of the GoAP\n            overall reform program. Section four details the status of\n            specific tranche release conditions. The memorandum\n            concludes that the conditions for the release of the second\n            tranche have been met and that substantial progress has been\n            made in implementing the measures outlined in the GoAP\n            letter of development policy."}, "docdt": "2010-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
