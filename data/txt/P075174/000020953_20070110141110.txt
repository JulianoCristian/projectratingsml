                           India-Assessment Letter for World Bank
                                         December 5,2006


As requested, this note provides the IMF staffs assessment of India's macroeconomic
conditions, prospects, and related policies for the Third Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform
Credit/Loan being considered by the Executive Board of the World Bank.


The economy continues to grow strongly. Growth is projected to be over 8%percent in 2006107
supported by strong domestic demand. Inflation (WPI) remains within a 5-5% percent range, in
line with the RBI's target. The external current account deficit is expected to widen to
1%percent of GDP in 2006107, financed by portfolio inflows and commercial borrowings, which
could make India more susceptible to a reversal in global investor sentiment. However, reserves
stand at $170 billion (about 7%months of imports, and over 120percent of total external debt),
and external debt remains low (about 16percent of GDP, as of end 2005106).


The immediate challenge is managing the near-term risk of potential inflationary pressures.
Credit growth remains robust, notwithstanding steady increases in policy rates over the past year
and steps by the RBI to tighten risk weights and provisioning standards. A further gradual
withdrawal of monetary accommodation would limit risks of inflationary overheating, and
further tightening selected prudential norms would address risks to financial stability.


A key medium-term challenge is to further reduce general government debt (now over 80 percent
of GDP) and create room for social and infrastructure spending. The general government deficit
is expected to decline further to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2006107, on the back of strong growth and
improved state-level finances. Provided consolidation continues, staff projects that the debt-to-
GDP ratio should fall to about 75 percent of GDP by 2008/09, given the backdrop of relatively
low interest rates and strong growth. However, achieving this and the central government's
target of current balance by 2008109 will require revenue and expenditure reform, including the
streamlining of tax exemptions and subsidies.


Greater progress in structural reforms is needed to spur growth, createjobs, and reduce poverty.
Among the key priorities is to improve infrastructure. While special economic zones hold
promise to stimulate investment and employment, the associated tax holidays could be costly,
and better targeted tax incentives would likely be more cost effective. Trade tariffs could be
further reduced, building on recent progress. In addition, steps to develop key financial markets
(e.g., money, corporate bonds, and derivatives)would facilitate investment (including
infrastructure) and enable better risk management as the capital account opens fbrther.


Overall, prospects for India's growth and macroeconomic stability remain good, and a higher
growth path could be achieved by acceleratingkey reforms. The staff report on the
2006 Article IV consultation with India will be discussed by the IMF Executive Board on
December 20.

                                                       I.Introduction

1.       The fifth-largest state inIndia, with an estimated population o f 80 million, Andhra Pradesh (AP)
i s one o f India's leading reforming states. With its demonstrated commitment to broad-based reforms and
impressive record on growth and poverty reduction, AP has played an important role in India's
development progress. Building upon the reform program o f the previous government, the current
government, which came to power in May 2004, has expanded opportunities for the rural poor to bring in
a more equitable growth and development process inthe state.' For over a decade, AP has had a sustained
policy and institutional reform program that has accelerated private sector-led growth and improved the
quality o f public service delivery inthe state.

2.        The World Bank has been a long-term development partner inAP's reform efforts in general, and
in its policy and institutional reforms in particular. In support o f the state's ongoing reform program, a
structural adjustment loan-the         Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform Loan 1 (APERL 1)-was                        approved in
March 2002, with a loadcredit amount o f US$250 million (plus an additional US$lOO million from the
Department for International Development (DFID), United Kingdom. In recognition o f further reform
progress, a second loadcredit (APERL 2) was approved in February 2004 for US$220 million (plus an
additional US$lOO million from DFID). In addition, there are three single-state, Bank-financed
investment projects currently under implementation in the state for a net commitment value o f about
US$369 million. AP also has a significant share o f various national and multistate projects that the Bank
i s supporting in India. Loolung ahead, there are about six projects in the pipeline, for a cumulative net
financial commitment o f about US$1 billion. AP has also been a major user o f the Bank's technical
assistance and analytical and advisory activities. The proposed loardcredit, which is consistent with the
Bank's India Country Strategy, is the third budget support operation in a series o f programmatic
Development Policy Loans (DPLs).

3.        Andhra Pradesh has made considerable progress in its development agenda dunng the last few
years. Back in the late 199Os, when APERL 1 was initiated, the state was relatively poor and backward,
and was inthe midst o f a fiscal crisis. In 1999/2000, AP's per-capita income was around US$385, nearly
22 percent o f its population was below the poverty line, 40 percent o f its primary school age children
were out o f school, and the state's fiscal deficit to gross state development product (GSDP) ratio was
breaching the 5 percent mark. Since then, the state has made impressive progress in all dimensions o f
development: per-capita income has risen to nearly US$700 (in 2005/06); the poverty head count ratio i s
expected to have fallen considerably;* nearly 95 percent o f its primary school age children are in school;
and the fiscal deficit is at a manageable level o f 3.5 percent o f GSDP and is falling.3Moreover, among the
major Indian states, AP i s now considered to have (a) the best managed power sector, (b) the third-highest
credit rating, (c) one o f the best investment climates, and (d) the fourth-lowest corruption level.4


  As per the Central Statistical Organization's estimates and the 2005106 economic survey o f AP, over 70 percent of the state's
population ofnearly 80 million lives inrural area and is dependent on incomefrom farming.
  The latest year for which the poverty head count ratio for Indianstates is available is 199912000,According to a forecast made
by India's Planning Commission, the poverty head count ratio in AP is expected to decline by 46 percent from 199912000 to
2005106. (See "India Economic RoadMap: The NextFive Years 2002-2007," PlanningCornmission, GoI, 2002).

                                                                 1

4.       Notwithstanding these impressive achievements o f the last several years, there remain a number
o f challenges confronting the state. First,growth across sectors has been uneven: while the manufacturing
and services sectors have registered a robust growth rate o f 8 to 9 percent, the trend growth rate o f the
farm sector has been around 2 percent per annum. Second, some o f the key indicators o f the health
status-infant     mortality rate (IMR), child malnutrition levels, rate o f prevalence o f anemia in women-
show stagnation or rates o f growth that are lower than what are necessary for AP to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In the education sector, the quality o f learning remains low
Although these problems are not specific to AP, and are faced by the nation as a whole, the GoAP has
taken several actions within its domain to correct the above imbalances. For example, major investments
are being made in irrigation, which will lead to doubling o f the irrigated land in the state in the next five
years. A number o f antipoverty programs are being implemented in the poorest distncts, and social
protection programs are being expanded to include all the vulnerable groups in society In addition,
programs are being designed to address the problems o f specific areas and groups o f people in the state
where human development indicators remain low

5.       The key objective o f the proposed operation i s to support the government's ongoing reform
program, which has expanded in both breadth and depth since the last operation, to: (a) improve the
state's investment climate; (b) strengthen revenue, public expenditure, and financial management
practices; (c) bring about better governance and raise the quality o f service delivery in the health,
education, and power sectors; and (d) help the government to better target antipoverty programs through
more effective monitoring and evaluation.

6.       At the time o f processing APERL 2 inFebruary 2004, it was envisaged that APERL 3, if it were
to go forward, would be a single tranche operation similar to the past two operations. However, in
October 2005, the Government o f India developed its own guidelines for budget-support operations for
the states5 A distinctive feature o f these guidelines is that all budget-support operations will now be
disbursedintwo tranches over a two-year fiscal period.

7        Following the GoI's guidelines on adjustment operation, APERL 3 will also have two tranches.
Splitting the operation into two annual tranches will support reforms over a two-year period and will help
provide more time for reforms to be implemented.6 The first tranche o f APERL 3 is expected to be
processed in January 2007, and the second tranche in the Bank's FY2007/08.' This Program Document
(PD) lays out the reform program supported by the two tranches o f the proposed operation, and the
indicative actions/triggers for any potential operation inthe future.

the national level and their implications for A P Section I11 summarizes key aspects o f development
progress and challenges in A P Section IV reports on AP's overall medium-term development reform

the global stage as an emerging economc giant. After slowing from 2000101-2002103, GDP growth has
resumedits rapid rate, and the country has experienced an average annual GDP growth rate o f 8 percent

         explicitly stated, the fiscal year inreferenceis to India's fiscal year, which runsApril 1to March 31. The Bank's FY IS
from July 1to June 30.

                                                                   2

during the past three years. This is also appreciably faster than the 6 percent annual growth in the 1980s
and 199Os, and 3.5 percent earlier. The momentum i s expected to continue in the near term, with most
analysts forecasting the GDP growth rate to be above 8.5 percent for 2006107 India's GDP per capita
growth rate since 1991 puts the country inthe ranks o f the top ten fastest-growing countries in the world.
The acceleration in economc growth has coincided with millions o f Indians moving out o f poverty, and
the poverty head count ratio has fallen from 37 percent in 1993194 to 26.1 percent in 1999100, and further
to 22.4 percent in2004105.

10.     Thriving services, improvingperformance in industry, and lagging agriculture. The growth surge
has been fuelled primarily by rapid and robust growth in the services sector-which           has grown at an
annual average rate o f 9 percent since the 199Os, contributing nearly 60 percent o f the overall growth o f
the economy While the most visible growth has been information technology and business process
outsourcing services, other services-including         telecomunication, financial services, community
services, and the retail sector-have    also grown considerably faster than GDP over time. The industrial
sector has grown rapidly, at 6.3 percent, between 1992-2004-but          this was slower than the services
growth rate and, at 22 percent in 2004105, the share o f industry in GDP remains low More rapid
industrial growth has resumed in the past year. On the other hand, agriculture growth appears to be
decelerating: from 3.2 percent in 1980-92, to 2.4 percent in 1992-2003, and to 1.3 percent over the past
few years.

11.     India's macroeconomic situation remains strong. The external position o f India's economy has
improved dramatically The rapid growth o f information technology services, recent pickup in exports,
and high volume o f remittances have resulted in a comfortable balance o f payments situation. Capital
inflows remain buoyant, and the surplus on the capital account was nearly US$40 billion in 2005106.
India's vulnerability to an external  crisis istherefore limitedby its record level o f reserves, equivalent to
more than 7 months o f imports at nearly US$167 billion (September 2006), exceeding India's gross
external debt. The inflation rate has remained at a relatively low rate o f around 5 percent, and for the
general government (states and central governments combined), the fiscal deficit has fallen from more
than 10percent o f GDP in2001102 to about 7.6 percent in 2005106. The key downside macro risks facing
the Indian economy in the short term are higher oil prices, a rise in inflation, rapid credit growth, and a
slowdown in the global economy, although they are unlikely to derail the overall momentum in the
economy

12.     Growth has been supported by wide-ranging, gradual reforms. India continues to reform its
economy gradually, and at the same time expand the scope to cover larger parts o f the economy India's
trade and investment regimes have become considerably more favorable: the average external tariff for
nonagricultural goods has been reduced below 15 percent, and i s committed to reaching East Asian levels;
foreign investment has been permitted in most sectors o f the economy; and the country has taken a more
proactive stance in trade negotiations. India's monetary authorities have done a creditable job o f keeping
the inflation rate low, improving the depth o f the financial sector, and allowing greater flexibility in the
management o f the exchange rate. Along with other structural reforms to improve the investment climate,
trade reforms and greater openness have led to increased competition and induced microeconomic
restructuring o f firms. The latter, in turn, has been linked to the more robust growth performance o f the
Indian economy in recent years. The aggregate investment rate in the economy had also climbed to 30
percent o f GDP by 2004/05, from about 23 percent in 2001102, much o f it due to greater private
investmentand financed byhigher domestic savings.

13.     India s primary challenges now include improvements in public service delivery. The recent
economic performance is also creating new challenges. While India's economic and social performance
has been impressive on many counts, it has also been uneven. For example, many dimensions o f health
provision-the     prevalence o f children with complete immunization against childhood diseases,
percentage o f women with timely visits from auxiliary nurses and midwives, and percentage o f children

                                                       3

delivered in public institutions-have           worsened between 1998/99 and 2002l03, Similarly, both maternal
mortality rates and the under-five mortality have hardly improved. In addition, HIV/AIDS is spreading
quickly, with risk factors that put the country in danger o f a growing epidemic. Inthe area o f elementary
education, there has been an impressive decline inthe number o f out-of-school children-from                  25 million
in the early 2000s to 13 million by 2005-but               quality issues are now becomng more central. Similarly,
the availability o f infrastructure-power,           water, roads-is       under severe stress and may constrain future
growth.

14.      Addressing growing gaps across regions, sectors, and households. According to the Bank's India
Development Policy Review (2005), one o f the central challenges facing India i s to extend the benefits o f
rapid growth to more regions, sectors, and people. Nearly three-fifths o f India's poor (some 150 million
people) now live in four states alone: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh. Although these
states are growing at modest rates, they are increasingly lagging the rest o f the country in investment,
manufacturing, and income. At the sectoral level, agriculture employs nearly 60 percent o f the labor
force, but contributes less than a quarter o f India's GDP At the same time, the combined impact o f the
growing rural-urban divide and rising inequality within urban areas has resulted in disparities across
households and people. Recognizing the problem, the central government has started a number o f
initiatives to revive growth in rural areas and to directly reach out to the poor. Notable among them are
Bharat Nirman (building infrastructure in rural areas), National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
WREGS), Sarva Sikhya Abhiyan (Education for All Initiative) and National Rural Health Mission.

15.      Continued fiscal progress remains a key issue. While India has begun to address its fiscal
problem both at the center and in the states, the overall fiscal deficit and indebtedness still remain hgh.
Recent fiscal consolidation has begun to yield results. In April 2005, 19 states switched to a system o f
value added tax (VAT), and it has since been expanded to all but two states. Similarly, almost all major
Indian states have passed fiscal responsibility legislation comrmtting themselves to eliminating their
revenue deficits and reducing fiscal deficits to 3 percent o f GSDP by 2008/09                 The level o f public debt,
however, remains high, and debt servicing preempts a large share o f public resources. The problem is
more acute at the state level, since Indian states are responsible for carrying out important knctions in
many critical sectors (e.g. education, health, agriculture, rural roads). State-level fiscal improvement
therefore remains an important part o f the overall development agenda o f the GoI, and, as discussed
below, has led to the introduction o f a number o f incentive-based lending instruments to spur reforms at
the state level.

16.      Incentives for state-level reforms. One of the policy planks for the Government o f India to
accelerate growth, especially in the poorer states, has been to put in place a range o f schemes to support
reforms at the subnational level. Its Fiscal Reform Facility (FRF) provided additional funding to states
during 2000-05 on the basis o f improved fiscal performance, and Andhra Pradesh was one o f the
beneficiaries. Following the recommendations o f the Twelfth Finance C o m s s i o n (TFC) for 2005-10,
which have been fully accepted by the GoI, incentives for states to undertake fiscal reforms have been
further strengthened. Similar incentive-based lending andor grants are under implementation in various
sectors, including power, irrigation, and urban infrastructure.

17       The implications of TFCfor Andhra Pradesh. These include: (i)a slight decline in AP's share in
central revenue from 7 7 to 7 4 percent, (ii)reduced debt servicing (could be as much as Rs 2,684 crore in
interest savings, Rs 740 crore as benefits in repayments, and Rs 3,835 crore in debt wnte-off over the
2005-10 period), contingent on continued improvements in fiscal performance; and (iii)a harder ceiling
on overall borrowing, along with stronger incentives to seek concessional external financing. Based on
TFC's recommendations, the Go1 is now passing on the official loans and credits to states in the same

term in which it receives them, which implies that like other Indian states, A P will also be liable to any
exchange rate risks associated with foreign currency borrowings.

                                                                             8.3                                            7.3

India's GDP (an economy o f US$55 billion in 2005106); and (iv) around 5-6 percent o f the country's
poor. The elections to state legislative assembly were held in May 2004, and after two consecutive five-
year terms, the regional Telugu Desam Party lost the election and the Indian National Congress Party
formed the government inthe state.

19        Continuity of reforms, emphasizing a more inclusive development process. The current
government has built on the economic and social reforms initiated by the previous government. Along
with continuing the key reform initiatives o f the past-fiscal           discipline, improving the state's investment
climate, governance reforms, restructuring o f public enterprises-the                      new government has added
emphasis on agriculture and irrigation, and greater emphasis on antipoverty programs to improve the
welfare o f the rural poor. The reform program has beenextended to new areas, including liberalization o f
agricultural markets, increasing access o f the poor to land and credit, and shfting public expenditure to
build rural infra~tructure.~       All in all, the reform momentum in AP continues to gather pace and is
reflected inits improved development outcomes.

A.        Growth and PovertyReduction

20.       Rapid and sustained economic growth. AP has experienced rapid and sustained economic growth
in recent years. Compared to an annual growth rate of 5.3 percent during the 199Os, the growth rate
increased to 5.8 percent during the 2000101-2002103 period, and accelerated to around 7.5 percent during
the last three years (figure 1, lefl panel). The per-capita income has grown at almost two percentage
points higher annually during the 2003104-2005106 period than in the past. The noteworthy feature o f
AP's recent growth is the revival o f the industrial sector, which is growing at around 8 percent per annum,
which is higher than the national average (figure 1, right panel). The service sector in AP, like in the rest
o f India, has continued to experience a robust growth rate o f 8-9 percent per annum. AP's economy,
however, continues to under-perform the national economy in overall growth, primarily because o f the
poor performance o f the agriculture sector. The agriculture sector has been adversely affected by a
numberof factors, including a lack o f adequate public investment, an unprecedented spell of dry weather
in recent years, an inefficient and fragmented supply chain, and the slow pace o f agriculture-related
reforms.




  One key change has been the policy o f free power to agriculture. The new government took office on a platform focused on
providing more governmentassistanceto the rural poor, in particular, by providing electricity free of charge to farmers, who use
it to run pump sets for irrigation. The free power policy was revised in January 2005, seeking to contain the fiscal burden of
growing agriculturalpower consumptionthrough better targeting (e.g., expanding the metering o f power, forcing farmers to use
morepower-efficientpump sets, and charging some farmers for power).

2 1.       Considerable reduction in poverty. AP's performance in reducing poverty has been satisfactory,
particularly in light o f the challenging environment it faces. For example, the ratio o f landless agricultural
laborers to cultivators in A P is twice the national average. The quantity and pattern o f rainfall in its
interior districts (Le,, inthe Telengana and Rayalseema regions o f the state) have been considerably lower
and more erratic than in the rest o f India. The state's literacy rate, at 57 percent (in 2001), i s 8 percentage
points lower than the national average. Yet historically AP has had a lower poverty head count ratio than
the rest o f the country. in 1999/2000, it was 15.8 percent in AP and 26.1 percent for the country
According to India's Planning Commission, between 1999/2000 and 2005106, the poverty head count
ratio in AP i s expected to fall by 46 percent (from 15.8to 8.5 percent), compared to 26 percent (from 26.1
to 19.3 percent) for the entire country         loIfthe past achievements are sustained, AP will more than halve
the proportion of people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 and thereby meet the
poverty-related MDG.

22.        Fiscal consolidation. A key component o f AP's ongoing medium-term reform program involves
strengthening fiscal discipline through the preparation o f a MediumTerm Fiscal Framework (MTFF), and
improving the composition o f spending by ensuring adequate spending on capital expenditures and on
primary education and primary health. During the last five years, the successive governments in AP have
broadly maintained a prudent fiscal stance (figure 2). Both the revenue and fiscal deficits (as a percentage
o f the state's GSDP) continue to exhibit a downward trend and appear to be on course to achieve or
surpass their respective targets set out in the Andhra Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
Management (APFRBM) Act o f 2005.''

23.        Debt sustainability AP's debt, in relation to the size o f its economy, has historically been higher
than the average for all the Indian states. The ratio o f interest payments to revenue receipts (IP/RR) was
also higher than the national average. AP has been classified as "debt stressed" by the G01.l~However,
because o f the recent improvement in the fiscal situation, IP/RR has come down to 21.3 percent in
2005106, and i s expected to fall to 19.1 percent in 2006107 At the same time, the falling deficit has
resulted inthe flattening o f the debt path, with the debt to GSDP ratio declining from 32.8 percent to 32.2
percent between 2004/05 and 2005106-an                    important achievement given that this decline has been
registered after six years o f consecutive increase (see table 1and left panel o f figure 3).

24.        Strong revenue performance. The improved fiscal situation in recent years can be largely
attributed to strong revenue performance, with the state's own revenue to GSDP ratio increasing from 8.6
percent o f GSDP in 2003104 to 9 7 percent in 2005106. During the last two years, aided by the
introduction of the VAT, better tax administration, and a buoyant economy, the collection o f both tax and
nontax revenue has grown at 18.2 and 26.5 percent, respectively-two                       and three times faster than the
corresponding numbers for the 2000/01-2003/04 period (figure 3, right panel). However, sustaining such

a high revenue buoyancy may prove to be difficult and, therefore, going forward, GoAP may have to rely
on effective public expenditure and financial management to reinin its fiscal situation.

25.        Composition of expenditure. The share o f committed expenditures-interest                     payments, salaries
and pensions-in          total expenditures has declined from 55 percent in 2003104 to 49 7 percent in 2005106,
releasing valuable resources for more potentially productive uses. A large part o f these resources has been
used to finance the public investment program, which has seen its share go up from 13 percent o f total
expenditure in 2003104 to 18.6 percent in 2005106 (figure 4). However, at the same time, the share o f
subsides and transfers has gone up marginally, and the share o f nonwage operations and maintenance
(O&M) expenses has declined between 2003/04 and 2005/06 (figure 4 and table 1). Moreover, in sectors
like irrigation, the actual spending on maintenance work i s only 20 to 25 percent o f the amount budgeted
as O&M expenditure. Clearly, there is a needfor AP to increase spending on actual maintenance work in
irrigation or else the value o f the existing assets could go down and the quality of service delivery would
be affected.

C.        Performance of the Power Sector

26.       Like in the rest o f India, the power sector has remained one o f the most challenging areas o f
reform in AP Keeping to its electoral promise, the current government (which came to power for a five-
year term in May 2004) announced free electricity to farmers immediately after talung office. But at the
same time, it initiated significant reforms in the power sector that neutralized some o f the adverse effects
o f the free power policy and ensured that AP's power sector remains the best managed power sector in the
country    l3


27        The following achievements o f AP's power sector are noteworthy,

       I  Reduction zn transmission and distribution (T&D) losses. T&D losses have been brought down to
          20.8 percent in 2005/06, from 21.4 percent inthe previous year and 35 percent in2000/01 (Figure
          5).
       I  Reduction in power subsidy as a proportion of revenues from sale of power. While the
          announcement o f free power to farmers led to a one-time increase in the otherwise declining
          power subsidy, the latter now constitutes a much smaller portion o f power sector revenue than
          before. This ratio i s expected to be reduced from about 24 percent in 2002/03 to about 15 percent
          in2006107, implying an average reductiono fabout 2.5 percent per annum(see figure 5).

       I  Improvements in supply and service quality. There has been a noticeable reduction in
          interruptions and breakdowns, as reflected in transformer failure rate falling from 29.1 percent in
          2000/01 to 11.2 percent in 2004/05. The time taken in rectifying faults has been reduced
          considerably, and distribution transformers in urban areas are being replaced in less than six
          hours-as          compared to the regulatory standard o f 24 hours.14

       I  Improvement znJinanczal performance. The AP Transmission Company (APTRANSCO) and the
          four distribution companies have ended the last two years with no financial losses (after talung
          the GoAP's subsidies into account). The improvement in financial performance has been
          achieved in the face o f a 13 percent reduction in industrial tariffs and no increase in retail tariffs

      .  Increase in investments in the sector. The transmssion utility and distribution utilities inthe state
         have together invested about Rs 3,730 crore during 2004105 and 2005/06. The average investment
         per year before reforms had been around Rs 575 crore, which jumped to Rs 1,296 crore per year
         for the five-year period dunng the reforms (2000/01-2004/05).
         Increase in rural electrification. Nearly 6,779 habitations were electrified during 2004/05, and
         2,46 1 habitations in 2005/06 (up to October 2005), achieving a village electrification level o f
         about 95 percent, and a rural household electrification level o f 68 percent.

D.       Developments in the Social Sectors

28.      Access to school education has improved, and thefocus is now on the quality of education. The
GoAP has been notably successful in improving physical access to schooling, with nearly 97 percent o f
habitations having either a regular school or an alternative center within a kilometer. Recent surveys have
found that only about 7 4 percent o f children are out o f school in the state, and most boys and girls are
currently enrolled. The state's estimate o f out-of-school children i s about 430,000 (or 3.6 percent o f the
total number o f children in the appropriate age g r o ~ p ' ~ )o,f which 80 percent are from rural areas. In
addition, the class-wise transition rate has increased in 2004/05 compared to 2003/04. This indicates that
not only are more students being enrolled in schools inAP, but a larger percentage o f them are advancing
inthe school system(see left panel, figure 6). Having achieved increased enrollment, the focus is now on
improving the quality o f education. A Go1survey done in 2006 found that learning outcomes are low, and
many primary school children are unable to read, write, and solve mathematical problems at their grade
level.

29       Health outcomes have been mixed, though service delivery of AP's public health system remains
better than the national average. Unlike the positive outcomes in many areas o f the economy, the
outcomes inthe health sector are rather mixed-a            problem that now affects the entire country and notjust
AP Some o f the key indicators o f health status-infant            mortality rate (IMR), child malnutrition levels,
rate o f prevalence o f anemia in women-show            stagnation or rates o f growth that are lower than what are
necessary for AP to achieve the MDGs. In 2004, AP reported the highest HIV prevalence rates in the
country (2.25 percent in antenatal clinics and 16.4 percent in STD clinics), with estimated cases o f around
1 million. However, there is good news on several fronts. The number o f polio and leprosy cases has
declined, and malaria cases have been reduced by two-thirds since 2000. The HIV prevalence rates have


  The number o f out-of-schoolchildrenis saidto havebeen further reducedin the current academic year through large-scale
mobilizationdrives andteacher motivation efforts.

also declined in recent months. Similarly, the use o f maternal health and family planning services has
improved, full antenatal care coverage has increased by about 13 percentage points, and deliveries
conducted by medically trained personnel have increasedby about 7 percentage points during the last five
years.I6 Also, a much larger proportion o f primary health care units in AP are found to have better
infrastructure, staff, and medical supplies than the rest o f the country (see right panel, figure &the wider
the octagon, the better is the performance).

30.       Increased emphasis on the rural sector One o f the main thrusts o f the current government has
been to undertake policy and institutional changes to accelerate growth in rural areas, especially in the
agriculture sector. While the full impact o f this reform program will be felt in the next two to three years,
the initial effects have been encouraging. For example, between 2002/03 and 2004/05, the area irrigated
by canals has increased from 1.5 millionhectares to 1.7million hectares; the amount of agricultural credit
disbursed to cultivators has gone up from Rs 14,000 crore to Rs 17,000 crore; the number o f farmers
covered by the agricultural insurance scheme has increased from 1.8 million to 2.6 million; the number o f
houses constructed for the weaker section o f society has gone up from 331,399 to 528,552. The utilization
rate and the number o f beneficiaries in various antipoverty programs like the Swarnajayanthi Gram
Swarozgar Yojana (Village Self-Employment Program) have also recorded sharp gains inrecent years.


        IV.      Government of Andhra Pradesh's Reform Program and Support from the Bank

A.        Development Strategy

31,       Andhra Pradesh's reform program has been anchored in well-articulated strategies. It started in
January 1999 with the release o f the Vision 2020 document-a             statement o f intent to pursue economic
growth, develop human capital, and reduce poverty-which                 laid out specific targets similar to the
Millennium Development Goals for the state." The very fact that a subnational entity could prepare a
vision document and a strategy to acheve it was a novel concept in India, at a time when social and
economc goals o f the states were generally defined by the central government. Andhra Pradesh's Vision
2020 document was a major initiative that has since been followed by many states.

32.      The Government o f Andhra Pradesh has a tradition o f preparing strategy documents and
consultation papers. As a result, its reform programs tend to be well thought-out and have strong
analytical underpinnings. The strategy documents, a few o f which are listed in table 2 below, were
prepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders, and upon completion were generally posted on the
GoAP's Web site (www,aDonline.aov.in; www.ap.gov.in). The Bank has complemented the GoAP's
effort with its own reports and policy notes in the areas o f economic growth, fiscal policy, public
enterprise reform, financial management, and power sector reform-many            o f which have been published
and widely disseminated within the state.

B.       Link to World Bank's India CountryStrategy

33.      The India Country Strategy approved by the Board in August 2004 highlights support for poor
and reforming states as one o f the major thrusts of the Bank's assistance in India. Despite its recent
development success, AP's per-capita income is below the national average, and the state has pockets o f
heavy concentration o f poverty and deprivation, especially the rural areas in the Telengana region. Of the
200 poorest districts in the country, 16 are located in AP At the same time, AP continues to be a leading
reforming state in the country Thus, on both these accounts, AP remains an appropriate candidate for
continued Bank support.

C.       Relationshipto other Bank Operations

34.      The shared commitment to poverty reduction is the basis for the long development partnership
between AP and the Bank. With a cumulative net financial commitment o f about US$1 billion, AP
currently has the second-largest Bank program among Indian states. Inthe last several years, the Bank has
financed a variety o f state-specific investment projects-including      for rural poverty, rural roads and state
highways, health, child nutrition, forestry, irrigation, and power. The Bank's engagement inAP also has a
major nonlending, technical assistance component, which has led to various pieces o f analytical work
aimed at helping the state address complicated policy issues. Three Bank-financed investment projects are
being implemented in AP. Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction (APRE'R), Andhra Pradesh District
Poverty Initiatives (APDPI), and Andhra Pradesh Community Forestry A number o f projects involving
rural water supply, urban infrastructure, and irrigation and water management are at various stages o f
discussion.


                                                       12

D.       Collaboration with other Development Partners

35.      The Bank's policy dialogue and technical work in the past had been carried out in close
collaboration with DFID. The previous two budget-support operations, APERL 1 and APERL 2, were
cofinanced by DFID. In a change o f its policy relating to external development partners, the Go1 has
asked DFID to focus its future assistance exclusively on health, education, rural development, and urban
poverty DFID will therefore not be providing further financial assistance in support o f this reform
program. A t the same time, DFIDwill continue to provide technical assistance in areas agreed upon with
the government, many of which support reforms that are part of APERC 3.

36.      The DFID program has included technical assistance (TA) for improving business regulation;
technical and financial support to the public enterprise reform program; TA for setting up the Center for
Good Governance; significant technical grant support for public administration reform; and TA for health
sector reform. Recognizing the needto be fully informed and coordinated in our approach, the Bank and
DFID teams worlung on Andhra Pradesh have streamlined a system of regular consultation and
information sharing between the two organizations, as well as joint initiatives to coordinate knowledge
and experience sharing among all donors active or interested in A P DFID is in the midst o f preparing a
budget support operation inthe health sector.


             V.      The Proposed Third Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform L o a d c r e d i t

37       The proposed APERL 3 i s the third in a series o f budget operations that will support the GoAP's
ongoing policies and institutional reforms, with a view to accelerating growth, reducing poverty, and
improving the quality o f service delivery in the state. While APERL 1 and APERL 2 covered three areas
o f reforms-fiscal,  power, and governance-with      the maturity o f AP's reform program, APERL 3 has
been widened to include specific growth, poverty, and human development related issues.

38.      The APERL 2 operation, which was presented to the Bank's Executive Board on February 10,
2004, laid out eight indicative triggers for APERC 3 that support the state's own reform program and
were to be largely completed before the latter could be processed. This section discusses the
government's reform program, including the progress made toward achieving the original indicative
triggers, and explains the reasons for deviation from them, if any It further lists the prior actions that
have been completed for disbursing tranche 1 o f the operation. Given that this will be a two-tranche
operation, prior actions for both tranche 1and 2 are listed inbox 1 and box 2, respectively

39       Overall assessment of reform program sofar Implementation o f the reform program supported
by APERL 1 and 2 and progress toward APE% 3 triggers have been satisfactory Apart from the power
sector, there has been no significant variation in the original indicative triggers identified at the time o f
APERL 2. Inthe power sector, the subsidy to the sector exceeded the ceiling set for 2004105 and 2005106
due to the free power policy While this has clearly affected the power sector reform agenda, it has
subsequently been offset by wide-ranging reforms on several other fronts (see box 3). In fact, AP's
transmission company recently received the expert choice award for being the "most admired power
sector organization in the country While there has been a significant improvement inthe functioning o f
                                    "
the power utilities under public ownership, there has been declining enthusiasm for privatization
following the not so satisfactory experience in other states. In light o f the changed reality, the original
trigger has been dropped and a modified action has been introduced for tranche 2. There have also been
some minor modifications to a few other indicative triggers-namely             those dealing with poverty
reduction and investment climate issues-and     the reasons for those deviations are explained below

A.       PolicyandInstitutionalReformsfor ReducingPoverty

40.      While economic growth remains the most potent instrument to fight poverty, the GoAP has
initiated a number o f antipoverty programs (APPs) since 2004/05 to directly improve the livelihoods o f
the poor. Areas o f focus o f the antipoverty plan include increasing the access o f poor to assets like land
and credit; facilitating expansion o f Self-Help Groups (SHGs); a number o f innovative service delivery
schemes, such as food stamps in selected districts (pilot), weather-index-based crop insurance, pensions
for the disabled with a community-based targeting criteria, etc., and increased levels and coverage o f
social pensions. Two major community-driven APPs supported by Bank projects, namely APDPIP and
APRPRP, are enabling the rural poor and their organizations to improve livelihoods and quality o f life.
The design o f these programs has been influenced by the GoAP's report Poverty Free, Healthy and
Educated Rural AP by 2015 Where will AP be in 20097 which identified the vulnerable groups and
regions in the state that need more attention. However, given the large spectrum of APPs operational in
the state, there i s also considerable scope to improve their coherence and to enhance their effectiveness.

4 1.     Making land more accessible to thepoor Inorder to improve the access to land by landless rural
households, 3.25 lakh acres o f surplus government land have been distributed in two phases in 2005/06,
with titles to the land being given to the women in the household. In order to ensure that the land
distributed to the poor households i s cultivated by them, the government i s also providing necessary
financial assistance to the beneficiaries under the Indira Prabha scheme. A land distribution committee
has been set up to oversee redistribution and enhanced access o f the poor to land.

42.      Empowering women through Self-Help Groups (SHGs). In order to empower women and
promote them in earning their livelihoods, the GoAP has extended support to women SHGs. Various
training and capacity-building programs have been conducted for them on production, paclung,
marketing, microcredit, and utilization o f loans. Linkages have beendeveloped with financial institutions,
and women SHGs are encouraged to come together as cooperative societies at the village and mandal
levels to enable them to avail themselves o f bigger loans, and to collectively bargain while selling their
produce and/or purchasing raw materials. Under the Indira Kranti Patham scheme, the government has
provided community investment funds to women SHGs. Supported by these measures, there were nearly
5.8 lakh women SHGs in A P in 2005/06, covering nearly 75 lakh rural poor women and nearly 350
cooperative societies.

43.      Reducing absolute poverty in rural AP The national launch o f the National Rural Employment
Guarantee (NREG) Act, which guarantees 100 days o f work per rural household per year on public works
projects in 200 backward districts, took place in the Anantapur district o f Andhra Pradesh in February
2006, and now covers the 16 poorest districts in the state. As o f September 2006, around 4.38 million
people have been issued NREGjob cards in AP, and 1.55 million have been provided work. Because o f a
strong consultation process, effective administration, use o f information technology, and other such
measures, AP has been one o f the leaders in coverage, though more careful analysis is required to
ascertain the full benefits o f the program. In addition, the Sampoorna Grameen Rozagar Yojana, which
provides wage employment to poor and disadvantaged rural households intimes o f need by utilizing their
labor for small public works projects, continues to be implementedin all remaining districts o f AP

44.      Expanding coverage and raising the amount of social pension. Inorder to provide social security
to disadvantaged groups, the government has made progress in increasing both the coverage and rate o f
social pensions in recent years. The social pension rate has been increased from Rs 100 to Rs 200 per
month as per the directive o f the central government from April 1, 2005. The coverage in AP has
expanded to almost 22 lakh widows, elderly, and disabled through an additional 3 lakh pensions in
2005/06. Inaddition, computerization o f social pension records is ongoing.



                                                      17

45.      Poverty monitoring and data analysis. In addition to direct poverty alleviation measures, the
government is buildingon efforts to improve poverty monitoring and data analysis. A chapter on poverty
and employment was included in the state's 2005106 Annual Economic Survey I t has set up two business
processing units with adequate hardware and software facilities to enter and analyze data from 25,000
villages from NREG districts and from women SHGs, and formats for data entry are being developed.
Social audits are being undertaken by community and local government groups in about 1,400 villages in
three NREGdistricts to improve the effectiveness of the program.

Prior Action for Tranche I

         (1 of 7) The Government prepares a report to assess AP's prospect of achieving Millennium
         Development Goals (MDGs), and uses it to design and implement the anti-poverty programs in
         the state.

46.      Status of the prior action. The indicative trigger was about preparation o f a consolidated action
plan for poverty reduction. The government that came to power in May 2004 was, however, more keen to
move beyond preparation o f the action plan and to actually implement a number o f antipoverty programs.
Therefore, a report "Poverty Free, Healthy and Educated Rural AP by 2015 Where will AP be in 20093"
was prepared in 2005, which identified the particular social groups, regions, and indicators for which AP
will not achieve its MDGs. These findings, together with other strategic departmental initiatives, were
used to design and implement more targeted policy interventions, including the land distribution policy,
NREG scheme, and social pension scheme discussed above. As mentioned earlier, the new government
has been more committed to reducing poverty and to implementing a number o f antipoverty programs
than was envisaged at the time o f APERL 2. From this perspective, while the substance of the indicative
trigger has been met, its wording has been modified as noted inbox 1.

47       Future challenges. Like most Indian states, AP has a large and growing number o f APPs under
implementation. I t is important that these programs are internally coherent, consistent with its
community-driven development approach, and efficient. The GoAP has been exploring several ways to
meet these challenges. For example, to strengthen the implementation o f NREG, the government intends
to increase the capacity and awareness o f Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), to reduce leakages in the
system, build links between the NREG database and other administrative sources like the Below Poverty
Line (BPL) census data to obtain a richer picture o f current NREGusers, and to develop a training agenda
for effective implementation o f the main development schemes in the state. In addition, to improve
community monitoring, the government plans to expand the system o f social audits by developing the
knowledge and funds base, and the methodology, to enable communities to undertake social audits o f
programs at the grassroots level. By 2007/08, the government plans to introduce social audits in at least a
quarter o f the villages in the 13 districts where NREG is being currently rolled out. The intention o f the
GoAP i s to gradually expand the social audit methodology to other antipoverty programs. Finally, a
state-specific impact evaluation o fNREGinAP is plannedover the coming two years, w h c h will provide
more detailed insights into household-level poverty, local labor market impacts, quality and impacts o f
assets created, and other factors.

48.      In the area o f social pension administration, the GoAP is loolung at three initiatives: an ICT
initiative for record keeping, introduction o f a combination o f smart card and mobile-based processes for
disbursal o f pension payments, and introduction o f social audits during 2007/08. In order to enhance
productive employment o f rural youth in the private sector, the government has set up an Employment
Generation and Marketing Mission, which is based on an innovative Public Private Partnership (PPP)
model, and seeks to provide private sector job placements to rural youth after suitable short-course
training. The mission has already resulted in tens o f thousands o f poor rural youth finding well-
remunerated private-sector employment, and the GoAP plans to cover around 1million rural youth inthe
coming three to four years.

B.        Measuresto ImproveState's Investment Climate for PrivateSector Growth

49        A number o f studies have shown that AP has one o f the best investment climates inthe country
It was the first state to enact the Single Window Act, to prepare legislation supporting public-private
partnerships; to amend laws to make the labor market more flexible; and to liberalize the state's wholesale
market for agricultural goods. The improvement in the investment climate is bearing fruit: during the
January-May 2006 period, Andhra Pradesh emerged as the second most important investment destination
inthe country after Gujarat (and better than the traditionally large recipients o finvestment like Karnataka,
Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu)-attracting               more than Rs 18,000 crore (US$4.2 billion) o f investment
proposal." Further, as per the CAPEX database o f the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, AP has
moved to second place interms o f the value of projects under implementation as o f April 2006, compared
with the fourth place it enjoyed in April 2003. The GoAP's future reform program includes creating
world-class Special Economic Zones (SEZs), more effective land usage through an integrated land
information system and fine-tuning its agricultural marketing arrangements. The following are some o f
the reform initiatives undertaken by the GoAP since 2003/04 to improve the state's investment climate.

50.       Making the labor market morejlexible. The GoAP was the first Indian state to amend the contract
labor regulation to allow flexibility in hiring contract workers. Subsequently, it prepared the Special
Enclave Service Condition and Disputes Resolution (SESCDR) Act o f 2003, aimed at faster resolution o f
industrial disputes and removing rigidities in the functioning o f the labor market in selected industrial
enclaves. The Act was passed by the Andhra Pradesh legislature in October 2003 and was referred to the
President o f India for ratification in 2004. Since the ratification has not been received, GoAP, therefore,
included the same provisions for labor market reforms in the A P Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act,
which was passed by the legislature in2005.20

5 1.      Policies aimed at introducing competition in agricultural markets. In recent months, the
agriculture sector has witnessed a series o f policy and institutional changes, some o f which are aimed at
increasing competition and encouraging greater private investment, while others are intended to raise
public investment and to step up government's involvement in the sector. The most notable reform has
been the amendment to the Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Act in October 2005 to allow the
private sector to build and operate agncultural market yards. Based on this amendment, a foreign private
company has recently been allowed to operate a wholesale market in Hyderabad, and a number o f pnvate
domestic companies have expressed interest inentering the market.

52.       Establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). The A P legislature has passed the Andhra
Pradesh Special Economic Zones Act, 2005, to facilitate and accelerate the setting up o f SEZs inthe state.
This Act not only incorporates all the facilitative provisions o f the Central Act (incentives and prescribed
simplified procedures) for encouraging economic activity, but also has provisions targeted to provide
labor market flexibility For example, the provisions o f Chapter V-B o f the Central Industrial Disputes
Act 1947 that deal with retrenchment o f workers have been relaxed, trade union rules have been
rationalized, and the Development C o m s s i o n e r o f the SEZ has been vested with the powers o f the
Labor Commissioner.

a surge in investment proposals in the recent past given the buoyant mineral-based commodity markets. If they are included,
AP's rank falls from second to fifth.
  Provisions include devolution of the powers of the Labor Commissioner to the DevelopmentCommissioner of the industrial
zonedestates; designating certain industnal zonesiunits as "public utility service" for the purpose of the IndustnesDisputes Act
1947, precludingindustrialstrikes.

                                                              19

Prior Action for Tranche 1

         (2 of 7) The state's investment climate is improved by* (9 amending the Andhra Pradesh
        Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market (APLM) Act, to lift state monopoly and bring about
        greater liberalization of agricultural wholesale markets; (id facilitating speedier resolution of
         industrial disputes and removing rigidities in the functioning of the labor market in selected
         industrial enclaves by including various provisions of the labor market reform in the Special
        Economic Zones Act.

53.      Status of the prior action. The A P L M Act was amended by the A P legislature in October 2005.
The SESCDR Act, which was designedto bring about the necessary labor market reforms, was passed by
the AP legislature in October 2003 and was referred to the President o f India for ratification. But due to
the change in government at the Center in May 2004, the expected ratification did not materialize. The
GoAP therefore included the same labor market provisions in the SEZ Act, 2005, which was passed by
the legislature inOctober 2005.

54.      Future challenges. Having achieved the second-highest value o f projects under implementation
among the Indian states, the emphasis in A P is now to speed up project implementation and to raise
operational efficiency o f existing and new investments. There are two important actions the GoAP intends
to undertake to meet these challenges. First, it plans to undertake an independent assessment o f past
investment climate reforms, including single window facility, labor market, annual inspection, self-
certification, and environment clearances. Second, the GoAP i s piloting an Integrated Land Information
System in the district o f Nizamabad that aims to provide "conclusive" titling to land parcels and to
integrate information on land titles across government departments. This initiative envisions legislative
bachng for an agency vested with the sole authority to provide "conclusive" land title across the state.
The latest technology is being used for land surveys and updating o f land records. A methodology has
been established to ascertain conflicting claims and settle disputes. Various departments dealing in land
transactions (the Revenue Department, Sub-Registrar's Office, etc.) are being networked to allow for the
instant updating o f changes in land ownership and claims. On the agricultural marketing side, having
amended the Act, the GoAP now needs to ensure that public institutions that are currently engaged in
agricultural marketing change their role to become facilitators and regulators o f the market.

C.       Fiscal Reforms:ProgressandChallenges

55.     Andhra Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. In June 2005, this
Act came into force. Among the specific measures, it requires the state government to practice fiscal
prudence by. (a) progressively eliminating (by 2008/09) the revenue deficit, with at least a 0.32 percent
reduction each year; (b) reducing the fiscal deficit by at least a quarter o f 1percent o f GSDP, to bring it
down to no more than 3 percent by the end o f 2008/09; (c) constraining outstanding liabilities to no more
than 35 percent o f GSDP by 2009/10; and (d) limiting the amount o f annual incremental risk-weighted
guarantees to 90 percent o f the total revenue receipts o f the second preceding year. The base period for
these statistics is 2004105. Through the FRBM Act, the government has institutionalized its own fiscal
reform program, with clear milestones for the next four years. The Act has also contributed to increased
transparency o f the budget process. The 2006/07 budget document included a brief macro framework,
medium term fiscal targets, details on guarantees, sinlung fund, guarantee redemption fund, number of
employees, statement of assets etc.

56.     Implementation of the value added tax (VAT).The GoAP, together with 22 other Indian states,
implementeda VAT on April 1, 2005. This has three major implications. First, from the large number of
tax rates in the previous sales tax regime, the VAT system has only four rates o f taxation (1, 4, 12.5, and




                                                     20

20 percent)2'-thereby        reducing uncertainty to taxpayers and investors about annual changes to tax rates
and reducing unhealthy "tax competition" between states. Second, it has improved transparency and
eliminated the cascading impact o f taxes through its provision o f input tax credits and reduced the
possibility o f undue harassment o f traders by tax authorities. Finally, while transitioning to VAT, Andhra
Pradesh made considerable changes in the way it administered taxes-restructuring                        the tax department
along functional lines, extensive computerization o f tax records and payment systems, and so on-which
has led to less time spent on filing taxes, faster processing o f tax payments, and a decline inthe time taken
to register new dealers.

57       Measures to make the tax system and tax administration more citizen friendly                        The GoAP has
diligently implemented several recommendations o f the Revenue Reform Committee (RRC)", which have
led to better compliance and collection. The basic rates o f the stamp duty, transfer duty, and registration
fees have been rationalized, and the rates have been reduced from 13.5 to 9.5 percent in urban areas, and
from 11.5 to 9.5 percent in other areas. The motor vehicle tax rate has been reduced from 16 to 7.5
percent. Other actions taken on the basis o f RRC reports include abolition o f internal check posts,
establishment o f Large Taxpayers Units and Dealer Service Centers in each division, and holding o f
regular bimonthly meetings with trade associations to address grievances. Computerization and
management information systems (MIS) have been set up at all revenue-earning departments, and the
infrastructures are beingstrengthened at the field level.

Prior Action for Tranche 1

          (3 of 7) The "Andhra Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (APFRBM) Act is                     "
         passed and all keyfiscal targets in 2005/06 and 2006/07 (budget) are consistent with it.

58.      Status of theprior action. The APFRBM Act was passed by the state legislature in 2005, ensuring
annual presentation o f MTFF along with the budget. The GoAP has met or surpassed the key fiscal
targets set out in the Act, as shown in figure 2. With an increased share of capital expenditure in total
expenditures, the composition o f spending has improved, though the expenditure share o f key sectors, like
primary education and health, has remained stagnant during the 2004/05-2005/06 period (their share is
budgeted to go up significantly in2006107).

59       Future challenges. Loolung ahead, AP's finances face two major risks that need careful
management: (i)large and growing public investment for the irrigation sector; and (ii)expanding
subsidies and transfer bills. The GoAP has already spent on irrigation (and related activities) over Rs
8,000 crore (US$1.9 billion) in 2005/06, and has budgeted over Rs 12,000 crore (US$2.8 billion) in
2006/07 Unless fully completed, new irrigation projects do not bear any benefits. In the past, the public
finances o f a number o f Indian states have come under severe stress on account o f large spending on
irrigation infrastructure projects that were abandoned at the midpoint due to lack o f funds, resultingin a
fiscal crisis and adversely affecting the quality o f public services. To ensure effective return on its
investment, AP has to manage its irrigation program appropriately                 23 Similarly, transfers and subsidies are
budgeted to increase from 3.6 percent o f GSDP in 2005/06 to 5 percent in 2006/07 While many o f these
subsides and transfers are desirable (e.g., social pensions), and in many cases are cofinanced by the Go1
(e.g., NREGS), careful management and monitoring o f these programs would ensure that critical needs o f
the poor are well addressed.




2iPetroleum products and liquor are subjectedto taxation at specialrates.
22 In 2002, the state government established the Revenue Reform Committee (RRC) to look at the existing tax and nontax
instruments and make recommendations for reform. RRC preparedreports on commercial taxes and stamps, and registration.
23 The state government has expressed interest in seeking a Bank loadcredit for its irrigation sector. Irrigation sector reforms
including a state policy on water management are being discussed as part o f this operation.

                                                              21

D.      Reforms in PublicFinancialManagementand Accountability

60.     Follow up on State Financial Accountability Assessment (SFAA). After the completion and
adoption o f the SFAA report, the Finance Department initiated the implementation process through a
steering committee, with technical support from the Centre for Good Governance. Following is the
progress inimplementing the key recommendations:


     0   The public financial management (PFM) legal framework has been strengthened through revision
         and updating o f codes and manuals, including improved accessibility to all government orders
         (GOs).

     0   Capacity o f the line departments has been improved to develop realistic expenditure estimates
         and to proactively monitor expenditure throughout the year.

     0   Enhanced accountability o f drawing and disbursement officers (DDOs) through the issuance o f
         fiduciary performance indicators and implementing and monitoring them through the treasuries.

     0   Better treasury systems through computerization and networlung, and initiation o f process
         reengineering.

     0   Increased disclosure o f debt liabilities in public accounts, and enforcement o f stricter
         requirements for scrutiny and risk assessment o f guarantee proposals.
61.      Improvement zn the budgetary process. Along with the adoption o f a medium-term fiscal
framework, the GoAP has simplified its budget classifications, issued more comprehensive budget
instructions and budget timetables, put in place a detailed scrutiny process, and introduced greater
transparency As a result o f these improvements, fiscal marksmanship has generally improved. The
budget has become a more effective tool for the government to implement its policy priorities. This is
reflected in the Annual Fiscal Frameworks for 2004105 and 2005106, and shifts in expenditure in the
budget. Transparency has improved with user-friendly budgets, and account information is now available
online and in printed versions, in the form o f the Annual Fiscal Framework, the Budget in Brief, and
Accounts at a Glance.

62.      Management of contingent liabilities. Significant progress has been made in the management o f
contingent liabilities, following a GO that established a ceiling on guarantees and a detailed scrutiny
process for all new guarantee proposals. The government has also established a guarantee redemption
fund and discloses the stock o f outstanding guarantees along with the budget document. Outstanding
guarantees are comfortably within the limit prescribed in the FRBMAct. Following the recommendation
o f the TFC, the government has set up a sinlung fund to meets the redemption o f open market loans. An
amount o f Rs 213 crore has been budgeted under this fund in 2006107 It has also set up a guarantee
redemption fund through earmarked guarantee fees and is worlung out a methodology for classification
for weighting the guarantees based on their risks. An amount o f Rs 27 crore has been earmarked under
this fund for 2006107

63.      Cash management and predictability of fundflows. Automation o f the treasury system has been
completed down to district subtreasuries. This has reduced the need for cash transactions, which are
vulnerable to fraud, and provided a tool for improving cash management. Wages and salaries o f state
government employees are now made through the commercial banlung system. This has helped the
government to completely eliminate its need to resort to ways and means advances or overdrafts from the
Reserve Bank o f India (RBI). Predictable fund flows to implementing agencies has also helped to ensure
a generally high level o f consistency between budget and outturn, at around 90 percent. The government
has maintained a consistent pattern o f releases, authorizing expenditure o f up to 50 percent o f the budget
at the beginning o f the financial year. In spite o f this, expenditure remains slow in the first quarter (14-15
percent o f the total) with a rush inthe last quarter (39-40 percent).

64.      Issuance of Handbook of Financial Accountability A Handbook on Financial Accountability
(2004), which simplified and pulled together fragmented rules and procedures into a single document to
guide all the controlling and disbursing officers across the state, which number around 60,000, has been
issued. Other finance codes and manuals are inthe process of being updated and made more concise. All
GOs are now accessible via a GoAP Web site

65.      Internal audit. This i s being reestablished as an important element for monitoring and enforcing
financial accountability An internal audit (IA) unit has been established in the Finance Department, and
an audit committee has been established to provide overall direction. An IA manual has been prepared,
with support from the Institute o f Public Auditors o f India (IPAI), and internal audit units are being set up
in Treasury, Pay and Accounts Offices, and Project and Works Department plus the seven largest
spending ministries.

66.      Financial accounts of local bodies. A financial accountability assessment o f local bodies has been
completed and the GoAP i s considering the report recommendations. The GoAP has already adopted new
comptroller and auditor general (CAG) guidelines for local government and municipal accounts by a GO
(No. 613), effective from 2005/06. The large backlog o f overdue municipal accounts has been reduced
significantly As a result o f an amendment to the PRI Act, which introduced penalties for local
government officials who fail to maintain proper annual accounts, a compliance level o f over 95 percent
has been achieved.

67       Fixed asset control, departmental budgeting, and debt management. A World Bank IDF grant
has been approved in May 2006 to: (a) improve the integrity o f the state budget; (b) strengthen the
management o f assets and liabilities; and (c) strengthen internal auditing and internal controls. These will
be facilitated through: (a) the development and implementation o f a system for online budget monitoring;
(b) the establishment o f dedicated asset management and debt management units;and (c) the setting up o f
an internal audit unit within the Finance Department. The grant i s effective and implementation has
commenced.

68.      PSUjnancial accountability. A financial accountability assessment o f PSUs is being planned
during this fiscal year, with a view to identify the major public financial accountability and management
weaknesses inorder to take corrective measures.

69       PFM impact assessment. Another initiative that the GoAP plans to undertake is to carry out an
impact assessment o f the P F M reforms implemented so far, using the performance measurement
framework developed by Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) group. This will
involve the use o f P F M indicators for assessing the progress to date and establishment o f a baseline for
future monitoring o f PFM progress. This will be a third-party assessment carried out by an academic
institution with the technical support o f the CGG.

Prior Action for Tranche I

         (4 of 7) Continuation of the PEFM reforms as identiped in the SFAA including: (i) improvement
         in response to audit queries of the Accountant General; (ii) maintenance of timely resource
         releases; and (iii) internal audit unit established andfunctioning.

70.      Status of theprior action. Timely release o f funds has been maintained, and an internal audit unit
has been established and i s functioning. While responses to all pending audit paragraphs for 2001/02 and
2002/03 have not been forwarded to the accountant general (AG), substantial improvement in
responsiveness to audits has been achieved. It has been agreed that the Finance Department would set up
a robust database for traclung audit queries and responses for each department.



                                                        23

71.      Future challenges. Loolung ahead, the government will continue to implement the reforms and
monitor its financial management performance using the framework o f PEFA indicators. It may also
follow up, as the next stage o f reform, with an accountability assessment o f public sector units.

E.       ReformingPublic Enterprises:Restructuringand Privatization

72.      Like most other states in India, AP had a large number o f State Level Public Enterprises (SLPEs),
many o f which were inefficient, inappropriate in the new economic world, and incurring huge financial
losses that contributed to the fiscal stress o f the state. The state decided to embark upon a reformprogram
in 1999, which has resulted ina number of enterprises beingclosed, privatized, restructured, or divested.

73.      Phase I of the reform program. As o f February 2006, the GoAP has privatized, closed,
restructured, or divested 77 enterprises since the start o f the program in 1999 Of these, 12 enterprises
have been privatized, 24 have been closed, 32 downsized and restructured, and nine divested. A well-
planned social safety net program (SSNP) was designed to mitigate the social impact o f reforms. The
approach has been to ensure that the interests o f workers and consumers are protected with minimum
adverse impact. This program has two distinct components: first, the Voluntary Retirement Scheme
(VRS), which is essentially aimed at easing the impact o fjob loss by providing a severance package; and
second, counseling and retraining for the redeployment o f the displaced workers so that over a period o f
time they can be reintegrated into the emerging labor market or become self-employed.

74.      Phase 11of the reform program. The second phase o f the public enterprise reform program-
supported by the APERLs-started        in 2002 and consisted o f 68 enterprises which were to be addressed
during the next four to five years. This number has now increased to 71, with one enterprise where the
government divested, and two more enterprises, which were not in Phase 11, beingbrought into the sphere
o f reforms under the Phase I1 program. Of these 71 enterprises, by March 2006, 58 had been closed,
privatized, restructured or divested. A target o f 15 each in 2002103 and 2003104 and 14 in 2004105 was
achieved. In 2005106, so far 14 enterprises have been addressed. Since the start o f the program, four
enterprises have been privatized, 18 closed, 27 restructured and nine divested.

Prior Action for Tranche 1

         (5 of 7) Phase 11of the Public Enterprise Reform program          ISimplemented and program targets
        for 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2005/06 are achieved.

75.       Status of theprior action. This prior action has been met.Phase I1o f the public enterprise reform
program continues to be on track, and the program targets for 2003104 and 2004105 have been achieved.
Remaining enterprises in Phase I1will be completed soon. Phase I11o f the reform program has also been
initiated.

76.      Future challenges. Twenty-seven enterprises had been excluded from the Phase I1 action plan.
These include large labor-intensive enterprises that are considered to have high political and social costs
in terms of redundancies, and where preparatory work will be required before restructuring is initiated.
Also excluded are enterprises with social obligations (e.g. Cooperative Bank, SC/BC Finance, Civil
Supplies Corporation), or those with a developmental function that i s likely to require restructuring.
Together, they account for bulk o f the budgetary burden, accounting for close to 85 percent o f total
government support to the PE sector in the last five years. With the experience o f PE reforms in the first
two phases, the government i s initiating the thrd and final phase o f the program. Option studies and
decisions relating to the remaining 27 enterprises will be undertaken over the next two to three years.

F.       ImprovingGovernance

77       Andhra Pradesh has made good progress in implementing governance reforms, particularly in
areas where the government has historically placed its greatest emphasis, such as e-governance and
transparency The first phase o f the GoAP's governance reform program aimed at setting up some basic
institutional structures, including the Centre for Good Governance (CGG) and the General Administration
Department (GAD), which could formulate, coordinate and monitor government reform initiatives.
Embedding these institutions into the governance framework has taken considerable effort on the part o f
champions within the state. These efforts have been largely successful, and these institutions have now
become major platforms for reform. The CGG has developed an enviable reputation as an analytical think
tank that not only supports AP's strategic reform needs, but also supports national-level reforms. While
progress against corruption has been satisfactory, advances in areas such as the reform o f human resource
management has been mixed.

78.      E-Governance. E-governance has traditionally been an area o f strength for AP, and the state
continues to build on its success. "E-Seva"      (services through electronics) has been expanded to 260
locations, and all municipalities in AP are now covered. Over 30 million transactions now take place
across AP and 170 government services are available online. The government has recently launched an
innovative rural online service delivery program, Rajiv, which attempts to take government services to
rural populations. The program envisages the establishment o f Internet centers through a public-private
partnership in all Panchayats, and the provision o f computer literacy to at least one member o f each rural
family In the first phase, over 8,600 villages will be covered, and by 2006, it i s envisaged that every
village will have connectivity and be enabled to access online government services.

79       Civil service reform. A new "Governance Reform and Public Management Strategy" was
prepared in May 2005 by the new government, which builds on the achievements o f the first phase o f the
governance reform program. Based on the new strategy, Strategy and Performance Innovation Units
(SPlcT's) have been set up in 12 focus departments, including general administration, finance, rural
development, welfare, and health. Change and Development Plans have been developed by these
departments, and are being implemented under an innovative governance project, the Andhra Pradesh
Public Management and Service Delivery Improvement Project funded by DFID. The SPIU in the
General Administration Department has been responsible for drafting the new procurement law, for
leading reforms related to transparency and anticorruption, and for the overall monitoring o f the
governance reform program. Notable successes include reforms in procurement in public works and
strong baseline analytical work in many sectors. The SPIU in the health department has supported the
development o f an innovative Health Systems Reform Program, which has been accepted by the state
government and will be funded by DFID. Strategic reviews o f staffing have been carned out in four
departments and at the level o f urban local bodies.

80.      Human resource management. While comprehensive organizational charts o f reporting
relationships for ministers and civil servants have been prepared and placed on the Internet, and
departments grouped thematically for budget and performance management, progress on human resource
management (HRM) has been less than anticipated. The GoAP has undertaken a number o f diagnostic
exercises to examine HRM issues across departments, and is considering the implementation o f some o f
the important recommendations of these reports, including the establishment of a central human resource
management unit. In addition, the GoAP intended to roll out a computerized HRM system in four pilot
departments. While the system has been designed, i t i s yet to be implemented fully inthese departments.

8 1.     Improved transparency and accountability. A P i s widely recognized for its progress in citizens'
charters, and external monitoring groups have commended the efforts o f the government in implementing
these charters. More than a 100 departments have implemented charters, and nodal officers have been
appointed in departments in the last year who are responsible for monitoring implementation. The GoAP

                                                      25

has recently set up a multiroute grievance redressal mechanism, which includes an online component. AP
i s also among the leading Indian states in implementation o f the k g h t to Information (RTI) Act.
Departmental manuals have been prepared, information officers have been appointed in over 70,000
public undertalungs and the CGG is tahng forward a wide-ranging capacity building program for both
government officials and civil society

82.      Procurement reforms. The GoAP has defined a two-pronged strategy for improving procurement
outcomes: one prong focuses on improving rules and practices, and the second prong emphasizes
improving procedures through the use o f modern ICT technology. The GoAP has had considerable
success in the second aspect-implementing           a statewide Electronic Government Procurement (e-GP)
system. After an extensive period o f piloting, the e-GP system has been rolled out to encompass most
departments, and the GoAP estimates that 90 percent o f the value o f procurement currently goes through
the e-GP system. However, progress in improving procurement rules and skills has not kept pace with the
technical advancement. Delays in securing passage o f the procurement law (expected to be passed later
this fiscal year) have limited the state's ability to improve the underlying quality o f procurement rules and
practices. Differences in the rates o f progress o f the two prongs o f the procurement reform strategy have
worked to dampen the overall impact o f the introduction o f e-GP For example, the e-GP system has
generated only a slight rise in the number o f bidders for procurement contracts-a       fact that suggests that
issues relating to the fundamental worlung o f the system need to be addressed in order to truly enhance
competition.

83.      Anticorruption. The government o f Andhra Pradeshhas undertaken important reforms inthe area
o f anticomption. Between 2003 and 2005, the number o f inquiries and investigations completed has
increased from 292 to 303, the number o f charge sheets filed inAnti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) courts has
increased from 182 to 235, and the number o f convictions has increased from 43 to 87 But on the flip
side, during the same period, trap cases being booked have fallen from 256 to 183, and the number o f
disproportionate asset cases has fallen from 65 to 48. An anticorruption action plan was prepared in2004,
which envisaged strengthening the budget and staffing o f the main anticorruption agencies (ACAs) a
stronger focus on enforcement at the district level, and its implementationhas been satisfactory There has
been significant new investment, particularly in strengthening the Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E)
department, whose budget has doubled in the last two years. The ACAs report that they are satisfactorily
staffed and that their infrastructure needs have been met. The GoAP has agreed to strengthen the outreach
mechanisms for V&E, and three additional regional V&E unit offices will be set up at the distnct level
this year. The GoAP has provided the Vigilance C o m s s i o n a budget for public awareness campaigns
and the Commission has been authorized by the government to receive complaints from the public about
corruption, and at the same time protect whistleblowers. Moving from enforcement to prevention,
progress has been made in talung forward detailed studies o f corruption-prone processes in a number o f
departments, including the weaker sections, housing, transport, revenue and registration and stamps
departments.

Prior Action for Tranche 1

         (6 of 7) Government supports the anti- corruption agencies with adequatefinancial and human
         resources. E-procurement program is implemented consistent with existing milestones.

84.      Status of the prior action. The budget o f the ACB has increased by over 20 percent since
2004105, while the budget o f the V&E department has increased by over 104 percent since 2004/05. The
increased resources have allowed for better staffing and infrastructure in these units, and the agencies
report satisfaction. The V&E unit has been provided resources to expand its scale o f operations and
establish three additional fully staffed regional units to tackle corruption. There has been significant
progress in improving procurement outcomes in sectors and in introducing e-procurement, which has



                                                        26

been established in seven departments, 11 PSUs, and 41 municipalities, and resulted in savings o f Rs.
1,000 crore in2004105.

G.       Power Sector Reforms: Resolvingthe Key InfrastructureConstraint

85.      The fiscal and environmental impacts o f the policy o f free power to farmers have subsequently
beenoffset by wide-ranging reforms on several other fronts. These include the announcement of a revised
free power policy (see box 3), continued efficiency improvements, and a number o f institutional reforms
inthe sector. A favorable governance and regulatory environment has facilitated a steady improvement in
operational and commercial performance o f AP's power sector. There is, however, considerable scope to
improve the pace o f commercialization and to increase metering.

86.      Sustained support from the government. Some o f the key areas where the government has
demonstrated its commitment to reforms include: (i)funding for unfunded pension liabilities; (ii)
regularly paying subsidy obligations, as determined transparently by APERC; (iii)     providing operational
autonomy to utilities, and providing legislative and administrative support to curb theft through enactment
o f comprehensive antitheft legislation, administrative support (including setting up 26 special police
stations), and nomination o f vigilance officers to handle theft. The state government has also successfully
involved external partners to support its reform efforts-the      Government o f India (Accelerated Power
Development & Reform Program), the World Bank, and bilateral donors (especially DFIDand CIDA).

87       Strong regulatory performance. APERC has succeeded in improving the credibility o f
performance data, providing a stable and increasingly predictable regulatory framework, and opening up
the regulatory process to a wider cross-section o f stakeholders. It has an excellent record o f on-time and
high-quality tariff rulings. While applauding the efforts o f APERC, consumer representatives have
highlighted the needto make regulatory processes more participatory (for example by malung documents
more understandable to users) and to involve stakeholders in discussing the medium- and long-term
investment plans o f the regulated utilities.

88.      Performance-based management. Performance o f AP's power utilities i s influenced by the
Memoranda o f Understanding (MoU) signed with the Ministry o f Power, GoI. In addition, APERC's
performance-linked regulations have been translated into performance targets for superintendent
engineers and divisional engineers. The scheme is now being extended to develop appropriate key
performance indicators (-1s)       to measure performance o f various functions such as human resource,
finance, projects, commercial, etc. A distribution company-level incentive scheme based on these KPIs i s
also proposed to be piloted in one o f the companies. Certain key activities have been outsourced under
performance-based contracts to improve performance andproductivity

89       Internal controls. There have been efforts at strengthening the financial audit systems (including
internal audits) inthe distribution companies (discoms). However, the achievements o f these efforts have
not been extended to the agriculture sector (which is not fully metered) and further progress in rolling out
energy input and billing controls to the circle level are key areas requiring strengthening o f internal
controls (see box 2).

90.      Implementation of an open-access regime. Consistent with the Electricity Act 2003, A P became
one o f the first states in the country to move (in2005) from a single-buyer market model to a multibuyer
model, and also announced the schedule for opening up the retail market to competition through "open
access" to its transmission and distribution networks.




                                                     27

                         Box 3: Impact of the Free PowerPolicy andthe CopingStrategy

 The current government, which came into power in May 2004, followed through on its election promise and
 introduced free power to farmers inMay 2004. It also waived electricity dues of farmers to the tune of Rs 1,258
 crore. The initial surge in unauthorized farm connections soon after the free power policy was announced almost
 caused a collapse of the supply system, including a staggering rise in transformer burnouts and cable failures.
 This forced the GoAP to undertakea number of far-reachingreforms (including those discussedinparagraphs 79-
 84), some of which perhapswould not have beenpossible otherwise.

 A slowdown of the reform program. Largely as a                3500
 consequence of the free (or previously heavily                           GoAP Subsldyto Power Sector
                                                                                     (in Rs. Crore)
 subsidized) power supply to             farmers,  reform      3,000

 outcomes have fallen short in several areas, including
 the pace of commercialization (cost recovery from             2500

 tariffs in 2005106 was only 84 percent, significantly         2000
 lower than the original target of 93 percent), and the
 pace of metering (metered sales as % of distribution           1500
 company purchases amounted to only 55 percent,
 significantly lower than the original target of 74             1Oo0
 percent). However, the fiscal burden was less
 significant-subsidy support to the sector increased             500

 from Rs 1,513 crore in 2003104 to Rs 1,813 crore in
                                                                  ~

 Revision to the free power policy. The agricultural                                                    RE

 power policy was amended in January 2005, with steps toward better targeting of free power subsidies through
 exclusion of large farmers (e.g., those who pay income tax) and implementation of demand-side measures, such
 as installation of capacitors and efficient pump sets. However, even under the revisedpolicy, nearly 95 percentof
 the farmers are eligible for free power supply. Although the revisedpolicy restricts free power to a single paddy
 crop, monitoring cropping patterns may not be possible and implementation o f such a policy may be politically
 difficult. Of late, the utilities are trying to shift the focus of supply control under the free power regime from
 minimumhours of supply to adequate supply for crop
 protection.                                                                                                    III_




 Controlling agricultural consumption. Over the last                         C o s t recoveryfrom tariffs
                                                               r)o%                       (inO h )             APERL
 two years, utilities, with political support, have
 managed to control agricultural consumption broadly
 in line with stated targets through effective
 communication at the grassroots level (between
 farmers and utility representativesat each substation)        6ooh

 and by adopting systemic tools and procedures to
 ensure effective restoring of supply across different         400h
 agro climatic zones within the state. Capping o f
 agricultural supply has also been helped by a firm            20%

 measuressuch as aHigh Voltage Distribution System,
 segregation of agricultural feeders, and single phasing o f supply to rural domestic consumers. Elaborate
 investment schemes have been suggested for implementation of these measures on a large scale. However,
 despite significant improvements in loss reduction, improved voltage levels, and control over agricultural
 consumption, the cost efficiency of these investment-intensivemeasuresneeds to be established,and these should
 be applied selectively, based on a thorough financial and economic analysis.

91.      Status of the prior action. As discussed earlier, due to changes on the ground, the indicative
trigger for the power sector has been dropped for Tranche 1. However, the government feels the need to


                                                            28

monitor power consumption for agriculture. Because introducing individual meters for farmers continues
to be politically difficult, the government has decided to measure agriculture consumption at the feeder
level. In order to enhance the credibility o f measuring agricultural consumption, it is therefore proposed
to verify the measurement by an independent third party on the basis o f a methodology that is approved
by the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission. This has been modified and included as a prior action for
the second tranche.

92.       Future challenges. In the medium term, the power sector in A P faces the following risks: (i)a
surge in subsidized power supply to farmers due to drought or pressures to release more than the planned
farm connections; (ii)    an increase in generation costs (electricity from new thermal plants i s about 15-20
percent more costly than from older, state-owned plants), and insufficient generation capacity-especially
inview o fthe delay in supply of gas to new plants, or ifpoor rainfall causes a drop in available low-cost
hydropower; (iii)a financial burden on account o f contractual obligations with new generation capacities
where natural gas i s not available; (iv) fiscal costs associated with implementation o f key provisions of
the revised free power policy to farmers, especially the demand-side management measure of using only
certified efficient pump sets; and (v) political resistance to pass on rising costs o f generation into tariffs,
especially in view o f higher physical and institutional strengthening investments required for further
efficiency improvements. Another challenge moving forward for the sector will be to maximize the
benefits that farmers (particularly poor farmers) derive from power and other subsidies, while also
ensuring the sustainability o f groundwater resources, and eliminating distortions inagricultural markets.

H.        School Education

93.       The government o f India, in consultation with the states, launched the Saiva Shiksha Abhiyan
(SSA) in 2001 with a view to universalize elementary education. This has become the main vehicle for
enhancing access to, and quality of, public elementary schools in the country AP implements the SSA in
its elementary schools. All triggers and actions indicated in the text and matrix fall within the main
component or innovation component o f the SSA.

94.       Reducing the number of out-of-school children. The GoAP has been able to identify about
390,000 out-of-school children, and o f these, has managed to enroll about 170,000. The state attributes
this success to Badi Bata, a social mobilization program in which volunteers undertake house-to-house
surveys to identify out-of-school children and dropouts. Students without any formal schooling are then
mainstreamed through Residential Bridge Centers (RBCs), while children with some formal schooling are
mainstreamed directly In earlier years, gains made through programs have been short-lived, and the
benefits have quickly dissipated over a short period o f time. However, under Badi Bata, the government
has made an effort to bringtogether other inputs needed to make this sustainable by ensuring parental and
teacher participation inthe process o f getting children back into school.

95.       Improving the reading ability of students. The GoAP recognizes that low levels o f reading ability
limit and inhibit performance o f children in standardized tests24 To address these key quality concerns,
the GoAP has employed the Children's Language Improvement Program (CLIP), and more recently,
introduced the Children's Learning Acceleration Program in a Sustainable Way (CLAPS). CLIP put
emphasis on the importance o f being able to recognize and read words, and not merely copy them into a
notebook. This emphasis on reading is achieved by allocating an additional 30 minutes a day to training.
Assessments made through the CLIP program have allowed schools to be characterized according to
performance, and thus set a baseline over which improvements can be demonstrated. While this seemed
to be a promising undertalung, the program was closed about a year after it began, and the administration


24  Ongoing research through APRESt (Andhra Pradesh Randomized Evaluation Study) demonstrates this unequivocally.
Childrenwere able to answer questionsthat were readout to them, but were not able to complete answers to questions that were
given to them on a question sheet.

has turned it attention now to CLAPS. This program i s based on the premise that many o f the new
entrants inthe education system are first-generation learners from disadvantaged backgrounds.

96.      Monitoring by departmental staff Recognizing the need for close supervision, the GoAP has
enhanced the monitoring functions o f key personnel within the organization at all levels. Officers from
the central government have increased their field presence both at the start of, and during, an academic
year to monitor, motivate, and challenge front-line personnel such as teachers and headmasters. The
improved monitoring has helped the state government strengthen its ability to identify and mainstream
out-of-school children, and to enforce uniform standards across schools.

97       Filling outstanding vacancies. A large number o f vacancies left unfilled in previous years have
been filled inthe past two years. This has allowed the functional responsibilities o f these individuals to be
more clearly mapped. These include head teachers, principals, mandal resource persons, and mandal and
district education officers. This has strengthened the monitoring capabilities o f the government, as
highlighted inthe previous paragraph.

98.      Development of a research agenda. The GoAP, in close cooperation with development partners
and NGOs, has engaged in rigorous policy research. A t present, a large-scale evaluation o f teachers'
incentives has been underway in the five districts in the state, and this will continue for another year.
Meanwhile, the GoAP is also in the process o f finalizing a five-year MOU with the Azrm Premji
Foundation to continue this partnership and expand it into other areas o f research available to
government, such as school vouchers, midday meals, school healthprograms, and others.

Prior Action for Tranche I

         (7 of 7) (4 Class-to-class transition rates are increased at the elementay level, and (id student
         and teacher attendance is raised over a mutually agreed upon baseline.

99       Status of the prior action. Class-to-class transition rates were assessed by the government, and
show marked improvements between 2002103 and 2004105. Transition rates have reached 95.6 percent for
grades 3 to 4 and 89 4 percent for grades 5 to 6. Transition rates have risen for all grades, with higher
increases in the upper grades. While no independent evaluation on teacher absenteeism has been
conducted after 2004, a recent survey by an NGO (Pratham), whose results have been endorsed by the
GoAP, assessed schooling achievement across the country The survey revealed that teacher absenteeism
was estimated at 21.3 percent in 2004. Although the methods used to estimate teacher absencelattendance
are not strictly comparable across the two surveys, the finding does suggest that absenteeism may have
fallen by about 4 percentage points between 2003 and 2004.

100.     Future challenges. Loohng ahead, the two key challenges o f the GoAP are likely to be:
enrollment and retention o f all children in schools, and the provision o f quality education. Many factors
affect these outcomes and not all are within the jurisdiction o f government. However, several key levers
do lie within government control, and reforms o f these are beingcurrently considered. These include: (i)
departmental restructuring and reforms; (ii)strengthening o f accountability through the devolution o f
specific functions to lower levels o f administration, and to communities where the schools are located;
(iii)reformsinteacher managementprocedures; (iv) curriculumreforms; (v) strengtheningmonitoring
and evaluation, includingdevelopment o f infrastructure for large-scale, periodic, and independent student
assessments.

I. HealthSectorz5

101.     Many o f the reforms inthe health sector-such            as providing greater autonomy to public hospitals,
ranlung o f hospitals based on performance, contracting out the management o f urban health centers and
contracting in specialists from the private sector to public facilities-have          been sustained over time. The
state has also made good progress in improving the quality o f care in the private sector, which provides
over 70 percent o f the curative health care in the statez6 A comprehensive private medical establishment
Act was passed in 2002 and a detailed set o f rules covering minimum standards for different types o f
facilities have been prepared. I t has also continued the ongoing conditional cash transfer program for
families below the poverty line."

102.     Andhra Pradesh was the first Indian state to implement a Bank-supported project to strengthen
state-level health systems. Inaddition to institutional strengthening and policy reforms, this project helped
the state to improve access, quality, and effectiveness o f health services delivered by public hospitals at
the secondary level. A follow-on project under the Andhra Pradesh Economic Restructuring Project
helped the state to consolidate the gains from the earlier project by improving the delivery o f primary
health services. The DFID-supported reform program in the health sector will be supporting wider-
rangingreforms.

103.     Future challenges. There are a number o f areas where the pace o f reform needs to be accelerated.
The task o f reorganizing the Health Department has been slow, and only recently a decision was taken to
separate the teaching cadre from the rest o f the department. Progress in innovations like demand-side
financing for improving access to essential health services for vulnerable groups, especially delivery
services for women, has been slow The main challenge still remains effectively implementing the
reforms at the local level. This requires strengthening o f district- and subdistrict-level capacities for health
service planning, delivery, and monitoring, with enhanced participation o f communities in these
processes. AP has also discontinued the practice o f collecting nominal user fees that are used for
developing the health facilities, while such a policy is being promoted by the National Rural Health
Mission. To address these challenges, the GoAP i s currently putting together a comprehensive reform
strategy for the health sector, which includes: (i)improving access to emergency obstetric care and
newborn health services by malung 246 first referral units fully functional; (ii)            introducing performance-
based incentives for medical officers worlung in difficult mandals; (iii)           strengthening and supporting the
hospital development committees; and (iv) setting up an independent board to oversee transfer o f medical
professionals, and so on.28

104.     The Government o f India has been supporting the efforts o f the GoAP to carry out reforms
through several programs including the Bank assisted Development Policy Lending (DPL) operations.
Depending upon the outcome o f APERL 3, the Go1 shall assess and consider any further support that the
state may require. Such an operation, if required, shall be the last inthe series. The Bank will carry out its
own assessment o f the reformprogram should such a request be received from the Go1

105.      Indicative actions for such a subsequentoperation, if any, are mentionedbelow




25While there are no prior actions on the health sector in AF'ERL 3, it constitutes an important part o f the Bank's
dialogue with the GoAP

                                       VI.       Operational Implementation

A.        Poverty and Social Impact

106#.     The proposed operation seeks to provide sound macroeconomic and fiscal underpinnings for
continued steady economic growth, w h c h will help improve the quality o f life for all sections o f the
population, especially the poor. Measures to enhance access to education and health services-with                    a
special focus on vulnerable groups-will           be particularly beneficial to the poor. Efforts to improve the
investment climate for private sector growth and employment generation will create new opportunities
and reduce the dependence o f the poor on agricultural employment.

107       Direct poverty eradication measures, like land transfers, increased rates and coverage o f social
pensions, and targeted employment generation programs, should lead to higher incomes for the poor.
These measures focus specifically on vulnerable groups. Further support to the women's Self-Help
Groups, land titles to poor women under the land transfer program, and higher pensions for widows and
the disabled, are expected to have positive social impacts on poor families.

108.      Updated poverty numbers from the National Sample Survey (NSS) based on the Planning
Commission's methodology, are expected in 2006107, and would give an estimate o f how poverty has
changed over the last four to five years2g Though there are no plans to update this figure during the
course o f the proposed operation, changes in social indicators will be tracked regularly through
adrmnistrative data maintained by the education and health departments. Data maintained by the
Department o f Rural Development on land transfers, social pensions, and employment generation will
also help to monitor progress under direct poverty reduction programs.




29The 1999/00 NSS indicates an aggregate poverty rate of 21.6 percent using the Deaton and Dreze methodology, while the
official estimateIS15.8 percent.


                                                          32

B.       Implementation,Monitoring, and Evaluation

109      The Department o f Finance, Government o f Andhra Pradesh, will be responsible for overall
implementation o f APERL 3. A multidepartmental group o f officials, headed by the Chief Secretary,
provides overall coordination for APEEU 3. Ths group has been worlung with the Bank team since the
inception o f the proposed operation.

110.     The Bank team's supervision plan will monitor actions and review implementation progress o f
the proposed operation. The Policy Program Matrix (Annex A) o f the proposed operation provides a
results framework that describes expected outcomes at the end o f the program, as well as indicators to
measure success. During the supervision phase o f the operation, these benchmarks will be regularly
evaluated, and the interim steps taken by the GoAP will be monitored.

C.       FiduciaryAspects

111.     Financial management. Improvingpublic financial accountability has been a central theme o f the
reform program in Andhra Pradesh since the preparation process for the economic reform program began
in 2001. The reform program has been based on the recommendations contained in a series of diagnostic
reports, including a preliminary financial accountability assessment (2001), a detailed State Financial
Accountability Assessment (2003) and a Local Bodies Financial Accountability Assessment (2005).
Significant improvements have been achieved in budgeting, cash management, internal control,
responsiveness to audit, and transparency The GoAP has recently proposed further steps to improve its
public financial management arrangements, including improvements in departmental budgeting, debt
management, fixed-asset management, and internal audit, supported by a recently approved World Bank
IDF grant. The results already achieved, and GoAP's steady commitments to PFM reform, provide a
sound basis for the proposed development policy operation.

112.     The Bank has reasonable assurance that the control environment for foreign exchange in the
Reserve Bank o f India (RBI) i s satisfactory for the purposes o f this operation, based on the RBI audit
report and the satisfactory outcomes o f other operations, which have been disbursed and managed through
the RBI.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) does not carry out a Safeguard Assessment o f the RBI,
the central bank in India. As part o f the preparation for this operation, the RBIaudit report and published
annual financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2005, were reviewed by the Bank. The audit
report has a clean, unqualified opinion, and was conducted by a group o f six private firms o f chartered
accountants appointed by the GoI. The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Reserve
Bank o f India Act, 1934, the notifications issued there under and in the form prescribed by the RBI
General Regulations 1949, and the audit has been conducted following auditing standards generally
accepted inIndia.

113.     Procurement. Alongside improvements in financial management, the GoAP has taken significant
strides to improve procurement. The introduction o f e-GP and its widespread application have acted to
reduce unwarranted discretion in the system and enhanced opportunities to monitor individual
transactions and overall performance. The GoAP has a well-definedprogram to make further progress on
improving public procurement that includes the passage o f a law designed to enhance transparency in
procurement operations. Specific steps to improve procurement have been complemented by the
enhanced financial management practices discussed above. The results that have already been achieved,
and the GoAP's continued commitment to improvingprocurement, provide a sound fiduciary basis for the
proposed development policy operation.




                                                      33

D.       Disbursement andAuditing

114.     Upon effectiveness, the borrower, i.e., the GoI, will submit to the Bank a withdrawal application
for the first tranche. The withdrawal application for the second tranche will be submitted after the Bank
and the Go1have assessedthat fiscal performance has been in line with the agreed path. In each case, the
Bank will disburse the U S dollar proceeds to the credit o f the GoI's account with the Reserve Bank o f
India. This account i s controlled by the Office o f Controller o f Aid, Accounts, and Audit (CAAA) o f the
Department o f Economic Affairs, o f the GoI, and is part o f the GoI's general foreign exchange reserves.
Upon receipt o f each tranche o f the loadcredit proceeds, the Go1 will transfer the equivalent rupee
amount to the GoAP as per the revised guidelines for the transfer o f external assistance on back-to-back
terms. This follows the recommendations o f the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) and enables the
states to participate on an equal footing in concessional external assistance, on the same terms and
conditions as attached to such assistance by external funding agencies, thereby mahng the Go1a financial
intermediary without any gain or loss. The GoAP will confirm to the Bank within 30 days, the receipt o f
each tranche and its credit into the Consolidated Fundo f the State.

115.     Disbursement o f the loadcredit proceeds would not be linked to any specific purchases.
However, the Go1would not use the loadcredit proceeds to pay for expenditures included in the Bank's
standard negative list, which includes expenditures on military hardware and environmentally hazardous
goods. If any portion o f the loadcredit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as defined in the DLA,
IBRDshall requirethe GoVGoAP to refundthe amount.

E.       EnvironmentalAspects

116.     Andhra Pradesh is an arid state. Nearly 70 percent o f the state's population relies on agriculture,
which is very vulnerable to drought and rainfall variability, particularly in rain-fed areas, which are also
among the poorest areas o f the state. A recent World Bank study estimates that farmers in rain-fed areas
o f the states face some losses o f agriculture output due to low and/or erratic rainfall every two to three
years. Rapid industrialization and economic diversification in the state has been accompanied by both
environmental pressures and opportunities. On the one hand, it has increased pollution levels, and demand
for environmental infrastructure outpaced its capacity in urban centers. On the other hand, this has been
accompanied by greater environmental awareness and significant efforts by the state environmental
authorities, such as the Department o f Environment, Forests, Science, and Technology, and the Andhra
Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) to improve environmental management and enforcement.
While having the lowest number o f staff per 100 units requiring environmental consenthspection, the
APPCB is among the most efficient, competent, and well-performing environmental enforcement
institutions inthe country

117      The Bank has provided extensive support to APPCB via the National Industrial Pollution Control
Project, the Industrial Pollution Prevention Project, and the Environmental Management Capacity
Building Project. The on-going forestry project supports building capacity o f the Forest Department,
including its regulatory functions pertaining to forest clearance. With respect to having the necessary
environmental infrastructure to manage the environmental impacts o f industrial growth, AP is the first
state in India to set up a modern hazardous waste disposal facility The state has a record o f preparing
several State of the Environment reports and other important environmental studies with support from
various donors, including the World Bank. The Bank-supported Andhra Pradesh Environment Program
(APEP), completed in2005, provided technical assistance and analytical support in the areas o f municipal
waste and water pollution. A study o f Vulnerability and Adaptation to Drought in AP was the first Bank
analytical work in India to assess strategies for adaptation to climate variability and longer-term changes.
It is now followed by technical assistance to the pilot initiative bythe GoAP to help rural communities in




                                                      34

the most drought-prone area to adapt to highand increasing (as the climate changes), risks of monsoon
failure and acute water deficit.

118.    The recently completed India Country Environmental Analysis (India CEA), 2006, aimed at
assessing implementation effectiveness o f environmental policies and regulations in India, including the
capacity and needs o f state pollution control boards, and specifically examined environmental
management issues in an industrial estate in the state in AP The study proposed a program o f actions, in
consultation with environmental authorities, industry, and other shareholders. A key finding relevant to
AP and this operation i s that while the capacity o f a key state environmental regulator (APPCB) has been
visibly strengthened, it has not kept up with increasing demands, mandates, and workload due to rapid
economic and urban growth. This capacity gap i s further exacerbated by a hiring freeze imposed by state
government. The findings o f the India CEA and discussions with the APPCB and the Department o f
Environment suggest that it would be important to develop and implement a medium-term efficiency-
enhancing and capacity-strengthening plan for APPCB, which would include: (a) process rationalization
and efficiency enhancement measures; (b) outsourcing o f noncore functions; (c) a skill upgrading and
staffing plan as the basis for the GoAP approval o f additional positions; and (d) measures to strengthen
public accountability, consultation, communication, and information disclosure, including meeting the
requirements o f the k g h t to Information (RTI) Act

119      Overall, the environmental impacts o f this operation are not likely to be significant. The operation
supports the following main pillars:

        Agrzculture: Private investment in agricultural markets is encouraged to increase competitiveness
         and eliminate oligopolistic bottlenecks. This initiative can be expected to raise farm-level
         incomes and will have no direct environmental effect.

        Przvatization: The program supports reform o f public enterprises and a deepening privatization
         agenda. The state has already established mechanisms, with DFID assistance, for environmental
         screening, auditing, and addressing identified environmental issues during sale or closure of
         enterprises posing environmental risk. Evidence suggests that environmental compliance levels
         are generally higher in the private sector, provided there is an adequate monitoring and
         enforcement regime. Hence, privatization i s likelyto confer environmental benefits.

        Investment climate: Improved investment climate leads to higher growth. I t also leads to a greater
        number of projects for environmental clearance and more operating facilities to be monitored for
         compliance with environmental standards. Managing the environmental impacts under this
         scenario requires the buildup in the capacity o f the state environmental agencies. The main
         enforcement body with respect to industrial and municipal pollution, APPCB, i s one o f the best in
        the country, with the highest compliance ratio by industry The Bank has provided a significant
         amount o f support to strengthen APPCB capacity via several projects and knowledge products
         including the Andhra Pradesh Environment Program and, most recently, the India CEA, which
        has an industry sector case study in AP APPCB i s tahng further initiatives to strengthen its
         capacity and efficiency in regulating industrial pollution, including an official plan for the
         strengthening and restructuring o f the board, consistent with the recommendations o f the India
         CEA. (An indication o f APPCB's good performance and financial health is that it plans to meet
        the entire additional expenditure as a result of implementation o f the plan from the board's
         funds). As per this plan, on September 15, 2006, the GoAP issuedpermission to APPCB to fill
         115 posts, lifting the ban on recruitment. This plan also covers APPCB's vision to create, over
        time 200 additional posts. Furthermore, the plan envisages creation o f six new regional offices
         and three new task forces at the zone level, and revision and strengthening o f the structure o f the
        regional, zone, and head offices. Overall, there is sufficient commitment by the GoAP and an
        adequate plan o f action by APPCB to address environmental management within an overall

                                                      35

        scenario o f rapid growth. Furthermore, the GoAP plans to commission an independent evaluation
        o f the performance o f the single window system (SWS), including the issuance o f environmental
        clearances with a view to better align the SWS with national environmental legislation.

         Power sector reform: Reforms in the power sector are designed to promote commercial viability
        and limit financial losses. These reforms may have environmental benefits by promoting
        efficiency and limiting the overuse o f groundwater. Concerns about switching to inferior fuels at
        the household level do not arise, as electricity is seldom used as a household coolung fuel in the
        relevant population.

        Land distribution: The environmental impacts o f this initiative are expected to be benign as
        environmentally sensitive lands are not being used for distribution. As part o f this reform
        initiative, legally designated forest land is prohibited from being used for nonforest purposes
        under the State Forest Act and the Forest Protection Act (FPA) o f the GoI. Inthe case o f the land
        distribution program, land being distributed to poor people includes (i)  revenue wasteland owned
        by the GoAP (ii)surplus land available with the GoAP under the land ceiling act and (iii)land
        that i s occupied by people and will be regularized. It i s therefore concluded that the land
        distribution program o f the GoAP follows well-defined and adequate state and national
        environmental regulations and therefore has no adverse environmental impacts.

        Other reforms support improvements in education and governance. These have no discernable
        environmental effect.

120.    Examples of best-practice initiatives of the APPCB. APPCB's reasonable capacity to deal with
changing priorities and pressures can also be seen from a number o f proactive initiatives, reinstating its
reputation as one o f the best performing state PCBs inthe country, namely.
        I t is operating a clean production cell that encourages cleaner pollution mechanisms and waste
        minimization through fiscal and nonfiscal incentives. This initiative has resulted in good practice
        measures inthe sponge iron and pharmaceutical sectors.
        As per the requirements o f the k g h t To Information (RTI)Act, APPCB has appointed officials in
        the regional, zone, and head offices, and three separate regional task forces dedicated to public
        grievances. APPCB also has a state-of-the-art website and regularly responds to technical
        requests by NGOs. It also has an environmental education cell in the board dedicated to
        awareness raising and dissemination o f environmental information.
        APPCB has an operational M I S for effective administration and faster decisions. A GIS
        (Geographic Information System) has been developed for the whole state for data management
        and analysis, particularly in areas relating to zoning atlas, estimation o f pollution loads, shifting
        o f industries,and prioritization o f areas and baseline surveys.
        In response to Supreme Court orders, APPCB has taken specific remedial measures against
        polluting industries in a number o f hot-spot industrial estates, such as Kattedan, Patancheru, and
        Jeedimetla, including the construction o f a new TSDF inVishakapatnam.
        Simplification o f consent procedures inthe case o f nonpolluting small-scale industries.

F.      R i s k s and Mitigation

121.    The major risks to the operation stem from: (a) weather-related shocks like drought, which could
adversely affect farmers' livelihood, economic growth, fiscal targets, and performance o f the power
sector; and (b) the government's proposed large public investment program inthe irrigation sector, which,
ifnot managedproperly, couldleadto majorcost overruns andsignificant delays.


                                                       36

122.    The Government o f Andhra Pradesh, as well as the Bank, i s takmg a number o f steps to mitigate
these risks. A pilot study on drought mtigation has recently been completed by the Bank, and its
recommendations are being implemented by the state government. There has also been extensive policy
dialogue between the Bank, the GoAP, and financial institutions on introducing weather-related insurance
products for farmers, and a few pilot cases are already being implemented. Two major community-driven
development pro] ects supported by the Bank, namely the Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives
Project (APDPIP) and Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project (APRPRP) also have
components dealing with drought mitigation. Furthermore, the initiative to double the amount o f irrigated
land inAP will be the most important drought mtigation strategy inthe long run.

123.    To ensure that the large public investment program in the irrigation sector will yield expected
results, the GoAP is undertalung the following steps. First, the government is giving priority to
modernizing and rehabilitating existing irrigation assets rather than building new assets, and thus the
benefits from the projects are already beginning to accrue. Second, the government i s committed to
providing adequate operational and maintenance expenses for the existing and newly built irrigation
assets, and this i s being supported through the APERL 3 operation. Finally, as part o f the dialogue on a
proposed investment loan for the irrigation sector, the Bank is currently discussing with the GoAP a
number of policy and institutional reforms in the irrigation sector. These include putting in place a
participatory framework that empowers users, unbundling o f the existing function o f the irrigation
department, establishing a Water Regulatory Authority, and creating basin-level corporations to manage
water resources at the operational level in collaboration with users.

IMFExecutive Board Concludes2005Article IV Consultation with India
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 06/17
F




On February 6, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with India.'

Background

India's growth has remamed robust in 2005106 followmg a strong performance last year. With rapid
growth m services broadening to encompass mdustry, GDP growth in 2004/05, at 7% percent (recently
revised upward from 6.9 percent) was above the histoncal trend. Strong momentum m manufacturing
andservices has continued, resultinginrising capacity utilization and soarmg business confidence. Staff
projects growth o f over 7% percent this year, led by strong domestic demand, and broadly m line with
the Reserve Bank o f India (RBI) and consensus forecasts. In 2006/07, growth is expected to decline
slightly as the economy further adjusts to higher oil prices and domestic andworld mterestrates rise.

While mflation remains low, underlymg pressures from buoyant domestic demand and higher
mtemational energy prices remam strong. Steps taken by the RBI to tighten liquidity in 2004105,
mcluding raismg reserve requirements and policy mterest rates, and mcomplete pass-through of higher
oil prices helped keep WPI inflation low With headline inflation hovering around 4% percent year on
year, the RBI raised overnight rep0 rates agam m October 2005 and January o f 2006, by a cumulative
50 basis pomts, citing concerns about the rapid pace o f aggregate demand and monetary growth and
high oil prices. Staff projects inflation to rise from an average o f about 4%percent in 2005/06 to
5% percent m2006/07,m partreflectingthe adjustment o f admmistered fuel prices.

After several years o f current account surpluses and growing reserves, the mvestment recovery and
consumption boom have pushed the external current account mto deficit. In 2004/05, the trade deficit
widened to over 5% percent o f GDP and the current account reverted mto deficit for the first tune m
three years, notwithstanding high growth in services mcome. While export growth continues to be
strong, a large increase mboth oil and non-oil imports caused the trade deficit to widen further this year,
and contribute to a sharp deterioration m the current account deficit. Staff projects it to reach 3 percent
o f GDP in2005/06.

The balance o f payments position remains comfortable with strong capital mflows helpmg finance the
growmg current account deficit. In 2004/05, close to half o f all capital mflows were debt creating, as
Indian corporates took advantage of favorable global mterest rates, an appreciating rupee, and the
liberalizationo frestrictions on external commercial borrowmgsto borrow abroad. While portfolio flows

                                                                                            Page 2 of 6

have continued to gain importance, FDI inflows remained weak. So far this fiscal year, capital inflows
have remamed strong and reserves have only fallen modestly as a result o f the redemption o f the India
Millennium Deposits. While more reliance on debt and portfolio inflows has increased India's
susceptibility to changes ininvestor sentiment, ample reserves and remaming capital controls limit risks
o fpotentialreversals.

Asset markets have strengthened. Net foreign mvestor mflows have accelerated since mid-2005, as
equity prices soared. Equity prices are up around 50percent iYom end-April. Ample liquidity and
historically low interest rates also helped he1property pnces, which have risen inmajor cities by over
20 percent annually over the past two years. Concerned with speculative pressures, the RBI has raised
risk-weights on housmg and real estate loans and imposed controls on real estate mvestments auned at
curbing speculative FDImflows.

The exchange rate has exhibited mcreased two-way flexibility In the eight months to June 2005, the
RBI scaled back mtervention in foreign exchange markets and the rupee appreciated by 4 percent
against the dollar (6% percent m real effective terms). Inthe second half o f 2005,-with   the exception
o f a six-week penod following Chma's July 21 revaluation, when the RBI mtervened to stem
appreciation pressures-the     rupee depreciated, reflectmg pressures fiom the growmg current account
deficit andrenewed U.S. dollar strength.

Followmg three years o f declinmg fiscal deficits, a "pause" m deficit reduction was announced for
2005/06. The central government deficit came in below target m 2004/05 for the second consecutive
year at 4.1 percent o f GDP (authonties' definition, mcluding privatization receipts as revenue), helped
by a cyclical rebound m revenue and expenditure compression, but also reflectmg greater recourse to
off-budget petroleum subsidies. This, together with a 0.8 percentage pomts reduction in subnational
deficits, contributed to a fall in the general government deficit to under 7%percent o f GDP, enough to
stabilize public debt at about 86 percent o f GDP The 2005/06 Budget deficit target o f 4.3 percent o f
GDP falls short of the mmimum reduction requved by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
Management Act. This reflected significant spending mcreases for key social and mfiastructure needs
and higher transfers to the states. The general government deficit is projected by staff to nse, for the
first time in four years, to 7% percent o f GDP

The bankmg sector has contmued to strengthen but some risks remain. Commercial banks have
continued to reduce nonperformmg assets, and aggregate capital adequacy remains high. Banks have
reduced their exposure to interest rate risks, decreasmg their holdings o f government paper and
shortenmg maturity Declinmg profitability due to rismg mterest rates has been m part offset by higher
credit growth. However, mterestrate nsk remains a concern with bank holdings o f government paper (at
38 percent o f assets) still high and m excess o f statutory requirements. At the same time, rapid credit
growth raises concerns about credit quality and cooperative banks, accountmg for about 6 percent of
bankmg system assets, remain mpoor health.

ExecutiveBoard Assessment

Executive Directors noted that the Indian economy is continumg to reap the rewards o f more than
15 years o f reforms. Notwithstanding highworld oil prices and a weak monsoon, the economy showed
remarkable resilience m2004/05, with growth remainmg robust and becoming broader-based. These
trends have contmued m2005/06, and growth o f more than 7%percent for the full year is expected.

Dvectors supported the broad objectives o f the government's economic program, m particular
addressing mfrastructure bottlenecks, alleviating rural poverty, and deepenmg global mtegration. They
noted that current favorable economic conditions provide a good opportunity to speed structural
reforms. In particular, measures to improve the business climate and reform labor laws would have a

                                                                                                  Annex C
                                                                                                 Page 3 of 6

large pay-off by fostenng private and foreign investment andjob creation. With an acceleration o f the
reform process, India would be able to achieve sustained economic growth o f 8-10 percent, in line with
the objectives o fthe authorities.

Directors emphasized that macroeconomic policies should remam vigilant, m view o f the evolving
macroeconomic situation. Although inflation has remained contamed, underlymg pressures point to
upside nsks.Inparticular, domestic demand remains strong, as evidenced by a widenmg current account
deficit and rapid credit growth. Inthis context, Directors recommended that fiscal policy should counter
demand pressures, andthey underlined the unportance o f overperforming on the budget and meetmg the
mmmumadjustment requlred under the FiscalResponsibility andBudgetManagementAct. This would
not only be an appropriate macroeconomic policy response, but would also bolster the credibility o f the
Act and allow the central government to lead by example m efforts to encourage adjustment at the state
level. Inthis regard, some Dlrectors cautioned that markets might mterpret the pause m deficit reduction
mthe current fiscal year as aweakening o fthe commitment to reform.

Directors underscored the need for the Indian economy to adapt to permanently higher international oil
prices. They recommended moving gradually to the full pass-through o f oil pnces-with                targeted
support for the poor-which     would help limit fiscal and quasi-fiscal losses and provide mcentives for
more efficient energy use, thus aiding competitiveness inthe medium term.

Directors considered that monetary policy should remam focused on keeping mflation expectations in
check. The mcreases inthe reverse rep0 rate by the Reserve Bank o f India m October 2005 and January
2006 were seen as appropnate, signaling the RBI's commitment to price stability and helpmg the
adjustment to higher global mterest rates. Drectors welcomed the RBI's continued two-way flexibility
mexchange rate management.

Directors noted that, notwithstanding the deficit reduction achieved since 2001/02, India's large public
debt remams a key constramt on growth. Without further enhancmg tax revenues and reducing lower-
priority spending, it will be difficult to create fiscal space for the planned large and crucial increases m
mfrastructure and social spending. In addition, with credit to the private sector nsmg fast, the nsk that
government borrowmg needs will crowd-out the pnvate sector has mcreased. Directors observed that
fiscal consolidation is a prerequisite for more complete financial sector development and further
openmg up o fthe capital account.

Directors viewed an acceleration o f tax reform as critical to achieve the government's deficit reduction
targets. They welcomed the mtroduction o f the value-added tax m most states and steps to widen the
services tax base and modernize tax administration. Dlrectors underscored the need to further broaden
the tax baseby tnmmmg existing exemptions and eventually mtroducmg a goods and services tax with
few exemptions. Directors looked forward to the planned development o f tax expenditure estmates,
which would provide a valuable tool for resisting attemptsto introduce new inefficient tax mcentives.

Directors observedthat greater spending efficiency,     111particular improved targeting o f subsidies, would
be requlred to generate the needed fiscal adjustment. They viewed the government's 2004 subsidy
reform blueprmt as appropnate, and urged its rapid Implementation. Drectors underlined that the new
rural employment program represents a potentially large expenditure commitment, and advised the
government to proceed cautiously with it.

Directors welcomed the initiation o f pension reform. The passage o f the Pension Bill would allow the
introduction o f fully funded, defined contribution pensions, which      111
                                                                           turn would help ensure a secure
source o f retirement mcome and aid inthe development o f capital markets. However, Directors pomted
out that revisions to the existing defined benefit schemes for civil servants are also required to reduce

                                                                                                       Annex C
                                                                                                     Page 4 of 6

large unfunded pension liabilities.

Directors noted that states have succeeded, in the aggregate, in reducing their deficits in recent years,
and they welcomed recent reforms undertaken          111 the context o f the Twelfth Finance Commission to
further strengthen state fmances. These reforms provide states with greater resources and mcentives to
undertake fiscal reform. However, Directors emphasized that state fmances could be further
strengthened by increasing conditionality and hardenmg budget constraints, mcluding via tighter global
borrowmg ceilings. They called for consolidating the recent gams through tax base broadenmg and
further reforms inthe pension, subsidy, and state electric utility areas. Dlrectors were encouraged that a
number o f states have already shifted to defined contribution pension systems and enacted fiscal
responsibility laws.

Directors supported the government's emphasis on public-pnvate partnerships to ensure greater private
participation m investments in infiastructure. However, they cautioned that an improved regulatory
framework and financial reforms to broaden the mvestor base are also needed. Dlrectors viewed
the 2003 Electricity Act as a solid framework for reform, and advised that it be unplemented quickly

Directors commended the underlying strength o f financial regulation and the effective response to
recent rapid credit growth. They advised close monitonng o f fast-growmg credit card debt. A further
strengthenmg o f prudential standards could be considered, where appropnate. Reliance on pnority
sector lending floors to deliver credit to agriculture and small and medium-sized enterpnses could be
reduced by addressing needed structural reforms m lending. Regulation should also be strengthened for
cooperative banks. Directors urged the RBI to ensure readiness for the planned move to Base1 I1 by
continumg to enhance monitonng o f banks' risk management systems, upgrade supervisory skills, and
strengthen disclosure requlrernents. Directors considered that the current sound position o f the financial
system provides a good basis for its further deepenmg, in particular through increasing private and
foreign participation in the bankmg sector, mcluding by acceleratmg implementation o f the RBI's
bankmg reform roadmap.

Dlrectors emphasized that further opening of the economy would allow it to reach its full growth
potential. While they commended the progress already made m bnnging down tariff levels, they noted
that faster convergence to ASEAN levels would be deslrable. Broad-based tariff reductions would also
help mmimize the trade diversion potentially associated with preferential trade arrangements. Also,
continued loosenmg o f sectoral limits on foreign direct mvestment, together with efforts to unprove the
busmess climate and liberalize labor laws, could foster growth andjob creation, while reducmg India's
reliance on shorter-term capital flows. Some Directors noted that further privatization could spur
efficiency gams and provide resources to reduce the public debt. Dlrectors urged the authorities to
consider labor market reforms, mcluding expanded contract employment and streamlined labor
regulations and reporting requlrernents. Such flexibility would be key to ensurmg that India can
generatejobs for its rapidly expanding labor force.
