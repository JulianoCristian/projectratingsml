"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third Andrah Pradesh\n            (AP) Economic Reform Loan and Credit Development Policy\n            Lending Project for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: policy-based lending at the state\n            level has been a huge winner for the Bank. This is a\n            conclusion drawn from a more general analysis of\n            policy-based lending at the state level. There is no doubt\n            that lending to support state reforms has made a large\n            positive impact, and perhaps its biggest contribution to\n            reforms, both in India at large and in AP in particular.\n            While this loan does not contradict this general conclusion,\n            and there are concrete reform gains one can point to, it\n            does also give rise to a few lessons of a more cautionary\n            nature. Over the years, the Bank took a flexible approach on\n            AP in relation to difficult issues, such as the power sector\n            reform. Although there can be trade-offs between flexibility\n            and credibility, overall a large degree of flexibility is\n            needed, not least so that past mistakes can be corrected.\n            The price for inflexibility can be very high both in terms\n            of a reform relationship and the ability to reach project\n            development objectives. Long delays between loans and loan\n            tranches lead to a loss of reform momentum, and can lead to\n            an unraveling of relationship. The decision to move to a\n            two-tranche approach was a decision of the Government of\n            India, apparently because it thought this will introduce\n            greater discipline. However, as evidenced here, two-tranche\n            operations result in less flexibility."}, "docdt": "2011-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
