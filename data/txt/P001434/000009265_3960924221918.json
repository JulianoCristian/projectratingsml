The Bank was most helpful in exploring\n            various avenues for rescuing the project from total\n            collapse. The Bank also showed realism and flexibility in\n            readjusting the financing categories and disbursement\n            percentages in light of the project's implementation\n            experience. The main strength of the Borrower's\n            performance on this project was that it was quite flexible\n            on many issues and was prepared to change its position even\n            after holding it for a long period. The lessons learned are\n            (a) Sound agronomic conditions do not necessarily ensure\n            success of an agricultural project; appropriate pricing and\n            marketing arrangements are also essential. (b) Smallholder\n            investment is socially desirable but fraught with risks,\n            particularly if the farmers lacked motivation, investments\n            have a long gestation period and incentive prices offered\n            are inadequate. (c) A project with a modest but successful\n            beginning has a better prospect in the long-run, than one\n            with an ambitious beginning which raises the risks. Without\n            assurance of counterpart funding and its timely release, a\n            project is doomed from the start to falter and fail. Many of\n            the conceptual problems concerning this Project could,\n            perhaps, have been resolved earlier if general educators had\n            participated sooner in project supervision."}, "docdt": "1991-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
