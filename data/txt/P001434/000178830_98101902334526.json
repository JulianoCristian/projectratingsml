      for the development of the oil palm sub-sector. The project\n            would include: establishing and operating a 5,000 ha nucleus\n            estate, providing extension services and credit facilities\n            to develop 2,500 ha of smallholder farms, training DOPC\n            staff and smallholders, constructing an oil mill,\n            establishing a fruit collection system, constructing roads,\n            constructing and installing storage and port facilities, and\n            providing technical assistance and consultant services. The\n            project faces no unusual risks, but the success of the\n            institution building program under the project would depend\n            on the ability of the government and DOPC to recruit, train\n            and retain competent Liberians."}, "docdt": "1979-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
