Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) need for high quality feasibility\n            studies for preparation of investments within an overall\n            plan that is agreed by the stakeholders, and a transparent\n            criteria for selection of schemes; 2) sector reforms and\n            restructuring should be based on high quality analytical\n            work, meaningful consultation and participation of\n            stakeholders, and should be backed by political commitment;\n            3) design of sector restructuring and the pace of its\n            implementation should be owned and endorsed by the major\n            stakeholders; and 4) the success of Financial Management\n            Information System (FMIS) indicates that pilots for\n            demonstration, and familiarization of the staff with new\n            technologies, should be carried out before introducing a\n            major change in business processes and sophisticated\n            information technology (IT) tools."}, "docdt": "2009-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
