There are seven project\n            components. The first rehabilitates high voltage\n            transmission network lines started under the Second Electric\n            Power Reconstruction Project (report no. 20167). The second\n            component finances reconstruction of key transmission\n            substations. The third component establishes a supervisory\n            control and data acquisition system and associated\n            telecommunications facilities. The fourth component funds\n            investments at hydropower stations to improve safety and\n            availabilty. The fifth component makes investments in\n            thermal power stations to control pollution. The sixth\n            component supports distribution substation investments\n            focusing on areas identified for refugee return, heavily\n            damaged and cut-off areas which have little or no\n            electricity supply, areas with war damage where many\n            connections are of a temporary nature and power supply is\n            unreliable and unsafe, and areas with seriously overloaded\n            networks, due to refugee resettlement. The seventh component\n            provides technical assistance and training in support of\n            procurement and implementation of the physical components,\n            among other sub-components."}, "docdt": "2001-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
