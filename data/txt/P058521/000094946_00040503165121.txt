PROSPECT.S  OF ENVIRONMENTAL PPOTECTION
R.ECOLNSTRLUCTION/1PPR0V`EMENT OF ELECTROSTAflC
PRECIPIT.-ATORS OF BLOCKS 5 (200 MW)
IPP `TIJZLA" IN TUZLA                               I :
.1  SThMeANARY
Block 5 (200 MW) olU cho TPP Tuzla was commissioned irl 1974. Until May
1999 this Block wai in ope.rarion 120 000 working hours and from May 1992, 
to Ncnvember 1996 ,as forced outaoe because of the war in Bosnia and.'
Herzegovina. Durin  :his Dnrlod, which lasted 4,5 years the facility, was
partially consereId. axcordin- to the financial capabilities.
Block 5 was restarteCd In Novevnber 1996 out of the need of the power system :
in BiH. Block 5 is a 2(1)!)0 MW facility planned to takc lignite - coal of the
heating value of 9000 to I 1. 000 kJlkg with the ash percentage of 25-30%.
2. CURRENT SITUATION / DAMAGE ASSESSNlENT
Since the date of its installation the electrostatic precipitator has been regularly
repaired and mainraL; ed without, however, beina updated. The cxsingn;
equipment is damaa_td and its eficiency is unacceptable:
.Manufacturer of £-S?:        EL WO Poland
Characteristics:
Volume of the flue ases:s     1 250, 000 Nm'/h wet
Temperature:                   170 0 C
Sub-pressure:                 - 300 da Pa                   .
3. ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Block 5 has 3 electrostatic precipitators. The planned content of dust at the
discharce was betw-en 400 m;DN3 and I000 mg/Nm3. The real concentration
of dust in the emission casses is I 000 to 2000 mg/Nm3 which is much higher
than the legal and rcgulated standards propose. In order for Block 5 to be
functional, seen frorn ii environmental feasibility, one has to adapt and
reconstuct it. The a.in-. *,f this technical reconstruction and revitalisation is to
reach the aimed concentration of dust in the discharged gasses according to the
standards (IGO m'n  oL'drxy to 6 % Oz).
4. REGULATIVE AND STANDARDS                                         -
Thie project of the existing electrostatic precipitators and the dust removal
efficiency was donc: according to the standards of 1974 but that can be no
longer followed. This is ntJ: acceptable from the environmental point of view.
The existing regulai:i\ e in the field of the quality control in the Federation of
BiH as well as the uDidaIed re;zutative is to be confirmed to the EU directives as
.I . .



well a5 the sanridsrdsi of the WVc.rld Bank (Technical Document No 286). The
maximum value for the tusi cartcemLrarion of gasNvaste is 150 mg/Nmn'.
5. THE SCOPE: OF THE PROJECT
Takina into the consideratior. thle unreliability of the equipment and the out
dated technology described in the third paragraph the scope of the works covers
the replacement of trth: ouI dated mechanical and electrical equipment,
including design. disniantdng of existinc equipment, delivery of new one,
installation and commissioninm.
The steal structure and casinm are to be kept.
6. EXPECTED RESULTS
-     Siznificant and reliable protection against the discharge of the solid
substances in the atniosphere including the air pollution in Bosnia and
abroad.
-     Reaching of the lezal aust emission and subordination to legal bearing
-     Environmenrta impact and health impact. Mak-e the work of the facility
in question acceptable for the population
-     ,Activities art to be directed towvards the development of the production
of thermnal cricrgy aid tne production of energy in general
7. COSTS
According to the preliminary quotes of the EU firms specialized for the
production of eleccrostatiz precipitators and our experience in the
reconstruction of B]h' X (t M00W) in TPP Tuzla we estimate that the costs of
the reconstruction. c.xnsidering the EU standards, would come to 3, 5 million
TJSD.
8. IMPLEMNIENT.kTIO.N
Design, manufacruring aid dclivery of equipment        6 months
Dismantling, ertction and commissioning                4 moths
For the production f the mechanical equipment, dismantling and installation

PROSPECTS Ol ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
RECONSTRUCTIONiRLEHABILITATION OF ITHE SYSTEM FOR
SLAG AND ASH DISPOS.AL
TPP "TUZLX" IN TUZLA
L. SUMMARY
TPP Tuzla is a 77 9   !Ta acility prolammed to take linite and brown coal the- -
.ash percenrage of vary inre frmnt 15% to 24%. When working at full capacity the
TPP produces 28' fh fash   71 Lth of slag. For the disposal of slag and ash
!-theif hdraLlitra n is emploed - slag and ash are
transported by *varer in rl   proportion of 1:10 to 1:I5. Up until present around
26 million tons of ash and vvasie was deposited.
Due to the overfidligi crarmsn;no of the present disposal for ash and slag as well
as due to the need for the concinuiry of electric energy production in TPP Tuzla'
it is necessary to creatze co;iitions for pass beyond on the new slag and ash
disposal area. Wit ti L-c new disposal location one has the possibility of
implementing The new technology for the slag and ash handling. The most
opportune new technolog  is the combined hydraulic-pneumatic system for the
slag and ash disposai. The pneumatic system would be used as the basic and
the hydraulic, witch rt;e sub-:;ys:em of the water recirculation, would be used as
a substitute, or even thte initial one if the reconstruction is to be divided into
steps/phases.
Tkis solution is ecolUgicaliy pleasing and it provides for the utilisation of slag
and ash as the con7itruction mat.rials.
2. CURRENT SITU ATION i DAMAGE ASSESSiMIENT
With every ton of siag and ash huge amounts of water are being used, which is
unacceptable from  the economic and ecological point of view. With the
increas,ed consumotir. ol tlhis 'technolo-ic water the quantity of the wasted
water is increased. The uSed, that is the discharged water, is being spilled
directly in the Jala River.
3. ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVERONMENTAL IMPACT
The current technolomical method of the slag and ash disposal is antiquated and
contrary to the to the posrulates of the correct management of industal and
other waste. Global OveN-populaiion problems include th- one of the increased
was;e of all classes Th,e main requiremernt and co-ordinared international
position is to take necessary steps for the reduction of the waste and the
irnplementation of the recyc ing methods and reuse. For the wet method of the
waste disposal -ea! amounLts of water are being used and as such spilled into
rivers. The river of Jala ts one such example of the river under heavy
environmental stress II' or 1'i category of water) and the situation that lcads to
turning the river into a sestm of sewer has to be remedied. The region of Tuzla
7



is alrcady an enorr-ous iiWdustrial centrc and there is no justification behind the"
quest for a ne  disposal :area.'
4. REGULATI' VJ  AND STANDARDS.
The Law of Urban Planning arnd other legislative which handle the waste issues
direct us towards a;tivites of rational use of natural resources and they make
us think about environment and conservation of nature.
The Agenda 21 as i concept of bearable/sustainable development asks for a ^: 
minute care for nanuru. p-.terinial1, appropriate use of resources and reduction of'.
waste. The strate2V oC environmental protection as well as the new legislative'.
in this field is to b.o made t) collaborate with international standards, regulative,
and directiV5es.
5. THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
Taking into the cornsideration the old-fashioned and dated technology described
in the section L.hree as we-l as the recommendations in the first section the
scope of the wor;ks includes:
change and reconstructEon of the da;ed system for slag and
ash disposal on boilers 5 and 6
A plementation of the new ash and slag handling system.
6. EXI'ECTED RESUILTS
Reduction in the u: ofrav, wvater taken from the lake.
7. COSTS
It is estimated tha; the cos.s of reconstruction are S million USD-
8. IMPLEMENTATION
Preparaton of manin (detaileed) design, manufacturing and delivery of the
equipment                                                       12 months:
Reconstruction of the existing equipment, instaUation of the new one, trial run
and commissioning                                               8 moths
For the production of Ethe mechanical equipment, dismantling and installation.

PROSPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
RECONSTRUCTIONTMODERNIZATION OF ELECTROSTATIC
PRECIPfTATORS -BLOCK # 7 (230 MW)
l PP "KAKANJ"  IN KAKANJ
1. SUMMARY'                                                          ,,,
Blocc 7(230 MVW) of tde ITP Kakanj was commissioned in 1988. From May 1g2to
March 1999 it r:mained out ot service. During this period, which lasted 7 years te
facility, was partial!. conserved, according to the financial capabilities.
Block 7 was rcstart-d in Nlarch 1999 out of the need of the power system in BiH :
Block 7 is a 230 M£'A' facilirv p,anned to take the coal of the lower heating value of
12.976 kJ/kog *Wih thc ash prctntaae of 38°0.
The existing electrostatic procipitators were designled to reach particulate emissions
level of 100 mraNm r! howvt er, since its restarting in Mv[arch 1999 this emission value
was not reached.
2. CURRENT SITliATflON / D.A.MAGE ASSESSMENT
Since the date of its installation the electrostatic precipitator has been regularly
repaired and mainta-ned %% ithout, however, being updated. The electrical equipment,
the accompanvinr automzatics of management and the system of monitoring is not
reliable. The heaLe-.- a:,d dust-vibraLors on ash hoppe-s are not installed, which has a
negative impact in ES?s efficiency.
Man.ufacturer of Elez rosiaiic precipitators: ELEX/VEMOS Croatia
Characteristics:
Volume of the flue gCsses:     974.590 Nm'Fh;
Temperatue:                    180 °:C
Sub-pressure:                  30  40 m bar
3. ASSESSMIENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL UNIPACT
Block 7 has 2 electrostatic precipitators. The planned content of dust at the discharge
of electrostatic precipitators was 0OO mg/Nm3. The real concentration of dust in the
emission gasses is significarnt,y higher because that the ESP's can not reach desiped
efficiency. In order ftr Brock 7 to be functional, seen from its environmental
feasibiliry. one has to adapt and reconstruct it. The aim of this technical reconstruction
and revitalizationi is lo reach the aimed concentration of dust in the discharged gasses
according to the standards c(100 r_g/JNrTm of dry to 6 %'o 02).
4. REGULATIVE A.ND STANDARDS
The project of the existing electrostatic precipitators and the dust removal efficiency
was done according u:o the standards but that can be no longer foUowed. This is not
acceptable from the ewlironmenial point of view.
The existing regulazive in the Cield of the quality control in the Federation of BiH a'as
well as the updated regulative is to be confirmed to the EtJ directives as well as the
,        .' '



stanrdards of the World Ban.k (Technical Docuiment No 286). The maximum value for
the dust concentration' of oas-waste is 150 mg/Nm'.                            .*
5. THE SCOPE OETHE PROJEC:
Takinig into the consideration the unreliability of the equipment and the dated
technology descnrbed in ih- Ehird paragraph the scope of the works includes:
R Repiacement of unreliable electrical equipment
--:nir mprove-ment of the mechanical part of the electrostatic preciptatoas;

installation of the heaters and vibrators on dust hoppers
-  l  rmprcvement/upgrading of the voltage controls automatics I&  and
;.-.iorin-lJ of electrostatic prcipitators.
6. EXPECTED RE.SULTS

PROSPE("7 S ( jIENVIROiNMENTAL PROTECTION
RECONSTR. CTION/)REVITALIZATION OF THE COOLING
1O WFA'TRS OF BLOCKS 2 x 110 MW
TPP "KAKANJ" IN KAKANJ
1. SUMMAIRY
:Te cooling water for the needs of the steam cooling in the condensers of the-
turbines of blocks 2 :1 I 1(1 M   is taken from the Bosnia River. The cooling
system is of a semri-ckl:ed lype that is 40% of water is discharged in the river.
60 % aoes in the cl-ed circLe through the forced draft cooling towers. In the
condensers the cocl  witvr is heated up between 10 to 15 0 C. The cooling
system is out da.ed a;nd nee.ds to be revitalized with the solution for the
decrease of the ne-pj:ivc cnv.ronmentai impact. The rcsult of the conducted
investigations is rhe deisic,n rto reconstruct/revitalize the cooling watersystem
of Blocks 2xl 10 NlVk wizh the task of turning the semi-closed to the closed
system of cooling.
2. CURRENT SITUATION J DAMAGE ASSESSMENT
The cooling towers are in poor condition. The concrete structure has been
daraged and-the d.i sclar.e srrucnure, cooling surfaces, sprinklers as well as the
mechanical and ef ica1 equipment is worn out and out dated. The capacity of
the cooling is onl 50Jn of the designed values, which requires the increase of
the Bosna w ater inr.ike from 40%1 0 to 70%. Thus the heat consumption of the
Blocks is indirectivi increased in the summerime.
3. ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIIRONMENTAL IMPACT
The cooling water heated un in the rtrbine condensers for 10-15 0 C is
discharged in the ..;er Bo.,na tiat has an environmental impact. The biological
minimum of war. as ell as the existing ecosystem is directly affected. Also,
the other wasted andl danzcrous components are discharged in the river, which
further endangers te * aters. The river Bosna falls into the third categgry/class
of waters. As a tributary of the Sava River and the Danube river the pollution
from the Bosna spreads. The increased specific use of heat comes in the
surnertime and in 'irWctl's aftfects the increase of the C02 emission.
4. REGULATI1E AND STAND.XRDS
In BiH, that is the federation of BiH a numerous legal regulative was passed in
the domain of the water management. The umbrella Law on Waters and
numerous other I islrUre5 form a good framework of the legal bearing for the
protection of ecosyslsems. T he laws provide the responsibilities, duties,
enforcement measures, and punishment.
BiH is a member *f the Programme for the Protection of the Danube and the
initiative for The ratiflcauion and the joining of the Convention of the Danube
Procection. At thc 6icnl the BiHl laws are being confirmed and co-ordinated with
the EU laws.

Aim of the Projeci and Re-sults foreseen',
The aim of the proj)ect Is to train personiil of .the Power Plant Tuzla in operaton 'andr
maintenance of Pullution Mlonitoring System as well a-s the implementation of legisati~e:
regulations concerning cnvironmncntal pollution, data handling,' public informatioDn.  eh.
reslt  illbe   beterconTrOl of pollution dute to well niaintained instrumensanclr
regualations and an optrnm-l ise of the nleasured stack and immission data.
Estimated total cost: :CU 95.000,--
Expected duration: 5 m:ntls
Summary of the FProjecz
The Thermal Power Plant of Tuz]a has already installed Stack Emission Monit*oring
instruments on two stauks and two Ambient Air Monitoring Systems. In the future t,o or
three more Stack Monitoring Svstens shall be instaled.
To get the niaxim um prot-iE from these investmnents (better co-ntrol of burning process,
results in lower pollution) the~ Thermal Power Plant needs to have personal, that ba.'
perfect knowlcdge in operation and m-aintenance of the instruments.
Up to now the Povwir Pl-ant and the District of Tuzla have no experience in Polluion
Control. Therefor;e we have the need :10 kn~ow ini which way such a PIollution Control.
System can be imip!eniented anid mianaged. This means set-up of alarm levels, how to
optimize the burniung process, perfect data handling and evaluation. Another very
important issue is the public informatdion on air pollution matters. Thus the consciousness
of the people for envLironmenral issues will increa'se.
The Regional governrment of Tuzla shall be tied up in this process to acquire the
necessary knowledg~: to ase the data from the Monitoring Stations and Installations oIn thIe
political and admjinistratiye level.

results in lower pollution) the Thermal Power Plant needs to have personal, that i:s
perfect knowled-e in operation and maintenance of the instruments.
Up to now the Power Piant and the District of Kakanj have no experience in Pollutin .
Control. Therefore we havt the need to lkow in which way such a Polluion Control
Systerm can be managed. Tbis means set-up of alarm levels, how to optimize the bumhig;
process, perfact data hantding and evaluation- Another very important issue is the public
information on air pollution matters. Thus the consciousness of the people fbr
environmental issues vill increase.
The Regional gove,mment sliall be tied up in this process to acquire the necessary
knowledge to use thed ,ata from the Monitoring Stations and lastallations on the political-.
and administrative leve1.

Subject: Proposed projects for ecological improvement - POWER III
A meezing vwas hbel on 15.10.1999 in order to inform all the participants abo'  rhe
subject. Additioral inifrmations "Environmental protection projecs pTanned' Efr-
2000" were ripplie. (in annex).
Present members agreed that the World Bank investments in ecological -projects of
TPP Tuzl wetre succeifult, in particul.ar the electrofilters reconstuctinn on 100 MW --
unit whichi made the di.st tmission fit european standards, as wefl as the inszaled.
inonitoring that anables the ar quality control in Tuzla area.
For the first timc. since. TPP Tuzia begun its operation. 100 MW unit works and it is'.
impossible to see the dust discharge from the chimneys. Therefore the proposed -
reconstruction project of unit 5 deserves our support.
We also demazd the limizarion of unit 5 dust discharge on 100 mg/ Nm3 and its
immediate recoistruction becawse unit 5, 200 MW  is in constant operation and its
present emission is 1000 mgNm3..
'The present means cf slag and ash disposal endangers mostly the inhabitants liig mn

Agenda:
-  Report on realisation of Environmental Management Plan - Phase 1, and
Proposal of Project: Environmental Managenent Plan - Phase 2
1. Reconsrxcton of Block 7 Electric Precipitator
2. Reconstructon of Cooling System of Biocks 2x1tO MW  (dosed cool:
sytam).-.
For the purpose of informing the partcpants on the problems in subject, 'al
Patrpants have been sent the invttadons for this discusion, t' which th e ere 
enclosed the material: P.eport on Realstion  of Phase I of Environmeir        .
rManagement Plan, and the Proposal for the P.an - Phase 2.
'lter tie dciscson; the following conclusions were drawn:
1. AJI participants expressetd the opinion the previous investts into the
ecological projects were completely effecdve.
2. Since the beginning of the TPS Kakanj operation, only now we were able to see
that it blccks of 110 MW wcrked, and there were no fue gz seen. Due tD Ns
reason, we give our fu:1 support to the proposed recorstuction of block 7 EP,
and consider the realisation of this project necessary and Justified.
:3. In the current cooling system, water is discharged into the Bosna river being of
increased temperature, which repreens a sgnificant thermic polluton of te-
recipient. In drj periods, due to significant use of water from the rivr Bosna for
the needs of the curTent coobng system, both the biological minirnum and.
equilibrium of that system are endangered. Due to the foregoing, we MW
support the reconstruction of the current cooling system and its trarion into
the cdosed system.
4. For theb purpose oF alleviating the consequences of the TPS operation for the
quality of air, vwater and micro-climate, we demand that during the development.
and realisation of these projects, the regulations from  the enrTnmneflt
protection field be recognised.

Until now pre-turbine gates on the second pipeline have been replaced,   ts oA tel, i
a egate no. 4, 5 and 6. These gates aro very reliablc and work without vibrations   J :
any fieight, have less loss of pressurc which resulcs in greater production of   Wr t
All gates have special hydraulic station for their operation, pressures and sealing o
stations are perfect which enables the easy maintenance and excludes any possibility  o
oil to mingle with waier.
Euvironmental Issues
Th ne complete equipnent of aggregate no.4 has been replaced, only an old spiral witbIne
model of stator blades remained. The operations of aggregate are quiet and  r c
Greater power and production has been achieved, maintenance expenses reduced an!
reliability of the hydroelectric power plant and safety of people increased. All leading    .
capacity bearings have been recunstructed which excludes any possibility for rea ;
oil to mingle with cooling w-er, The usage degree of aggregates has been increasd in 8,
% and that lowered loss or heat in powerhouse. The same applies to the problems oat
condlitional powerh(iuse.                                          .
,- Ail these works were done on existing equipment and structures, so that there is no ns*,

- Waste oils from hydraLliic sysms of rehabilitated aggregates are being cohtrolled  LC
after a proper qualitative analysis, a pan of oil is used again (recycling). The ret is
removed according to regulatio;S.

POWER 3 - Electric Power Reconstruction Project
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
1.    INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS WIIH LOCAL INHABITANTS
During last war in Bosnia and Htrzegovina great nun*ber of power stations were
extremely damaged, and the consequences were that they have not performed their function
or it was reduced performance. The corsequence was that rmany areas were left unthout
electricity or supply was not safe, that many industrial subjects hlave unsafe supply and that
power system is not stable enough and his not connected property with other countries.
Eiektroprivreda's in BIH with supporl from international conmunity make big eXorts in
rehabilitation of generation stations, traTsrmssion and distrbelin network in order to
establish normal function of pcwer system.
In following few years (2000-2003, Elektroprivreda of CGatian community of Hleeg-
Bosnia with the loan from The World Btank, Washington plans to rehabilitate power stations
that were damaged in the war. Rehabilitation program called POWER 3 includes
rehabilitation of Hydro power plant Rama 400 kV and 220 kV Iransmission network and
distribution network.
Hydro-power plant Rama was dari%ed in the area of stucture of the dam, drain
tunnel and surge shaft. These faults are not direct war :rrrages, but they Te the
consequence of operation of the plant in the war conditions. To bring the HP? into
technically acceptable condition, some work will be done Crnjection, wrapping up the
underground structures. etc.) In this way sater leakage throigh. identified holes wnsd be
prevented and stability of the dam, drain tunnel and surge shaft would be provided.
Direct war damages caused faults nn the transmission nT5work, 440 kV and 220 kV
transmission lines and transformer stations.
Rehabilitation program includes retabilitation of 400 kV transmission lines Mostar-
Gacko, Mostar-Sarajevo, Tuzla-Ernestinov;: (Croatia) and 200 k'transmission lines Yzkanj-
Prijedor, Jajce-Mraclin (Croatia) and rehabilitation of substaton plants 400/220/1 ;0 kV
tvlostar 4, 220 kV Mostar 3 and 220/110 kV Jajce 2
In the distribution network rehabiatation will be dc.ne on he 10 kV transmission lines
and 10/0,4 substations as well as on the lew voltage network.
Works that will be done. under this program in distribmi and transmission network
are including civil and installing works cn the existing transrrission lines and substation,
which were, build before the war.
With this rehabilitation (including civil and installing works) on the power stations of KPP
Rama, transmission and distribution network, these stations win be brought into condition in
which they were before the war. Work will be done on the stations which are out of inhabited
area and which with their characteristics cannot have negative i,i7pact on the environenit.
Also. all the stations have all investment and technical documer*ation (permissions for civil
works and inspection certificate) which whw.e issued by competer authority before Ithe war.

SUBJECT: Information
Referring to your letter 1-1951/99 dated 27.12.1999. concerning rehabilitation of
power objects (POWER 111) in the period 2000-2003 be inform you that there are no
barriers for realization of mentioned projects.
From the enclosure it can be seen that in the area of Canton Herceg-Bosna bigger
works are not predicted.
From the other side, works on rehabilitation of transmission and distribution network
will be done on the existing facilities. Also, that objects are out of inhabited area and
their rehabilitation could not significantly impact the ervronment.

Dear Sirs,
Referring to your letter 1-1915/99 dated 27.12.1999., concerning rehabilitation of
power objects - Power IlIl project we inform you following:
1.    As municipality Rama is not in the terrntory of canton Sredisnia Bosna your
request for report about public opinion of local inhabitants and environmental
organization is not in the authority of cant4 Sredisnja Bosna.
2.    Referring to the part of the project (POWER 111) concerning rehabilitation of
existing transmission lines, which were dan;aged in war, and are in the area
of Canton Sredi§nja Bosna, my opinion is that rehabilitation of above
mentioned cannot have impact on the enrironment. For that reason, we give
our approval for the rehabilitation.
Sincerely,

SUBJECT: Report for Power 3
Referring to your fax no. 1-1931 dated 27.12.1999. 'Rehabifitation of power facilities-
Power 3 program' and information tha; in the period 200D-2003 EPHZHB plans to
rehabilitate power objects, transmission and distribution nehiwrk we submit you
following information and opinion in Carton Posavina.
Total war damage of distribLlion region m the area of canton is estimated as 50 M
DEM. With the support of internatio.Vl institutions and bca  community in the
collecting grants important object are rehabilitated, reconstuced, modernized and
built. Complete reconstruction of the system is not yet finished. but we have clear
opinion about priority to make whole system come to the final purpose.
Beginning with reconstruction of global power capacities, and ensuring 10(20) k V
lines to every local community, it is contnued with building of secondary capacities,
like interpo!ation of substation 10J0'4 kV in the local comrnunil'ues.
Final level of rehabilitation is reconstruction .f LV network.
There were probiems because of voltage deficit from Croatia, which is significant for
the area of Orasje and Domaijevac muricipalities, because A is one way supply
connection. For that reason it is necessary 2 support another tm'iection to this area
and that would be 110 kV voltage frorn FBIH. The reconstruction of this line is still
uncertain.
In Working unit Elektro-Orasje are concerned because the gre.at part of the LV
network is old and damaged in the war. Reabilitation needs grev nunds.
From the contacts with WU Elektro-Oraie we notice that power situation in the area
of WU Elektro Orasje is very unfavourable. The reason tor this are often
disconnection in the supply on khe 35 kV voltage and limited paver on 4-5 MW in
Modrica (RS).
Starting with 10 kV works on tne SS 35/10 caused often disconnection in supply and
long term stoppage especially in the period of season holidays (Christmas and New
Year). In addition we notice that there is ncreserve supply forSS 1 10 kV Orasje, and
that is the reason because this area stays without voltage when voltage from Croatia
is disconnected. Area of Odza's is also depending on power situation in RS, but from
now cn 110 kV voltage.
It can be noticed that inhabitants are unsatisfied because of often cuts.
Because of all this we express our agreement for rehabilitation of transmission and
distribution network. The objects on which the rehabilitation will be done are away
from inhabited areas and they cannot make bad impact on the environment. On the
second extended meeting of council of local communities in Odzak dated
14.01.2000. it is concluded that the approval for works on rehabilitation of power
objects in Power 3 should be given, i.e. t?wt for our area ever:aPy tne rehabilitation
of 10 kV and SS 1010,4 kV and LV network would be more important.
Our local inhabitants expressed the opsion to have boetter supply, because our
damaged industry is clear assumption for economy development, and with that,
existence of people in this area Their des:re is not to think if they have candles in the
house and if this night will be spent in tie dark, which is very often case in our
canton.

EPRS-TPP Ugljevik
New System of Ash and Slag Transportation
Introduc tion:
At the  TPP "TUgljevik" with capacity of I x  300 MW is installed the system of
pneumatically ash traasport from clectrostatic precipitator up to the collecting silos and
transport of slag by conveyer belt from boiler up to the slag silos (placed near by ash silos).
Ash and slag transport from collecting silos up to ash and slag disposal area is being conducted
by keeper trucks. Loading of wetted ash (22-25% water) is pcrformed by means of screw
moisturizers and loading of slag is performed by vibrating loaders.
During the exploitation, using this type of transport for ash and slag, there are considerable
problems in technologicai and enavironmental meaning.
With regard to technology there are difficulties with trucks because especially during autumn
and winter seasons due to instability and inadequacy of transport road, trucks cannot dispose
ash and slag at regularly designated location, but nearer improvised dumps with stable roads
have to be prepared instead.
Furthermore the selected trucks.have shown a large instability during the discharge of materials
causing overturning of trucks.
With regard to environmental protection using track transportation causes considerable
environmental pollution of:
-  the spacc undernath silos because of dusting, evaporation and falling of materials from
trucks,
-  transport roads because of dust dispersion caused by wind etc.,
- at the dump because of discharge from trucks and previous disposed ash in particular
weather conditions (winds, etc.).
Due to these facts, we started to searching for new conception of ash and slag transportation to
dump (ash disposal area). There are two technologies considered;
- hydraulic system
- mechanical system
The basic characteristic  of hydraulic system for ash  and slag trasportation is with mass
concentration of approxirnatively 50% and with solidification of ash during the disposal.
Solidification (fully water contents of hydraulic transport react with ash, so there is no free
water) wil be possible because of presence of some components which participate in structure
of ash from TPP "Ugljevi" (high content of CaO etc.). Such prepared hydro mixture is
transported to dump (disposal area) by sludg pumps and by steel pipelines and further at dump,
distribution may be conducted by plastic pipelines, which are easier and more convenient for
manipulation.
To make hydraulic system  of transportation generaIly acceptable, it is required to perform
laboratory and experimental (pilot plants) examination of water-ash mixture.
Mechanical system for ash and slag transportation better known and xnore acceptable for us. The
procedure is that ash has to be wetted by existing mixers (approxinmatively 20% of water) and
by closed belt conveyer is being transported to ash disposal area where ash is disposed on dump
by transport system (fixed and movable) of one spreader movable on caterpillar.
By new transport systcm of ash and slag above menrioned accidents are avoided. Those
problems have jeopardized environment but in future some plans and monitoring and mitigation
measures are anticipated, that should eliminate the causes of environmental poUlution.

Basically, the flows of information regarding monitoring activities and mitigatnmg measures, are
as follows:
- measurements of parameters. intcrpretation of results, preparation and distribution of reports.
is done by Central Chemical Laboratory (CCL) and Environment Protection Department
(EPD) (laboratory technicians).
result analysis is done by CCL & EPD (engineers in charge) and Generation Working Unit
(GWU) (manager of generation and engineer in charge for ash and slag transportation).
- if monitoring results are dissatisfactory:
a) increased dust concentration,
- GWU instantly undertakes mitigating measures;
b) increased level noise,
- ID undertakes mitigating measures;
c) increase in pH values and sulphates and sulphides concentration,
- analysis of heavy metals is being done;
- additional analysis of the cause is being done (high concentration of water for moisturizing
or worsening of weatier conditions). All above mentioned personnel is involved plus
designer of ash and slag transportation system;
- undertaking of mitigating measures;
- if mitigating measures do not give resulTs, management of TPP make decision on the
change of operation regime or shutdown the plant.

F. CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL NGOs AND PROJECT - AFFECTED GROUPS
Consultative meeting
The meeting was held on 18 t of July, 1999, at the offices of TPP, preceded by public invitation.
The following issues were discussed at the meeting:
1. Environmental aspects of ash and slag transportation.
2. The activities undertaken in order to eliminate the input of ash and slag transportation on
cnvironment pollution.
The representatives of TPP Ugljevik presented the issues of ash and slag transportation directly
involved in environment pollution.
The representatives of NGOs and PAGs presented their views concerming the impact of dust on
hruits, vegetables and cereals, as well as on the section of road used by trucks for ash and slag
transportation. Their views were very negative and crmshing.
The dependence of the environrnent pollution on seasons and weather conditions, was discused,
too.
Then the representatives of TPP Ugljevik presented the plan for the new ash and slag
transportation system, with all anticipated benefits and deficiencies.
General conclusion of all attendants was that activities on the replacement of ash and slag
transportation system should be accelerated in order to reduce environment pollution.
Remark: Ash and slag disposal area is siruated at the location of Bogutovo Selo, which makes it
the most endangered by a/m issues.

Recultivation of ash disposal areas at M&TPP Gacko
Introductiou:
The power complex of Mine and TPP Gacko comprises open pit mine Gracaniica with coal
capacit of 1.800.000 t per year and overburden of 4-5,5 mill.m3, also thermal block of 300 MW
installed capacity with annual net electrical energy production of 1400 GWh.
Lignite produced in mine is used only for consumption in the boiler of TPP in quantity of 300-
350 t/h i.e. 1.800.000 tlper year. Ash and slag are being separated in quantity of 70 t/h i.e. totally
400.000 t/per year. Since the commencement of lPP at 1982 up to 1992 the ash was utansported
by tucks to the ash disposal area Drazljevo placed 7km away from TPP location. Ash disposal
area Drazljevo is fall-filter and there is disposed ash of 3-5 mill. t. The preparations for it's
lastly conservation are in process.
Since 1992 ash disposal is performed in the exploited part of mine that was prepared accordingly
to project of Institute for Mining from Belgrade and comprises environmental protection
measures against harmful influence of disposed materials.
During coal exploitation the digging out overburden (barren soil) and interburden is conducted
continuously. At the part "A" of the mine, the overburden ratio amounts 1,21m3/t while at the
part "B"' that ratio is 3,21m3/t. Overburden is disposed by means of two continuos systems
BBS (bucket dredger - belt - spreader) I and BBS II and by discontinuous system to the cast
and west outer disposal areas. Around 38mill.n3 overburden have been disposed at these
disposal areas up to now.
There are two inner disposal areas in the mine. It is required to conservc and to recultivate all
these disposal areas in accordance with some similar projects. Recultivation is composed of
physical part that means planning of ash disposal area (trimming of surfaces, filling of
depression, collection and drawing off the waters and lining by geomembrane liner if required
and to put layer of humus).
Than to come up to agritechnical preparation composed of melioration fertilization and increase'
of content of the organic substances in the covering layer.
Biologically recultivation is sowing of grass and planting of woody plants to stabilize the
disposal area and to prevent erosion.
Disposed ash is hazardous material with high content of CaO (about 70%) and because of that
ash contaminate water when contact is made.
Overburden (barren soil) is chemically inert material and due to this fact dast and ground erosion
are basic pollution made by dump of barren soil.
Control of influence made by disposal area to environment is being conducted by checking of
water quality as well as quality of the soil and air.
The basically control system is checking of the water quality of Musnica river ax location
Srdevica Klanac. Control checking system is conducted by piezometers i.e. measurement of
pH in water sample.
Furthermore the monitoring of measuring results and visual deficiencies and intervention.

Note: 1KM= 1DEM
On the basis of the contacts made with WB experts and allocated amnount of loan Managing
Board of Mfine and TPP Gacko consider as the most beneficial to  perform supply of the
following basic means by WB loan.
- dredger, trench digger with the bucket capacity of 2-3m3 for peeling and loading of humus,
- field truck, carrying capacity of 25t for transportation of humus,
- bulldozer, 200 kW capacity for dump planning and for putting of humus.
Besides above quoted equipment Mine and TPP Gacko will perform supply of additional
equipment and materials by own funds as like:
- Field truck, carrying capacity 25t,
- Material for agritechnical and biological recultivation,
-  Ciontrol measuring equipment.
Mine and TPP Gacko will perform.all work-s on recultivation of the above mentioned dumps
(ash disposal area).

Basically, the flows of information regarding moniitoring activities and mitigating measures, are
as follows:
-  measurements of parameters, interpretation of results, preparation and distribution of reports,
is done by Central Chemical Laboratory (CCL) and Environment Protection Department
(EPD) (laboratory technicians).
-  result analysis is done by CCL & EPD (engineers in charge) and Generation Working Unit
(GWU) (manager of generation and engineer in charge for ash and slag tansportation).
- if monitoring results are dissatisfactory:
a) increased dust concentration.
- GWU instantly undertakes mitigating measures;
b) increased level noise,
- ID undertakes mitigating measures;
c) increase in pH values and sulphatcs and sulphides concentration,
- analysis of heavy metals is being done;
- additional analysis of the cause is being done (high concentration of water for moisturizing
or worsening of weather conditions). All above mentioned personnel is involved plus
designer of ash and slag transportation system;
- undertaking of mitigating measures;
- if mitigating measures do not give results, management of TPP make decision on dte
change of operation regime or shutdown the plant.

3. P'lan of ash disposal areas recultivation.
The most negatively influence from TPP Gacko to environ=ent is ask emission and pollution
of the water of Musnica river.
The project of reconstruction of the electrostatic precipitator at TPP is accepted very positively,
by what means will be achieved decrease of ash emission on level of European standards.
The mentioned project will be realized within 2000 year partly by WB loan. Recultivation plans
of ash disposal areas detailed presented by representatives of TPP and Plans are accepted as
measures which improve environmental situation in Gacko.
All associated occurrence which may take place during realization of recultivation works for ash
disposal areas and mitigation measures planned to be undertaken are discussed and professional
explained and accepted by caution about surely control of providing.
The representatives of Srdevici village have insisted on realization of project for waste water
puri.fication, because tht river Musnica is imperiled by waste waters. The representatives of TPP
Gacko are accepted the obligation to put that project in realization priority by explanation that
the shortage of firancial means is the main problem but all measures will be undertaken to
ensure required means.

LPRS -'ELEKTROKRAIINA. BSAJA LUKA        -2-
Draft -Final Report of Feasibility Study, regarding project Power -III, financed by WB, has
included (re) construction of four facilities in the area of distribution company
"Elektrokrajina", Banjaluka, namely:
1. Construction of 110/20 kV SS :elinac
2. Construction of 110 kV TL Bay- SS 110/20/10 kV Prijedor 3
3. Reconstruction of 35kV TL Kotor Varog-Kneievo
4. Reconstruction of 3516 kV SS Libija
All works on these facilities will be performed according to the applicable IEC standards.
Expocted impacts of construction and operation of said facilities on environment, are given
by location here below:
1. 110/20 kV SS telinac
Design foresees replacement of existing 35/2() kV transformation with 110/20 kV
transformation, along with introducing of 110 kV linc (inlet-outlct) SS Banja Luka l-SS
Kotor Vaios.
Eniironmental issues during construction and operation?are following:
-  During construction of 110 kV switchgear the impact of noise, dust. traffic interference
etc. shall be minimized by: civil works shall be performed with machinery (excavation of
the foundations for equipment), concrete foundations shall be built with ready made
concrete mixture, all works shall be performed during daylight
- The location of SS is in suburban area
- SS will have concrete oil pit, big enough to absorb complete content of oil from
transformer to prevent the leakage of oil in to soil.
- Existing transformers 35/20 kV, 2X4 MVA don't contain oil with PCB s (attachment 1.)
- Technical characteristics of new power transformer, to be given in tender documents,
shall strictly request transformer oil without PCBs
- Citizens in Ceinac municipality are informed about thc scope and purpose of this
construction, and during the meeting with NGO and project affected group, no
concerns regarding environmental issues were raised from the audience,(attachment 2.)



EPRS -1-ULEKKTROKRA]INA: BAJA LUKA      -3-
2. Construction of 110 kV TL Bay- SS 110/20/10 kV Prijedor 3
The design foresees construction of complete 110 kV TL bay, in the direction to Kozarska
Dubica, within the existing 110/20/10 kV SS. The construction will not have any detrimental
effect on environmental issucs since:
- SS is located outside urban area
- All works shall be performed during common working hours
- some increase in noise level could be expected but it will be diminished by use of
appropriate machinery
- Existing power transformer 110/20/10 kV, 20 MVA doesn't contain oil with PCBs,
(attachment 1.)
- The citizens in Prijedor are informed about these activities, at the meeting held with the
representatives of NGOs and PAGs, (attachment 3.)
3. Reconstruction of 35 kV TL Kotor Varog-Knezevo
This is the reconstruction of existing, old 35(20) kV line. The new T11 will run along same
route, so that negative impact on environment will be minimized.
- Needed deforestation will he more than compensated by subsequent afforestation.
- During the construction, the existing roads and paths will be used, avoiding damage to
agricultural land.
- special care will be taken during the work on the sections of line crossing the roads and
inhabitated areas
- Individuals from PAGs have been talked to, and they support this activity, fmding no
probable damaging effect on environment (attachment 4.).
4. Reconstruction of 35/6 kV SS Ljubija
Project foresees the rehabilitation of building itself and the replacement of existing 35 and
6 kV equipment with new one.
- This is reconstruction of existing building so there won't be any additional civil works.
- The existing transformer 35/6 Ic, 4 MVA doesn't contain oil with PCBs (attachment 1.)
and tender documents for new, 35/20 kv, 4 MVA, transformer shall request oil without
PCBs, too.
- Along with the oil pit for existing transformer, oil pit will be made for new transformer,
too-



r-PRS -£ELEKTROKRARNA: BAJA LUKA         -4-
- SS is not in the vicinity of urban area and works shall be performed during common
working hours so as to diminish detrimental effect of noise, dust etc.
- During the meeting held with NGOs, and PAGs from Prijedor and Ljubija, no concerns
werc raised regarding environmental issues of construction. (attachment 5.)
NOTE: Monitoring Plan, Institutional Strengthening and Institutional Arrangement are
not considered necessary within this scope of work

SUBJECT: Project Power III (WB)
By your letter NL280, dated 28th of December, 1999, you asked what were insulating media
in transformers and circuit breakers in Prijedor TII, Ljubija and Celinac SSs.
All circuit breakers contain transformer oil TEHNOL Y-3000, and transformers contain either
TEHNOL Y-3000 or TRAFOMOL SPECIJAL depending on the date of transformer
production or overhaul.
On the basis of a/rn we state that all circuit breakers and transformers in said SSs contain oil
without PCBs.

- LV network reconstruction (cca 30 km.)
ZDP ElektroHercegovina Trebinje
- 10/0,4 kV SS ( 10 pcs.)
-  10 kV TL reconstruction (cca 20 kn.)
- LV network reconstruction (30 km.)
All works on these Facilities will be performed according to the applicable IEC Standards.
Expected impacts of construction and opration of said facilities on environment, are given
separately for similar facilities.
1. SS 110/35/10 kV
During construction of 110, 35 and 10 kV switchgear the impact of noise, dust, traffic interference
etc. shall be minimized by: civil works shall be performed with machinery (excavation of
foundations for equipment), concrete foundations shall be built with ready made concrete mixture,
all works shall be performed during daylight.
-Citizens in Doboj municipality are informed about the scope and purpose of this construction,
and during the meeting with NOO and Project affected group, no concerns regarding
environmental issues were raised from the audience.(Attachment)



2. SS35110 kV
The cxisting transformers 35/10 kV doesn't contain oil with PCBs, and tender documents for new
transformers will request oil without PCBs, too.
-Along with oil pit for existing transforner, oil pit will be made for new transformer, too.
-All works shall be performed during common working hours so as to diminish detrimental effect
of noise, dust etc.
-During the meeting held with NGOs and PAGs ,no concerns were raised regarding
environmental issues of construction.(Attachment)
3. TL35kV
During the construction, the existing roads and paths will be used, avoiding damage to agricultural
land.
-Special care will be taken during the work on the sections of line crossing the roads and
inhabitated areas.
-Needed deforestation will be more than compensated by subsequent afforestation.
-Individuals from PAGs have been talked to, and they support this activity, finding no
probable damaging effect on environment .(Attachment)
4. SS 20(10)/0,4 kV
1. Constuction of 20(10)/0,4kV SSs
The project foresees the  construction  of new  20(10)/0,4kV SS with the purpose of the
improvement of power system. From environmental point of view, these facilities will not have
detrimental impacts on environment.
-New power transformer will contain the oil without PCBs, the requirement that shall be
specified in tender documents.
-During construction, the impact of noise, dust, traffic interference will be minimized by:
-  work will be performed during common working hours,
-  adequate machinery will be used,
- civil works (particularly foundations) will be performed with ready made concrete
mixture,
- the incidence of excessive dust will be reduced by water spraying.
During the meeting held with PAGs from affected areas, no concerns were raised regarding
environmental issues of constructions.
5. The reconstruction of 20(10) kV:TL s and LV networks
The project foresees the reconstruction of old 20 kV and LV networks in order to achieve more
reliable supply of electicity. The reconstruction will be done along existing routes so that the
disturbance of environment will be mininmized.
The individuals from PAG s are inforrned about planned reconstruction an they did n't express
concem regarding environmental issues of reconstruction. (Attachment)

EPRS - HPP Trebinje
REHABILITATION AT HPP TREBINJE I
lntroduction
The process of rehabilitation of IPP Trebinje I, included in project Power III, of the WB, will be
performed step by step, not disturbuting power balance of HPP.
Thee works on electrical, mechanical and -hydro-mechanical equipment won't have detrimental
effects on environment.
*     There is, 1however, one issue related to. environment protection, which will be taken care of by
BiP it self, and which doesn't need additional funds. This is about the large quantities of
various oils present in the sections of plant that will undergo interventions, namely:
- bearing lubricating oil
-  turbine govemor oil
-  transfonner oil
- hydraulic oil for intake structure wicket gate.
All these oils should be prevented from spillage into accumulation, since the accumulation
serves as a source for drinking water.
Existing oils, which have been in use for more than 30 years, don't contain banned chtmical
compounds (ex.PCBs).
The following types of oils are currently contained in the equipment:
- SHELL TELLUS OIL 33
- SHELL TELLUS OIL 29
-  MOBIL DTE OIL HEAVY MEDIUM
- MOBtL TRANSFORMER OIL BB
All transformers have constructed oil pits, big enough to accept whole amount in the case of
accident.
New transformer oil will not contain PCBs, which requirement shall be specified  in  Tender
Documents.
Spent turbine, transformer's or hydraulic oils will be loaded in adequate barrels or tanks and
stored in sate place, or sent for recycling.
Since HPP has  well  equipped laboratory, which permanently analyze the water from
accumulation, this activity will be permanent and more frequent durig construction.
The levels of noise and vibration should be permanently monitored, and adequate records should
be kept, during the operation of IHPP.
