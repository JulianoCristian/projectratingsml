Additionally, the project will support GOI efforts\n            to timely prepare for, detect and respond to influenza\n            outbreaks in humans and animals'. Due to the reduced\n            scope of the project as well as the partial completion of\n            the planned activities, the human health component of IDSP\n            anticipates savings of USD 15.954 million over the remaining\n            tenure of the project.
