A. SUMMARY

  The proposed changes relate to the animal health component under this project and
  will support cancellation of an amount of SDR 6,472,199.42 (US$ 10 million
  equivalent) from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (Credit no. 3952-IN)

B. PROJECT STATUS

  The project is scheduled to close on March 31, 2012. The last credit cancellation
  (dated January 12, 2012) was for SDR 10,391,657 (US$ 15.954 million equivalent)

  The key project data is as follows:

Approval Date                           July 8, 2004
Original Closing Date                   March 31, 2010
Revised Closing Date                    March 31, 2012
Original Credit Amount                  SDR 46.9 million (or USD 72.46 million equivalent)
Revised Credit after Cancellation       SDR 41.478 million (or USD 65.56 million equivalent)
of April 15, 2010
Revised Credit after Cancellation       SDR 31.087 million (or USD 49.155 million equivalent)
of January 12, 2012
Amount Disbursed                        SDR 18.166million (or USD 28.153 million equivalent)
(as of March 29, 2012)
Undisbursed Amount                      SDR 12.92 million or USD 19.962 million equivalent)
(as of March 29, 2012)


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

  The revised PDO of IDSP is to: (a) strengthen the existing integrated disease
  surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases by (i) enhancing central level
  monitoring and coordination functions, and (ii) improving state/district surveillance
  and response capacity with emphasis on selected (nine) states; and (b) timely prepare
  for, detect and respond to influenza outbreaks in humans and animals.

  Due to non-procurement of the planned two constructed Bio Safety Level III labs
  within the animal health component of IDSP, approximately US$ 12 million of the
  IDA Credit remains unutilized at project end. IDA has received a request (dated
  March 30, 2012) from the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance,
  Government of India, requesting cancellation of available savings from IDA 39520-
  IN. The Task Team has assessed the unutilized Credit and recommends cancellation

             revised category-wise allocation is given below:
