                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          Despite improvements in portal reporting, outbreak reporting and creation of the laboratory network, some important implementation bottlenecks remain, such as the delay in
                         recruitment and training of human resources at both the Central and State levels. The recruitment and trainings need to be completed at the earliest.
