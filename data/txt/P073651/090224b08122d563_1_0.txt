                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         To support the Government of India (GOI) to strengthen the integrated disease surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases by (i) enhancing central level monitoring
                         and coordination functions, and (ii) improving state/district surveillance and response capacity with emphasis on selected (nine) states. Additionally, the project will
                         support GOI efforts to timely prepare for, detect and respond to influenza outbreaks in humans and animals.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The restructured Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) has entered the final four months of implementation with good progress having been logged on most activities
                         agreed for both the human health as well as the animal health components of the project. For the human health component, the capacities of the Central Surveillance Unit (CSU), the
                         State Surveillance Units (SSU) and the District Surveillance Units (DSU) have been strengthened with recruitment of technical and IT personnel and their training. The priority states

                         have demonstrated a progressively improving performance over time in terms of timeliness and consistency of reporting of epidemic prone diseases on the web-based portal through
                         health facility level surveillance. A slow start has been made in involving the private sector health facilities for disease reporting. Disease outbreak reporting has improved
                         significantly, with the priority states accounting for more than 60% of outbreaks reported in India till date, during 2011. 17 District Priority Labs (DPLs) and a network of 65 referral labs
                         have been strengthened with hardware and software support to improve lab access for disease and outbreak confirmations. In addition, 12 labs have been strengthened with 11 labs

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         IDSP has requested the Bank through the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) for a cancellation of USD 15.954 million from the allocation for human health component and USD
                         0.324 million from the allocation for the animal health component. The Task Team has completed the processing of this cancellation request pertaining to the human health
                         component and the same has been communicated to the DEA on 13th January 2012, while the amount of cancellation required from the animal health component has been
                         requested to be re-assessed in view of the delay in construction of two animal health labs. The closing implementation support review and the Learning Implementation Completion
                         Report (ICR) mission for IDSP is planned for February/March 2012 following which a final project ISR will be filed.
