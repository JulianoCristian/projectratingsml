Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The PDO was revised twice: In the 2007 restructuring, a supporting PDO was included: "to minimize the
threat in India posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza infection and other zoonoses from
domestic poultry and prepare for the prevention, control and response to an influenza pandemic in
humans". As a result of the 2010 restructuring, the PDO is revised to:"To support the Government of India
(GOI) to strengthen the integrated disease surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases by (i)
enhancing central level monitoring and coordination functions, and (ii) improving state/district surveillance
and response capacity with emphasis on selected (nine) states. Additionally, the project will support GOI
efforts to timely prepare for, detect and respond to influenza outbreaks in humans and animals".
