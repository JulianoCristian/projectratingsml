                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The PDO was revised twice:

                          In the 2007 restructuring, a supporting PDO was included: "to minimize the threat in India posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza infection and
                         ot                               her zoonoses from domestic poultry and prepare for the prevention, control and r                              esponse to an
                         influenza pandemic in humans".

                          As a result of the 2010 restructuring, the PDO is revised to:"To support the Government of India (GOI) to strengthen the integrated disease surveillance system
                         for epidemic-prone diseases by (i) enhancing central level monitoring and coordi                                  nation functions, and (ii) improving state/district

                         implementation of the restructured project: key staff (procurement and financial management)are on board in both implementation agencies; all 9 states have finalized the referral
                         laboratory network plans and received technical and financial guidelines; training modules for health professionals have been finalized ; a sound quality control system as wellas
                         adequate arrangements for sample collection and transportation are now operational for the network of Influenza Reference Laboratories ; two BSL3 laboratories are fully operational

                         for the Avian Influenza Animal Health sub-component. The project has been instrumental in creating an increasing surveillance awarness and establish the basis for a surveillance
                         system, including seting up an outbreak detection and response reporting system: in the 9 priority states, 306 outbreaks were investigated in the first 8 months of 2010 as compared
                         to annual number of respectively 488 and 400 outbreaks in 2009 and 2008.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Despite clear improvements, some important fiduciary and implementation bottlenecks remain. Recruitment of the additional human resources is delayed both at the Central and
                         State level . Furthermore, the nine priority states have not yet fully internalized the revised scope of the project, their roles and responsibilities and as well as the use of the revised
                         results framework since restructurng.Reporting outbreaks directly through the portal by districts and states is not implemented consistently and satisfactorily, while, monitoring of the
                         revised outcome indicators can only be done based on input from portal reports. In the nine priority states, two out of the planned 17 district priority labs are fully operational and the
                         implementation of the Laboratory Referral Plans has been rolled out in two states only . Although one financial management specialist (FM) position has been filled up in MOHFW,

                         the second position in the FM cell at the MOHFW became again vacant, and recruitment is underway. Instead of the use of a dedicated procurement agent by MOHFW, a revised
                         procurement arrangement, including capacity enhancement, has recently been agreed with MOHFW, and its implementation would be assessed over the next few months. The Audit
                         of decentralized expenditures of the Animal health subcomponentof Avian Influenza is delayed, which increases risk in loss or misplacement of records. During the last joint
                         implementation reviewin September 2010, a specific set of key actions to be completed for the project ratings to improve were agreed with both project implementation units.The
                         Bank team will closely follow-up on all these agreed actions, and will review the implementation progressratings prior to the next implementation review.
