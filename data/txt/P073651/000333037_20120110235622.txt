SUMMARY

  1. The proposed changes will support cancellation of an amount of SDR 10,391,657
     (US$ 15.954 million equivalent) from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (Credit
     No. 3952-IN)


PROJECT STATUS

  2. As of November 10, 2011, the project has disbursed 37.2% (SDR 17.45 million) of IDA
     Credit of SDR 41.5 million. The key project data is as follows:

  Approval Date                July 8, 2004
  Original Closing Date        March 31, 2010
  Revised Closing Date         March 31, 2012
  Original Credit Amount       SDR 46.9 million (or USD 73.87 million equivalent)
  Credit after Cancellation    SDR 41.478 million (or USD 65.56 million equivalent)
  Amount Disbursed             SDR 17.45 million (or USD 27.04 million equivalent)
  Undisbursed Amount           SDR 24.03 million or USD 37.85 million equivalent)

  3. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) became effective on October 28,
     2004. It was restructured on February 14, 2007 following a request from the Ministry of
     Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) through the Department of Economic Affairs
     (DEA) to include support to India’s Avian Influenza program in response to the global
     influenza pandemic that threatened animal and human health. The project was
     restructured once again on March 29, 2010 to accommodate
          − a revised, clarified and specific Project Development Objective (PDO);
          − reduction in the number of project components from five to three;
          − a sharpened focus–a phased roll out in 35 states was amended to support
              implementation in nine priority states;
          − a revised results framework with consolidation of outcome indicators and
              clarified targets;
          − deletion of decentralized expenditure and Bio Safety Level (BSL) IV labs from
              the avian flu component;
          − strengthened project implementation through additional Human Resources (HR)
              and establishment of Financial Management (FM) Cells at MoHFW and
              Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairies and Fisheries (DADF);
          − Use of procurement agents for MoHFW/DADF;
          − Cancellation of USD 8 million; and
          − Extension of the credit closing date by two years, until March 31, 2012.

  4. The revised PDO of IDSP is to: (a) strengthen the existing integrated disease surveillance
     system for epidemic-prone diseases by (i) enhancing central level monitoring and
     coordination functions, and (ii) improving state/district surveillance and response


                                              4
    capacity with emphasis on selected (nine) states; and (b) timely prepare for, detect and
    respond to influenza outbreaks in humans and animals.

5. Despite responding with alacrity to a changing external environment, the project
   proceeded at a slower than expected pace in leveraging the International Development
   Association (IDA) credit to implement the ambitious (and subsequently toned down)
   project implementation plan on account of capacity constraints both at the Central
   Surveillance Unit (CSU) and the State Surveillance Units (SSUs) and also due to a delay
   in the facilitatory financial processes [e.g.: Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC)
   approval] emanating from within the respective government bodies. Since mid-2010,
   however, the project demonstrated significant progress in all aspects of project
   implementation and consequently was brought out of its problem status during the Joint
   Implementation Review (JIR) of April 2011. The progress includes:
        a. Recruitment of specialists (epidemiologists, microbiologists and entomologists),
            Information Technology (IT) related personnel, and financial consultants at SSUs
            of nine priority states and the CSU. Additionally, induction and training of all
            technical and non-technical IDSP staff from all 35 states and Union Territories of
            the country.
        b. Support to 17 District Priority Labs (DPLs) in nine priority states and to a referral
            network of 65 public and private labs with an annual grant, equipment, reagents
            and training to ensure full operationalization; thus, strengthening disease
            surveillance with investigations of routine human samples and those from
            epidemic prone disease outbreaks.
        c. Establishment and operationalization of 623 data and training centers in nine
            priority states for data compilation, reporting, analysis and training. The project
            has also designed a portal for web-based reporting of surveillance and outbreak
            related data, block level upwards from public health facilities, private health
            facilities and laboratories (public health labs, DPLs and labs of the referral
            network). Since the second restructuring, the project has increasingly improved
            reporting on the portal, and for the Quarters 1 and 2 of 2011, it achieved an
            average of 92% districts reporting on the portal for syndromic, presumptive and
            lab assessment of surveillance information.
        d. Strengthening of 12 labs with reagents, materials and training for testing of
            human samples for influenza; and establishment 23 BSL II and 4 prefabricated
            BSL III labs across the country to build capacity for testing of animal samples for
            influenza.

6. The gains in rupee amount of the Credit due to exchange rate fluctuations, the delayed
   approval from the EFC after the previous restructuring of the project, the challenge of
   building capacity both at the central and state surveillance units for the human health
   component of the project and leveraging this capacity for project implementation; and
   thus the reduced available time for project implementation has resulted in significant
   reduction in the financial requirements of the project. Consequently, the CSU in
   consultation with the World Bank Task Team has estimated an unused Credit of USD
   15.954 million, and through the Department of Economic Affairs requested the Bank for
   cancellation of this amount.

7. The procurement arrangements agreed during the last restructuring on March 29, 2010
   will continue and no new procurements are envisaged till the project closing.




                                             5
      8. The proposed cancellation of an IDA amount of USD 15.954 million will not affect in
         any manner the completion of social and environmental safeguard management activities
         earlier agreed with the client, which the Bank will continue to monitor.



PROPOSED CHANGES

          Financing

      9. Due to the reduced scope of the project as well as the partial completion of the planned
         activities, the human health component of IDSP anticipates savings of USD 15.954
         million over the remaining tenure of the project. Consequently, IDA has received a
         request from the MoHFW through the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of
         Finance, Government of India for cancellation of USD 15.954 million from the human
         health component of the project. Accordingly, the revised allocation is given in the table
         below.
