Conditions\n            internal and external to Rwanda affected project\n            development, impact, and success. Throughout the\n            project's life, Rwanda experienced political\n            instability, internal and regional insecurity, and suffered\n            from a lack of institutional capacity. The lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) Post-conflict environments\n            necessitate malleable project designs in order to be able to\n            adapt to the often rapidly changing conditions as to what is\n            feasible and what is desirable. 2) Speed and ownership are a\n            regular trade-off for interventions in a post-conflict\n            environment. In an emergency period, implementation through\n            an independent agency may be most efficient as long as local\n            capacities are too weak to carry out such activities. 3)\n            Projects in post-conflict countries should pay particular\n            attention to financial management. Weak government capacity\n            and the lack of adequate financial controls require the\n            close monitoring of funds. 4) Micro-credit activities, which\n            by nature require some level of stability within the\n            environment they are implemented, may not be appropriate in\n            post-conflict environments. 5) Monitoring and evaluation\n            should be conducted regularly so as to be able to make snap\n            decisions and respond expediently to matters in a changing\n            and sometimes volatile environment."}, "docdt": "2001-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
