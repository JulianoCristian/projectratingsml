                         suffered from delays in works completion. Most critical in this regard are: (1) the issuance of the take-over certificate for the Tabanovce-Kumanovo motorway, and (2) the completion
                         of the remaining works at the Blace BCP. During January 2012, the Macedonian Customs Administration successfully settled the budget restraints faced during the end of 2011.
                         In order to complete all project activities and achieve the development objectives fully, the project closing date was extended by three months to June 30, 2012.
