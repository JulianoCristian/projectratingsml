It\n            represents an artery passing through the country in a\n            north-west direction along the valley of the most important\n            water course -- the Vardar River. Apart from the East-West\n            transportation corridor (Corridor 8, connecting the\n            neighboring countries Bulgarija, Macedonia and Albania),\n            this corridor is regarded as most important development\n            axis, since it enables connection of Macedonia with the\n            developed European countries from the north, as well as\n            provides exit to the Aegean Sea in the South, through\n            Greece. Completion of the highway in its full length is\n            considered a priority, which is supported by the fact that\n            the Government intends to obtain EU pre-accession funds\n            (IPA) to finalize a very difficult section in technical and\n            engineering terms of this corridor. This project covers a\n            section starting from the border crossing Tabanovce and\n            ending at the point where the existing highway is terminated\n            at its leaving the town of Kumanovo, in total length of 8.34\n            km. Some of the environmental impacts and corresponding\n            mitigation measures are: air pollution, to be mitigated by\n            planting vegetation buffer zones; endangerment of wildlife,\n            to be mitigated by relocation and tracking; construction\n            waste and debris, to be mitigated by appointment of a waste\n            manager; cultural issues, to be mitigated by compensation of\n            the local population; and hazards, to be mitigated by a\n            hazard management plan."}, "docdt": "2012-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
