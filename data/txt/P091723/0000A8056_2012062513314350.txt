                         bottlenecks and improving the efficiency and quality of road and rail services along Trans-European Transport corridor X on the territory of the Borrower.

                         throughput on the Tabanovce-Kumanovo section of Corridor X motorway, (3) functioning electronic communication of freight documents between railways and customs, (4) widened
                         availability of electronic clearance of customs documents, (5) extended passenger border point at Blace.
                         The Tabanovce-Kumanovo motorway is operational and the Contractor successfully implemented most of the remaining items (from the snag list). The Agency for State Roads (ASR)
                         completed the consultation process for the implementation of noise mitigation measures along the motorway section. The software upgrades to the Customs electronic clearance

                         system are operational and have gained excellent traction with the private sector. The telecommunication system installed along rail corridor X continues to work well and has been
                         also utilized by neighboring railways in Kosovo and Serbia. The trade facilitation aspect of railway operation has been strengthened and is evidenced in the joint border operation
                         between the railways in Serbia and Kosovo. A month before the project closure, the rehabilitation of the old section of Blace border crossing remains to be finished and the overall
                         physical progress is at 97.6 percent. In case the Customs Administration doesn't manage to finish the border crossing before June 30, completion will need to be financed by budget
                         resources and approximately 400,000 EUR will not be disbursed.
