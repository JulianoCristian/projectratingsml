                                 Restructuring Paper



    1. The Government has requested an extension of the closing date for the Second
Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (IBRD Loan 48590-MK), from September
30, 2011 until March 31, 2012. The proposed extension is necessary to allow additional
time for civil works to be completed under one of the project components.

    2. The project objectives continue to be achievable, with noteworthy results and
positive outcomes already achieved. The Project has been rated Satisfactory and
Moderately Satisfactory for the last 12 months for progress towards achieving the
Development Objective and for Implementation Progress, respectively. Overall, project
implementation is progressing well under all components, with the exception of the
physical investment under Component 2, related to the modernization of the Blace border
crossing for passengers, which is behind the original schedule. As of June 23, 2011, about
65 percent of project funds have been disbursed. Financial management performance is
satisfactory, and there are no overdue audits. Financial covenants have been complied
with.

    3. As of end May 2011, physical progress with the civil works at the Blace border
crossing is only at about 34 percent completion. This is attributed to the accumulated
delays from the beginning of the construction, and also to the impact of adverse weather
conditions, which not only halted the earthworks construction several times, but also
required some of the earthworks to be reconstructed. In consultation with the Bank, the
Customs Administration has prioritized a list of key actions that need to be completed to
maintain timely progress. With respect to the remaining activities related to the
implementation of software packages for the Customs Administration, the extension will
provide additional time to ensure quality of delivery.


   4. This will be the first extension of the project. A revised implementation plan has
been agreed with the Customs Administration. It is planned that civil works will now be
completed by end December ahead of the proposed new closing date in March 2012.
