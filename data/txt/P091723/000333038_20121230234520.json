"4859", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Trade and\n            Transport Facilitation Project for Macedonia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Bank's\n            due diligence on all project aspects is essential even when\n            there is time pressure for project delivery. Reliance on\n            representation is not an excuse. The land acquisition issue\n            at Blace resulted in time delay but in the end did not\n            impact the Project's outcome. However, a similar\n            situation on a large scale project which had not been\n            resolved and remedied very soon could have a much more\n            negative outcome including reputational risk to the Bank. In\n            trade facilitation, some essential investments are not\n            costly. The impact of these investments on institutional\n            reform, however, could be immense. The various software and\n            IT activities are minor investments compared to the civil\n            works. These investments, however, require disproportionate\n            efforts from the Bank in technical and procurement support.\n            Although it is not the case in Macedonia, the failure rate\n            of IT investments in transport projects tends to be high.\n            One reason for success of this Project is that Macedonian\n            Railways (MZ) and Macedonia Customs Administration (MCA)\n            both have a high level of IT literacy. For instance, they\n            both have technical departments which designed the software\n            specifications. These were client-driven processes.\n            Consultations on road design are not always undertaken to\n            produce a better design. In this Project, community inputs\n            have resulted in a better designed investment for the road\n            upgrade. The revision in the motorway design after\n            consultation added social development features for the\n            Project and wider stakeholders' support. Lastly, the\n            Project's implementation arrangement has some\n            duplication of efforts. However, the utilization of public\n            sector staff in project implementation instead of a PIU\n            structure resulted in much better capacity strengthening and\n            project ownership. Under such arrangement, training for\n            implementation staff is crucial. In the future, the Bank\n            should agree with the Government on a package of training at\n            the start of the Project and at Mid Term Review."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
