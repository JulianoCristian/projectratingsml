                         The reasonable expectation that the PDO will be achieved continues to be dependent on the progress of construction works on the Tabanovce-Kumanovo Road and the Blace border
                         crossing point, both currently facing slippages. On the trade facilitation activities, the use of the fiber-optic network continues to improve train operating times on the rail network. Also,

                         Customs have intensified trade facilitation efforts that will simplify and expand possibilities for electronic communication with the business community and shorter processing times.
                         Consequently, once the physical infrastructure investments are completed, it is expected that the PDO will be achieved.
