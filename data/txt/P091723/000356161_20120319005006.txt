                            (P091723)

                                Restructuring Paper



    1. The Government, through the Ministry of Finance, has requested an extension of
the closing date for the Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (IBRD Loan
48590-MK), from March 31, 2012 until June 30, 2012. The proposed extension is
necessary to allow additional time for civil works to be completed under one of the
project components.

    2. The project objectives continue to be achievable, with noteworthy results and
positive outcomes already achieved. The Project has been rated Moderately Satisfactory
for the last 12 months for progress towards achieving the Development Objective and for
Implementation Progress. Overall, project implementation is progressing well under all
components, with the exception of the physical investment under Component 2, related to
the modernization of the Blace border crossing for passengers, which is behind the
original schedule. All project funds have been disbursed, the remaining balance in the
Designated Account is EUR 1,065,214.36. Financial management performance is
satisfactory, and there are no overdue audits. Financial covenants have been complied
with.

    3. As of end December 2011, physical progress at the Blace border crossing was at
97 percent. Since then, adverse weather conditions have halted the completion of the
remaining construction. The implementing entities, the Macedonia Customs
Administration (MCA) and the Agency for State Roads (ASR) are confident that the
remaining project activities will be completed in a satisfactory manner, allowing the
project development objective to be fully met within the proposed extended time period.

    4. This will be the second extension of the project. A revised implementation plan
has been agreed with the Macedonia Customs Administration. It is planned that civil
works will now be completed by end April 2012 ahead of the proposed new closing date
in June 2012, allowing sufficient time for completion of all administrative procedures
related to contract completion and for the measurements of border crossing time.
