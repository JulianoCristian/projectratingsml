As of\n            end May 2011, physical progress with the civil works at the\n            Blace border crossing is only at about 34 percent\n            completion. This is attributed to the accumulated delays\n            from the beginning of the construction, and also to the\n            impact of adverse weather conditions, which not only halted\n            the earthworks construction several times, but also required\n            some of the earthworks to be reconstructed. In consultation\n            with the Bank, the customs administration has prioritized a\n            list of key actions that need to be completed to maintain\n            timely progress. With respect to the remaining activities\n            related to the implementation of software packages for the\n            customs administration, the extension will provide\n            additional time to ensure quality of delivery. This will be\n            the first extension of the project. A revised implementation\n            plan has been agreed with the customs administration. It is\n            planned that civil works will now be completed by end\n            December ahead of the proposed new closing date in March 2012."}, "docdt": "2011-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
