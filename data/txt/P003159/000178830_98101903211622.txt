year of independence, and will not exceed 400 by 1970. P exlmwhile total
requirements are estimated to rise from 3,650 in 1966 to 5,600 in 1970 and
1L0,000 in 1980.
iv.       The University of Zambia, the country;s only degree awarding
institution of higher education, opened in 1966 and is rapidly becoming
the main source of high-level m-anpower.  Earolments, now 1,000 students,
will grow to 3,400 in 1973 and 5,000 in the later seventies. In spite of
this rapid increase, the University wili be unable to provide sufficient
graduates to meet the demand by 1980.   Its output of graduates between 1966
and 1980 is estimated at 6,750 or less than 707% or the country's estimated
requirements.  Expansion of the University is limited by the availability
of qualified secondary school leavers.
V.        University enrollment by faculty is closely geared to meeting
specific skilled manpower requirements by profession. Fields of study,
identified as priority areas, are the sciences, including engineering,
medicine and agriculture, and the training of secondary school teachers.
vi.       The proposed project would essist the School of Engineering and the
School of Education to reach the 1973 enrollment targets, thus filling two of
the most important gaps in Zambia's supply of high-level manpower. The School
of Engineering, with about 360 students in 1973, will produce 80 engineers



- ii -
annually. The School of Education, with a full-time student equivalent j of
670 in 1973, will train secondarv school teachers and nrimrarv and secondarv
school principals. In addition, the proposed project would finance the
onnnstruitinn of quffienint hnstsls to  e,e'nmmndate the innrPased number nf
students in these two schools.
vii.      The project is urgently needed to allow the University to develop
according to its plan, and should be completed in 197. TPn mAt this
target date, the University will start preparatory work, including archi-
tects' design, before a Bank loan isobtain       The gornment hopes that re-

APPFUISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN ZAMBIA
I. Introduction
1.01      In February/March 1968 a Unesco project preparation mission assisted
the government to prepare an education project which was appraised by a Bank
mission in April/M.y. 1968. This i'iroAect included extensions to the University
of Zambia at Lusaka. The Universij;y item was found difficult to evaluate due
to the absence of a sufficiently d3!tailed development plan for the University
as a whole. It was then agreed that suLch a plan vould be prepared to permit
completion of the apnraisal.  In view cif the considerable delay foreseen in the
preparation of this scheme, the government requested that the University ex-
tenniona should be deferred in order to avoid deltving the malor part of the
project. This part constituted the basis of a Bank loan of $17.4 million (N4o.
592-ZA) which was i4gneA April 11- 1Q69C
1.09      In FebruaTy, 1;-96 the governme_nt made a nev request for BAAnk

II. Higher Education in Zambia
2.01     hle Unver*ity OI Zambia, tue couUnry's only degree MWMrding
institution, came into being on November 12, 1965 with an Act of Parliament
whieh vested ultimate respousibility for the University ini a rrovisional
Council. In its first academic year (1966), the University enrolled 312
students. Since then student numbers have risen rapidly:  536 in 1967,
706 in 1968 and 1,010 in 1969.
2.02      From the start, it was decidted that the University should cover as
many fields as feasible. After only two years of existence, the University
had already established eight schools and two departments, the latter fcir
extra-mural and correspondence studies. As a result, enrollments in many of
the schools, as shown below, are stil]L very low with low student-staff ratios

and high costs. While a student-staff ratio of 6:1 may not be exceptional
for a University which is recently established, a more normal ratio of 10:1
or higher should be attained in the near future.

2.03      The present high costs of the University, resulting from unfavor-
able student-staff ratios and w-der-.atilization of nv faciliti4e, is a
temporary characteristic of a new and rapidly growing institution.    Univer-

seventies.
2.04      Admission to the University requires appropriate credits in the
CLambridge Universiby School Certificate EXamination (or its equivalent).   T_he
main factor limiting the University's enrollment growth so far has been the
small numbers of students leaving secondary schools with this qualification.
Secondary education is expanding rapidly, howvever, and should produce a five-
fold increase in output within the next decad'3. Expanding University enroll-
ments to 5,000 students can therefore be considered as a realistic objective
to be attained towards the end of the seventies. Meanwhile, an intermediate
target of :3,400 students has been set for 1973 and present investment plans
aim at providing facilities ror this number.
2.05      Expansion ulans by faculty are closely geared to meeting the
country's specific manpower requirements.   Government applies a quota system
governing the number of first-year students entering each of the faculties
by the award of bursarieo which are offered, not for admission to the Uni-
versity in general, but for admission to defined areas of study. Highest
priority is being given to the sciences, including agriculture, medicine and
engineering and to education.



-3-
2.06      The University started operations in temporary accommodation in
1966 but in the sgme year construetion beggan of a new -ivniersity campus some
five miles from the center of Lusaka. In March, 1968 the University occupied
its firdt five maJor buildings on this new c&zplue.  in-M.stments .n prl'rcpal
buildings completed or currently under construction amount to K 8.2 million
(!g1I5 millon1irw   Add-tionial- facilitiesor e  ---   g and educat"on and
new student hostels are urgently needed by Ma ch, 1972.
2.07      To assure that the initial beneficial results of improved planning
will not be lost in subsequent yer-s,   omprehensi-ve plning o. further
university development should be a permanent part of the University's adnin-
istration.  So far, the Uf4ivers4+-y haa been unable to recrui  a quaalised.
development officer.   During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
8deqllate pla-ning procedres w411 be established and  a qualified plamning
officer will be appointed by the University.
2.08      Other institutions of post-secondary education are:
(a) the Northern Technical College, responsible for a variety
of technical courses at' d   rent levels, including the
training of industrial technicians;
(b) two 1[igher Teacher Training Colleges in Kabwe and Kitwe,
providing t-wo-year co-arres to train teachers for the
junior cycle of secondary schools; and
(c) the Nlatural Resources Development College in Lusaka, provid-
ing post-secondary courses in agriculture.
III. Cost and Financing
University F?inancinK
3.01      About 87% or tne annual recurrent budget of the University is
covered by a grant from the central government education budget; for 1969
this amounts to K 2.7 million or 7.4% of the total recurrent education
budget of the government. Another 12% of University revenue comes from
tuition and boarding fees paid by students; indirectly these fees are also
paid by the government through its scholarship system. Tuition fees for
Zambian students amount to K 120 annually; boarding fees to K 180. The
amount of government; expenditure on education and its proportion in the
total budget are shown in Annex 2. Expenditures by level of education,
including those spent on the University, are given in Annex 3.
3.02      The University's request for government financing is submitted on
a triennial basis sad scrutinized by the University Grants Committee com-
posed of outside University experts and representatives of the Ministrie,3
of Finance and Education.   The Committee's recom endations have led to a



- 4-
substantial reduction in the University's budget for 1969 as compared with
the University's original submission; the budgets for the years 1970 to
1972 are now under study.
Recurrent Expenditure
3.03      Total recurrent expenditure of the University amounted to K 2.4
million in 1968; the budget for 1969 amounts to K 3.1 million - an inereaaee
of 28% as compared with an increase of 40% in student enrollments. Overall
recurrent costs per student, conseauently, decreased from K 3,400 in 1968
to K 3,125 in 1969. Excluding boarding expenses, research, extra-mural work
and library expenditure, the remaining C8t8 pner student remained virtually
constant at K 2,100 per student for both years. A summary of University
expenditure is given in Annex 4.
3.04      Recurrent costs per student vill nrobabLy cont4inue to decreae as
student:staff ratios and utilization of physical facilities improve. The
total cost of the Universitvy hovever, will rise sharply as a resUlt of the
rapid increase in student numbers; consequently, the direct government grant
to the University will probablv rise from K 2.7 million in 1069 +to K 7.3
million, or 11% of the total education budget, in 1974 (Annex 3). This
amount is within the finan ial ennasaelty of the fvvernment; the percentage
is within the limits of what is a normal budget allocation for higher edu-
cation.
Capital Expenditure
3.05      Prior to 1967 the government undertook to   et 50% of the capital
costs of the University; the balance was financed from different sources,
including a U.K. grant of . 1 million annd iortgage. loans. In 1967 the
government agreed to contribute 100% of f.ture construction costs and allo-
cated K 16 mi-llion to the UniverS4+y for  ke pa         1966-197v.  Between
July 1, 1966 and December 31, 1968 nearly K 6.9 million of this amount was
spent. Th^e to+-- 1  -o=t Of ca:pits'41 expend"it=ur on tone 'UMLver-sity is shown
in Annex 5. At the end of 1968, allocations to the University were reduced
drastically as a result of budgetary constraints and growing awareness of
the need to reduce University investments to the minimUm requirements.  For
!or, on-ly K 31.45 nd11:0Do ia -33ocated.
3.06      Ap-art from the completion of present construction work, the only
major investment projects envisaged for the near future, are extensions to
the Schools of Engineering and Ed-ucation, where the need for additional fa-
cilities is clearly indicated, and the construction of additional student
hoste'l and staff housing.  It is the government's intention to postpone
further major investments until present accommodation is more fully utilized.
In the early seventies, however, new investments will be needed for the
Schools of Medicine and Agriculture.

4.01      Higher education in Zambia - still in the early stages of develop-
ment - is unable to maeet the rising demand for professional, administrati-ve
and managerial personnel with appropriate degree level education.  At
independence in 1964 only 100 Zambians had obtained a University degree; this
number had risen to .150 in 1966. Of a total number of 3,650 posts occupied
by degree holders in Zambia in that year, 3,500 posts or 96% were held by non-
Africans (Annex 6).
4.02      The situation has changed somewhat in the last few years. Many
high-level political positions have been "Zambianized" but a majority of
the high-level professional and administrative posts, both in the public and
private sector, are still held by expatriate staff, often at high cost to
the economy and with discontinuity of tenure. The government acknowledges
that "Zambianization" of all middle and. high-level positions will take
considerable time, extending well beyond 1980.
4.03      Crucial shortages of qualified manpower exist in nearly every sector
in the economy. Private enterprise experiences serious difficulties in re-
cruiting personnel with secondary or hi.gher education since most school leavers
seek employment in the public sector. Efficiency and productivity in industry
and commerce are low and further growth. is restricted by a lack of new staff
and by the low level of education of those who are already recruited. The
public sector, after filling 838 existing civil service vacancies with newly
recruited expatriates in January 1968 -- most of them in the professional, ad-
ministrative and executive ranks - still had 4,600 unfilled posts in May, 1968.
For 2,100 of these posts, a secondary education or equivalent is required and
for 425 posts, a University degree. Nearly all teachers at secondary and
post-secondary level are expatriates.
Projections of Manpower Requirements
4.04      Government proJections of high-level manpower requirements to 1980,
drawn up this year in the Office of National Development and Planning indi-
cate a total need for degree level personnel of 12,545 graduates, of whOm
1,800 should be engineers and 3,800 teachers.
4.05      These projections are based on somewhat optimistic economic growth
expectations and perhaps overestimate the labor market's future effective
demand for high-level manpower. More cautious assumptions would reduce the
demand proJections to about 10,000 graduates by 1980 of whom 1,500 should. be
engineers and nearly 3,000 teachers; (another 2,300 secondary school teachers
should be trained at dinloma level in the countrv's two higher teacher train-
ing colleges). These reduced manpower projections have been used for evelu-
ating the nronosed parolect.

from about 150 in 1970 to over 1,000 in 1980. The total output of Zambian

ably below the estimated demand and expatriates will be required to fill
considerable n-umbers oV high-level pusitions wel beyond 1980.     A more rapid
expansion of the University is not feasible in view of the limited supply of
qualified entrants.   mThe aggregate teacher demand aud supply is well balanced
but science teachers will remain in short supply until 1980; the supply of
engineers is far below the estimated deMand. Adjustment of the university
courses to increase enrollments in science and engineering at the expense of
non-science enrollments is not yet possible due to the limited number of
science students graduating from secondary schools. Partly due to the out-
put of students from schools assisted by the first MRRD education project,
these imbalances will be corrected after 1975 so that a more balanced supply
of Unilrersity graduates can be attained in the early eighties.
V. The Project
A.   Technical Features
General
5.01      The proposed project consists of the following e,4tensions or addi-
tions to the University of Zambia:
(a)  extension and equipping of the School of Engineering,
(b)  extension and equipping of the School of Education,
(c)  construction and furnishing of student hostels for
960 students, including eight staff houses for wardens
and caretakers.
School of Engineering
5.02      The undergraduate course in engineeriniz extends over five years;
studerts spend the first year in the School of Natural Sciences and the re-
maining four years in the School of Engineering; vhich provides courses in

civil, mechanical, electrical and mining engineering. The ultimate en-
rol' A enlt target is- 680%V        ULAWOzt  in ~ these fo;e ,s b;t-4ne it
target of 360 students has been set for 1975.   This would require an an-

enrc 'LLJ1LInt 'l.La engineering jVoUm  7 sUUdUeLn sU in   UV6 to LL L"UCXuiUj.aLt
target of 360 in 1975.
5.03      Enrollments in each of the four departments (civil, mechanical,
electrical aud Wining engineering) -will be adjusted. to manpower requirements
as student numbers increase.   Great flexibility in enrollment by department
will. be requi.red.  Curricula and accommodation schedules have, consequently,
been designed in such a way that enrollment patterns can be changed when
necessary. Courses are general rather than highly specialized. Following
some years of industr.ial experience, students would be encouraged to return
for more specialized craining leading to a higner degree.
5.04      The curricula would seem to have been prepared for design engineers
rather than engineers concerned more directly with production and maintenance
for wnich there is likely to be a major demand.   hne appraisal mission has
been informed that thLs is not the intention.   However, the curricula, as
well as the detailed syllabuses, should give direct expression to the indus-
trial aspects of engineering. An assurance to that effect was obtained
during negotiations.
5.05      To assure adjustment of the courses and numbers of students to
the needs of the economy, a standing advisory committee has been estab-
lished, representative of the academic, government and private interests
concerned.
5.o6      Except for £1 large workshop and some ancillary spaces, the Schoo]-
of Engineering has no facilities at pres,ent. The proposed project would
provide two lecture rooms, 10 laboratories, 8 seminar rooms and 33 staff
offices..
5.07      In addition to the staff of nine lecturers now in service, con-
tracts have been offered to seven staff mnembers.  Recruitment takes place
through contacts with overseas universities in a variety of countries; these
have led, so far, to En adequate supply of qualified teaching staff. The
total number of full-time academic staff is expected to increase to 33 by
1973.
School of Education
5.08      The School of Education, organ:Lzed in four divisions (Department
of Education, Science Education Center, Library Studies and Institute of
Education) offers a variety of courses, of which the 4-year undergraduate
course to train secondLary school teachers is the most important.  The
1973 enrollmernt target for this course is 900 students, who will take
three of their four courses in either Humanities or Natural Sciences and
one in Education.   In addition the School is organizing courses leading to

5.10      The present academic staff of the School of Education consists of
26 members from nine different countries. Part of the staff is provided under
a U.N. tlechU.LUC.L '6MM.LbU.W.U &b.LUJiIt CUML-oug ULLWOUVo. SWI s,taf..L
members, however, are recruited with the assistance of the Inter-University
Council foLr aigher Education Overseas in London.  SmaLler numfbers are re-
cruited from other European countries, Australia, New Zealand and India.
It is expected that the total academic staff vill increase to 0o 'Dy -y-ue- or
1973. No major difficulties are foreseen in recruitment.
Student Hostels and Staff Eousing
5.11      In the government's request, the proposed Bank financing of students'
hostelF accounted for about 52% of the total project costs.   Partly because
of this high ratio, the Bank has subjected the request to a close scrutiny,
to assure that only the essential requirements would be included i± the proj-
ect and met at lowest possible cost. The Bank has come to the conclusion
that the student hostels are justified for the following reasons: at present
nearly 83% of the students enrolled in the University are residential students.
Students are ,dmitted from all parts of the country and a relatively small
minority (less than 15%) originates from Lusaka. The city has very little
private residential accommodation available to meet studentu' needs. The
University will, therefore, have to provide on-campus accommodation for the
great majority of its stuxdents. This is necessary for full utilization of
the University's academic facilities, including those provided under the
proposed project, and to reduce the ratio of student failures. Adequate
hostel accommodation, with better supervision and guidance of students during
their private studies, would result in better student performance and, con-
sequently, a lower cost per graduate. Further advantages of adequate hostel
accommodation are greater student participation in extra-curricular activi-
ties and better health.

boarding places by 1973 to assure the effective use of its teaching space,
in addition to 1,4 places wu±un no-w exist. or a.re unde~r cvIIsbr-uc,.±on.
To overcome this backlog in residential. accommodation, the University's
irnvestment progrU fOr the coming year3 -UrUt inelude .u exceptionally
high level of allocations for boarding facilities. ".his need for redress-
ing a temporary imbalance is reflected in uthe proposed proJect.
5.13      Tne boarding places which are! included in the Bank project would
meet the needs of the Schools of Engineering and Education alone. It is
expected tha.t enroliments in the Engineering School will rise to 360 stu-
dents by the mid-seventies. Excluding short "in-service" courses, enroll-
ments in the School of Education should increase to 1,180 students by that
time. Enrollments in the two schools irill thus be 1,540 by the mid-seventies,
representing; an increase of about 1,20(i over the present enrolLment of
about 350. Assuming that 80% of the additional students will be boarders,
there will be need for residential accommodation for 960 of the additional
students. It is recommended that the proposed project should include such
provision. To meet the needs of other schools of the University, the
University administration plans to construct 480 additional boarding
places in 1972.
5.14      To reduce the high costs of boarding accommodation, the University
has agreed to reduce the space standards to an austere minimum. There will
be four hostels, each housing 240 students with two students in each room
of 130 square feet, as compared with 165 square feet in the University's
existing residences; minimum acceptable allowances will be made for circu-
lation space and walls. The size of common rooms for 240 students will be
reduced to 1,200 square feet as compared with 1,600 square feet in the
existing buildings.
5.15      Staff housing included in the project will be limited to accom-
modation for a warden and a caretaker :Ln each of the four student hostels.
B.   Cost of the Project
5.16      The estimaLted total cost of the proposed project is K 5.3 million
or US$7.4 million equivalent; the estimated foreign exchange component is
K 3.8 million or US$5.3 million represienting 72% of the total cost. The
costs by type of educational facility are analyzed in Annex 7 and summarized
below:

5.18      These unit costs compare favorably with similar projects in other
countries. Building costs in Zambia, already high at present due to the high
costs of imported materials and expatriate labor. are expected to rise by
as much as 30% in the next three years. The main cause of this steep in-
crease in costs is the re-routing of shipments owing to present difficulties
with Rhodesia. Until recently, most building materials were imported from
South Africa via Dar es Salaam. RecentLy the Government of Tanzania pro-
hibited the entrance of all goods originating from South Africa and as a
result it is likely that most of these 7iaterials will in the future be nro-
cured in Western Europe at much higher post. It is expected that building
nrices vill rise bv nearlv 20% in the e'mina 12 months and will nontinue tn
rise at an annual rate of 5% between 1970 and 1972.

to the B-nk.
5.23      Master Plan.  While the University has a development scheme,
it does not include long term proposals for the comprehensive development,
of its campus.  For future guidance of its further development, the Uni-
versity should now prepare a master plan of the campus. The first phase
of this plan which includes the major elements of the development of the
campus during the next ten years, (zoning and land-use, circulation patterns
and the locaLtion of future buildings) has already been completed and is
acceptable to the Bank. A more detailed plan of the University's future
buildings -  up to the stEge at which the University attains its enrollment
target of 5,,000 students --- should be prepared concurrently with the imple-
mentation of the proposed project, but this work should be completed not
later than 2 years after the date of the proposed Loan Agreement. This
plan should specify the requirements for, and proposed utilization of, space
and accommoclation, and should indicate the general areas and locations of
the required buildivngs and other facilLties.  Upon completion, this Plan
should be provided to the Bank for its comments. Assurances regarding the
preparation of a master plan of the caapus, as described above, were obtained
during the negotiations.
5.24      Architectural Services.  To carry out the design and technical
control of the project, the University is engaging the services of archi--
tectural consulting firms, which are acceptable to the Bank. These con-
sulting firmis would provide the architectural, engineering and technical
services for the design of all project items and be responsible for super-
vision of construction and for certification of contractors' bills. The
consulting firms should be required to follow the patterns of the approved
first phase of the tMaster Plan and to study the cost effectiveness of thfe
use of standardization of basic building components, pre-fabrication of
parts and modular coordination.
5.25      All contracts for construction amounting to $140000 or more and
for procuremient of ilurniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of

international competitive bidding. Although it is unlikely that any of the
civ4  works ^          ill be below this lmit+, 4+ 4i  e        +ha+ all
will be awarded to local firms.
5.26     Maintenance.  Assurances have been obtained during negotiations

leaves little time for preparation and construction. For this reason, the
University started preparatory work, including t-he emploVyAment of archLiects
and the design of the buildings in early October, 1969. It is recommended
th-atu . the costs OI^ this prepa-ratory work amovuting to approximately +50 ,000
be reimbursed under the proposed Bank loan. Construction work and equip-
ment procurement will not begin until a loan agreement with the BanK has
been signed.
5.28      Disbursements,   Disbursements would be spread over four years
(A4nex 8). Th-e proposed IBRD loan of US$5.3 milliori would finaince:
(a) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of instructional
equipment and furniture, estimated at US$985,000;
(b)  67.5% of the remaining costs of the project consisting
of construction and architectural and other professional
services. This latter percentage represents the esti-
mated foreign exchange component of the expenditure in
these categories.
Undisbursed amounts would be subject to cancellation. Should expenditure
exceed the estimated project cost of USB$.4 million, the excess would be met
by the Zaxibian Government.
VI. Recommendations
6.01      To ensure the successful implementation of the project, government
assurances were obtained during negotiations that adequate planning proce-
dures would be established in the University (including the appointment of a
planniAg offizer) and that a master plan for the development of the Univer-
sity campus would be prepared. The curricula and syllabuses of the School
of Engineering would be revised. Adequate provisions for the maintenance
of buildings and maintepanqe and replacement of equipment wrould be made.
6.02      A condition for effectiveness of the proposed loan would be the
establishment in'the University of a project unit, consisting of a project

I - SOCITL AID ECOIOUIC BACKGROUND
1 0i    The Republic of Zambia occupies a land-locked territory of
about 290,000 square miles Qn a plateau in the southern half of Africa.
Population and economic activity are concentrated along the only railway
line which runs from Rhodesia via Livingstone in the south through
Lusaka in the center to the Copperbelt, centered around Kitwe and Ndola,
in the north. M4ost of the main towns are situated along this line of
rail. The industrial center of the country is at present the copper
mining region in the north but a new industrial township is being
constructed near Kafue.
1.02     The population in 1968 is estimated at 4.1 million.  Approxi-
mately 55S of the African population is below 20 years of age.  About
25% is living in urban centers. The rural population is extremely
scattered, living mainly in very small groups. The labor force was
about 833,000 in 1966 of which about 500,000 was in the rural subsist-
ence sector.
1.03     Copper mining is the mainstay of the Zambian economy, accounting
for about 485 of total GDP, over 90% of total export earnings and nearly
70% of' government revenue. Development of other sectors, particularly
the rural economy, is urgently needed to reduce Zambia's economic vulner-
ability and expand employment opportunities for a rapidly rising supply
of labor.

for the introduction of modern statistical methods and for integration
between ministries.  The Planning Unit is, however, under-staffed; it
has not begun to function effectively and needs strengthening. The
Inspectorate needs broader expertise in pre-vocational education. A
specialist in agricultural education has been appointed recently; there
will be need for specialists in technical secondary education. During
negotiations assurances have been obtained that these two units will be
expanded.  The National Council of Eclucation would be more effective if
representatives of the private sector were added.
2.04      There are nine administrative regions, each with a Chief Educa-
tion Officer and his staff of education officers, who are responsible
for general supervision of policy implementation. Training of the
regional staff is urgently needed; assurances to that effect have been
obtained during negotiations.

of 4 yearis and an upper cycle of 3 years< (Annex lb). Enrollment has more

than doubled from 279,780 pupils in 1960 to 598,198 pupils in 1968 or
about 84% of the 7-13 years age group (Annexes ic and id).Government
projections show enrollment growing to 857,300 in 1975 and 974L,900 in
1980. This latter figure approximates to universal primary education
(Annex le). Of the 10,655 primary school teachers in service in 1967,
92% are qualified. Many of these latter, however, had only one year of
training after two years of secondary education and require further
training (pa.a. 2.:14).
Secondary Educatiorn
2.06     The secondary course comprises a 2-year junior section, leading
to the junior secondary school leaving examination and a 3-year senior
section which prepares for the Cambridge University Overseas School
Certificate examinations eiving access to the University of Zambia and
other institutions of post-secondary education.
2.07     Present policy is to admit one-third of primary school leavers
to secondarv education (which is high in compariqon with other Afrinan coun-
tries and to maintain a progression rate from junior into senior cycle
of secondarv educiation of two-thirds of the pupinls  Tn 19'8P_ the resnec-

structure, in which a 2-year junior cycle is followed by a 3-year senior
c-ycl.e (2:3 structure), i.nto a 3:2 structure and to reduc-e the progression
rate mid-way from two-thirds to one half.   This will lead to an output of
.ore mature and better educated young people at the end of the junior
cycle and to a supply of manpower more in line with the projected require-
ments at both Jrni'or. an. senior level as s    in pra.   . 07.

2 .0"9   Jrollmer-tu in general secondary schools ha-ve increased sharply:
from 2,543 in 1960 to 38,997 in 1968 (Annex ld). If the government should
continue 'Lts present amis sion- policy, total enrollment would rise to
nearly 90,000 pupils in 197h and nearly 1O0,000 in 1980. Given the limi-
tation of tne administrative capacity to provIde new places and tLhe
constrain-ts of finance and teacher supply, it is unlikely that these
increases wiii be realized.  Tne output of secondary scnooi graduates,
moreover, would ecceed estimated manpower requirements.
2.10    rThe government would be well advised to reduce the admission
rate to about 30% along with the reduction of mid-way progression to 50%.
Enrollment would then reach about 80,000 pupils in 1974.   Provided the

2.13     Enrollments in the nine colleges are 2072 students.   The teacher-
pupil ratio of 1:15 is to be increased to 1:20 as soon as possible.   Seventy
eight of 141 teacher trainers are Zambians.
2.14     Existing capacity is sufficient to meet requirements for additional
primary school teachers.   There is, however, an urgent neec to retrain tne
majority of the teachers now in serviceb and the Ministry has decided to
extend tvio existing colleges for thi-s purpose-
2.15     Secondary teacher training is provided at the Higher Teacher
Training College in Kabwe and the School of Education of the University of
Zambla.  A seconcd Higher Teacher Training College in Kitwe will start oper-
ating soon. Stucdents are admitted after having completed secondary educa-
tion.  The 3-year diploma courses, started at Kabwe in 1967 for teachers
in junior secondary classes, and to start in Kitwe in the near future, wil'l
be reduced to 2 years in 1969 to meeat the urgent need for teachers.  The
colleges will also train teachers of home economics, commerce, industrial
arts and agricult;ure for both the junior and senior classes.
Present ienrollment at Kabwe is 124 'but will increase to 750 in both colleges
with an annual output of 325 teachers from 1974.
2.16     The School of Education of the University of Zambia provides teacher
training courses for students enrolled in Humanities and Natural Sciences.
The first group of 40 teachers will leave the University in 1971.
2.17     The combined efforts of the two colleges and the University of Zambia
should be able to meet the total demand for secondary school teachers by
1979, including the replacement of foreign teachers, if expanded as p'lanned
(para. 4.13).  For a number of years to come, however, secondary education
will rely on foreign teachers (Annex J-).
2.18     During 1968-1971 650 more foreign teachers will be needed than are
now in service. The main source of' supply has been the United Kingdom but
the Ministry of Overseas Development has indicated that financial linitations
would not allow further growth.   The Zambian government is launching a recruit

the office oI Tne Vice--Fresident,an(d tne proposal to establish National
Advisory Councils at technician and craft levels.
2.20     At the pre-vocational level, the David Kaunda Secondary Techn-
ical School (under the Ministry of Education) offers four-year courses
preparing for apprenticeship in the engineering and building industries
or for adimission to full-time diploma and degree courses at the Northern
Technical College and the University of Zambia, respectively. The school?
the only one of -Lts kind in Zambia, has an intake of 120 pupils per ye:ar.
2.21     Full-tirae courses in brickworlc and carpentry are given in govern-
ment Trade Schoois at Livingstone, Lukashya, and M4ukobeko.  Entry is re-
stricted to trainees who are sponsored by industrial firms with whom they
spend three montlhs before entering upon the one-year trade school course.
Selected trainees may return for an advanced course after completion of a
minimum of one year in industry. A UJNDP/ILO project presently has under concAd
eration a revision of apprenticeship arrangements and the construction of 1-?-
new vocational training centres,raising the output from the existing Itotal
of 272 to approximately 2,00C per year.   The centres will also train
selected craftsmen for supervisory posts.
2.92     Training at technician level is carried out at; the Evelyn Hone
College of Further Education (Lusaka) and the Northern Technical College
(Ndola).  The latter is concerned mainly with the engineering and bui'Lding
industries but is associated with "feeder" institutions at Kitwe and
Luanshya where commercial and general education courses are offered
(Annex lh). At Ndola a majority of the students are already in employment
as apprentices or learners and are released by employers to attend fuLl-
time courses of six week's duration three times a year. Recently,full-
time courses of two years' duration have been introduced at certificate
technician level together with more advanced courses of four years' dura-
tion at diploma technician level. The demand for these full-time courses
is expected to increase with the economic development of the country and
some of the craft training will eventually be transferred to other centres
(Annex lh). At present the intake of new students is of the order of 250
to 300 per vear! enrollment in 1967' was 636 full-time and 93L part-time
students.  A feature of the work of the College is its close co-operation
with industryr in the conduct of block-release and full-time courses.

i.on; the i-nstitutes also train fcarmers. Twelve Farmer Training Centers
give short courses to farmers and farmers' wives. Twelve other centers
are under construction.
24.26     The University has established a School of Agriculture which
has neither sufficient staff nor accommodation. Seven students were
enrolled this year to the School of Nlatural Sciences but it seems likely
that they will be sent abroad for further study.
2.27      Government plans for a rapid development of the agricultural
sector would indicate that agricultural education and training should be
expanded. The need for such expansion is not yet fully reflected in
educationaLl planning and in the proposed project, except for the intro-
duction of' pre-vocational agricultural courses in secondary schools. An
assessment of existing agricultural training facilities and of the need.
for further expansion at all levels will be undertaken. Identified needs
for further investment in agricultural training institutions could form
part of a second education project in the near future.

III - COST AND FINANCING OF EDUCATION
3.01      Finance for education is centralized in the budget of the central
government.  The role played by private schools is negligible.  Mission
schools, which are grant-aided for 100%' of recurrent and 7M  of capitaL
costs, are considered part of the public sector.

3.02      Income from school fees is very low; for primary and secondary
scnuloo  lb is esu±imaueu ab A 3,0.0UUU, or unly ,'of 0 gUVt:.U-.UILJ1i met
on primary and secondary education. Tuition fees of K 36 p.a. and boarding
fees of K 162 p.a. are only charged in. the small group of ex-federal
schools, known as "scheduled" schools. No fees are charged in the majority
group of "unscheduled" primary and secondary schools, the trade schools and
secondary technical school (except for some small boarding fees in primary
schools). Education is also free at tne teacher training colieges; lir
addition, students receive pocket money and travel allowances.
3.03      The Northern Technical College and Evelyn Hone College of Furt,her
Education are financed through a government grant to the Boards of Gover-
nors and, to a small extent, through income from fees and donations.  The
University of Zambia is financed through a triennial government grant,
which in 1968 covered nearly 909% of all recurrent expenditure; the rest
is covered by tuition fees of K 120 p.a. and boarding fees of K 180 p.a.
(which are indirectly financed through government bursaries to students)
and other income.
3.04      Recurrent expenditure on education by other Ministries is only
K 2.4 million or slightly over 7%9 of the recurrent expenditures by the
linistry of Education (Annex 1i). Regional and local authorities expendi-
ture on education is negligible; local communities assist in the construc-
tion of primary school buildings but even here the major part of the costs
is borne by the central government.
30o5      The contribution of private industry is important, although the
exact amount is unknown. Participaticon comes in many forms, such as
vocational training directly organized. and financed by industry (partic-
ularly the mining industry), the sponsoring of students in public schools,
scholarships and donations. The total financial contribution of the
mining industry is estimated at K 6 million in 1968.
3.O6      In aggregate it is estimated that in 1968 K 61.5 million or some
6,2;9 of GDF wTas spent on education (Annex 1i):

ANNEX 1
Page 'o
a University degree or a post-secondary diploma; even thos_ who have
finished secondary education constitute only 0.2p of the African labor
force. In 1966, of 56,150 positions requiring 2 years of secondary
education or more, only 17%o were filled by qualified Africans.  That
most middle and high level positions are filled by non-Africans is
shown at Annex 1j.
4.02     Crucial shortages of qualified manpower exist in nearly every
sector of the economy. Private enterprise experiences serious difficul.-
ties in recruiting trainable personnel with secondary or higher educa-
tion since most school leavers are directed into the public sector. Ef-
ficiency and productivity in industrv and commerce are low and further
growth is inhibited by this lack of staff and by the low level of educa-
tion of those who are available.  The public sector, after filling 838
existing civil service vacancies with newly recruited expatriates in
January 1968 - most of them in the professional. achinistrative and
executive ranks - still had 4,600 unfilled posts in May, 1968. For 2100
of these nosts. a completed secondarv education or eouivalent is required
and for 425 posts, a University degree. Nearly all teachers at secondary
and prt-seconnn8r  level are e3mqtrit;es.

of the huunan resource development problem in the near future.  In the
Tohg run 1,his problem might become more important than the se-vere short;age
of qualified manpower at present.

Plan, 1966-1970. Pianpower proJectisuu  shovuld therefore llaKe provision Jor
a gradual up-grading of the rural working population. The primary and
secondary school system should adjust its orientation and offer better
preparation for rural employment by teaching practical subjects, particu-
larly agricultural science and indutrial arts.  Agreement has been reached
with Government that steps to that effect would be taken.
4.05     In the modern sector, the demand for educated Zambians depends
mainly upon (i) the rate of replacement of foreign personnel and (ii)
the growth of total employment as a result of economic expansion. Govern-
ment pressure to speed up the process of Zambianisation is strong and
non-Zainbians are being replaced at a faster rate than the supply of
qualified Zambian manpower permits.  Positions are frequently filled with






AMNEX 1
Page 9
personnel of inadequate education or experience and there is a danger tlIat
such unqualified inicumbents will block the way for more highly qualified
Zambians as these become available. To avoid long-lasting damage to labor
producctivity, the output of the education and training system should be
increased -without delay.
4.06     The growth of total employment in the modern sector of the economy
has 'been considerable, Between 1964 and 1966, total employment rose from
268,700 to 332,900 or by 24%, mainly in manufacturing, construction, trans-
port and communications (Annex 1 k). The rate of expansion has probably
decreased recently and present conditions, including uncertainty as to the
future price of comper. on which the greater part of the economy depends,
make it difficult to estimate future employment.  It is believed that the
rate of exnansion is less than oriagnallv foreseen in the official manpower
projections, the presently estimated annual growth being 8% for the period
1965-1970 compared with original expectations of T1%. For the nurmoses
of this appraisal, the 1966 government manpower forecasts have therefore
been reduced correvsnondinolv.

by a levelling off in the rate of expansion beyond 1974 (Annex lf). For
reasons given in paras. h.o0 and [O.Q  above. this ranid increase over
the next few years should be preferred to a more even growth path.
4.10     At this rate of growth, the total output to the labor market of
students lev-ing schoollat +hei entd of t.he. iuinior cycl  or droping out
half way through the senior cycle dur.ing the period 1966-1980 would be about
105,300.  Th>.e outpu!t of s.tudents wit completed cannndanleducatiLon in
the same period would be 78,000.  These output estimates are roughly in

the introdulction of such courses was reached with the Government (para. 5.0'6).
4.12     In the field of primary teacher training no new investments in
regular pre-service courses are necessary  but provision should be made
for in-ser-vice courses to up-grade the majority of teachers now in post.,
4.13     As detailed in paras. 2.17-2.18 and 4.07, there is a considerable
shortage of secondary school teachers. The training of secondary scnooiL
teachers, both at the Higher Teacher Training Colleges at Kabwe and Kitwqe and
at the School of Education of' the University of Zambia should therefore be
greatly expanded to provide the number of teachers required for expansion
of secondary education and to replace expatriates now in service before 1900.
4.14     Of high economic priority is the training of technicians and engi-
neers, which has only recently started. Estimated requirements of tech--
nicians are specified in para. 4.07. The Northern Technical College
program to train engineering technicians at certificate and diploma level
will assure an annual output of some 210 technicians, which is still below
the country's requirements.

Note.--  It is very difficuilt to estimate the "output" of the Northern Technical
College, a majority of whose students will be industry-based and may leave at
any point in a course of from one -to four years duration.      Moreover, a course
may commence with a craft bias and terminate at the technician level.         In the
following approxima-tion it has been assumed that, for most courses, students who
leave at a "half-way"' stage can be included in the craft output.
