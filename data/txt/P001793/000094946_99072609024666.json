These lessons are offered:\n            Projects should be designed with a simple institutional\n            organization and few components. A complex multi-component\n            project implemented through many agencies risks spreading\n            responsibilities, diluting \"ownership\" of the\n            project among agencies, and making project coordination very\n            difficult. When the macroeconomic and political conditions\n            in which a project was appraised changes profoundly during\n            project execution, a radical project redesign/re-appraisal\n            may be required proactively as soon as it is clear that the\n            changes are permanent. Rather than requiring compliance with\n            rate of return or other complex financial covenants\n            difficult to monitor and sometimes unfamiliar to the\n            incumbent entity, it is preferable to require compliance\n            with simpler and less ambitious indicators, easy to monitor\n            but necessary to achieve basic financial survival of the\n            incumbent entity. By implementing natural resource\n            management including cash generating activities to the\n            community, villagers get incentives to protect natural\n            resources and use resources in a cost-effective and\n            sustainable manner. With timely and flexible intervention,\n            it is possible to achieve some measure of success, even if\n            initially the project had been poorly designed and managed."}, "docdt": "1999-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
