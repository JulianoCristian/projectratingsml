      Ref.:  Urban Household Energy Credit (Cr. 2033-MOZ)
      The Household Energy Credit was signed in September 1989 but
funds for the principal component, relating to EDM, have not been
released because EDM has been unable to comply with two of the
disbursement conditions relating respectively to preparation of a
plan for financial viability, and to adoption of a plan for recovery
of accounts receivable.
      In recent months Government and EDM's have made substantial
progress towards meeting these conditions.  The January tariff
adjustments for EDM and the adoption of an automatic price
adjustment mechanism should enable EDM to break even in the current
fiscal year. Also EDM has implemented many aspects of a plan for
financial viability through various measures to cut  costs and
improve cash collection.  On the second issue, accounts receivable,
EDM has a plan of action under implementation for a majority of
customers in arrears, but action is still required from Government
on the non-payment by a number of Government departments where
because of the hardships that might be caused a 'cut off' policy
cannot be used as a last resort.
      So as to enable EDM to start the project implementation and to
use consultancy work already completed we would like to help by
releasing a part of the Credit funds. Accordingly we suggest
breaking Category 1(a) of Schedule 1 to the Credit Agreement into
two phases so that 20% of the funds are available immediately, and
the remaining 80% remain subject to the conditions of disbursement.
This will have the effect of giving an extra year for the
disbursement conditions to be met, and I trust that by that time
Government will have taken the necessary decisions.
      If this proposal meets your approval please sign both copies
of the enclosed revised Schedule 1 and return one copy to us.
Sincerely,
Stephen Denning
