 Project Development Objectives

  WAPP APL 2 - OMVS Felou Hydroelectric Project (P094916)
  Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
  The project development objectives are to (i) augment the supply of low cost hydroelectricity from the OMVS Power System to the national
  utilities of Mali (EDM), Mauritania (SOMELEC) and Senegal (SENELEC); and (ii) develop a nucleus of a well-functioning, cooperative, power
  pooling mechanism for the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) Zone B Organisation Pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Sénégal (OMVS) Countries
  of West Africa.


  Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 On the implementation of the project, the construction of the Felou hydropower plant was completed. The Commissioning Certificate for the three 20
 MW units was issued by the Owner’s Engineer on April 30, 2014. This is an important milestone in the final stages of the project. Going forward,
 SOGEM needs to ensure that the constructor submits the French translation of the operating manual. The project is closing on December 31, 2014
 with a partial cancellation of the undisbursed balance.

 Overall Comments
 Data have been provided as of November 30, 2014. Below are the projected data for the end of the project December 31, 2014.
 -Quantity of hydroelectricity supplied by OMVS Power System Operator to the electric utilities of the WAPP Zone B OMVS Countries
 (EDM, SENELEC, SOMELEC) : 1121 GWh
 1.       EDM         : 562 GWh
 2.       SENELEC : 346 GWh
 3.       SOMELEC : 213 GWh
 The end target is 1142 GWH- 98.16% of the target is likely to be achieved. The situation at Manantali has had a consequence on the
 energy generated at Felou rather than Manantali itself. It is estimated that the energy generated at Felou which is close to 300 GWh
 today would have reached 330 GWh, leading to a total gneration at Manantali and Felou close to 1151 GWh.
