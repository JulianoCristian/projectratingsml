Some\n            lessons learned included: although there is more to be done\n            and additional capacity building measures can have been\n            incorporated into the project, Manantali Energy Management\n            Company (SOGEM) has gained experience and know-how from the\n            implementation of the Felou HEP, including interactions with\n            large contractors, consultants, and donors. The highlight of\n            the Felou project implementation is the inordinate amount of\n            time taken on a two-stage bidding process to contract the\n            design-build contractor and the economic losses incurred as\n            a consequence. The existing state of play is a threat to the\n            development of Senegal River Basin Development Organization\n            (OMVS) and its three participating utilities but also to the\n            future of the West Africa power pool (WAPP). This regional\n            electric power arrangement cannot develop into a market\n            unless the electricity sellers have some assurance that they\n            will be paid. Most attempts to have the operation and\n            maintenance (O and M) responsibility borne by a separate\n            (often foreign) firm which has no long term interest in the\n            project\u2019s performance in term of reliability, safety,\n            durability, etc. have not been fully satisfying as the\n            Manantali experience has shown. This option will obviously\n            require providing a strong technical and organizational\n            support to this entity for some years, with the main\n            objective of increasing the company\u2019s own capacity to\n            eventually be able to operate largely in an autonomous\n            manner. Two financial covenants were imposed on SOGEM\n            requiring it to maintain a level of accounts receivable of\n            less than 90 days and to have net revenues to be at least\n            1.2 times the estimated maximum debt service requirements."}, "docdt": "2015-09-30T02:48:05Z"}
