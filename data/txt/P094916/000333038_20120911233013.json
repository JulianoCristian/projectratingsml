The project Engineer\n            is providing support to SOGEM for the recruitment of a\n            private operator for the Manantali and Felou hydropower and\n            transmission projects. The consulting services to prepare\n            the specifications of SOGEM's (Societe de Gestion de\n            l'Energie de Manantalinew) SCADA (Supervisory Control\n            and Data Acquisition) system are under recruitment (at\n            financial evaluation phase) and are expected to start in\n            September 2012. The contract for the supply and installation\n            of the SCADA system itself is expected to be signed in April\n            2012; the full financing of this contract would require an\n            extension of credit closing date by about 9 months, which\n            will be considered by the Bank in due time. The reallocation\n            is necessary to allow the full financing of the\n            project's components as stipulated envisaged in the\n            project's agreements and project appraisal report. This\n            requires a reallocation between categories of the three\n            credits that still have available funds, in order to reflect\n            the increase in estimated costs of the project's\n            component two (consulting services, due to minor increase in\n            the scope of services) and component three (consulting\n            services and SCADA equipment, due to a minor increase in\n            cost estimate)."}, "docdt": "2012-08-29T00:00:00Z"}
