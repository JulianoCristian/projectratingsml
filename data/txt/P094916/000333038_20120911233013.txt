2.     There will be no reallocation for Credits No. 4215-SN and 4217-MR, which have
already been fully disbursed.

3.      Project implementation is progressing well. Current ratings are marginally
satisfactory for Implementation Progress and satisfactory for achievement of
Development Outcomes. The full commissioning of the Felou hydropower plant is
scheduled for mid-June 2013, under the Euros 125 million design-build contract with
Sinohydro, which is cofinanced by the European Investment Bank (EIB). The Project
Engineer’s contract to support SOGEM (Manantali Energy Management Company), the
implementing agency, in the supervision of Sinohydro’s contract execution, including
safeguards aspects, is being implemented satisfactorily. The project Engineer is also
providing support to SOGEM for the recruitment of a private operator for the Manantali
and Felou hydropower and transmission projects. The consulting services to prepare the
specifications of SOGEM’s new SCADA system are under recruitment (at financial
evaluation phase) and are expected to start in September 2012. The contract for the
supply and installation of the SCADA system itself is expected to be signed in April
2012; the full financing of this contract would require an extension of credit closing date
by about 9 months, which will be considered by the Bank in due time.

4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to allow the full financing of the
project’s components as stipulated envisaged in the project’s agreements and
project appraisal report. This requires a reallocation between categories of the three
credits that still have available funds, in order to reflect the increase in estimated costs of
the project’s component 2 (consulting services, due to minor increase in the scope of
services) and component 3 (consulting services and SCADA equipment, due to a minor
increase in cost estimate) – as shown in Table 4 below.

5.       In addition, The proposed reallocation would replace the initial modalities of
cost sharing between the three initial and two additional credits involved . Instead of
sharing all costs across all credits as to the initial percentage shares, cost sharing between
IDA credits and financing partners would now be managed on the level of the overall
amounts, only: As per the financing agreements for the three initial credits to Mali,
Mauritania and Senegal and the two additional credits to Mali and Senegal, IDA is to
finance 100% of the costs of components 2 and 3, and 71% of the costs of component 1. 1
This requires the permission that all three remaining credits would be able to cover 100%
of eligible expenditure under all categories.

6.     The initial split of percentage coverage of eligible expenditure between the five
IDA credits is shown in Table 5 below, as established in Schedule 1 and Appendix of the
financing agreements for Mali and Senegal supplemental credits dated February 17,
2012. This split would be lifted with the proposed re-allocation.

  The remainder of this component’s cost is financed from the EIB loan and SOGEM own funds,

7.      The underlying background is that since effectiveness of the supplemental
credits was delayed, SOGEM used exclusively the three initial credits for payments of the
full amounts of each eligible invoice under component 2 from the start of execution of
the Sinohydro and Project Engineer contracts, instead of splitting costs for each invoice
as to the agreed percentage shares between the credits. They did the same for component
1, while distributing invoices between IDA and EIB for component 1 to match the
71%/22% co-financing split2. This simplified the invoicing and payment process3 and it
allowed to speed up the full disbursement of the three initial credits; it should also be
noted that in the end, this method would also result in overall IDA financing as per the
agreed upon percentages.

8.     However now with only the supplemental Senegal credit and the initial and
supplemental Mali credits4 still having funds remaining, it turns out that SOGEM will be
unable to cover the full cost of contracts under components 2 and 3, and/or to add up IDA
financing to cover 71% of the Sinohydro contract, from these credits under the initial
percentage shares as shown in table 5, as it has been agreed upon with the Bank.

9.     The proposed change in percentage as requested by the Governments of Mali and
Senegal and shown in above Tables 1, 2 and 3 will remedy this situation, while not
modifying the overall percentage of project costs that IDA has committed to finance for
each contract. In the case of the Sinohydro contract, SOGEM will distribute future
invoices between IDA and EIB to ensure the agreed upon 71%/22% split and will finance
contingencies from its own funds as planned.


2
   The 7% that SOGEM should finance corresponds to physical and price contingencies under the
Sinohydro contract, which have not materialized so far.
3
   The simplification comes from the fact that there is only one invoice for each payment request instead of
dividing it into five separate invoices.
4
  Suspension of Mali credits under OP7.30 between March 22 and July 15, 2012 also misbalanced the
financing allocation system
