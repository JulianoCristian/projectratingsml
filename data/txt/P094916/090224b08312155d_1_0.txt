  The PAD of June 5, 2006 only mentions one objective (see PAD page 12 and Project Development
Objective above). The Project Agreement of September 13, 2006 between IDA, OMVS and SOGEM, and
all ISRs, mention two objectives: “The objectives of the Project are to: (a) augment the supply of low cost
hydroelectricity from the OMVS Power System to the national power utilities of Mali, Mauritania, and
Senegal; and (b) develop a nucleus of a well-functioning, cooperative, power pooling mechanism for the
WAPP Zone “B” OMVS Countries of West Africa.” The assessment of this ICR will rely on the definition
of objectives given in the Project Agreement as per OPCS guidelines.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
A.      Regional Context:

1.    At the time of appraisal, the member countries of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) faced a number of energy sector challenges among which
were:
(i) Low access to electricity. The poverty reduction action plans of many of ECOWAS
member States emphasized increasing access rates as well as encouraging productive uses
of energy as important challenges to be addressed. Despite the region’s large energy
endowment, the region’s per capita consumption of electricity was among the lowest in the
world. In 2003, the combined total consumption of electricity was about 40,000 GWh
(approximately       60    kWh      per    capita)   and      peak    power     demand
was 6,500MW. Electricity demand is projected to grow by over 7% per year until 2020,
with electricity requirements reaching 140,000 GWh (approximately 370 kWh per capita)
and the peak power demand exceeding 22,000MW. It was estimated that only 20% of the
population of ECOWAS member States had access to electricity. The access was higher
in the Organisation pour la Mise en valeur du Fleuve Sénégal (OMVS) countries with
about 30% of the population connected;
(ii) Widespread supply shortfalls. Across the region, electricity supply was characterized
by unreliable service caused by supply shortfalls. These shortfalls made it difficult to
expand access. It was estimated that the capacity shortfall in the OMVS countries was
about 200 MW;
(iii) Use of expensive emergency thermal generation plants. To ease the immediate
supply shortfalls, several ECOWAS member states, including OMVS member states, were
compelled to procure on an emergency basis, generation plants fueled with imported
petroleum products primarily because they are quick to install and involve relatively lower
capital outlays. However, the high running cost of these facilities meant that the tariff paid
by consumers was often below cost recovery levels. The utilization of such plants had in
general proven to be unsustainable and the challenge for the region was to search for and
implement projects from more sustainable sources such as hydro power;
(iv) Undeveloped indigenous hydroelectric resources. The indigenous fossil fuel
resources (coal and petroleum) of the region commonly used for electricity production are
concentrated in one or two member states. There was however a substantial economic
hydroelectric potential of about 1000 MW in the region that remains untapped. The
challenge for the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) was to find ways to mobilize these
resources in an environment where the individual governments did not have adequate
resources to meet the investment requirements; and
(v) Weak institutional and human capacities. The size of the power infrastructure in many
of the member states of ECOWAS and OMVS can be described as small or very small.


                                              1
The local capacities for system operation, maintenance and especially project
implementation were correspondingly low.
2.      The vision of ECOWAS was to develop and put in place a cooperative power
pooling mechanism for integrating national power system operations into a unified regional
electricity market - with the expectation that such mechanism would, over the medium to
long term, assure a stable and reliable electricity supply at affordable costs. The long term
scenario was to establish the WAPP as the principal vehicle to help meet the region’s
projected electricity requirement by harnessing electricity from: (a) several large capacity
hydropower facilities (e.g., Kainji, Akosombo, Manantali) sited on the region’s major
rivers (Niger, Volta, Senegal) which produce relatively low-cost electricity (US$0.01 -
0.03kWh); (b) the substantial but as yet untapped hydro resources of Guinea, some 6,000
MW of which was potentially economic to develop and generate around 20-25 TWh per
year of electricity at relatively low cost (between US$0.02-0.03kWh); and (c) an expansion
of gas-fired power generation, leveraging the West Africa community’s parallel track
strategy to expand access to Nigeria’s enormous natural gas reserves (3,500 billion cubic
meters of proven natural gas reserves) via the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP). In order
to provide a robust infrastructure platform for the WAPP, a four-fold increase in power
system interconnection capacity among ECOWAS Member States (the “Community”) was
required over the period 2005-2020.
3.      Power pools benefits expected from developing interconnections and operating the
power pool included the following: (i) reduction in capital and operating costs through
improved coordination among power utilities; (ii) optimization of generation resources and
scale economies with large generating units; (iii) improved power system reliability with
reserve sharing; (iv) enhanced security of supply through mutual assistance; (v) improved
investment climate through pooling risks; (vi) coordination of generation and transmission
expansion; (vii) increase in inter-country electricity exchanges; and (viii) development of
a regional market for electricity.
4.      Among the many constraints and challenges facing the WAPP (such as mobilizing
investment for power projects), two constraints were particularly relevant to the West
Africa region (including OMVS): (i) Inadequate generating capacity and reserve margin;
and (ii) lack or underdeveloped transmission networks. ECOWAS and OMVS, with the
support of the Bank and other donors, particularly the European Investment Bank (EIB),
addressed the problem by strengthening generation and transmission throughout the region
through three Adaptable Program Loans (APLs):
- APL 1: Costal Transmission Backbone
- APL 2: OMVS Power System Development; and
- APL 3: Inter-zonal Transmission hub
This ICR deals with APL 2: OMVS Power System Development.
5.      West Africa is endowed with significant energy resources for electricity generation,
but these resources are unevenly distributed and the gap between supply and demand was
increasing. In 2003, the combined total consumption of electricity was about 40,000 GWh
(approximately 160 kWh per capita) and peak power demand was 6,500MW. Electricity
demand was projected to grow by over 7% per year until 2020, when electricity



                                             2
requirement would reach 140,000 GWh (approximately 370 kWh per capita) and the peak
power demand would exceed 22,000 MW.
6.      OMVS was mandated by the governments of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania to
ensure a multi-purpose water resources development, including electric power generation
in the Senegal River Basin. The hydropower potential of the Senegal River Basin is
estimated at 1,200 MW, of which only about 200 MW have so far been developed. During
the 1990s, the Regional Hydropower Development Project (RHDP), implemented by a
special purpose company (Societe de Gestion de l’Energie de Manantali, SOGEM –
Manantali Energy Management Company), led to the establishment of a unique sub-
regional power system: the OMVS Power System. It comprises a 200 MW hydroelectric
plant at the foot of the Manantali dam, a 1000 kilometer long system of 225kV transmission
lines and sub-stations that evacuate electricity produced at the Manantali hydroelectric
plant to the main load centers in Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal, both operated in real-time
by a central load dispatching system. The Felou 60MW run-of-the-river power plant was
located on the Senegal River in Mali about 200 km downstream of the Manantali
Hydropower Station with an interconnection to the 225 kV transmission system which
links Dakar (Senegal), Nouakchott (Mauritania) and Bamako (Mali). The Felou
hydroelectric Project (HEP) took advantage of an existing small hydro plant (600 kW) and
excess transmission capacity available in the OMVS network.

B.     Rationale for Bank Assistance

7.      The Felou HEP primary purpose was to support the OMVS Governments’ efforts
to provide affordable energy to their energy starved economies. To support this objective,
the Bank pursued a two-pronged strategy at the regional and national levels.
8.      At the regional level, the Bank followed a well-defined and phased integration
effort in key sectors where the countries would benefit significantly from cross-border
trade - notably road and air transport, energy and telecommunications. This strategy was
articulated in the Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) for West Africa which
the Bank adopted in 2001 and whose objective was to help the countries concerned create
a unified regional economic space through the integration of markets of goods, financial
and infrastructure services.
9.     To achieve this objective, the Bank and other donors such as EIB (which parallel
financed the Felou Build-Design contract) in consultation with the WAPP and ECOWAS,
agreed to put in place a multi-year programmatic framework in support of WAPP. In
addition, national energy projects in the Bank Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) for
each ECOWAS member state (including OMVS) were aligned with the broader goals of
WAPP. For the OMVS countries, the Felou HEP was aligned with the objectives of: (a)
broad based growth and private sector development, including improving infrastructure of
the FY04-06 Mali CAS; (b) wealth creation of the Senegal FY03-06 CAS; and (c)
accelerating private sector-led growth of the Mauritania CAS.
10.    At the national level, the development of the OMVS Felou HEP under the WAPP
APL 2 operation provided a least-cost energy source and strategically complemented
country-specific IDA energy lending operations in the OMVS member countries (i.e. Mali,



                                            3
Senegal, and Mauritania) to address various energy sector challenges outlined in paragraph
1 above.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

11.    The objectives of the project were to: (a) augment the supply of low cost
hydroelectricity from the OMVS Power System to the national power utilities of Mali,
Mauritania, and Senegal; and (b) develop a nucleus of a well-functioning, cooperative,
power pooling mechanism for the WAPP Zone “B” OMVS Countries of West Africa.
12.     The PAD only mentions the first objective. However, the Project Agreement
included the second objective. The ICR analysis is based on both objectives as stated the
Project Agreement, as per OPCS guidelines. All implementation status and results reports
(ISRs) mention the two objectives.
13.       The two PDO level key performance indicators are:
      -   Quantity of low cost hydroelectricity that OMVS power system supplies to the
          electricity utilities of the WAPP Zone B OMVS countries (EDM, SENELEC, and
          SOMELEC); and
      -   Operating rules in place on the basis of sound economic dispatch criteria.
14.     The first PDO level indicator was included in the original results framework, while
the second PDO level indicator was added to the results framework of the project as part
of the changes made during the additional financing in 2009.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

15.      The original project objectives were not revised during the life of the project. Only
the first PDO level key indicator was included in the original results framework in the PAD.
The second PDO level indicator (i.e., operating rules in place on the basis of sound
economic dispatch criteria) was introduced through the additional financing in 2009.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

16.     The primary target groups identified in the PAD are the OMVS member countries
of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania and through their respective power utilities, their
respective populations. Furthermore, as a source of clean, renewable energy, the OMVS
60 MW Felou Hydroelectric Project benefits the global environment as it displaces thermal
power generation powered by fossil fuels.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

17.        The Felou HEP had three components:
          (a) Component I (US$ 177.6 million)2: Design, construction and commissioning of
          a 60 MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric plant at Felou. This component represents
          about 92% of total project cost (excluding price contingencies and interest during
          construction). The design build contract included the provision of the following
          goods and services: (a) site preparation; (b) civil works; (c) studies and services; (d)
          electro-mechanical equipment (3x21 MW generating sets); (e) equipment assembly;
          (f) mechanical auxiliairies; (g) electrical equipment and materials; (h)
          interconnection to the OMVS transmission system; (i) environmental and social
          mitigation; (j) assistance in operation and maintenance during the guarantee period;
          and (h) spare parts. These components are further broken down into sub-
          components in Annex 2 below.
          (b) Component 2 (US$ 8.56 million2): Two-Stage "Project Cycle Management
          Contract". Provision of services of an experienced engineering consulting firm to
          provide comprehensive project cycle management support to oversee the design,
          construction and commissioning of the hydroelectric plant at Felou through a two-
          stage sequential contracting arrangement, as follows:
               (i)      Phase 1 ("Transaction Adviser"). Contract with a consulting firm to
                        provide transaction advice and support required to: (a) perform detailed
                        planning and scheduling of project implementation arrangements,
                        including pre-qualification of prospective bidders, (b) prepare and issue
                        bidding documents for the selection of an independent contractor, (c)
                        prepare a comprehensive set of power supply agreements for use by the
                        OMVS Power System Operator, and (d) conduct the two-stage bidding
                        process, evaluate bids and make recommendation for the award of the
                        design-build contract; and
               (ii)     Phase 2 ("Owner's Engineer"). Contract to oversee the day-to-day
                        performance of the design-build contractor over the entire "design-build
                        performance testing" cycle, up until the critical milestone involving the
                        hand-over of the "use and control" of a fully operational Felou
                        hydroelectric plant to the OMVS Power System Operator.
          (c) Component 3 (US$7.79 million2): WAPP Action Plan for the OMVS Power
          System. Support in facilitating joint operations and coordination between Electricite
          du Mali (EDM), Societe Nationale d’Electricite du Senegal (SENELEC), Societe
          Mauritanienne d’Electricite (SOMELEC) and the OMVS Power System Operator
          by: (i) upgrading communication and data acquisition facilities to enable real-time
          information exchange with the load dispatching center at Manantali and the three
          national power utilities; and (ii) acquiring the necessary software licenses (with

         thermal power generation capacity of the recipients.

1.6 Revised Components

18.       There was no change in the project components.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

19.     The original project design with its two development objectives and three
components remained unchanged throughout. The changes introduced with the additional
financing were those related to the arrangements for project implementation, the extension
of the project’s closing date, the financing plan and revisions to the results framework.
20.      Arrangements for project implementation: Under the original project
implementation arrangements, OMVS was responsible for the overall coordination of the
implementation of the project. OMVS, with the support of SOGEM, was also responsible
for component 2 of the project, including: (i) detailed planning and scheduling of project
implementation arrangements; (ii) preparing and issuing bidding documents for the
selection of an independent contractor; and (iii) conducting the bid evaluation and contract
award processes. In August 2008, OMVS informed the Bank that the Council of Ministers
had decided to entrust the responsibility for project implementation entirely to SOGEM3.
While OMVS had played a coordinating role and helped with mobilizing the financing for
the project, this decision of the Council of Ministers helped focus the responsibility for
implementation on SOGEM which was already carrying out most of the coordination of
project implementation activities with the assistance of its consultants. This change in
project implementation arrangements was considered acceptable and was formalized as
part of the additional financing package.
21.    Extension of the Closing Date: Given the delays experienced in awarding the
design and build contract and the time needed to mobilize the additional financing required
to complete construction, the project could not be completed by the original closing date
of June 30, 2010. Taking into account the implementation period for the design build
contract, the closing date of the project was extended by three years (from June 30, 2010
to June 30, 2013). The closing date was later again extended by one year and a half to
December 30, 2014.
22.    Project Financing: In line with OMVS policies, the costs of new regional assets
were to be equally shared between the member states independently of how project benefits
are shared. Therefore, in the original financing plan, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal each
borrowed one third of the funds made available from IDA and the EIB. SOGEM had
estimated that the total financing required to implement the project increased from US$125
million to about US$241 million (or 193% increase). The main reason was the increase in

                                                   8
the cost of the design build contract, but the estimates for the Project Cycle Management
Contract, price contingencies and Interest During Construction (IDC) had also to be
adjusted because of the increase in the cost of the design build contract to which they were
tied. The cost of IDC which was underestimated during appraisal of the original project
was made, during additional financing, to reflect the 4.5% on-lending rate for IDA and EIB
funds from the three governments to SOGEM.
23.     In 2009 and because of policy reasons, IDA was not in a position to extend new
credits to Mauritania, but given the high priority accorded to completing the Felou HEP,
the significant economic benefits and the high cost of delays, the governments of Mali and
Senegal requested that they be allowed to borrow the full amount of the additional
financing required. The Government of Mauritania had indicated to the Governments of
Mali and Senegal: its full commitment to an early completion of the Felou project and had
demonstrated that by settling the arrears from SOMELEC to SOGEM as well as by signing
off on the new guarantee mechanism which was to ensure regular bill payments to SOGEM.
Given this evidence of commitment to OMVS, SOGEM and the Felou HEP, Bank
management provided a waiver from OP 7.30 (Dealings with De Facto Governments4) to
allow disbursements on the existing Credit to Mauritania for the Felou HEP subject to
approval of the additional financing by the Board. This was done on August 29, 2009
which accorded Senegal and Mali an additional financing of SDR 27.4 million (equivalent
to US$42.5 million) each.
       Revision of the Results Framework: The additional financing project paper of
July 30, 2009 introduced the following changes to the project’s results framework (Section
1.3 above for details):
      Addition of a PDO indicator to the second project objective of creating a nucleus
of a power pooling mechanism, namely “Operating rules in place on the basis of sound
economic dispatch criteria”.
      Addition of seven intermediate performance indicators; and
      Deletion of one intermediate indicator.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Project Preparation

24.      The project was well grounded in the need of the region and the OMVS countries
for a reliable source of affordable energy to sustain a broad-based growth and employment
called for in country assistance and poverty reduction strategies.

  A "de facto government" comes into, or remains in, power by means not provided for in the country's
constitution, such as a coup d'état, revolution, usurpation, abrogation or suspension of the constitution.



                                                      9
25.     The project was also well grounded in existing OMVS conventions and operating
rules for jointly owned infrastructure, such as the OMVS power system and followed an
output-based approach to the main design build contract. In parallel a consulting engineer
support was provided to enable SOGEM to oversee the entire project cycle, including
engineering supervision.
26.    At the time of appraisal, the project benefitted from the experience gained in the
implementation of:
      the Regional Hydropower Project of Manantali which was partly financed by IDA
through three credits to Mali, Senegal and Mauritania as well as from lessons learned,
including the option of a Fixed- Price Date Certain Turnkey Contract for the dam and
power station, with a pre-qualification process (i.e. a two stage bidding process); and
       national projects and sector work done by the Bank in Mali, Senegal and
Mauritania, all of which had an impact on the Felou HEP project and the OMVS system,
such as the Energy Support Project (ESP) in Mali or the Electricity Sector Efficiency
Enhancement Project in Senegal.
27.     Existing hydrological data on the Senegal river and the data collected at the site of
the existing small run-of-river power plant (600 kW), which was replaced by the Felou
hydroelectric power plant, were used to develop a comprehensive set of high-quality
baseline data, including reasonable candidates such as Felou and Gouina hydroelectric
projects, downstream of the Manantali hydroelectric project. The feasibility study carried
out by Coyne et Bellier (2003) delineated the dam and power plant characteristics and these
technical specifications were used in the call for the first stage bids toward the choice of
an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor.
28.    The project also benefitted from the Scandinavian experience in the design of
power pooling mechanisms. A key lesson learned was the requirement of active
involvement of all transmission system operators. In the specific WAPP APL 2 project
context, a unique multi-country regional transmission system operator – Eskom Energie
Manantali SA (EEM) – was established to coordinate operations through the Comité
Technique Permanent de l’Interconnexion (CTPI) with the national power utilities.

Assessment of project design and Quality at entry.

29.     The objectives of the project responded to Bank priorities for the ECOWAS region
in general and OMVS region in particular. They also fitted Government priorities to supply
their economies with affordable energy. The CASs and poverty reduction strategies of
each country for the year 2005-2006 when the Felou project was prepared and appraised,
invariably called for higher, sustainable and broad-based growth to generate employment
and raise the living standards and affordable energy was a key ingredient in achieving this.

30.    The project’s strategy to remain simple and focus on two objectives, the main of
which was increasing the power generation capacity to alleviate the power and energy
shortages in Mali, Senegal and Mauritania and designing the project to only include three
components was commendable. The project development objectives were structured
around two categories of outcomes expected from the project, namely (a) alleviate power
supply deficits in Mali, Senegal and Mauritania through an increase supply of low cost


                                             10
hydroelectricity from the OMVS power system, including Felou; and (b) develop a nucleus
of a well-functioning WAPP power pooling mechanism. The second outcome was added
at additional financing.
31.     The project was designed with three components that reflected the categories of
outcomes mentioned above (a “design build” component, a “Project cycle management
contract” component, and a “WAPP Action plan for the OMVS Power System”
component); consequently, project design followed a well-defined structure, from
components to objectives and from objectives to outcomes. The scope of the first two
components was reasonable and in line with international experience in run-of-river power
plants. The scope of the third component was also reasonable. However, the outcome it
supported has no easy interpretation (see Section 2.3 below for more details).
32.     An important feature of the project was the retention of a private company as
OMVS Power System Operator However, promoting private sector participation needs to
be accompanied with a strengthening of the public entity’s capacity to oversee a private
sector operator. The Manantali project succeeded in involving a private operator for the
management and operation of project facilities, as well as in reviewing and establishing
tariff principles and mechanisms, and energy purchase agreements. However, legal
disputes between SOGEM and the operator over contract responsibilities and
remuneration which were not clear in the Manantali concession agreement showed that
the objective of promoting private sector participation needs to be accompanied with a
strengthening of the public entity’s capacity to manage and negotiate operations and
maintenance (O&M) contracts.
33.     As a category A project in regards to safeguards, the project design took into
account the Bank’s safeguards policies, including procedures and implementation
arrangements to ensure full consideration of environmental and social safeguards. Four
Bank safeguard policies were triggered: Environment Assessment (OP/BP 4.01);
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); Dam Safety (OP/BP 4.37) and Projects on
International Waterways (OP/BP 7.40). See Section 2.4 below for details.
34.     The implementing agency was supported by an engineering consultant to assist in
bid evaluation and supervision during construction. This was an appropriate measure to
supplement SOGEM’s implementation capacity. However, project implementation still
proved to be challenging (see section 2.2 below) due to: the lack of advanced procurement
actions including readiness of the bidding documents before project approval; the adoption
of a comprehensive bidding process including prequalification and two-stage bidding; the
unexpected rebidding process conducted to comply with the Bank’s procurement eligibility
requirements; and the rise in the cost of civil works and equipment for the design-build
contract. Multiple reasons were given to explain the substantial increase in the estimated
cost of the design-build contract despite an open international competitive bidding process.
In US Dollar terms, the estimated base price of the Design-Build contract increased from
US$ 100 to US$ 176 million. The cost increase was due to the devaluation of the USD
exchange rate relative to the Euro in which the contract was denominated and the
worldwide increase in commodity and equipment prices that was witnessed in comparable
projects over the few years after the base price was estimated till the contract was procured.
Other factors may also have contributed to the high contract price, such as the worldwide
market volatility when the contract was procured, and the contract model selected (while


                                             11
its selection might have been justified for its other merits): a fixed lump-sum price contract
on design-build basis, covering construction of the large civil works, supply and
installation of hydrogenation plant for a multi-year period.
35.    In addition to IDA, EIB was the only other external co-financier of the project. EIB
provided parallel financing for design-build contract under component 1 of the project.

Adequacy of governments’ commitments

36.      The commitment to, and ownership of the project was strong at the time of
preparation and appraisal. This strong commitment was sustained throughout the life of
the project. The governments of Mali, Senegal and Mali requested and obtained five (5)
IDA credits (three original and two additional financing) towards the financing of the
project which was also co-financed by EIB. The three governments also pushed for the
settlement of arrears to SOGEM by their respective national utilities as well as accepting a
tariff increase of 10% in July 2013.

Assessment of risks

37.     The table below shows the risks and mitigation measures identified in the PAD
along with a brief description of how these risks evolved during the implementation of the
project.

38.     Other risks (not formally identified at appraisal):
               Hydrology and O&M: As with most hydroelectric projects, the hydrology
        is an important risk to project outcome. SOGEM set up a Hydrology Risk Fund to
        ensure that payment obligations are met in the event of a disaster or a poor rainfall
        year and a Maintenance and Operation Fund. Despite resources constraints,
        SOGEM did its best to ensure that these were adequately funded. The coming on
        stream of Felou would allow more resources to be allocated to the Funds.
               Non regular payment of electricity bills: Another risk not formally
        identified is the non-regular payment of bills by EDM, SENELEC and SOMELEC
        which created serious financial difficulties for SOGEM. SOGEM in turn had
        difficulties repaying the loans including some on-lent to it by the three governments
        for the purpose of project financing. However, financial covenants were put in
        place whereby the Governments of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania were to cause
        their respective utilities to establish an escrow account to backstop payments
        obligations for electricity purchases from the OMVS power system. This provision
        however proved ineffective as the three national utilities continued to accumulate
        arrears. The situation improved after the commissioning of Felou and as of early
        June 2015, only EDM had arrears of about FCFA 3.3 billion, of which 1.43 billion
        are in dispute with SOGEM.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
39.     The project was approved in June 2006 and closed in December 2014. The eight
and a half years implementation period was characterized by two distinct phases: a period
of significant delays, which lasted roughly four years, until mid-October 2010, and a period
of active implementation, which lasted about four years and a half until project closure in
December 2014.
40.     The early implementation period (2006-2009) was characterized by a slow
start. The parent project was approved in 2006 and became effective 10 months later. In
2008, the cost overrun resulted in processing the additional financing, which was approved
in 2009 with additional delays because legal documents needed amendments after a coup
d’etat in Mauritania and a waiver was needed to proceed. The new set of effectiveness
conditions attached to the additional financing further delayed implementation. As a result,
three years after Board approval, as of August 2009, less than 3 % of the project funds had
been disbursed, against an original expectation of about 75%. During this period, the
overall implementation progress and project development objectives ratings of the Felou
HEP were consistently satisfactory to marginally satisfactory even though start-up was
slow, the Bank and the three Governments/implementing agency were able to adapt to the
unforeseen challenges posed and project implementation proceeded more rapidly.
41.     The active implementation period (2010-2014) was characterized by
implementation progress but also significant project management challenges such as
management contract issues, financial problems, governance and country instability. With
improved perspectives of achieving its objectives, the project was restructured in August
2009 with the additional financing with adjustments to some component indicators and a
three-year extension of the closing date. By mid-October 2010, with many of the earlier
challenges addressed, the project started to make significant progress. The bidding process
was successful and the design-build-contractor started construction. The Mid Term
Review (MTR) took place in November 2011 to examine the issues that had slowed
implementation. It focused on remedial measures to accelerate implementation, improve
operational efficiency, and strengthen SOGEM’s financial position and operating
performance. It also suggested steps to ensure that the environmental and social issues in
the Environmental Action Plan and the Resettlement Action Plan, whether they were the
responsibility of SOGEM or the EPC contractor, be undertaken or completed. The mission
finally focused on the financial situation of SOGEM which was worrying because of an
increase in operating costs and a high level of arrears built up by participating utilities. The
expected tariff increase of three times 10 % each starting in July 2011 and stretching to
January 2013 did not take place, further exacerbating SOGEM’s cash-flow problems. The
MTR requested that SOGEM implements a cost cutting program to alleviate the situation.
However, an increase in tariffs was seen as the most important instrument to redress the
situation. SOGEM’s performance in financial management was rated moderately
unsatisfactory because of the four months delay in submitting the 2010 audit reports. The
MTR, while insisting that SOGEM strengthen the capacities of its financial department,
otherwise confirmed the continued relevance of the project development objectives and its
three components.



                                               14
42.     Thereafter, the project progressed well until closure. The development objective
(DO) rating was Satisfactory until June 2012 and moderately satisfactory until the project
closing date in December 2014. Implementation progress was rated moderately
satisfactory from early 2011 until the closing date of the project.
43.     In summary, the following factors affected project implementation at various
stages:
       Procurement Process: The procurement process for the design-build contract
started only after the project was approved in June 2006. Following a comprehensive
process, including prequalification and two-stage bidding, four bidders were prequalified
but only two of them submitted bids in the final stage. Because the lowest evaluated bidder
could not meet the eligibility requirements under the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines and
the other bidder’s price was too high, a fast-track rebidding was then conducted in late
2008, which resulted in awarding the contract to Sinohydro of China for a value of about
126 million Euros or about US$ 176 million (excluding physical and price contingencies).
The contract was signed in May 2009 after a satisfactory financing plan was in place to
fund the cost overrun. 5 Since the project was designed to have a design-build contract, the
procurement method i.e. prequalification plus two-stage bidding, might have been a
suitable approach. However, it should not be taken for granted for future projects and a
thorough assessment of various procurement options should be carried out. Procurement
actions should also be carried out well in advance of the project approval and the processing
of additional financing.
        Delayed Project Effectiveness: It took 10 months between appraisal and
effectiveness of the original project due mainly to having the three Governments sign/ratify
the legal documents and meet the conditions of effectiveness. The additional financing took
about the same time (about 10 months) between appraisal and effectiveness.
        Additional financing: IDA, at the request of the Governments of Mali and Senegal,
approved two additional credits of about US$42.5 million each towards the financing of the
project. The reasons for the increase noted above. Construction of the dam and power
station started in November 2009 with the signature of the contract. As already mentioned
earlier on delayed project effectiveness, it took about10 months for the additional financing
to become effective. The reasons were the satisfaction of the conditions of effectiveness
(two of which were tied to the readiness of the draft bidding documents for Design-Build
Contract and the draft phase 2 contract “Owner’s Engineer”(which required the recruitment
of the consulting engineer) and the lengthy legal approval process by the countries involved
(Mali and Senegal).
        Management Contract Issues: Disputes between SOGEM and EEM over contract
responsibilities and remuneration which were not clear in the Manantali concession
agreement led to an unanticipated termination of the 15-year contract between them with
effect end October 2011 with the possibility of extending the contract until June 30, 2012.


5
    Bid validity expired on March 28, 2009, but SOGEM had already obtained an extension of two months
to allow more time to put the additional financing in place.



                                                 15
Eventually the EEM contract was extended and closed in July 2014 after successive
extensions. While waiting for the recruitment of a new private operator, a new company,
La Société d’exploitation de Manantali et de Félou (SEMAF) was set up as a subsidiary of
SOGEM. SEMAF has already started the operation and maintenance of Manantali. For
Felou, SOGEM signed a temporary contract with the EPC constructor, Sinohydro which
will expire in October 2015 (before the end of the April 2016 warranty period). An O&M
expert provided recommendations on the future transfer of Sinohydro's responsibility to the
newly created subsidiary, SEMAF.
        Financial Issues: Payment arrears reached nearly FCFA 45 billion at the end of
December 2007. In addition, funds for maintenance and upgrading of the hydroelectric plant
and transmission lines (Main Equipment Rehabilitation Fund) were not set aside by
SOGEM as originally planned and agreed. The same happened to the Hydrology Risk Fund
(15 billion FCFA) that SOGEM had set up to ensure that payment obligations are met in the
event of a disaster or a poor rainfall year. The situation improved only in 2009, when a
resolution from the OMVS Council of Ministers called upon member countries to ensure
the regular payments of their electricity bills and authorized EEM to cut electricity supply
to the defaulting electricity companies.
Following the resolution of the OMVS Council of Ministers, the level of arrears decreased:
According to the Annual EEM technical report released in March 2011, the recovery rate of
new bills was up to 100% (Eskom, 2003-2010). As for the old arrears, 75% of the
outstanding 2007 total arrears were settled at the end of April 2009. This situation however
proved unsustainable and the build-up of arrears reemerged as a major concern: FCFA 11
billion compared to turnover of FCFA 35.8 billion or about 31% in December 2013.
SOGEM’s financial situation improved following the commissioning of Felou and as of
early June 2015, only EDM had arrears of about 3.3 billion FCFA, of which about 1.4 billion
FCFA are in dispute. SENELEC and SOMELEC are current.
        Coup d’Etat and Insecurity in Mali: In Mali, the civil war, the 2012 coup d’etat and
the resulting insecurity resulted in higher costs, including security fees, for goods and
services. In addition, in periods of heightened tensions, constructors and consultants
withdrew their staff from the Felou site and often worked through (heavily guarded) short
visits. Furthermore, this situation had an impact on project supervision as often during this
period, supervision was done remotely through video conference.
        Lack of Agreement on Acquisition of SCADA and other IT equipment and
Software Licenses: Except for a minor expense on a study and preparation of bidding
documents, component 3, a very small component of the whole project (about 4% of project
costs), was not implemented. The procurement of SOGEM’s enhanced SCADA system
was delayed by almost two years, as a result of prolonged technical discussions between
SOGEM, EDM, SENELEC, SOMELEC, and the WAPP Secretariat about the integration
of existing and future SCADA systems in the sub-region, together with procurement delays
for consulting services for the design of SOGEM’s enhanced SCADA system.
       Lack of Capacity of SOGEM: SOGEM lacked technical, administrative, financial
and environmental and social capacity to carry out the project as implementing agency. A
supervising engineer and direct recruitment in the needed specialties (procurement,
financial management, environmental and social) helped strengthen SOGEM’s capacities


                                             16
in implementing the project. As with other countries, a future Bank engagement with
SOGEM could focus on capacity building.
       Contractor’s Underestimation of Highest Floods: The design-build contractor’s
underestimation of highest floods/size of diversions/cofferdams, twice resulted in flooding
of the construction site. This led to implementation delays and financial claims between
SOGEM and the contractor.
44.   SDR7.49 million (or about US$ 10.46 million) of the credits were not disbursed
and were thus cancelled.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

45.     Design: The baseline data for the indicators (original and revised) were prepared
and the monitoring system was simple and based on measurable outputs especially for
components 1 and 2. The original project documentation only had one PDO indicator. A
second indicator was added at the time of the additional financing. At the time of the
additional financing, seven new intermediate indicators were added and one was dropped.
Furthermore, one core indicator related to generation capacity of hydropower constructed under
the project was added starting with ISR 7 (see Section 1.3 above for details). The second
project objective to “develop a nucleus of a well-functioning, cooperative, power pooling
mechanism for the WAPP Zone “B” OMVS Countries of West Africa” and its outcome
indicator of “operating rules in place on the basis of sound economic dispatch criteria”
were somewhat vague.
46.     Some indication of what the outcome indicator was meant to be is given in the
Results Framework of the additional financing “…a measurement for the functioning of
the WAPP power pooling mechanism” or in the description of component 3 (PAD, para.
23) which was meant to support the achievement of the project’s second objective “This
component will help upgrade the functional and operational capabilities of the CTPI to
fully deploy the power pooling provisions of the OMVS Power System. Specifically, this
component will facilitate joint operations and coordination between EDM, SENELEC,
SOMELEC and EEM”. Or from the description of component 3 in the additional financing
Project Paper (para. 15): “.acquiring the necessary software licenses with relevant training
to support optimization and scheduling of the combined hydro and thermal power
generation capacity of the recipients”. Ultimately component 3 was not implemented.
47.     Implementation: The M&E system was well-embedded institutionally and the
OMVS Power System Operator and SOGEM carried out the overall monitoring of the
project and the achievement of the output indicators. These indicators were reported to the
Bank in progress reports. The monitoring included separate detailed reporting by SOGEM,
covering progress on physical implementation, procurement, financial commitments and
other elements of the project progress. The data collected were evaluated and used to
inform decision-making.
48.      Utilization: The information provided by the monitoring and evaluation system is
critical to the operation and energy dispatch of the OMVS power system and to the three
utilities of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania. Due to the criticality of the information provided,
the sustainability of the M&E arrangements beyond the project implementation period is


                                             17
likely. However joint operations and coordination between EDM, SENELEC, SOMELEC
and the OMVS Power System Operator has been postponed to a future date as the
conditions for this to happen are not yet in place (e.g. power shortage in all OMVS
countries, power exchange agreements, etc.).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

49.     Environmental and social safeguards: Four safeguards policies were triggered:
Environment Assessment (OP/BP 4.01); Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); Dam
Safety (OP/BP 4.37) and Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.40)
50.     Over the life of the project, the compliance with environmental safeguards was
rated from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory mainly because of the lack of reporting
by SOGEM particularly on the status of implementation of the RAPs, and the call for the
strengthening of its social unit. The team however noted considerable efforts in the
implementation of safeguard mitigation measures. The detailed action plan showed that all
planned mitigation measures under Sinohydro (the design-build contractor) or OMVS
responsibility were satisfactorily implemented: feeder road; water supply; fence of Lontou
School; providing funding for the construction of the health center; etc. An improved water
waste management system was built and the safety of workers and population in the Felou
site was improved and no incident was recorded.
51.      The environmental audit of the Felou HEP which was due within six months of the
closing of the project was received. Its conclusions are that: (i) every person affected has
been equitably compensated and complaints resolved to the satisfaction of the parties; (ii)
the measures included in the RAP have been for the most part implemented; (iii) the
mechanisms of dispute resolution have worked well; and (iv) there has been an
improvement in the social conditions such as through the provision of potable water supply.
It however recommends a number of minor corrective measures, part of the Environmental
and Social Management Plan (ESMP), to be addressed by SOGEM/Sinohydro while Felou
is still under the operating warranty (e.g. Reforestation of the site, follow up on the
maintenance of the trash management system and a plan of what would become of the
Sinohydro’s base camp now that the work was completed).
52.     Financial Management (FM): The FM performance of the project was rated
mostly moderately satisfactory during project implementation and the related risk was
deemed moderate taking into account that minimum FM arrangements were put in place at
the coordination unit and that 100 % of projects expenditures were made through direct
payments. Starting in 2012, audit reports noted gradual improvements on SOGEM’s
financial statements that evolved from a qualified opinion with substantial shortcomings to
an unqualified opinion in 2013. However, SOGEM’s weak internal control environment
and its FM system to which the overall FM performance of the project was closely tied,
was often criticized by external auditors and Bank FM supervision reviews. As
documented in ISRs, staffing of SOGEM’s finance department remained an issue and
SOGEM failed, over the life of the project, to take appropriate action to adequately
reinforce it.



                                                18
53.     Financial management was rated unsatisfactory in November 2011 because the
audit report revealed serious weaknesses in SOGEM’s financial management and internal
controls. The rating was subsequently upgraded to moderately satisfactory after SOGEM
improved its financial and accounting practices and reorganized its finance department.
This rating was kept until the end of the project.
54.     Procurement: The project was implemented in accordance with Bank’s
Procurement and Consultant Guidelines and the Standard Bidding Documents were used.
As noted in section 2.2, for the Design-Build contract a rebidding process was conducted
to in order to comply with the Bank’s procurement eligibility requirements. Allegations
of fraudulent and corrupt practices by a firm involved in the implementation of the project
resulted in an investigation by the Bank that has led to a pending sanctions case against the
firm and related risk mitigation measures.
55.    The ISRs noted weaknesses in capacity and recommended training and recruitment
of procurement specialists. After the effectiveness of the additional financing in October
2010 and except for component 3, procurement proceeded and the Felou HEP fully entered
operation in April 30, 20146.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

56.     The Felou HEP is operated as a unit of the OMVS power system that now includes
Manantali and Felou, but is expected to include more power plants in the future such as the
Gouina HEP, now under construction with non-World Bank financing. The OMVS
member countries have a clear strategic interest in the effective operation of the OMVS
system that delivers power sustainably at a reasonable cost. As indicated earlier,
Governments’ commitment to the project and to the OMVS system in general have for the
most part been strong and steady. The alternatives to the predominantly hydro based
OMVS power system (such as relying on thermal power generation even if the economics
of thermal power has been altered by the rapid fall in oil prices) are worse. Hydropower
has to stand on its own merit but it still provides a cheaper source of energy to meet the
three OMVS countries’ energy needs. The risks to project outcome have been evaluated
as modest as Felou HEP is likely to serve the three countries’ energy needs well into the
future (see para. 85 below). Furthermore, there is still a significant hydro potential on the
Senegal River (about 1200 MW of which only 260 have so far been developed) that has
not been yet tapped that could be developed to supply OMVS/WAPP countries in the future.




6
  The ratings of procurement in ISRs up to sequence 9 of March 2011, were however consistently satisfactory.
This rating was downgraded to moderately satisfactory in sequence 10 of October 2011 because of the time
taken to procure component 3 of the project (SCADA system, associated software and licenses). The project
retained this rating until project closing because this component could not be acquired before December 31,
2014.



                                                    19
57.    While addressing their energy needs through the pooling of their own resources,
the OMVS countries are also looking further into the future to meet their energy needs
through a wider power pooling and exchange of energy with other West African countries
through the WAPP.
58.      Transition operation and management arrangements are being put in place through
an affiliate of SOGEM to manage the OMVS power system effectively. The management
of the system is likely to be enhanced once the SCADA system is acquired.
59.      Sinohydro is currently acting as a temporary OMVS system operator7. In July 2014,
SOGEM created an affiliate (SEMAF) to take over the role of OMVS system operator for
an initial period of four years at the end of Sinohydro’s contract at the end of October 2015.
SEMAF has started doing so for Manantali and some of its staff has been seconded to Felou
to undergo training in the operation and management of hydro assets under the supervision
of Sinohydro. After an initial four-year period, a determination will be made whether to
proceed with the recruitment of a private firm or continue with this or other arrangements.
60.     The Bank support is critical in supporting OMVS, SOGEM and the WAPP in
further developing economic exchange for electricity throughout the West Africa region
and particularly through short and medium capacity building programs and investment in
generation, transmission and distribution assets.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
Rating: High

61.    Relevance of objectives: The project objectives and the activities supported by the
Project were, and still are, highly relevant to the power sectors of Mali, Mauritania and
Senegal and regionally, as more electric power becomes available, to the WAPP.
62.     The development of the Felou HEPis in line with the Bank’s regional integration
strategy in Africa which remains a critical piece of the Bank’s strategy to improve
connectivity, leverage economies of scale, and enhance productivity. Furthermore, better
infrastructure is key to promote broader growth, including in manufacturing and services.
More abundant, reliable power is fundamental for competitiveness. Too little electricity
remains the most serious infrastructure obstacle. Tapping Africa’s tremendous potential to
generate its own power from hydro, geothermal, natural gas, and solar resources is a
priority for African countries, including OMVS, and the World Bank Group.

63.   The development of the Felou HEP also strategically complements country-specific
IDA energy lending operations that are ongoing or planned in the OMVS countries of the
Senegal River Basin to increase the power supply to meet the needs of industry, commerce



7
    It has done so at SOGEM’s request, after EEM left.



                                                20
and households. The Felou HEP is aligned with the FY14-15 Mali Interim Strategy Note
on the preparation of the conditions for economic recovery. The growth in domestic
electricity demand resulted in Mali absorbing the entirety of its share (50%) of generation
from the Manantali hydropower scheme. To meet further growth in demand, the
Government adopted a strategy combining more expensive short-term domestic thermal
generation with longer term regional solutions that would result in lower generation costs,
including the construction of an interconnection with Cote d’Ivoire, and development of
Mali’s hydropower potential, estimated at about 1,000MW. Of this potential, about
250MW has been developed so far at the Selingué and Sotuba dams on the Niger River,
and the Manantali dam on the Senegal River. Also on the Senegal River, the Félou hydro
plant will add to the generation mix.
64.      The project supports the two pillars of the Senegal FY13-17 Country Partnership
Strategy of accelerating inclusive growth and creating employment and improving service
delivery which focus on infrastructure investments in the energy sector to improve the
availability of reasonably priced electricity and to reduce the sector’s dependence on costly
thermal generation. The high cost of energy coupled with unreliable supply (especially for
electricity), is a key constraint to private sector growth and also contributes to undermining
the fiscal framework. The challenge for Senegal is to ensure a competitive supply of
electricity in the industrial zones and agricultural areas that have the greatest potential.
Demand had increased by about 10% per year. In 2010, power outages occurred 270 days
out of 365, with the impact of these outages on economic growth as high as 1.4 percentage
points of GDP. Senegal will need to diversify its energy mix, including by attracting
private sector investments and improving sector governance. Senegal’s heavy dependence
on imported oil products for its energy supply has hurt its competitiveness, weakened its
fiscal framework, and continues to severely undermine growth. Investments in low cost
hydropower projects and regional cooperation offer a solution to Senegal’s energy
problem.
65.     The project objectives are also aligned with the two pillars of the Mauritania
Country Partnership Strategy FY14-16 of growth and diversification and, economic
governance and service delivery through developing and expanding growth-supporting
infrastructure, including transport, electric power production, and ICT.
66.      Relevance of Design and Implementation: The project design was basically sound.
The project comprised three components; (i) a large design-build component whose main
objective was the construction of the Felou HEP to meet the energy demand of the
participating utilities; (ii) closely tied to the first component, engineering consulting
services to supplement SOGEM’s capacity in the bidding process and construction
supervision; and (iii) a component comprising the acquisition of information technology
for the management of the OMVS power system. The first two components were tied to
the first project objective which was to increase the quantity of electricity made available
to the participants. The third component was logically tied to the second project objective
which was to develop a nucleus of a well-functioning power pooling mechanism between
OMVS countries. The second objective had no PDO indicator until the additional
financing and the link between this project objective and its PDO indicator was somewhat
tenuous (see Section 2.1 above).

 67.     Improvements in design could have included: a clearer definition of the second
 PDO as well as its indicator with the benefit of hindsight, a more straight forward
 procurement process, although the team was acting on a lesson learned from the Manantali
 project; in pursuing the two-stage bidding process, a capacity building element to support
 SOGEM in its management of the project.

 3.2 Achievement of the Project Development Objectives
 (including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
 outputs in Annex 2)

 Rating: Substantial

 68.    The PDOs, namely: (a) Augment the supply of low cost hydroelectricity from the
 OMVS Power System to the national power utilities of Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal; and
 (b) Develop a nucleus of a well-functioning, cooperative, power pooling mechanism for
 the WAPP Zone “B” OMVS Countries of West Africa, remained unchanged throughout
 the project’s life. A split assessment (more below) is carried out because a PDO indicator
 was added at the time of the approval of the additional financing.

(*) No PDO key outcome indicator was attached to this PDO in the original project. One was introduced
with the additional financing.
 70.    The quantity of electricity generated in December 2014 was 1121 GWh (EDM: 562
 GWh; SENELEC: 346 GWh; and SOMELEC: 213 GWh) or 98.2% of the project target of
 1142 GWh. The target can be considered substantially achieved. It is estimated that
 without the operational problems experienced at Manantali, the energy generated at Felou
 which is close to 300 GWh today would have reached 330 GWh, leading to a total


                                                   22
combined generation of Manantali and Felou close to 1151 GWh. The breakdown of this
composite target of 1121 GWh shows that the electricity off take by SENELEC and
SOMELEC were lower than anticipated and lower that of EDM due to demand and supply
conditions in each country. Manantali and Felou provide the cheapest energy option (about
US$ 0.11 cents/kWh) knowing that the cost of electricity generation is very high as a result
of the region’s high dependence on expensive oil-based thermal generation translating into
high tariffs of US$0.20-30 per kWh still not sufficient to cover the cost of supply.
71.     About 96% of the project’s resources (excluding price contingencies and interest
during construction) were devoted to the achievement of the first objective against only
about 4% to the second objective of the project. Taking into account the relative weights
of the components of the project and the high achievement of the first objective (98.1%) as
well as its high significance to the immediate well-being of the populations of Mali,
Senegal and Mauritania, the overall assessment of the achievement of the project
development objectives is rated as Substantial.
72.     Causal Chain: There was a clear and logical causal chain between all of the
activities that the project was designed to carry out under components 1 and 2 and the
expected attainment of the objective of supplying an increased quantity of low cost
hydroelectricity that OMVS power System supplies to WAPP Zone B OMVS countries.
The logical causal chain between the activities under component 3 and the expected
attainment of the objective to develop a nucleus of a well-functioning, cooperative, power
pooling mechanism for the WAPP Zone “B” OMVS Countries of West Africa was also
relatively clear to follow.
73.   Outputs: A 60 MW capacity run-of- river hydroelectric plant at Felou (Mali)
which was fully commissioned on April 30, 201 and consulting services.
74.      Outcomes: Increased access of consumers of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania to
reliable electricity at an affordable price and increased revenues from the sales of electricity
for SOGEM. The project will also lead to improvements in revenue and operating
efficiency of EDM, SENELEC and SOMELEC through higher sales and fuel substitution
of expensive diesel generation by hydro energy. This will increase their ability to pay their
bills to SOGEM.
75.      With regard to the second project objective of creating a nucleus power pooling
mechanism among OMVS countries, the key PDO level indicator on operating rules on the
basis of sound economic dispatch was reached. The rules that are put in place play a vital
role in ensuring an effective dispatch of the energy produced to the three participating
utilities. The rules for allocation of electricity for Felou were agreed between the members
were 45 percent dispatched to Mali, 30 percent to Mauritania and 25 percent to Senegal.
This allocation adjusted at times to optimize the economic benefits of the electricity
dispatch, for instance in periods were the Manantali hydropower plan experienced
operational problems. The project also helped to build capacity to implement the operating
rules of the jointly owned infrastructure managed by SOGEM more professionally. The
technical and economic management system will be further enhanced with the acquisition
and installation of a SCADA system, which is expected to be acquired under a new OMVS
project under preparation.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Rating: Modest

79.     An economic analysis has been undertaken for the project at completion. The main
quantifiable economic benefits of the project for the three countries are the increased
supply of electricity evaluated at the assumed value of unserved energy of US$0.14/kWh.
However, given that this value is a broad measure for the whole West Africa region per
project preparation documents, a higher value (e.g., increased by 20%) was tested for the
OMVS countries. The economic costs are the total investment cost of the project disbursed
(excluding price contingencies and interest during construction), the operation and
maintenance (O&M) and transmission and distribution costs. The investment costs include
the construction of the plant, equipment and buildings. The O&M costs mainly include
repairs and other regular maintenance costs. The delays are taken into account through the
process of discounting. The cost of delays is simply the difference between the net present
value of the project without delays and the net present value of the project with delays).
The table below summarizes the results of the economic analysis at completion.

            Base case                                            $47.76          14.74%

            20% reduction in sales                                 $7.82         10.84%
            20% increase in value of unserved energy               $89.42        18.42%



81.     This analysis shows that the results of the project are still positive in the base case
but are very sensitive to a reduction in critical variables. This includes the changes in sales
due to, for example, poor hydrology, breakdown of one or both generating sets, incident
on the transmission line, etc.). An increase in the value of unserved energy by 20% would
almost double the NPV.
82.    The economics of the project deteriorated because of the cost overrun that
necessitated the additional financing and the delayed stream of benefits because of the
implementation issues already discussed (see Section 2 above).

83.    Average Incremental Cost (AIC): The average incremental costs indicate the price
which would recover the investment and operating and maintenance costs over the life of
the project. Since these costs are in constant terms, they would need to be adjusted
periodically to take into account the effect of inflation and other real price changes. The
AIC for the average hydrology scenario is US$0.11 US/kWh.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                              27
84.      The project development objectives and design of the project have a high relevance
in terms of increasing the supply of electricity to the OMVS system and to the three
utilities’ power systems that were, and continue to be, subject to severe load shedding. The
overall achievement of the project objectives is rated as satisfactory. The recalculated
efficiency (NPV and IRR) in this ICR confirms the positive efficiency of the project, albeit
lower than either the original or the additional financing because of the cost overrun and
the delays in effectiveness and procurement. The combination of the relevance of
objectives and design, the achievement of the project development objectives and
efficiency ratings, results in an overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

85.      The direct impact of the project on lower-income rural and urban population and
other vulnerable groups was not explicitly taken into consideration at appraisal, and no
poverty analysis was conducted at the preparation stage. Gender issues were not addressed
during the preparation stage nor was the gender impact monitored during the
implementation of the project. However, as a source of clean, renewable energy, the Felou
HEP qualified for carbon emission reduction credits, the proceeds of which are earmarked
for electrification of rural communities that reside along the transmission “right of way” of
the OMVS Power System. Furthermore, there are no adverse indirect and/or long-term
impacts anticipated as a result of the project. The main social development issue in the
project area (Kayes, Bafoulabe) pertains to the negative impacts on fishing activities and
acquisition of about 1.25 ha of land planted with orchards and vegetable gardens for project
facilities. The RAP determined the adequate level of compensation for these losses and the
compensation was effected. The project also implemented additional social enhancement
measures to benefit neighboring villages (Lontou, Bengassi) in the project zone of
influence (e.g. water supply).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

86.     The project’s institutional development impact, which is defined in ICR guidelines
as the extent to which the project “has improved the agency’s or country’s ability to make
effective use of its human and financial resources”, has been modest. The institutional
strengthening provided in this project by a technical assistance in two phases for
preparation, issuance and evaluation of bids and works control and supervision (owners’
engineer). Given the limited scope of work of engineering consultants, this choice was
sub-optimal recruitments of accountants, financial management, environmental and other
specialists were made by SOGEM often late and at the insistence of the Bank.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

87.     Carbon offset: The project also offers a substantial global environmental benefit
related to reduced greenhouse gas emissions: electricity delivered to the grid by the project


                                               28
would have otherwise been generated by the operation of existing or new power plants that
mainly use fossil fuels. The Felou HEP was registered on May 6, 2010 as a Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) project activity according to the standards of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The project has the
potential to generate 1,342,355 Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) for the first seven
years of operation. The Bank signed an Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA)
with SOGEM for the purchase 280,000 Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) on June
29, 2007 under the Spanish Carbon Fund (SCF). The ERPA was later transferred to the
Tranche 2 of the Umbrella Carbon Facility (UCF T2) on December 13, 2011. On January
23, 2015, the ERPA was amended to: (i) capture the delay in the commissioning date, and
(ii) to adjust the contracted CERs volume according to the amended commissioning date
of the project on July 2, 2013. The CER volume contracted under the UCF T2 was reduced
from 734,300 CERs in the original ERPA to 701,665 CERs to be generated from July 2,
2013 to December 31, 2018. Also, the project successfully completed the independent
validation of its compliance report to the World Commission on Dams. In June 2015, the
Felou HEP was issued its first carbon credits of about 90,000 CERs and delivered them to
UCF T2 as a result of the first successful verification, which covered 6 month period from
July 2 to January 1, 2014. This is the second issuance in West Africa (after Nigeria with
cook stoves and gas flaring), and the first issuance for a hydro project in West Africa. The
proceeds are to be earmarked for electrification of rural communities that reside along the
transmission “right of way” of the OMVS Power System. The second verification is
completed and the issuance of about 172,000 CERs for the second reporting period is
expected by end of September 2015. From the carbon finance point of view, the Felou
HEP is demonstrating high performance and should be able to deliver more than the
contracted CERs according to the agreed schedule, if SOGEM maintains the current
monitoring best practices. The registration of the Felou HEP as a CDM activity also
provides a substantial demonstration effect, leading to more development of renewable
energy-based projects and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the region. More
details about the carbon offset are provided in Annex 9.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

88.     The Felou HEP is expected to serve the energy needs of Mali, Senegal and
Mauritania in years to come. There is a modest likelihood that some changes, detrimental
to the project’s main development outcome may occur due to:
   (i)     Technical: (a) poor hydrology; (b) lack of proper maintenance of Manantali
           and Felou HEP installations; and/or

   (ii)    Institutional and Financial: The situation improved significantly in recent years.
           The three participating utilities of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania paid their bills
           to SOGEM regularly even though they themselves are constrained by the tariffs
           allowed nationally by their respective governments and regulatory authorities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.    This ICR assesses the Bank’s performance during identification, preparation, and
appraisal of the project as Moderately Satisfactory.
90.     The Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all major relevant
aspects, such as technical, environmental, financial and economic. Less attention was
given to the institutional, procurement and financial management aspects. A number of
alternatives were considered for the project design and the Bank made use of the transfer
of experience from similar projects such as the Manantali project.
91.     The composition and balance of the Bank team at appraisal was adequate. It
consisted of four core sector specialists, including a hydropower specialist and six fiduciary
and safeguards members, including a senior environmental specialist. However, frequent
changes of task managers (about one task manager every 14 months on average,) may have
been disruptive to dialogue with the implementing agency. The period for the original
project preparation was adequate (four months between the concept review and appraisal).
Strategic choices were made appropriately at the design and preparation stage including:
(i) the focus on two objectives and a few components; and (ii) combining specialized
technical assistance and physical investments. This focus was kept unchanged with the
additional financing of the project.
92.     Some of the potential risks were correctly identified. Some potential risks were not
identified such as hydrology (see Section 2). The risk, posed to SOGEM’s financial
situation by the non-regular payment of bills by EDM, SENELEC and SOMELEC was not
formally identified in the project documentation. Nonetheless, the three utilities were
required, as condition of effectiveness, to open an escrow account to guarantee the payment
of their bills to SOGEM. Eventually, this measure proved ineffective and the level of
arrears remained high. The Bank also drew attention of the authorities about the negative
consequences on SOGEM‘s financial situation of postponing promised tariff adjustments.
Furthermore, there were capacity issues such as SOGEM’s financial management,
environmental and procurement capacity that were not adequately addressed which led to
implementation delays. The original project readiness for implementation could therefore
have been improved through early preparation of bidding documents and the
implementation of capacity building measures. The lack of such measures was one of the
major contributing factors in the slow implementation of component 1 and the non-
implementation of component 3 of the project (see Section 2).
93.     Overall, the project design was basically sound in terms of the focus on two
objectives and the choice of limited number of components, the time for preparation was
adequate and the preparation team was adequately staffed. The project cost was
underestimated, though unforeseen factors came into play and thus necessitated additional



                                              30
financing. The project was extended from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2014 after two
extensions of the closing date. There was no quality at entry review.

94.     Quality at entry, as a whole, is therefore rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.    The quality of project supervision carried out by the Bank is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.
96.     The Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources, and the project was
adequately supervised, except in the early first two years of project implementation. The
quality of supervision reporting in these first two years was poor (e.g., lack of aide
memoires and limited information in ISRs. The quality of supervision reporting improved
markedly in later years and the team's proactive supervision in later years allowed a quick
re-launch and award of bids after allegations of fraudulent and corrupt practices. The
intervention of the Bank was appropriate, well-coordinated, and satisfactory 8 with its
insistence on compliance with financial, environmental and social safeguards as well as the
management of the OMVS power system such as the continuity or choice of another
OMVS System Operator. The team also had the support of management and the comments
on ISRs were very supportive. The Bank's financial management and procurement staff
worked closely with the SOGEM staff to explain the rules and procedures to be applied
during project implementation, with regard to procurement of goods and works, and
selection of consultants, as well as audit requirements, based on the financing agreements.
The financial management aspects of the project were carefully reviewed, and specific
recommendations to strengthen the financial management system were made.
Shortcomings in accounting software were also identified and recommendations made to
address them. Environmental and social specialists were most often associated to
supervision missions to monitor the quality of environmental and social compliance. The
Bank also provided guidance and oversight in the preparation of the operational manual
for SOGEM, the final version of which was completed in July 2010. The last ISR archived
on December 24, 2014 rated the performance of the project achievement of development
objectives and overall implementation progress as moderately satisfactory.
97.    Based on the above the ICR rates the project’s quality of supervision as Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 The supervision mission scheduled for May 26-30, 2014 was cancelled because of the coup d’etat in Mali.
The meetings were therefore held through video conference and the Bank conducted a follow-up field
mission in August 2014 to monitor project implementation progress, and exchange on the operation and
maintenance of the plants and the repair of the Manantali HEP that broke down in April 2013.


                                                   31
98.     The rating of overall Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory, being
moderately satisfactory at entry and moderately satisfactory during supervision with the
rating on overall outcome as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

99.     The Governments of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania’s performance is assessed as
Moderately Satisfactory. The commitment to the ownership of the project and to the
achievement of the project’s development objectives, as discussed in Section 2.1, was
strong at the time of project preparation and appraisal, and remained largely supportive
during implementation, except when it came to tariff adjustments. The Governments did
not have a direct implication in the implementation of the project but had power to decide
on the financing of capital investments, tariff adjustments and implementation
arrangements. For example, in July 2008, they designated SOGEM as the sole
implementing agency while the implementation was earlier shared between OMVS for
component 2 and SOGEM for components 1 and 3 of the project. The three Governments
also pushed for the settlement of arrears to SOGEM by their respective national utilities as
well as accepting, with delay, a tariff increase.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. Implementing agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory for: First, the
implementing agency/agencies were pro-active in very difficult circumstances (war and
civil disturbances) that made it an out-of-norm endeavor. There was, to be sure, Bank
prodding on many issues related to project management: staffing, procurement, financial
management, submission of audit reports and, reporting on environmental and social
safeguards. This is normal in the process of project implementation and Bank advice was
always taken into account and accommodated by the implementing agency. Second, there
was stellar implementation of the environmental and social safeguards. Third, the
dedication of SOGEM’s Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff and its manager in
dealing with implementation challenges (many of which are described above), including
in the procurement of the relatively large number of goods, works (through a complex two-
stage bidding process), and consultancy services and the implementation of the relevant
infrastructure.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

101. The rating of overall Borrower performance is Moderately Satisfactory, being
moderately satisfactory for Governments’ performance and moderately satisfactory for the
implementing agency’s performance with the rating on overall outcome as moderately
satisfactory.




                                            32
Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

102. Capacity building: Although there is more to be done and additional capacity
building measures could have been incorporated into the project, SOGEM has gained
experience and know-how from the implementation of the Felou HEP, including
interactions with large contractors, consultants and donors. The closing of the Felou
project offers an opportunity to: (i) develop a sustainable operation and maintenance of the
OMVS power system; (ii) focus on the safety of dams and the reliability of transmission
lines (in coordination with needed reinforcements of national distribution systems); (iii)
devote some thinking into finding and designing a mechanism to ensure the regular
payment of bills by national utilities to ensure the sustainability and expansion of OMVS
facilities; and (iv) review in depth the capacity of SOGEM to undertake large investments
and develop enhancements in various areas (procurement, project management, accounting
and financial management, environmental compliance, etc.) through reorganization,
staffing and training.
103. Require bidding documents to be ready before Board presentation: Especially
those of major components (e.g., component 1) of large projects and/or those requiring a
two-stage bidding process. The highlight of the Felou project implementation is the
inordinate amount of time taken on a two-stage bidding process to contract the design-build
contractor and the economic losses incurred as a consequence. Requiring bidding
documents to be ready before Board presentation is a step towards addressing this type of
problems, especially when large projects are involved;
104. Address the buildup of accounts receivable: To resolve the recurrent problem
of significant buildup of accounts receivable, grant real (i.e. credible) autonomy to OMVS
System Operator to cut supplies for non-payment of bills and some leeway in tariff
adjustment under a regulatory arrangement to be defined. Another possible and perhaps
more sustainable solution would be a partial credit guarantee(s) by the three governments
of Mali, Senegal and Mauritania to the OMVS System Operator. This (these) guarantee(s)
would be called in case of non-payment by EDM, SENELEC or SOMELEC. The existing
state of play is a threat to the development of OMVS and its three participating utilities but
also to the future of the WAPP. This regional electric power arrangement cannot develop
into a market unless the electricity sellers have some assurance that they will be paid;
105. Plan ahead for the system operator set-up: Hydro projects are relatively cheap
to operate, but the consequences of flawed operation or maintenance can be extremely
severe (safety issues, loss of production, heavy rehabilitation costs even for relatively
recent projects, etc.). Those in charge of O&M must have a strong interest in ensuring the
flawless and sustainable capacity of the project to deliver the services and revenues which
were expected at the investment stage. The overwhelming pattern which can be observed
worldwide is the one by which the owner of the hydro project also assumes O&M
responsibility, possibly with the temporary or permanent assistance of experienced
specialists. Most attempts to have the O&M responsibility borne by a separate (often
foreign) firm which has no long term interest in the project’s performance in term of
reliability, safety, durability, etc. have not been fully satisfying as the Manantali experience
has shown.


                                              33
106. In the case of Manantali, the creation of SEMAF is currently considered as a
temporary arrangement, merely meant to solve the immediate problem of ensuring the
continuing operation of the plant despite Eskom’s departure, with a view of recruiting
another independent operator as soon as possible through competitive bidding. There could
be some merit in analyzing the pros and cons of a reverse proposal, considering that the
independent operator was a temporary approach for the first few years of operation, and
that the creation of the subsidiary would in fact be a first step towards a possibly more
sustainable solution, more consistent with the standard practice, by which the owner retains
O&M responsibility either directly or through a subsidiary. This option would obviously
require providing a strong technical and organizational support to this entity for some years,
with the main objective of increasing the company’s own capacity to eventually be able to
operate largely in an autonomous manner. There would be a key role for the Bank and
other international financial institutions in providing such support.
107. The EEM experience also points out to the necessity of: (a) a trained and competent
staff to negotiate/interact with the independent operator; (b) well financed reserves to
undertake the O&M, including heavy maintenance and to mitigate the effects of a poor
hydrology; (c) a careful drafting of the bidding documents and contract of the System
Operator, whether public or private; and (d) a periodic audit of the System Operator,
including a technical and financial audit.
108. If covenants are imposed, ensure the implementing agency has direct control,
over them. Two financial covenants were imposed on SOGEM requiring it to maintain a
level of accounts receivable of less than 90 days and to have net revenues to be at least 1.2
times the estimated maximum debt service requirements. It was not in the power of
SOGEM to have the level of revenues necessary to meet these covenants. Those who could
have made the fulfillment of these covenants possible were the three national utilities (by
paying their bills regularly) and their respective governments/regulatory agencies (by
authorizing tariff adjustments when justified). In the case of SOGEM, the two financial
covenants that were imposed were not credible and the lack of compliance with at least one
of them and the cyclical compliance with the other were not unexpected.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

109. On July 7, 2015, SOGEM provided the Bank with its own evaluation of the
implementation of the Felou HEP9. A summary of this evaluation is given in Annex 7. Its
main conclusions are the following:
      The works were carried out to the satisfaction of all project actors;
      All performance indicators have been met;

                                                34
      All performance tests were judged satisfactory by the consulting engineer and the
operational acceptance was pronounced on April 30, 2014;
      The supporting and mitigation measures to the negative impacts of the project have
been put in place in line with the recommendations of the ESMP and the RAP. The regular
follow up by the World Bank has contributed to the achievement of this result.
      Following the environmental and social management audit which took into account
the observations/comments of the World Bank, the Malian Ministry in charge of the
Environment has indicated to SOGEM its agreement with the findings;
      Since the power generation began, the rate of availability of the generators is more
than 98% and the energy produced as of June 30, 2015 is 600 GWh;
      The closing of IDA on December 31, has put a stop to the procurement process of
Component 3. SOGEM has considered putting this component in the new project now
being prepared.
      Finally, the project has been implemented within the limits of the available
financing.
(b) Cofinanciers

110.    The EIB commented on this ICR as follows. (see also Annex 8)
“…..We agree on the content of the report and share its conclusions, especially with regard
to the assessment and the weaknesses of SOGEM and the lessons learned section.
However, if you allow us, the following two items could be taken in consideration for the
final version of the Completion report:
- The Sinohydro underestimation of highest floods /size of diversions/coffer dams (that
resulted into twice flooding of the construction site)
- The Claim/acceptance/defect situation between Sinohydro and SOGEM would be useful
to explain more in detail in the PCR, especially as Sinohydro remains under contract with
SOGEM for the time being” .
111. WB comment: In accordance with the Bank’s decision, a partial amount of the
claims were cleared. Since the project is now closed, the balance will be borne by SOGEM.

Component 2: Consulting Services – Project Cycle Management. Experienced
engineering consulting firms provided comprehensive project cycle management support
to oversee the design, construction and commissioning of the hydroelectric plant at Felou
through a two-stage sequential contracting arrangement, as follows:
           a. Phase 1 ("Transaction Adviser"). A consulting firm to provided
              transaction advice and support to: (a) carry out detailed planning and
              scheduling of project implementation arrangements, including pre-
              qualification of bidders, (b) prepare and issue bidding documents for the
              selection of an independent contractor, (c) prepare a comprehensive set of
              power supply agreements for use by the OMVS Power System Operator,
              and (d) conduct the two-stage bidding process, evaluate bids and make
              recommendation for the award of the design-build contract; and
           b. Phase 2 ("Owner's Engineer"). An experienced consulting engineering
              firm was recruited to oversee the day-to-day performance of the design-
              build contractor until the fully operational Felou hydroelectric plant was
              handed over to the OMVS Power System Operator; and

                     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      At appraisal in 2006, a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) was carried out to assess the
economic viability of the Felou hydroelectric project. In 2009, a new BCA was carried out
with the additional financing. At completion, the economic efficiency is assessed again.
2.      To ensure comparability with the appraisal and additional financing estimates, the
economic analysis at project completion adopted the same methodology, and in some cases,
the same unit valuations, such as those for the value of unserved energy (USD0.14/kWh
and USD0.12/kWh for the original project and the additional financing respectively) and
the average sales out of the Felou hydroelectric project (HEP).
3.        However, due to the long project implementation period expanding almost a
decade, the benefit streams were delayed by about four years. The main project benefit,
the electricity generated at Felou, will be shared between the shareholder countries of Mali,
Mauritania and Senegal. In the context of the economic analysis, the rules for allocation of
electricity for Felou will be as agreed between the members, i.e. Mali: 45%, Mauritania:
30% and Senegal: 25%.
4.      The investment costs include the construction of the machinery and equipment,
buildings, and land purchase. The O&M costs include mainly repair and maintenance costs.
Transmission and distribution have also been included.
5.        At appraisal, a cost-benefit analysis was undertaken to ascertain the economic
justification of the Felou HEP. Costs included the capital and operating costs of the Felou
HEP. As the analysis was presented into a condensed form, it is not at all clear if
transmission and distribution costs were taken into account. Benefits included mainly the
sale of energy. At appraisal, the reduced CO2 emissions and carbon revenues were also
estimated. However, these revenues were a minor benefit in the economic justification and
were not taken into account in the economic analysis of the additional financing. They are
not also taken into account at completion though they are described in detail in this report.
Benefits are valued at the value of unserved energy in the ECOWAS region of USD 0.14
used as a proxy for customer willingness to pay for incremental electricity supply. The
economic rate of return as estimated at the time of appraisal was 30% and the NPV was
estimated at about USD 221 million. This is in sharp contrast to the economic values found
at additional financing and at completion stages. The cost of the project has, of course,
increased with the additional financing and benefits were delayed. The project is still
economically justified with a largely positive NPV and an economic rate of return higher
that the assumed discount rate of 10%. The cost of the delays is given by the difference
between the NPV without delays and the NPV of the project with delays.
                                                     NPV
                                                                  IRR (%)
                                                  (USD million)
                 At appraisal                         221            30
                 At Additional financing               62           14
                 At Completion                         48           15

6.       However, the sensitivity analysis whose results are shown below shows that these
positive results are very vulnerable to a reduction in sales (due for example to a poor

hydrology or an incident at the plant that would prevent it from delivering the assumed
quantity of energy) and to the assumed value of unserved energy.

7.      Average Incremental Cost (AIC): The average incremental costs indicate the price
which would recover the investment and operating and maintenance costs over the life of
the project. Since these costs are in constant terms, they would need to be adjusted
periodically to take into account the effect of inflation and other real price changes. The
AIC for the average hydrology scenario is 0.11 US$/kWh.

         Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.     On July 7, 2015, SOGEM provided the Bank with its own evaluation of the
implementation of the Felou hydroelectric project (HEP)10. A summary of which is given
below:
2.        The report provides some important dates in the life of the project and describes
the status of implementation of components 1 and 3, the environmental and social
management plan, carbon offset component, the beefed up security around the Felou
installations, the operation of the power plant and the financial claims of the Design Build
contractor. It also describes a number of difficulties encountered during implementation.
3.         Its main conclusions are the following:
     -    The works were carried out to the satisfaction of all project actors;
     -    All performance indicators have been met;
     -    All performance tests were judged satisfactory by the consulting engineer and the
          operational acceptance was pronounced on April 30, 2014;
     -    The supporting and mitigation measures to the negative impacts of the project have
          been put in place in line with the recommendations of the ESMP and the RAP. The
          regular follow up by the World Bank has contributed to the achievement of this
          result;
     -    Following the environmental and social management audit which took into account
          the observations/comments of the World Bank, the Malian Ministry in charge of
          the Environment has indicated to SOGEM its agreement with the findings;
     -    Since the power generation began, the rate of availability of the generators is more
          than 98% and the energy produced as of June 30, 2015 is 600 GWh;
     -    The closing of IDA on December 31, has put a stop to the procurement process of
          Component 3. SOGEM has considered putting this component in the new project
          now being prepared; and
     -    Finally, the project has been implemented within the limits of the available
          financing.

4.      The European Investment Bank (EIB) commented on this ICR as follows: (*)
5.     “As requested you will find below our comments on the Implementation
Completion and results report for the Felou Hydroelectric project.
6.       We agree on the content of the report and share its conclusions, especially with
regard to the assessment and the weaknesses of SOGEM and the lessons learned section.
However, if you allow us, the following two items could be taken in consideration for the
final version of the Completion report:
- The Sinohydro underestimation of highest floods /size of diversions/coffer dams (that
resulted into twice flooding of the construction site); and
- The Claim/acceptance/defect situation between Sinohydro and SOGEM would be useful
to explain more in detail in the PCR, especially as Sinohydro remains under contract with
SOGEM for the time being”

G. Supervision of Carbon Finance Operations Guidelines

According to the Bank Guidelines (Office Memorandum, December 1, 2011) oversight
(supervision and monitoring) of Carbon Finance operations is conducted in two phases: (a) the
implementation phase, from effectiveness of the ERPA to project completion; and (b) the
monitoring phase, from project completion to termination of the ERPA. Between these phases,
oversight responsibility is transferred from the Region to GCCCF. Since the Project is fully
operational and capable of generating emission reductions, the present ICR summarizes the
achievements of this project, and issues and lessons learned, in order to transfer it to GCCCF for
the monitoring phase.

2. ACHIEVEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

2.1    Basic project description and summary of any significant changes since Emission
Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) signature

2.1.1 The OMVS Felou Hydroelectric Project reduces greenhouse gas emission through the
supply of clean energy which displaces fossil-fuel based electricity generation to the interconnected
grid in the sub-region including Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. Total installed capacity of the
project is 63.45 MW consisting of 3 Bulb-type turbines, with a predicted gross power generation
of 333.5 GWh per annum.

2.1.2 Sponsored by the governments of Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal, acting through the High
Commission of the Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Sénégal (OMVS), the project
was developed and overseen by the Société de Gestion de l’Energie de Manantali (SOGEM). The
operation of the project was contractually delegated to a grid operator.

2.1.3 The Félou hydroelectric project was designed in 2006 to alleviate power supply deficits in
WAPP
Zone “B” OMVS countries (Mali, Mauritania and Senegal) by augmenting the supply of low cost
hydroelectricity. The project has the potential to generate 1,342,355 Certified Emission Reductions
(CERs) for the first seven years of operation. The Bank signed an Emission Reduction Purchase
Agreement (ERPA) with SOGEM for the purchase 280,000 Certified Emissions Reductions
(CERs) on June 29, 2007 under the Spanish Carbon Fund (SCF). The ERPA was later transferred
to the Tranche 2 of the Umbrella Carbon Facility (UCF T2) on December 13, 2011. On January 23,
2015, the ERPA was amended to: (i) capture the delay in the commissioning date, and (ii) to adjust
the contracted CERs volume according to the amended commissioning date of the project on July
2, 2013. The CER volume contracted under the UCF T2 was reduced from 734,300 CERs in the
original ERPA to 701,665 CERs to be generated from July 2, 2013 to December 31, 2018.

2.1.4 As a source of clean renewable energy, the OMVS Felou Hydroelectric Project generates
carbon emission reductions, the proceeds of which were earmarked for electrification of rural
communities that reside along the transmission “right of way” of the OMVS Power System.

2.2 Project implementation and commissioning
2.2.1 Original Project Development Objective: the original PDO of the Félou HEP was to
generate electricity and GHG emissions reductions from a run-of-the-river hydroelectric
installation on the Senegal River in Mali. The Félou project will deliver clean energy to national
power utilities in the sub-region (Mali, Mauritania and Senegal) and the GHG credits to
international buyers through the creation of additional 63.45 MW 11 of installed hydropower
generation capacity at an existing weir of an old 600 kW hydroelectric facility. The construction
and operation of the Félou HEP is supported by financing from the International Development
Agency (IDA) under the WAPP APL 2 - OMVS Félou Hydroelectric Project and from the
European Investment Bank (EIB). The Félou HEP started delivering electricity to the grid on July
2, 2013 and can supply 320-350 GWh to the interconnected grid displacing the same amount of
electricity from existing fossil fuel based plants in the regional grid.




11
     Total nameplate capacity of three generators.



                                                 54
2.2.2 The Félou HEP was registered as a CDM project on May 6, 2010. So far, 90,237 CERs
have been issued and delivered to UCF T2, corresponding to the first verification, which covered
the period from July 2 to January 1, 2014. The second verification is completed and the issuance
of about 172,000 CERs for the second reporting period are expected by end of September 2015.
The project preparation costs incurred have been reimbursed to SCF from the payment made for
the first CERs issued as stipulated in the UCF T2 ERPA. As of June 2015, approximately 90% of
contract ERs remain to be delivered under the UCF T2 ERPA. The project successfully completed
the validation of the compliance report to the World Commission on Dams.

2.2.3 As per the PAD and PDD, SOGEM committed to provide electricity to selected villages
surrounding the project site. As part the resettlement action plan (RAP), three villages (Médine,
Lontou and Bengassi) in the OMVS priority rural electrification program were electrified with grid
electricity. The project supports the local community development with its plan to electrify seven
more villages through connection to the grid. These villages Kaffa, Kounda, Fatola Mamoubougou,
Lomba, Keniou and Boteguekourou. SOGEM will use revenues from the sales of carbon credits to
finance the electrification of these villages. A special rural electrification account was created to
hold the payment of carbon revenues.

2.3     Monitoring, reporting, verification and issuance of emission reductions

2.3.1 The monitoring of Félou HEP has been carried out by SOGEM in accordance with the
Monitoring Plan as described in the PDD12. With the Bank’s support, SOGEM has prepared all
monitoring reports.

3. BANK AND PROJECT ENTITY PERFORMANCE

3.1     Assessment and rating of overall Bank performance

3.1.1 Overall, the Bank’s performance has been Moderately Satisfactory in regards of the carbon
finance operations. The Bank’s involvement was critical in the CDM registration and verification
stages. Since the beginning of the project, the Bank has collaborated closely with SOGEM and has
built the capacity needed to overcome many of the obstacles the project encountered, such as the
concerns raised by the designated operational entity (DOE) during the verification stage on the
project’s installed capacity and monitoring system alignment with the registered PDD.

3.2      Assessment and rating of overall project entity performance

3.2.1 The performance of SOGEM is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory for the parent project.
However, the project entity performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory in regards of the carbon
operation because of the delay in the commissioning date. SOGEM has complied with all of the
obligations and requirements expected, such as assisting with the development of the PDD,
implementing the monitoring plan, executing the resettlement action plan and compensation of
local stakeholders, (i.e., municipalities, communities, and nongovernmental organizations).
SOGEM monitors the performance of the equipment to ensure compliance with the PDD and
implements the Environmental Management and Monitoring Plans. SOGEM is complying with the
safeguards of the WAPP APL 2 - OMVS Félou Hydroelectric Project (the parent project).

4.      BENEFITS, TARGET POPULATION, AND RATE OF SUCCESS

4.1      The OMVS Félou Hydroelectric Project was the first CDM project registered in a regional
project, and the first hydro project to issue CERs in West Africa. ERs have been calculated using
information verified by a DOE, an “independent auditor accredited by the CDM Executive Board
to verify whether implemented projects have achieved planned greenhouse gas emission
reductions,” as well as the CERs issued by the CDM Executive Board. Estimated electricity
generated has also been extracted from these reliable sources.

4.2     Three villages were electrified. As more CERs are certified by the UNFCCC, more
resources will be used for the implementation of the rural electrification activities. For that purpose,
SOGEM created a special rural electrification account to receive carbon credits payments and track
the use of the fund.

5.      COMMENTS FROM PROJECT ENTITY AND OTHER PARTNERS

5.1     SOGEM contributed to the preparation of this Implementation Completion and Results
(ICR) report, providing the Bank ICR team with information and data, and facilitating site visits.
SOGEM also provided the lessons learned section, and the information to describe Félou HEP’s
commissioning and implementation experiences. SOGEM participated in regular Bank
supervision and safeguard missions.

6.      SAFEGUARDS COMPLIANCE

6.1     Four safeguards policies were triggered: Environment assessment (Full, Category A
project) (OP/BP 4.01); Involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); Dam safety (OP/BP 4.37) and
Projects on international waterways (OP/BP 7.40)

6.2       There were no significant and/or irreversible impacts expected from the Project nor adverse
indirect and/or long-term impacts foreseen as a result of project activities. The main social
development issues in the project area (Kayes/ Bafoulabe) related to the negative impacts on fishing
activities and acquisition of 1.25 ha of land planted with orchards and vegetable gardens for project
facilities as well as the interruption of the power supply from the small existing run-of-river power
plant at Felou during the construction of the Project. The latter temporary impact was mitigated by
the provision of electricity with a supply from the site generator.

6.3     An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were
prepared and disclosed prior to project appraisal. The RAP determined the adequate level of
compensation for the loss of assets resulting from the acquisition of 1.25 ha of land.


                                                  56
6.4     The Project also implemented additional social enhancement measures to benefit
neighboring villages (Lontou, Bengassi) in the Project zone of influence. A large part of the
mitigation measures (particularly infrastructure improvements) was implemented as part of the
main design and built contract. The last ISR of September 2014 rated the compliance with
environmental safeguards as moderately satisfactory because of the lack of reporting by SOGEM
particularly on the status of implementation of the RAPs.

7.      LESSONS LEARNED

7.1      Capacity building and climate change awareness. As in many countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa, several capacity building activities were conducted in Mali financed by donors and
multilateral agencies. However, little has been achieved in terms of the retention of the capacity
because of the lack of direct connection between these capacity building initiatives and concrete
projects on the ground. The Félou hydro power project was able to bring this real case in the region,
providing the ground for practicing greenhouse gas accounting. The Bank was able to help develop
a CDM capacity within SOGEM and more importantly to raise awareness on carbon and climate
finance at the company management level as well as at the level of governing bodies of the OMVS.

7.2      Carbon finance to provide benefits to local communities. The project is unique in its
design where at the early stage, the project entity with support from the World Bank has decided
to use the revenues from the sales of carbon credits to support local development through the
electrification of villages. The decision is supported by the OMVS and additional climate finance
are sought to provide energy access to rural communities.

7.3     Independent nature of CDM project cycle and Bank capability to deal with it. Access
to project development financing and CDM project registration is key to maximizing the benefits
from CDM projects. In this case, a Project Idea Note was submitted to the Bank in June 2006, and
the project was registered in December 2010 with many challenges such as the demonstration of
additionality using barriers analysis. Later on, the registered PDD was revised to take into account
the monitoring system implemented on the ground and simplify the system. The Bank was able to
support SOGEM to navigate through the CDM pitfalls and implement a smooth monitoring system.

7.4     Replication effect. The Felou hydropower project was the first CDM project to issue CERs
in West Africa. Within SOGEM, this achievement created strong interest to explore additional
climate finance opportunities, to support local development. The lessons learnt will be useful to the
OMVS where the hydro potential remains untapped, when countries like Guinea are included.

8.      JUSTIFICATION FOR MOVING TO THE SECOND PHASE (CARBON
        FINANCE MONITORING PHASE) AND SAFEGUARDS COMPLIANCE

8.1     Compliance with safeguards and implementation challenges in the first phase -
supervision phase

8.1.1 The project was rated A due to environmental and social safeguards which were triggered
during implementation. During implementation, suitable measures were taken to mitigate these
safeguard issues.

8.2     Project entity’s capacity to carry out key functions related to safeguard requirements




                                                 57
8.2.1   SOGEM’s capacity to address safeguards was satisfactory.

8.3      Potential issues in post completion operation, including project entity’s capacity and
ability of the project to deliver the contracted ERs

8.3.1 No issues are likely to arise in the post completion of the project. Emission reductions are
on schedule for delivery, as estimated.

8.4     Justification for moving to the second phase - carbon finance monitoring phase

8.4.1 All safeguard requirements are fulfilled and the ESMP is fully complied with. No
substantial outstanding material issues exist and no potential issue is anticipated during the
remaining term of the ERPA. The environmental audit of the Felou HEP which was due within six
months of the closing of the project was received. Its conclusions are that: (i) every person affected
has been equitably compensated and complaints resolved to the satisfaction of the parties; (ii) the
measures included in the RAP have been for the most part implemented; (iii) the mechanisms of
dispute resolution have worked well; and (iv) there has been an improvement in the social
conditions such as through the provision of potable water supply.

8.4.2 For the remaining monitoring activity, SOGEM has the capacity to operate the project and
to carry out key functions related to safeguards requirements. The monitoring system is proven to
be suitable, and the risk was assessed as minimal at the time of the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR).

8.5.   Recommendations and guidance for project monitoring in the second phase - carbon
finance monitoring phase
8.5.1 The team noted considerable efforts in the implementation of safeguard mitigation
measures. The detailed action plan showed that all planned mitigation measures under Sinohydro
(the Design Build contractor) or OMVS responsibility were satisfactorily implemented.

8.5.2 As of today, all major safeguard issues and compensation are closed. However, the team
should continue to monitor on yearly basis the implementation of rural electrification activities.
The environmental audit recommends a number of minor corrective measures, part of the ESMP,
to be addressed by SOGEM/SINOHYDRO while Felou is still under the operating warranty (e.g.
Reforestation of the site, follow up on the maintenance of the trash management system and a plan
of what would become of the Sinohydro’s base camp now that the work was completed).
