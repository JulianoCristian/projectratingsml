The proposed project will assist DBSI\n            in providing needed finance for production investments in\n            the agricultural, industrial, commerce, transportation and\n            service sectors for the period 1981-82.  The co-financing\n            arrangements have been agreed with ADB according to a Letter\n            of Credit Administration under which ADB will be the lead\n            co-financing institution and will be responsible for the\n            supervision of the project.  The proposed project is\n            expected to benefit about 500 subborrowers whose total fixed\n            investment cost is estimated at US$8.4 million.  The\n            subprojects would help increase the involvement of the\n            indigenous population in the economy and would generate much\n            needed opportunities for earning cash incomes.  The risks\n            associated with the project stem from DBSI's relative\n            lack of experience in development banking."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
