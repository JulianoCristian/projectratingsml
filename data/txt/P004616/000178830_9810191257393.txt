PROJECT FOCUS DESIGN AND RATIONALE
1.        The Solomon Islands economy consists of a faL.3.y
large subsistence sector which accounts for about 44 per cent
of gross domestic product (GDP). Agriculture (including
forestry, livestock and fisheries) is the mainstay of the
economy, accounting for 70 per cent of GDP and about 90 per
cent of the country's exports. To ensure continued economic
growth for the maximum benefit of Solomon Islanders and to
encourage investment to create employment and cash income,
the country's second National Development Plan (1980-1984)
aims at spending $230 million equivalent -- or more than
double that of the previous Plan which has been completed
successfully.
*2.        In order to create proper credit and promotional
facilities for furthering economic development, the Bank
provided three technical assistance grants to the Government
of Solomon Islands to set up the Development Bank of Solomon
Islands as a full-fledged development financing institution
(DFI). Bank technical a.ssistance included the provision of
the services of an expert to serve as DBSI's chief executive
and-to train a Solomon Islander to ultimately take over this
position. DBSI's organiz ation, management, staff, operating
policies and procedures have improved and are generally
satisfactory. A Solomon Islander has been appointed as General
Manager and is expected to assume his new responsibilities in th
beginning of February 1981. DBSI's operational and financial
performance has also been satisfactory and utilization of
the first Bank loan has been ahead of schedule. DBSI remains
a suitable vehicle for financing development projects and
channeling Bank funds to prospective sub-borrowers efficiently.
3,        The Bank's proposed second loan of $2.0 million
(with which US$1.5 million would be co-financed by IDA) would
contribute towards the achievement of the objectives of the
Second Plan (NDP II) by: (i) augmenting DBSI's foreign
currency resources for the purpose of making medium and long-
term loans to meet the foreign exchange cost of projects in
the agriculture, manufacturing, transport and services sectors$
and (ii) assisting DBSI in its efforts to continue improving
its institutional aspects. The Bank loan will meet part of
DBSI's foreign currency requirements for 1981-1982. DBSI will
repay the loan to the Government of Solomon Islands as per a
fixed amortization schedule over a period of 15 years with 6
years grace, while DBSI will extend subloans for much
shorter periods. DBSI will use the (funds received from)

repayments of (the principal of) the subloans not yet due
for repaynt to the Government to make further loans in
accordanrwi with its Policy Statement. The Bank loan,
therefore, would also help DBSI in meeti   its local currency
fund requirements. The foreign exchange risk on the ank
subloans will be borne by the Gover   nt.
4.        Since its establishment in January 1978, DBSI has
made a significant contribution tQ the development of projects
and entrepreneurs    ng Solomon Islanders for whom DBSI is
the main source of financial assistance, From January 1978
through September 1980  DBSI had approved' 2,852 loans amounting to
SI$7.9 million; of these 2,513 (or 88 per cent by number)
were small loans of only up to SI$1,000,
5.        The beneficiaries of the proposed loan are expected
to be about 500 subprojects; about 4() per cent of the loan
would be allocated to subprojects in agriculture, rural develop-
ment and natural resources development; 30 per cent. to manufac-
turing and construction; and 30 per cent to comrce, services
and transport. The total fixed cost of the projects to be
assisted out of the proposed Bank loan is estimated at US$8.4
million; DBSI's share in the financing of the cost of these
projects is estimated at US$5.6 million (including the Bank
loan and IDA Credit for a combined total of US$3.5 million)
or 65 per cent. These projects are expected to generate ad-
ditional employment and cash income for about 2,833 people
and contribute annual value added estimted at US$6.5 million.
The annual total income of the 2,833 people to benefit frao this
second loanwould increase by about US$4.5 million which works
out to an annual income of US$1,585 per family.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Bank has so far provided three technical
assistance grants to the Development Bank of Solomon .Islands
(DBSI) and its predecessor, the Agricultural and Industrial
Loans Board (AILB) and one loan of US$2.0 million for DBSI±:/.
The first technical assistance grant financed a study on the
feasibility of converting AILB into a full-fledged development
finance institution (DFI).- The second technical assistance
was granted to set up and manage the institution and train
staff for the eventual takeover of supervision and manage-
ment by Solomon Islanders. As a result of two technical
assistance projects, the Development Bank of Solomon Islands
(DBSI) was established on 1 January 1978.
2.        In April 1979 the Bank approved a US$2.0 million
credit line to Solomon Islands for DBSI. Along with the loan,
a third technical assistance grant was given to extend the
services of the Bank Consultant as DBSI's General Manager
for two years. The loan became effective on 2 July 1979 and
its use has been much faster than expected.
3.        In March 1980 the Government of Solomon Islands
requested the Bank for a second loan for DBSI to meet its
foreign currency fund requirements for 1981-1982. An
Appraisal Mission visited Solomon Islands from 9 April t980
to 26 April 1980. The Appraisal Mission was composed of
S. Mirza (Senior Development Bank Specialist) as ".8ssion
Chief; Tocher Mitchell (Financial Analyst); and Valerie San
Lin (Financial Analyst). The Mission was assisted by A. H.
Mufti (Counsel) in the Bank. The Mission concluded that the
progress in utilization of the first Bank loan and the third
technical assistance had been satisfactory and that a second
Bank loan was justified. However, loan processing was

II. BACKGROUND
A. The Economic S
4.        The economy of Solomon Islands11 has a dual character
comprising an indigenous subsistence sector with about two-
thirds of the population engaged in non-cash agriculture, and
a monetized sec.tor,- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1978 at
current prices was estimated at SI$81.7 million, of which
about 44 per cent was contributed by subsistence production.
5.        Agriculture (including livestock, forestry and fisher-
ies), is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for over 70 per
cent of GDP and about 90 per cent of the country's exports.  In
recent years there has been an enlargement and diversification
in the base of agriculture production. Copra continues to be
the most important cash crop, and the smallholder sector accounts
for about 70 per cent of total production. While production from
the plantation sector is relatively stable at about 10,000 tons
a year, smallholder production fluctuates widely being more
sensitive to price and the availability of transport. In the
late 1970s cocoa production revived with the development of a
disease-resistant variety suited to local soil conditions, and
the high world prices in 1977 and 1978. During 1-977 and 1978
cocoa production in the smalliolder sector increased its share
in total pmduction from 29 per cent to 46 per cent.   Palm oil
and rice, meanwhile, have been successfully cultivated on large
scale plantations. The potential for the development of small-
holder farming also exist ; Li cattle, fisheries and garden vege-
tables. It is in these areas that rural credit facilities and
promotional and cooperative activities are required to transform
rural non-cash agriculture into monetized economic activities.
6.        Manufacturing, construction and conmercial activities
are centered in Honiara and constitute a '1u   but rapidly
expanding sector, accounting for a l1Ltle over 4,000 workers
-- or about 25 per cent of total employment -- at the end of
1978. Expansion of manufacturing and processing in joint ven-
tures with foreign investors, where appropriate, is being
emphasized by t.Ie Government to strengthen the base of the
economy. This is assisted by the provision of credit from
DBSI and commercial banks. Recent developments include the
1/ The country's total land area is about 29,000 sq km and

establishment of a palm oil mill, a rice mill, a saw mill, and
a tuna canning factory. Private sector activities inc-lude
retail and wholesale trade, transportation, building ponstruc-
tion, and saw milling. A range of small-scale manufacturing
activities exists such as baking, furniture making, canoe build-
ing, cocoa and copra processing, metal works, and handicrafts.
7.        Localization1/ of domestic industries and business
activities has been slow due to a shortage of skills and capital
among local nationals.  In order to accelerate the process of
greater national participation in the economy, the Government
is actively promoting cooperative activities. The nu-mber of
cooperatives increased from 110 in 1968 to 250 at the end of
March 1980; the largest number (173 cooperatives) were multi-
purpose (stores/produce/marketing) in nature followed by 34
consumer, 14. land purchase development, 10 for cocoa marketing
and the rest for fishing, saw milling, savings, transportation
and others.
8.        The major objectives of the second National Develop-
ment Plan (NDP II) 1980-1984 are:   (i) to ensure the continued
growth of the economy by developing the country' s resources
for the maximum benefit of Solomon Islanders; (ii) to expand
and diversify exports and promote self-reliance; (iii) to
encourage a wide geographical and social distribution of eco-
nomic activity; and (iv) to increase investment to create,
employment and cash income. Emphasis will also be placed on
educationi and training in order to increase the supply of
local skilled manpower.  The total public development expendi-
ture during NDP II is set at about SI$230 million, or more than
double that of the previous Plan.
B. Financial Institutions
9.        The financial system in Solomon Islands is simple
and has developed to meet the country's needs.   Financial
institutions of the Solomon Islands include: The Solomon
Islands Monetary Authority (SIMA), DBSI, the Government Share-
holding Agency (GSA), National Provident Fund (NPF); and three com-
mercial banks.  SIMA,established in October 1976, performs
certain central banking functions; it advises the Gc''rernmernt
on currency management and exchange control administration,
oversees the development and operaticn of the banking system

-5-
and provides banking services to commercial banks and the
Government. DBSI was established in 1978 as the main deve-
lopment finance institution to meet various credit needs in
the private sector.
10.       GSA was established in September 1977 to manage the
Government's investment portfolio in latge development projects,
mainly joint ventures. GSA's portfolio increased from SI$4.9
million (US$5.6 million) in 9 projects at the end of 1978 to
SI$6.81 million (US$7.83 million) in ten projects at the end
of 1979, including all of DBSI's share capital (see paragraph
21). NPF started operations in October 1976. Its funds are
from compulsory social insurance contributions of all wage and
salary earners in the country. NPF's assets increased from
SI$2.3 million at the end of 1978 to SI$5.0 million at the end
of 1979, including SI$2.5 million in investments which comprise
mainly term deposits with comnercial banks and some real estate
loans to the private sector.
11.       Branches of three foreign commercial banks operate
in the country: Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia,
Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation and Mongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation. As of 31 December 1979,
their total deposits amounted to SI$43.8 million (demand depo-
sits, SI$12.2 million; time deposits, US$24 million and sav-
ings deposits, SI$7.6 mi J4ion) while their loans and advances
totalled SI$13.4 million- . Most of their liquidity is depo-
sited with SIMA. The total amount of commercial bank deposits
with SIMA at the end of 1979 stood at SI$21.6 million, of which
about two-thirds was in the form of 180 day term deposits.
Deposits in the banking system in Solomon Islands are
dominated by institutional savers, viz. Copra Board, NPF and
the Port Authority. Since March there has been a steady dec-
line in the amount of total depoits within the banking system
because of a decline in prices of copra and an increase
in loans. With a view to mobilizing these excess funds for
the country's development activities, the Government
1/ As of 30 November 1979, total advances amounted to SI$9.3
million. Of these about 47 per cent were to the services
sector, 26 per cent to the agriculture (including forestry
and fisheries) sector, 9 per cent to the manufacturing and
construction sector while the remaining 18 per cent was to
individuals.



-6-
floated bonds amounting to SI$1.5 million in 1979 and
SI$2.0 million in 1980 wUt.ch were fully subscribed.  Lt.is ex-
pected that in 1981 SI$3 million would be borrowed domestically,
During the current Plan period the Government plans to borrow
about SI$20 million from local commercial banks to finance
various development projects which will cover about 9 per cent
of total development expenditure.
12.       In its efforts to further mobilize domestic resources
and channel available funds through appropriate institutions,
the Government is in the process of establishing a commercial
bank, namely National Bank of Solomon Islands, as a joint ven-
ture with the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia, by acquir-
ing the existing assets of its branches in Honiara and the pro-
vinces. The National Bank of Solomon Islands will offer all
general commercial banking services with special emphasis on
responding to the needs of Solomon Islands' business in genetal
and to the rural areas in particular. The new bank is expected
to start operations and st:aff training in the near future and
will establish branches and agencies throughout the Solomon
Islands.
13.       There has been no change in the interest,rates in
the country since the first Appraisal in February 1979. Inte-
rest rates are fixed by the financial institution3 in informal
consultations with each other. The rates offered by SIMA on
the deposits of the cominercial banks range from 4.25 to 8.0
per cent a year depending upon maturity. These rates indirectly
influence the deposit and lending rates of the commercial banks.
Their deposit rates range between 4.0 and 7.0 per cent while
their lending rates range between 10.35 and 14 per cent. DBSI's
lending rates vary between 4 to 11 per cetic (see paragraph 41).
The interest rate structure prevailing in Solomon Islands as
of 31 March 1980 is given in Appendix 1.

III. ESTABLISHMENT AND OWNERSHIP
A. Bank Technical Assistance
14.       Since its establishment in 1955, AILB had made a
limited contribution to the economic development of Solomon
Islands. In order that AILB could contribute more meaning-
fully towards implementing the objectives of the First
National Development Plan 1975-1979, the Government, in
August 1973, requested the Bank for technical assistance.
15.       Under the first technical assistance, the Bank
financed the services of two experts for five man-months
to study the feasibility of converting AILB into a full-
fledged DFI. This study indicated that Solomon Islands
needed a DFI to channel development credit and recommended
that AILB should be suitably upgraded to achieve this objective.
The second technical assistance fir4anced the services of a
Senior Institutional Expert for 18 months and a Loan Operations
Expert for 12 months0 The technica' assistance was completed
in April 1979 after a six month extension in the term of the
Senior Institutional Expert. DBSI was established on
1 January l978. Initially, the Senior Institutional Expert
and (after expiry of his term in August 1978) the Loan Opera-
tions Expert, acted as DBSI's Chief Executive. In order to
provide sound management and training skills, with a view to
gradually delegating supervisory and management functions to
Solomon Islanders, a third technical assistance grant was
approved (with the first loan of US$2 ,0 million) in April
1979 extending the services of the Loan Operations Expert
as General Manager by two years to June 1981.
B. Establishment
16.       DBSI was established as a public authority under
the Development Bank of Solomon Isleatds Act (the Act) enacted
in December 1977. It started operat-ions on 1 January 1978
when it assumed all of AILB's assets and liabilities. The
Act, prepared in consultation with the Bank, provides a
satisfactory legal framework for DBSI's functions as a multi-
purpose and autonomous DFI. DBSI's main objective is to
assist in the economic and social development of the Solomon
Islands within the Government's overall development plans
and strategies, giving particular emphasis to promoting the
participation of Solomon Islanders in economic development,



-8-
rural development and stimulation of processing and industrial
activities,  To implement these objectives DBSI can make
loans and assist in or promote the establishment, maintenance,
development or reorganization of enterprises engaged in agri-
culture, industry, construction, mining, tourism, transport,
cm-unications and services. To perform its functions, DBSI
can exercise powers to acquire, hold, underwrite and dispose
stocks and securities, issue guarantees, and acquire and make
properties available for use by other persons, accept depo-
sits and administer funds for and on account of the Govern-
ment. DBSI is the only financial institution in Solomon
Islands which provides medium-and long-term finance for
developmental projects in the agriculture and industry
sectors, particularly to the indigenous enterprises. DBSI
is now well-established and operates as an effective institu-
tion for financing economic development.
C. Capitalization
17.       DBSI's authorized capital is SI$5.0 million (US$6.15
million), of which SI$2.78 million (US$3.42 million) was paid-
up as of 31 DN-txmber 1979 compared with SI$1.8 million at
the end of 1976. The Government had originally planned to
gradually increase the paid-in capital to SI$2.5 million
(US$3.08 million) only by 1981, but in view of the rapid
expansion of DBSI's activities, the paid-in capital has been
increased at a much faster pace than originally envisioned,
rising to SI$2.86 million (US$3.52 million) by 31 December
1980.  The Government plans to continue increasing DBSI' s
paid-in capital by SI$0.50 million (US$0.62 million) each
year during 1981-1984.
18.       Undear the Act, at least 51 per cent of DBSI's
share capital is to be held by GSA. The remaining 49 per
cent may be alloted to any person or institution approved
by the Minister of Finance.  At present, GSA holds all of
the shares of DBSI.
D. Relationship with the Goverment
19.       DBSI has a close relationship with the Government,
which has fostered its development through such measures as
exempting it from all taxes (tinder the Act), arranging for
its financial resources and allowing the use, without cost
to DBSI, of the extension staff of various ministries for



- 9 -
project appraisal and follow-up (see paragraph 42). The
Ministry of Finance has administrative jurisdiction over
DBSI, whose directors are appointed by, and whose General
Manager is appointed with the approval of, the MirFister of
Finance, Under the Act the Minister of Finance can, after
consulting DBSI, give it directions of a general nature
regarding its functions and powers. Within this framework,
DBSI functions with adequate autontmy and its management
has full authority to make decisions,
20.       DBSI's General Manager has also been associated
with various Gavernment agencies in an advisory capacity,
such as the Commercial Investment Committee under the Ministry
of Trade, Industry and Labor, which screens all foreign invest-
ment proposals, the Fishing Cooperatives Committee and the
Finance and Banking Committee.



- 10 -
IV. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND STAFF
A. Board of Directors
21.       Control over the operations of DBSI is vested in
a nine-member Board of Directors. The Board is composed
of the General Manager as an ex-officio member and eight
other members appointed by the Minister of Finance. At
least four members should be persons who are not publi4
officers. The Act stipulates that a Board member may iold
office for the period specified in the instrument of his
appointment but not more than three years. The present
Board of Directors was appointed on 31 December 1979 for a
period of one year (the previous Board was appointed for a
period of two years). The Board members represent a wide
spectrum of expertise covering agriculture, industry,
coerce and finance (a list of the Directors is given in
Appendix 2), Four members served on the previous DBSI Board,
thus maintaining an element of continuity. The Board meets
once a month to discuss policy mz-ters, review operations
and decide on proposals for financial assistance over
SI$1O,OOO (the General Manager can approve loans below this
amount).
B. Management
22.       Since its establishment, DBSI has been managed
effectively by Bank consultants, provided for under the
Bank's second and third technical assistance projects.
DBSI's present General Manager is a Loan Operations Expert
who succeeded a Senior Institutional Expert who held this
position until August 1978,
23.       In accordance with the Government policy of loca-
ization and the provision in the Agreement covering tne
first Bank loan.1 , the Govrrnment identified and apnointed a
suitably qualified persontt to DBSI's Board of Directors
1/   Loan No. 394-SQL (SF), Loan Agreement, Schedule 4,
paragraph 4.
2/ This individual has several, years of working
experience at NPF (before shifting to DBSI)as its
Manager. He has a degree in accounting
from the University of Technology at Lae in Papua
New Guinea and served on hoth the AILB and DBSI
Boards of Directors.



effective 1 January 1980. In November 1980 this individual
was appointed General Manager of DBSI.   He has so far been
holding the position of Manager of National Provident X
Fund (NPF),  However, because of the time that would be required
to appoint and train his successor at NPF, he will assume his
new responsibilities in the beginning of February 1981.
Government has agreed that prior to the effective date of the
proposed loan agreement, the new General Manager shall
assume full responsibilities allowing the present General
Mana gr to move into an advisory role until the expiry of his
term.L/, In order to ensure smooth turnover of the General
Managership, the Government has also agreed that the services
of an expatriate development bank expert satisfactory to the
Bank (as Advisor) will be available at least until the end of
November 1981 at the Government's exprtnsel/. The Bank considers
these arrangements as practical and sa.tisfactory.
C. Organizational Structure
24.       DBSI's organizational structure is considered
appropriate for its current operational requirements (Appendix
3 gives details of DBSI's organizational structure as of 30
September 1980). DBSI is organized into a Head Office and five
branches. The Head Office organization is divided into an Opera-
tions Department and four services divisions, namely Secretary,
Accounts, Securities and Statistics. The Operations Depart-
ment has three divisions:   (i) the Loans Division for project
evaluation and supervision of loan appraisal work at branches;
(ii) the Follow-up Division for supervising disbursements,
follow-up and arrears control; and (iii) the Project Promo-
tion Division.  In order to cope with >,>4dly expanding
operations, DBSI opened four branches 74'F979 and one branch
in 1980 and transferred the main operP*tiV L work of loan
appraisal and supervision to them from the Head Office. The
branches are located in Gizo, Western Province; Honiara, Central
Province; Auki) Malaita Province; Kira Kira, Makira Province
and Buala, Santa Isabel Province (see Map, page (iii) ).
25.       The Project Promotion Division and three branches,
Gizo, Auki and Kira Kira are headed by expatriates while the
1/ Proposed Loan Agreement, Section 6.01(a).
2/  Pronosed Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, naragraph 4.



w 12
branches in Hioniara and Buala are headed by Solomon Islands
nationals. The services of the four expatriates are provided
under Australian grant. The expatriate officers under
Australian assistanCe have been assigned senior local-staff as
understudies who will take over upon expiry of the expat-
riates' terms (the term of the Branch Manager at Gizo will expire
in December 1980 while those of the Head of the Project Promotion
Division at the Head Office and the two Branch Managers
at Auki and Kira Kira will expire in December 1981).
D. Staff and Training
26,       As of 30 September 1980, DBSI had 65 staff members
(excluding the General Manager) including 24 officers of
whom 4 were expatriates. In comparison, the total number of
staff at the time of first Bank appraisal (at the end of
January 979) was 26 with 10 officers (one expatriate). The
increase in staff strength during the past year was in response
to rapidly expanding operatiorn through the opening of five
branches and the need to train staff for future requirements
before the expiry of the terms of the Bank consultant and
other expatriates. Total staff strength is expected to be
increased by, 46 per cent to 83 by the end of 1981, which
would be sufficient to meet DBSI's staff requirements until
1984. DBSI's staff strength is supplemented by extension
services personnel of various ministries whose services are
used by DBSI under arrangements carried over from AIJB
DBSI's dependence on the staff of Government agencies will
gradually diminish as it develops its own trained staff
in the field.
27.       Despite the shortage of qualified nationals, DBSI
has successfully met its personnel requirements because of
its competitive pay structure, better career prospects and
recognition by the Government of DBSI's important role in
the economy. Of the local staff two are degree holders and
two have agricultural and accounting diplomas (after high
school). Thy rest of the staff have studied up to the high
school levelLI. Staff expertise is being upgraded through
on-the-job tritining, at all levels, combined with in-house
and external training programs conducted by the Bank's
1/   There is no university or college in Solomon Islands and
students desiring higher education must study abroad.



- 13 -
consultant and other expatriate staff. All staff receive
three hours of classroom training each week on project
evaluation and supervision. Fourteen staff have attended
external courses including three who participated in the
Bank's development banking program in 1979. Staff are en.-
couraged through financial incentives (reimbursement of
tuition, etc.) to enroll in courses that enhance their
academic qualifications; six are taking courses in mathe-
matics, accounting and economics conducted by the University
of the South Pacific in Honiara.
28.       Staff have responded to these training programs
enthusiastically, and the results so far have been encou--
raging. Most of the work related to project appraisal at,
branch offices (except for larger applications) is now handled
by Solomon Islanders. The local staff still requires more
training and experience for appraisal and follow-up of
larger projects involving more complex economic, marketing
and financial analyses.  DBSI will continue to give high
priority to staff training and has assured the Mission that
it will take appropriate steps to develop and conduct suitable
in-house training programs in the future.    DBSI will also   1/
inform the Bank annually on the progress of training programs-
29.       In order to continue the staff training programs
on the lines indicated above DBSI is exploring the possibili-
ties of retaining the services of two expatriates for 1982
(one for the staff at Head Office and the other for the
branches). Also in order to strengthen and develop its own
senior level staff in areas of accounting and business advisory
services, where local staff still have limited knowledge and
experience, DBSI intends to recruit two expatriates, to head
the Accounting and Business Advisory Services Divisions.
These expatriates are expected to join DBSI in the beginning
of 1981 and 1982 respectively. The Mission considers that
with these arrangements the management and supervision of
DBSI's operations after the completion of the Bank's techni-
cal assistance programs would continue in a satisfactory
manner.

V. ACTIVITIES, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
A. Activities
30.        To enable DBSI to achieve its main objectives of
promoting participation of Solomon Islanders in economic
development and rural development and in stimulating processing
and industrial activities, DBSI is empowered to undertake
activities such as term-lending, equity financing, under-
writing, issuing guarantees and providing advisory assistance.
Its main activity 80 far has been to make medium and long-
term loans for development projects, which cover a wide
range by sectors such as in agriculture (Including tree crops,
logging, fishing and livestock), commerce, mining, industry,
construction and services (including tourism and transport)
and to conduct related promotional activities.
31.        Loans to the agriculture sector are mainly for
farm development, the purchase of tractors and other farm
implements and housing. In the industry sectbr,.while the
larger and more sophisticated industries have been set up
by large foreign companies, DBSI's assistance mostly goes to
smaller units engaged in simple operations using light
machinery and equipment. Loans are generally granted for the
construction of buildings and purchase of machinery and
equipment.
32.        Equity investments are also generally made to
provide capital support to local entrepreneurs both to set
up new projects and to help in the transfer of successful
ventures from expatriates to Solomon Island nationals. DBSI
has so far made eight such investments in six companies
involving a total of SI$232,OOO. DBSI has not issued any
guarantee or done any underwriting so far.
33.        Though DBSI is mandated under the Act to give
priority to channeling assistance to local nationals, it
continues to provide funds, on harder terms, for expatriate-
owned projects in view of the economic benefits they generate
and in order to maintain a balanced portfolio in terms of
sectors, size, and nature of projects.   As of 30 September
1980, DBSI had financed 30 expatriate-owned projects amounting
to SI$0.81 million (including 4 Bank subloans of SI$0.30
million) out of a total 2,852 projectsoamounting to SI$7.88
million.



- 15 -
34.        DBSI's project promotional activities aim to
attract local nationals to business activities and the use
of credit to stimulate local entrepreneurship and foster rural
develco,nent consistent with DBSI's objectives and the Govern-
ment's development strategy.  In order to intensify its
promotional activities, DBSI established a Project Promotion
Division in 1979.  This division gives emphasis to project
identification and development geared towards multipurpose
and special purpose cooperatives involved in various types of
developmental and economic activities. In 1979, DBSI assisted
eight such new projects with loans amounting to SI$385,350.
These projects included a saw mill, an electrical workshop
and a new hardware store. Loans to export-oriented cocoa
projects amounted to SI$83,260 for 17 projects, and local
building contractors received 19 loans amounting to SI$182,100
in the form of bridge financing against specific job orders
of the Solomon Islands Housing Authority (SIHA) and other
organizations.
35.        DBSI continues to make efforts to diversify and
broaden its lending coverage to rural areas, particularly in
the subsistence sector.  In 1978, DBSI implemented a "micro-
loans scheme" which enables local nationals in rural areas
to obtain loans not exceeding SI$1,000 on soft terms 1/, to
purchase items like tools, wire, fishing equipment, and
building materials.  From 1 January 1979 to 30 September 1.980
2,299 micro-loans totalling SI$1.29 million were approved
compared with 214 loans totalling SI$125,000 in 1978.
36.        DBSI's advisory services to its clients (in the
form of advice and limited training on technical and manage-
ment aspects) are carried out with the help of the extension
service and field staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Lands and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Labor, but these
are still limited mainly due to a lack of qualified staff.
DBS'f intends to set up a Business Advisory Division in 1981
to supplement the services provided by the Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Labor.
1/ These are:   a flat 4.0 per cent inllerest rate (see
paragraph 41), maturity of 6 monthis to 5 years including
one year grace (most of thle loans are for less than
two years), and minimal security.



16 -
B. Policies
37.        DBSI adopted a Policy Statement shortly after its
inception in 1978, formulated by the Bank consultants in
consultation with the Bank   (see Appendix 4). The Statement
places emphasis on the developmenta'L role of DBSI and contains
appropriate guidelines and scope for its operations, general
policies and procedures, financial and banking practices.
38.        According to the Statement, DBSI's equity
participation in any enterprise shall not exceed 25 per cent
of the paid-up capital of an enterprise or 10 per cent of its
own equity; DBSI's aggregate equity investments at any time
shall not exceed 20 per cent of its paid-up capital and reserve
funds. DBSI's total commitment in a single enterprise will
not exceed 20 per cent of DBSI's total paid-up capital and
reserves funds, 65 per cent of the total fixed assets of enter-
prises in the industry sector and 80 per cent of the total
assets of enterprises in the agriculture sector (the latter
two limits can be exceeded in exceptional cases which merit
special consideration) and, DBSX will not carry any foreign
exchange risk on its loans. According to the Statement, DBSI
shall set aside at least 3 per cent of its financial assistance
approvals in each year as a provision for bad and doubtful
debts until such reserves reach 10 per cent of the total port-
folio; DBSI will also transfer all its net profit to a reserve
fund until it reaches 50 per cent of the paid-uip capital.
39.        DBSI has generally adhered to the guidelines set
out in its Policy Statement, but, in the light of experience
gained during the first two years of operations, is considering
some revisions to the Policy Statement which are considered
necessary to expand the scope of operations and also bring
about greater participation by Solomon Islanders in the country's
economic activity. These revisions would involve an increase
in the overall limit for DBSI's equity investments and the
limits for DBSI's maximum comnitment in a single enterprise.
Appropriate amendments to the Policy Statement on these points
would have to be approved by DBSI's Board. While the Mission
agrees with the need for a suitable increase in the limit of
DBSI's equity investments, any change in the limits for
maximum commitment to a single enterprise should be formulated
and implemented with caution. DBSI has agreed that it will



- 17 -
not substantially amend the Policy Statement without prior
agreement of the Bank, l/.
40.        Loan maturities range from 6 months (for micro-
loans) to 15 years including grace periods up to 5 years
(for loans for cattle, cocoa, coconut and interisland shipping
development).  However, maturities on loans for cooperative
land purchases from expatriates may be given for up to 20
years. DBSI's policy on security and collateral and its
security documentation procedures are being reviewed for
simplification and updating purposes. Security normally
consists of real estate mortgages, bills of sale and personal
guarantees.
41.        DBSI's interest rate policy, wiiich became effective
on 1 January 1979 following a review by the Bank's Consultants
of AILB's interest rates2/, remains unchanged (see Appendix 1).
Micro-loans are charged a flat rate3 / of 4.0 per cent a year;
agriculture, 10.0 per cent4/9 anc commerce, industry and the
service sectors, 11.0 per cent-L . Expatriates are charged at
least: 1.0 per cent more.  The DBSI rate for Solomon Islanders
is slightly less than, and for expatriates competitive with,
those! of the commercial banks (see Appendix 1). Cattle and
meat processing loans financed by DBSI as executing agency
under the Bank's Beef-Cattle Development Project are charged
4.0 per cent and 8.0 per cent respectively on a declining
balarnce basis.  DBSI's margin on the two portions of the loan
for t:he cattle project is 1.5 p.>r cent and 6.5 per cent
1/ Loan No, 394-SOL(SF) Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, para-
graph 2, Project Agreement, Section 3.01(e).
2/ AILB's interest rates were: for nationals - 4 per cent
for agr&.cultural loans and 5.5 per cent for non-agri-
cultural loans; for expatriates - 9 per cent or higher
depending upon the purpose of the loan. These rates were
also applied by DBSI until mid-1978 when it gradually
increased these to the present level.
3/ Interest is recovered on the entire loan amount approved
charged from the date of disbursement and not on the
balance outstanding. The effective rate on micro-loans
would work out to around 6 per cent a year on outstanding
loans.
4/ Interest is charged on a declining balance basis.



18
respectively.  DBSI has agreed to review its interest rate
structure periodically and make suitable adjustments after
consulting the Bank]:/. Except for micro-loans, DBSI charges
a service fee of 1.0 per cent of the amount of assistance
approved. Penalty interest of 2.0 per cent is charged on
overdue amounts.
C. Procedures
42.        DBSI's operational procedures in respect of project
evaluation and approvals, documentation, loan disbursements
and follow-up have been formulated by the Bank's Consultants
under the technical assistance program and take into account
the nature of the loans DBSI makes. An operational manual has
been prepared to guide DBSI staff in this task. With the
opening of four branch offices, most of the applications for
financial assistance are now received, screened and appraised
at the branches. Applications from more remote areas are
still being received by, and processed with the assistance of
extension officers  of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands.
Also, the services of technical experts of the various minis-
tries are used when necessary as DBSI does not have its own
full time technical staff. However, the final decision on
loan approval rests with DBSI.  These arrangements have been
working satisfactorily so far, The Head Office generally
provides overall guidance, supervision and control, and only
large applications for commercial and industrial projects
(selected on a case by case basis) are processed at the Head
Office, Conisidering the nature of the projects financed,
appraisal techniques and criteria applied are simple and there
is at present only limited scope or need for DBSI to apply
sophisticated economic analysis for project evaluation.
43.        Normally, a branc!. loan officer interviews the
sponsor, inspects the project site, and prepares a report
covering various aspects of the appraisal in consultation with
the technical staff of the Government agenc'ies concerned.
Loans up to SI$500 may be approved by the loan officers,
SI$1,000 by the Senior Loan Officer and SI$2,500 by the Branch
Manager. At the Head Office loans of up to SI$ 3,000 are
approved by the Operations Manager while those up to SI$10,000
1/ Loan No. 394-SOL(SF) Project Agreement, Schedule,
paragraph 2,



19 -
are approved by the General Manager. Loan proposals above
SI$10,000 are submitted to the Board for consideration about
once every month.
440        DBSI's Follow-up Division at the Head Office
regulates disbursements, supervises follow-up work and
monitors arrears control while the actual follow-up work is
done by the branches.  Disbursements are made directly to
suppliers of material and equipment after reviewing, where
applicable, progress of the project. Goods financed by DBSI
are mostly procured by means of "off-the-shelf" purchases from
local importers. The borrowers obtain quotations from local
agents on the basis of which DBSI ensures that the prices of
goods to be procured are reasonable and competitive.  The time
lag between approvals and disbursements is between 1 to 12
weeks depending on the nature of the project.  After loan
disbursements, the projects are inspected by DBSI branch staff
at least once and after that as warranted by repayment perform-
ance. Also, the assistance of various Government extension
service and technical staff is usually sought for follow-up
purposes where necessary and particularly in remcote areas.
DBSI maintains effective monitoring and control of loan arrears.
Periodic reports (generally on monthly intervals) are received
from branches and, where necessary, appropriate action is
taken to rehabilitate the project or to recover its dues.
Further training and expansion of branch staff and the continued
assistance and cooperation of the extension service officials
in the field are expected to strengthen further DBSI's projects
supervision capabilities.

VI   OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. General
45,       DBSI's operations expanded significantly during
1979 (its second year of operations) Aith 1,044 loans amount-
ing tD SI$2.5 million approved during the year compared with
289 loans totalling SI$1.5 million in 1978. This 67 per cent
increase exceeded approvals projected during the first appraisal
for 1979 and 1980 of SI$1.9 million and SI$2.4 million res-
pectively. Operations have continued to expand rapidly in the
first nine months of 1980 with 1,519 approvals amounting to
SI$3.87 million. The large increase in loan apprevals was
mainly due to DBSI's stepped up promotional activities through
its branches in outlying islands and improved loan processing
procedures. There were six equity investment approvals
amounting to SI$68,250 in the first nine months of 1980 com-
pared with no approvals in 1979 and two approvals totalling
SI$80,000 in 1978.
B. Sectoral Distribution of Loans
46.       A summary of the sectoral distribution of loans
approved by AILB (October 1975 to December 1977) and DBSI
from 1 January 1978 to 30 September 1980 is given in Appendix
5. Table 1 below gives a summary of the sectoral breakdown
of DBSI's approvals,.

47.        As shown in Table 1, loan approvals to the agricul-
turie sector (including livestock and fisheries) increased sub-
stanitially after the form,ition of DBSI; however, the share of
agriculture in total loan approvals decreased from 38 per cent
by amount during October 1975 to December 1977 to 32 per cent
in L979. Within the agriculture sector, the subsectors that
accounted for the largest share of 1979 loan approvals by
amount were:    rural infrastructure (housing, co       nity develop-
ment, water supply, etc.) and fisheries and forestry. Loans
for cocoa development, fisheries and rural infrastructure re-
gisitered the biggest increases over 1978. The share of the
manjfacturing and construction sectors in loan approvals dropped



22 -
from 31 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in 1978 to 14
and 7 per cent in 1979.  In the manufacturing sector, general
engineering (viz. shipbuilding and repairs, metal workshops,,
plumbing, etc.) is the most important subsector, accounting
for about two-thirds of the total manufacturing sector appro-
vals in 1979. The share of the construction sector (mainly
housing construction contract8 awarded by SIHA) decreased
because in some cases conmercial banks have taken over from
DBSI as the contractor's m~ain lender. Loan approvals to the
services sector, including comnerce, shipping and transport, ac-
counted for a larger share in 1979 than the previous year. The
share of the shipping subsector nearly quadrupled in 1979
over 1978. During the first nine months of 1980 DBSI approved
SI$1.67 million in loans to the shipping sector, reflecting the
need for interisland shipping.
48.       In line with one of its main goals, DBSI in 1979
significantly increased the proportion of loans approved for
Solomon Islanders as opposed to expatriates (for details see
Appendix 6). As a result, 99 per cent by number and 97 per
cent by amount of loans approved in 1979 went to local natio-
nals (individuals, groups, cooperatives, companies with majq-
rity Solomon Islander ownership) compared with 92 per cent and
61 per cent respectively in 1978. Because both the eccnomy of
Solomon Islands and the operations of DBSI are still in a for-
mative stage of growth, most of DBSI's loan approvals are
granted to new borrowers. About 68 per cent of the loans (by
amount) approved in 1979 went to new borrowers, compared to
93 per cent in 1978, and a similarly large share of loans are
approved for new projects (see Appendix 6).
49.       Geographically, in 1979 a greater share of loan
approvals went to outlying islands; 22 per cent by number and
47 per cent by amount went to projects in Guadalcanal, the
main island, compared with 29 per cent and 76 per cent respecm
tively in 1978 (for details see Appendix 6), This trend con-
tinued during 0980 with the establishment of five branches in
outlying islands (in the first nine months of 1980 only 17
per cent and 39 per cent of approvals by number and amount
respectively were for projects in Guadalcanal).
C. Size and Maturity of Loans
50.       Because of DBSI's continuing emphasis on micro-loans,
the average size of loans approved has dropped from SI$5,098
in 1978 to SI$2,426 in 1979. Most DBSI loan approvals by



-23-
number are small (73 per cent in 1978 and 94 per cent in
1979 were for loans of less than SI$5,000) while micro-loans
increased four times thereby increasing their share from 63
per cent in 1978 to 87 per cent in 1979. In terms of amountl,
the approval of loans under SI$5,000 increased from 14 per
cent in 1978 to 27 per cent in 1979; it should be noted that
DBSI's margin on micro-loans is close to nil as their associa-
ted administrative costs are quite high (see paragraph 64).
Loans over SI$20,000 comprised 68 per cent and 56 per cent of
total amount of loan approvals in 1978 and 1979 respectively
while only one loan in 1978 and four loans in 1979 were over
SI$100,000.
51.       The large number of micro-loans in DBSI's 1979
operations is also reflected in the data on loan maturities,
as most of these are for two years or less. About 92 per
cent of the 1,044 loans approved in 1979 had maturities of
less than 3 years, an increase over 79 per cent in 1978.
The weighted average maturity by number of loans approved
declined from 3.2 years to 2.7 years. The proportion of
loan approvals by amount with maturities of more than 4
years decreased from 71 per cent in 1978 to 54 per cent in
1979. With the establishment of five new branches in 1980
Ei outlying islands DBSI's loans continued to be weighted
towards small loans with short maturities (see Appendix 6),
since most loans approved by these branches continue to be
micro-loans.
D. Socioeconomic Aspects
52.       DBSI is the only financial institution in Solomon
Islands that can provide long-term finance for development
projects. Through the micro-loans scheme, which is mainly
administered by its five branches and directly serves a size-
able part of the total population, DBSI has become the first
institution to lend to Solomon Islanders in remote areas.
DBSI has helped expand the monetized sector of the economy,
improve productivity in the subsistence sector and educate
people in the use of credit. Of the 2,852 DBSI loan appro-
vals,(amounting to SI$7.9 million) up to 30 September 1980,
2,695 (or 94.5 per cent by number) have been for amounts
less than SI$5,000. Nearly all of these loans are to bor-
rowers in remote areas and will generate additional employ-
ment and cash income to at least as many families. In 1975
average cash income per head in these rural areas was only



- 24-
US$45.3 at 1978 prices and about    .2 per cent of rural house-
holds had reported no cash income±!
53.       one of DBSI's most important impacts on economic
development has been in the transportation sector, particu-
larly the shipping and air transport subsectors whose deve-
lopment is crucial to an archipelagic country such as Solomon
Islands. About 29 per cent by amount of DBSI's loan
approvals up to 30 September 1980 has been for projects in
the transportation sector. The larger l.oans in this category
including one of SI$0.11 million to the country's only airline
and two amounting to SI$O.85 million to two shipping comrnanies
serving outlying islands.

54.        The condensed balance sheets of AILB and DBSI as
of the end of 1977, 1978 and 1979 are given below (for details,
see Appendix 7).

al Excludes portions of loans due/payable within one year.
55.        The everall financial position of DBSI has remained
satisfactory.    Its total assets grew by 46 per cent over the       I/
previous year to reach SI$4 million (US$4.7 million equivalent- )
on 31 December 1979. About two-thirds of the increase in
total assets was due to the increase in medium-and long-term
loans, which accounted for 51 per cent and 62 per cent
1/   At the exchange rate of sI$1 c US$1.1863 as of 31 December
1979,



26 -
respectively. By 30 September 1980 total assets had increased
further to SI$5.71 million (US$7 million). As of 31 December
1979  DBSI's total portfolio, including the current portion,
accounted for 76.2 per cent of total assets (79.1 per cent as
of 30 September 1980)e
56.       DBSI has a large equity base, mainly due to the
capitalization of long term Government loans in 1978,   The
debt/equity ratios of 0.4:1 as of the end of 1979 and 0.8:1
as of 30 September 1980 were therefore, low and well below
the maximum limit of 3:1 provided for in the loan documents.
The current ratio is very high because current maturities in
its loan portfolio form a relatively large proportion and DBSI
has very few current liabilities; most of DBSI's long-term
debts are still in their grace periods. As of 30 September
1980, the long-term debts outstanding included: (i) SI$l.05
million under the first Bank loan (SI$0.58 million still un-
drawn) with the principal repayable over 15 years including
a three-year grace period; (ii) SI$O.14 million (SI$0.21
million undrawn) under the Bank-financed Cattle Development
Project loan repayable over 25 years including a five-
year grace period; (iii) SI$0.73 million under the Government/
UK loan repayable over 25 years including a six-month grace
period after each drawdown; and (iv) SI$0.5 million under the
NPF loan repayable over 15 years including three years
grace period.
2. Loan Portfolio
57.       DBSI's loan portfolio totalled SI$2.98 million as
of 31 December 1979, an increase of 57 per cent over the end-
1978 position, nearly matching the growth rate of loan approval$
during that period. The loan portfolio had increased
further to SI$4.54 million as of 30 September 1980. The 886
loans outstanding as of 31 December 1979 were quite evenly
distributed both sectorally and geographically (for detail& see
Appendix 8). The largest share of the portfolio was in the
commerce sector, mainly stores (31 per cent), followed by
agriculture (27 per cent), manufacturing (22 per cent), trans-
port and services (13 per cent) and construction (7 per cent).
This distribution is more balanced compared to AILB's port-
folio as of 31 December 1977, when the agriculture and commerce



- 27 -
sectors made up 77 per cent of the loan portfolio.
58.       As judged by the low level of arrears (see
Appendix 9 for details), DBSI's loan portfolio may be consi-
dered of good quality- but the increase that has taken place
in the number of loans having arrears must be watched closely.
DBSI's total arrears increased from SI$57,000 as of 31 December
1978 to SI$95,000 as.of 31 December 1979 and to SI$237,000 as
of 30 September 1980. Total arrears as a percentage of loans
in the repayment stage increased from 3.1 at the end of 1978
to 3.4 per cent at the end of 1979 and to about 5.3    per cent
at 30 September 1980. The increase in arrears is partly a
result of the rapid expansion of DBSI's portfolio in sectors
new to it and in outlying areas of Solomon Islands. The fact
that arrears as a percentage of loans in repayment in terms
of number of accounts has increased at a faster rate (from 29.5
per cent at 31 December 1978 to 61.3 per cent at 30 September
1980) indicates that DBSI is having some problems collecting
on its smaller (i.e. micro) loans to borrowers who mainly live
in remote areas. As of 30 September 1980, 44 per cent by
number of loans in arrears were less than 3 months overdue.,
many of which may have been overdue partly because of poor
communications and can be recovered through close follow-up.
59.       By sector, the weakest areas of DBSI's portfolio
are the rural infrastructure and cattle subsectors with
overdues as of 30 September 1980 at 17 per cent and 10 per
cent respectively of loans outstanding in the repayment stage
(see Appendix 9). However, since these are mostly small loans,
the overall impact on arrears is not significant. Loans in
these two sectors are almost all in outlying areas. The
commerce, manufacturing and transport sectors are the strongest
in DBSI's loan portfolio, with arrears as a percentage of
loans in the repayment stage at 3.7 per cent by amount as of
30 September 1980.
1/ Precise information regarding loan portfolio sectoral
breakdown is unavailable for 30 September 1980; however,
it can be noted that the shares of the agricultural and
transport and services sectors increased somewhat.



- 28 -
3. Euity Portfolio
60.       As of 30 September 1980, DBSI had four equity invest-
ments in its portfolio with a cost value of SI$0e21 million
(for details, see Appendix 10). Of these, two investments are
operating profitably and generating dividend income for DBSI
while two others, Solomon Soaps, Ltd. (SSL) and SIACO, Ltd.,
a fish retailer, are loss situations. SSL started up in 1979
and has suffered from competition with imports and labor
problems. As a result of steps taken by the Goverment, SSL's
operations have just started to improve. SIACO has been
losing operation due to unreliable shipping and poor management.
DBSI is now formulating a program to rehabilitate SIACO, which
includes turning the operation over to the private sector.
DBSI also has loan exposure to SSL and SIACO totalling SI$0.24
million as of 31 March 1980.
4. Adequacy of Reserve for Bad Debts
61.       DBSI's highest potential bad debts, as measured by
arrears over 12 months, totalled SI$51,000 as of 30 September
1980 (SI$37,000 as of 31 December 1979.). Taking into consi-
deration potential losses from DBSI's two problem equity
investments described above, as of 30 Seotember 1980 total
potential write-offs are estimated at SI$66,000 compared to
DBSI's reserve for bad debts of SI$240,334 or 5.1 per cent
of the total portfolio (as of 31 December 1979, SI$52,000 com-
pared with  SI$l30,000 or 4.1 per cent of the total portfolio).
In 1978, DBSI had to write-off loans of only about SI$8,000
while there were no write-offs in 1979nrid in the first nine
months of 1980. Thus, the reserve appears to be more than
adequate. An assessment made by DBSI's auditor (for the year
ended 31 December 1979), Price Waterhouse, also indicates that
the reserve for bad debts can be considered adequate.
B. Operating Results (Income Statement)

63.       DBSI's gross t     t    income rose from SI$86,877
in 1978 to SI$212,418 iu     9    zring with the large increase
in its loan portfolio.   The    Irest spread increased from
0.6 per cent in 1978 to 5.5 per cent in 1979. It had been
abnormally low in 1978 because a significant part of DBSI's
resources were still on deposit. DBSI's earnings spread is
high due to the large amount of cost free funds in the form
of equity in its long term reoources. The earnings spread was
10.2 per cent in 1978 and 9.4 per cent in 1979, dropping
slightly as the proportion of borrowings in resources increased.
64.       Despite the increase in interest income and improve-
ment in the interest spread, net income declined from SI$49,833
in 1978 to SI$5,229 in 1979 because:    (a) administrative
expenses were up (increasing in relation to average total
assets from 3.7 per cent to 4.6 per cent) due to the increase
in staff and opening of new branches necessary to deal with a
large number of small loans and scattered population centers;
(b) the provision for bad debts as required under the Policy
Statement was relatively large due to the increase in loan
approvals; and (c) there was a SI$29,232 extraordinary charge
that offset most of 1979's operating profit, whereas in 1978,
there was an extraordinary gain of SI$31,000 on the sale of
DBSI's original headquarters building. The loss of SI$14,514
in the first nine months of 1980 is due to the large provision
for bad debts of SI$110,334 related to the high volume of
approvals. For the entire year, however, DBSI expects
a nominal profit (see paragraph 73). Although it is



- 30
in an early stage of development, DBSI's financial position may be
considered relatively strong; with a steady increase in operations
and disbursements, the operating results are expected to improve.
C, Accounting System and Auditin
65.       DBSI's accounting procedures are adequate, but need
to be streamlined. A manual must also be prepared for better
guidance and training of staff both at the Head Office and
oranches.  DBSI will attend to this after the appointment of a
full-time professional accountant in early 1981.
66.       Under the Act, DBSI's accounts are to be audited by
an auditor(s) appointed annually by DBSI with the Auditor
General's approval.  Under the loan documents for the first
Bank loan, DBSI's accounts have to be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. DBSI's accounts are presently
audited by Price Waterhouse & Co. Under the proposed loan,
DBSI's accounts will continue to be audited by independent au-
ditors acceptable to the Bank,  The auditor's report would be
submitted to the Bank within four months from the close of each
financial year;/.

68.       DBSI's 1979 loan approvals at SI$2.5 million, rose
by 72 per cent over 1978 and were also 30 per cent higher
than estimated during the first loan appraisal.    In the first
nine months of 1980 DBSI's financial assistance approvals
reached SI$3.87 million. Based mainly on this operational
performance, DBSI's loan approvals during 1980-1984 are
expected to grow by 25 per cent a yearl'. Equity investments
are expected to be 10 per cent of the approvals in Table 4.
69.       As of 27 October 1980, DBSI's pipeline of projects
totalled SI$4.7 million; in addition projects which are at a
relatively early stage of development and for which primary
contact has been made with DBSI amounted to SI$7 million.
The sectoral distribution of these projects is as follows:
agriculture 42 per cent, construction 21 per cent, service
and transportation 18 per cent, commerce 10 per cent and
manufacturing 9 per cent.
I/ The 1981 increase would be 25 per cent after exclusion
from 1980 approvals Qf two large loans for the shipping
sector totalling SI$0.85 million.



- 32 -
70.       Given DBSI's rapid growth of loan approvals in the
last two years, the large pipeline of projects, further insti-
tutional strengthening as the Bank consultant continues to
train indigenous staff including loan officers, the large po-
tential for the further growth of loan approvals as DBSI's new
outlying island branch promotional and marketing efforts take
hold, and the potential for growth in the economy, the Mission
considers DBSI's loan approvals projections for 1980-1984 to
be attainable. The Mission also considers the projected
sectoral breakdown to be realistic.
71.       Based on the projected financial assistance approvals
for 1981-1982, DBSI will require about SI$9.5 million to meet
its overall fund requirements. The foreign currencyrequire-
ments can be estimated based on experience with the first Bank
loan, where 50 per cent of loan approvals were to meet foreign
currency requirements. This percentage is relatively high
because, construction materials, machinery and equipment must
be imported.
72.       DBSI expects to meet its local currency fund require-
ments of SI$5.7 million (including a deficit on approval basis
of SI$0.9 million for 1980) from the following sources:
SI$4.8 million in loan repayments during 1981-1982; SI$1.0
million in share capital contributions by  the Government; and
additi,*onal borrowings of SI$0.6 million from NPF and SIMA for
a total of SI$6.4 million.  DBSI's foreign currency requirements
for 1981-1982 have been estimated at SI$5.3 million (including
a deficit, on approval basis, of SI$0,55 million for 1980).
The proposed US$2 million Bank loan with IBRD/IDA cofinancing
of US$1.5 million (for a total of SI$2.85 million equivalent)
will provide about 54 per cent of these requirements. The
balance of SI$2.45 million is expected to be met from SI$0,24
million in capital contributions from Australia/New, Zealand
Aid through the Government, the SI$0J9 million EDF loan, the
local currency resource surplus and from unidentified sources.
B. Financial ProJections
73.       DBSI's projected financial statements and their
underlying assumptions are given in Appendixes 13 to 16.

Interest Coverage (times)            1.1  1.1  1.1   1.3   1.5
74.       Gross income is expected to increase at an average
annual rate of 41 per cent (55 per cent in 1980 with growth
rates declining gradually to 29 per cent in 1984). By com-
parison, gross income in 1978 and 1979 grew by 116 and 40
per cent respectively. The interest spread is expected to
increare from 5.3 per cent in 1980 to 6.8 per cent in 1984
because DBSI expects to have a larger proportion of
its portfolio consisting of higher interest rate loans; micro-
loans, on which DBSI charges the lowest interest but which
bear relatively higher administrative expenses, will form a
smaller proportion by amouit.   Administrative expenses as a
percentage of average total assets will remain high but are
projected to decline steadily after 1982 (administrative
expenses will be higher at first because of branch start up
expenses in 1980 and large increases in staff assulmed for
1980/1981). As a result, profitability as measured by net
profit as a percentage of average equity will increase steadily
although it will still be low in 1981 and 1982 because DBSI has
mnde provisions in administrative expenses for the six month
extension of the Bank consultant's texm and the salaries of
three expatriates (see paragraph 29). The earnings spread,
on the other hand, is expected to decline from 9.4 and 9.5
in 1979 atnd 1980 respectively to 7.8 in 1984, because the
proportion of interest bearing liabilities in DBSI's resource
structure will increase (the proportion of interest free
resources, viz. equity, will decrease). This level of earnings
spread, although reduced, is still considered satisfactory.
Interest coverage will also remain at adequate levels. Overall,
therefore, DBSI's income and profits are expected to reach a



- 34 -
satisfactory level. DBSI's cash flow is expected to be more
than adequate to service its debt obligations and loan commit-
ments, aided by the fact that DBSI's profits are tax exempt
as per the DBSI Act. Additionally, in accordance with a pro-
vision of its Policy Statement, DBSI does not expect to pay
any dividends during 1980-1984. Since most of DBSI's long-
term liabilities will still be in their grace periods during
most of this time, debt service coverage will remain high.
75.       The projected balance sheets for 1980-1984 are
summarized below.

SI$4 million (US$4.8 million equivalent-/) as of 31 December
1979 to SI$16.6 million (US$20.4 million) by 31 December 1984.
The   jor part of the assets will be the loan portfolio, which
will account for around 75 per cent of DBSI's total assets
during 1980-1984. This loan portfolio will grow at an average
annual rate of 36 per cent (48 per cent in 1980 declining to

December 1979.



- 35 -
a rate of 27 per cent in 1984), a higher growth rate than
for loan approvals due to the particularly high growth of
approvals during 1978 - 1980 and the lag time between
approvn .Is and disbursements. DBSI's equity is expected to
grow by about 15 per cent a year to SI$5.6 million (US$6.9
million equivalent) by the end of 1984. The debt/equity
ratio is expected to increase to 1.87 by 31 December 1984.
This level is still well below the limit of 3:1 prescribed
in' the Bank's loan documents. The current ratio will be
very high because current maturities in its loan portfolio
form a relatively large proportion (see paragraph 51) and
also most of DBSI's long-term liabilit.ies will still be in
their grace periods. DBSI's financial condition is expected
to be satisfactory during the projected period.



- 36
IX. UTILIZATION OF THE PREVIOUS BANK LOAN
A. General
77.       The Bank's first credit line of US$2 million to
DBSI became effective in July 1979. It was originally
expected that the loan would be fully committed within
three years from the date of loan effectiveness and would
be fully disbursed by the middle of 1983. Utilization has
been faster than originally expected because of the expansion
of DBSI's operations. As of 30 September 1980 US$1.77 million
was committed for 322 subloans against which an amount of
US$1.26 million had been disbursed. The balance of the first
Bank loan to DBSI is expected to be fully coiitted by the
end of 1980. All the disbursements so far have been on a
reimbursement basis. mainly for off-the-shelf purchases,
made within the 120 da q period provided for this purpose
in the loan documents.-
B. Nature of Subloans
78.       Of the 322 subloans, about 80 per cent by number
(for US$212,000) were approved for the agriculture sector
and rural infrastructure (mainly for the purchase of trac-
tors, implements and vans and the construction of farm
houses), about 19 per cent (for US$1.34 million) for the
commerce and service sectors, viz, transportation (including
interisland shipping), construction, tourism, etc., and only
2 per cent (for US$0.19 million) for manufacturing. The low
share of the manufacturing sector is in line with its share
in DBSI's overall operations in 1979 and is due to lack of
relevant experience and entrepreneurship among Solomon
Islanders, who were predominant as the sub-borrowers. The
subsectors that benefitted most from the Bank subloans were
transport (about US$1.0 million or 56 per cent of the total
committed), forestry and farming (US$74,000), construction
fUS$81,000), tourism (US$54,000) and general engineering
including shipbuilding and repairs (US$0.18 million). Sub-
loana for about 33 per cent of the total amount went for new
projects while 67 per cent went for expansion, balancing
and modernization of existing projects.
i/   Loan No. 394-SOL (SF) Project Agreement, Section 2.03.



- 37 -
79G       Although the size of indiv4ual subloans has
varied between US$151 and USW96,00a' (the upper limit
for subloans was US$250,000)J, only nine subloans for a
total amount of US$1.16 million out of 322 sublr*is approved
up to 30 September 1980 have been above the free limit of
US$30,000.  The average size of subloans approved up to
30 June 1980 stood at US$5,487.  There were 227 subloans
below SI$1,000 (US$1,229) of which 145 subloans were for
amounts not exceeding SI$500, all under DBSI's micro-loan
scheme.
800       About 92 per cent by number of the subloans and
38 per cent by amount are for up to five years maturity and
about 79 per cent of the subloans by number and 29 per cent
by amount carried maturities of between one to three years.
The comparatively short period of repayment of the subloans
is due to the fact that they were granted for the purchase of
light equipment and machinery. There is a good geographical
distribution of subloans; about 31 per cent by amount went to
Honiara, 20 per cent each to Western Province and Central
Isles Province (excluding Honiara), 18 per cent to Santa
Isabel and 9 per cent to Malaita. This distribution is in
line with the distribution of loans approved by DBSI in 1979
and is an improvement over 1978.
C. Procurement Aspects
81.       DBSI has followed the agreed upon procurement
procedures. In most cases individual orders have been
small and procurement has been made from local suppliers
on an "off-the-shelf" purchase basis. Purchases by country
for the first Bank loan to DBSI as of 30 June 1980 were made
from Australia and New Zealand (41 per cent), Fiji (25 per
cent), Japan (25 per cent), USA (8 per cent) and UK (1 per cent).
1/   There were only two subloans exceeding the maximum
limit of US$250,000, both for US$296,000, for financing
the procurement of interisland shipping vessels,
approved as special cases.
2/   Loan No. 394-SOL (SF) Project Agreement, Schedule,
paragraph 3, also proposed Project Agreement,
Schedule, paragraph 3.



- 38 -
D. Comliance with Loan Covenants
82.       The Government and DBSI have complied with all
the conditions and covenants in the loan documents. on
the whole the Bank's experience with regard to the utiliza-
tion of the loan by DBSI has been satisfactory (for details
see Appendix 17).
E. Socioeconomic Aspects
83.       The small size of the subloans and the nature of
many of them makes quantification of their socioeconomic
benefits difficult. Of the total 322 subloans, only nine
exceeded the free limit of US$30,000 and only four were
above US$100,000.  A number of subloans have been for the
purchase of transportation equipment including trucks, buses,
outboard motors and canoes. The socioeconomic benefits in
these cases include the generation of additional employment
and income for people in rural areas, mobilization of personal
savings, assistance to poor people, nurturing their entre-
preneurship skills and improving transport facilities. The
two largest subloans (US$296,000 each) financed the procure-
ment of interisland vessels to facilitate the regular move-
ment of goods which will stimulate further production of
cash crops and raise farming aubove the subsistence level.
84,       A selection of 74 DBSI Bank subloans in various
subsectors amounting to SI$1.02 million (US$1.21 willion)
or 61 per cent of the Bank's loan also indicates DBSI's
fairly significant role.  These subprojects have benefitted
about 368 persons with wages and cash income of SI$007
million. The total revenues and gross value added have
been approximately SI$2.50 million and SI$114 million
respectively.

X. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Loan Amount, Borrower and Executing Agency
85.        On the basis of DBSI's estimated additional foreign
currency requirements of SI$5.3 million (equivalent to US$6.52
million) during 1981 and 1982, it is proposed that a Bank loan
of US$2.0 million equivalent be extended to Solomon Islands
(Borrower) from the Special Fund resources in a cofinancing
arrangement with IDA, which would provide a credit of US$1.5
million under the standard IDA terms, making a total of
US$3.5 million (equivalent to SI$2.85 million). The proceeds
of the Bank loan will be relent to DBSI (Executing Agency)
under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bankl/
to be executed between the Government and DBSI. The IDA credit
will be administered by the Bank2/ and will also be subject to
the following terms and conditions as set out below for the
utilization of the Bank loan.
B. Main Features
1. Purpose
86.        DBSI will use the loan proceeds of the Bank and the
IDA credit to make subloans to finance the foreign exchange
cost of specific development projects.2/. The tentative sectoral
allocation is: agriculture, rural development and natural
resources (40 per cent); manufacturing (including small scale
industries and construction) (30 per cent); and commerce,
services and transport (30 per cent). Within each sector,
DBSI will give priority to making subloans to smaller enter-
prises, particularly those in rural areas and to enterprises
owned by local nationals4/.
2. Foreign Exchange Risk
87.        The Borrower will bear the foreign exchange risk
on the proposed loan.5/.

3. Utilization
88.       The loan is expected to be utilized within a period
of two years from the date of loan effectiveness. Considering
the need for flexibility, the closing date for submission of
subloan applications for approval/authorization for withdrawal
has been fixed at thr e years from the date of effectiveness
of the proposed loan-1/. The closing date for withdrawals is
four years after the date of loan effectiveness2.
4. Amortization
89.       As in the case of the first Bank loan, fixed amorti-
zation is proposed between the Borrower and DB P extended to
15 years including a grace period of six years  . DBSI's local
currency requirements are fairly large over the projected period.
A fixed repayment period would enable DBSI to recycle the prin-
cipal repayments received from its sub-borrowers. The long re-
payment and grace periods will strengthen DBSI's resource posi-
tion and help to keep debt service obligations and financial
burden on DBSI in its initial period of operations at low levels.
As DBSI is owned and funded by the Government and is an integral
element of the Government's development strategy, the proposed
repayment terms will also benefit the Government as the counter-
part funds of the Bank loan will reduce DBSI's demand for addi-
tional local currency funds for its operations.
90.       The sub-borrowers' repayment terms to DBSI will not
exceed 15 years including 3 years grace period except loans
for cattle, cocoa, and coconut projects whose grace periods
may be up to 5 years because of their longer gestation periods±!.
5. Interest Rates
91.       The relen§Ing rate by the Borrower to DBSI will be
fixed at 5 per cent- . Such a relending rate would conform
with Bank policy since it is based on the need to strengthen
DBSI's financial viability by ensuring it an adequate interest
spread- . DBSI's activities ,are still in an early stage of

development: its volume of operations though expanding
remains relatively small, and its activities contain a signi-
ficant developmental and promotional content. These two
factors result in high administrative costs for GBSI (see
paragraph 64). Furthermore, as a new DFI, DBSI needs to build
up its reserves to an adequate level. The country's interest
rate structure, within which DBSI has to operate, restrains
DBSI from unilaterally increasing its lending rates. In view
of these factors, the 5 per cent relending rate is considered
appropriate.
92.        DBSI's lending rate on subloans will be as follows:
a 4 per cent flat rate for micro-loans yielding an effective
rate of around 6 per cent on outstanding balances; 10 per cent
for agricultural loans; and 11 per cent for commercial,
industrial and service loans (both on outstanding balances).
In keeping with DBSI's policy, sublending rates on loans to
expatriates will be at least 1 per cent higher than these
ratesl/. The overall average lending rate on subloans during
1980-1982 is estimated at 10.1 per cent giving an overall
interest spread of 5.1 per cent on the proposed loan.
6. Free Limit
93.        Considering DBSI's past lending pattern and that
its staff needs more experience in project appraisal, the free
limit will be kept at US$30,000, the same as in the first Bank
loan-./ (of 322 subloans, only nine were above free limit under
the first loan).
7. Maximum Size of Subloans
94.        In order to ensure a wide and balanced distribution
of subloans, DBSI would not make any subloan in an amount
exceeding US$0.25 million equivalent except with Bank con-
currence-l. In view of DBSI's present and expected operations,
few loans will be over US$250,000. DBSI's Policy Statement
restricts its maximum commitment per enterprise to 20 per cent
of its equity; this limit amounted to US$0.77 million as of
30 September 1980.

8. Reimbursement and Expediures
95.      A period of 120 days for reimbursement of expendi-
tures incurred before the receipt of a subloan application
by the Bank will be allowedJ/.
9. Procurement
96.      DBSI will satisfy the Bank that the Procurement
procedures adopted by individual sub-borrowers are appropriate
in the circumstances. DBST will also ensure that goods and
services to be financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loan
and IDA credit will be purchased at reasonable prices, taking
into account relevant factors such as delivery time, efficiency
and reliability of goods, their suitability for the project
concerned, and the availability of maintenance facilities and
spare parts, and, in case of services of the quality and the
competence of the parties providing thema/.
10. C   erartnds
97.      DBSI will use all funds received from the repayment
of the principal of the subloans, subject to loan service
payments under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, to make further
loans in accordance with its Policy Statement4
11. Appointment of General Managtr
98.      Prior to the effective date of the proposed loan
agreement, the new General Manager shall assume full respon-
sibilities allowing the present General Manager to move into
an advisory role until the expiry of his termn&. The Borrower
would also, prior to making any future appointments to the
position of General Manager of DBSI, consult the Bank regarding
the qualifications, experience a d tenure of office of the

XI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
101.      The Solomon Islands economy is basically rural,
with about two-thirds of the population engaged in non-cash
agriculture. The potential for development is considered
good. Solomon Islands has successfully completed its first
National Development Plan (197541979) and has launched a new
National Development Plan (1980-1984) which will continue to
emphasize agricultural diversification, export expansion and
rural development. DBSI, as the only DFI in the country,is
expected to play an important role in the development of the
economy.
102.      Bank technical assistance to DBSI is being imple-
mented satisfactorily and is expected to be completed in June
1981,  DBSI's organization, management, staff, operating pol-
icies and procedures have improved and are considered generally
satisfactory. The quality of DBSI's portfolio and its finan-
cial position is considered gdod; its profitability has so far
been marginal but is expected to improve in the future. DBSI
is also fully supported by the Government. With the expansion
in DBSI's operations, its dependence on the Government's direct
financial support will gradually decline,  The utilization of
the first Bank loan has been faster than expected. The Govern-
ment and DBSI have gernrally complied with the covenants of the
first loan.
103.      In view of the foregoing, the Mission considers that
DBSI is a suitable DFI for a second loan. It is proposed that
the Bank approve a loan of US$2.0 million equivalent to Solomon
Islands from the Bank's Special Fund resources for relending to
DBSI to meet part of its foreign currency requirements during
1981-1982 on the terms enumerated in Chapter X and detailed in
the attached loan documents. The Bank loan will be cofinanced
by IDA for an additional amount of US$1.5 million equivalent
under standard IDA terms but subject to other terms and condi-
tions set out for the utilization of the Bank loan.

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF SOLOMON ISLANDS
Statement of General Business Policies
(Policy Statement)
I. The Bank
The Development Bank of Solomon Islands (the Bank)
was established under the Development Bank of Solomon Islands
Ordinance 1977 as an independent statutory body operating,
under the direction of its own Board.
The purpose for which the Bank may exercise its
functions under this Ordinance is the assistance of the
economic and social development of Solomon Islands within
the overall national development plans and strategies, giving
particular emphasis:
a) to promoting the participation of Solomon
Islanders in that economic development;
b)  to rural development; and
c) to stimulating processing and industrial
activities which might be expected to
strengthen the economic independence of
Solomon Islands.
II. Scope of Activities
1.        The Bank will conduct its operations within the
general framework of the national economic policies, plans
and priorities.
2.        Although the primary role of the Bank is to promote
economic development and production in the private sector,
the existence of Government or other public ownership in an
enterprise will not preclude that enterprise from being
assisted by the Bank.
3.        The Bank will finance projects aimed at increasing
production and development in the fields of agriculture
including horticulture, livestock and fishing, timber ex-
traction and reforestation, quarrying, industry, manufacture
and processing of all kinds, tourism, commerce, transport and
communication, service industries, includirng professions,
hospitals, schools, cooperatives as well as community activities.
(Reference to Text: Paragraph 37, page 16).



-50-                  Ap,pendix 4
Page 2
4.        The Bank will finance both new enterprises and the
expansion or modernization of existing enterprises.
5.        The Bank will provide financial and other forms of
assistance in the following ways:
a) extending loans;
b) making equity participation;
c)  guaranteeing the finance provided by other
sources;
d) providing technical managerial and financial
consultancy services; and
e) assisting in the identification, formulation
and promotion of new projects.
6.        The Bank's financial assistance will be primarily
for the acquisition of fixed assets.  However, the Bank may,
in deserving cases, also finance seasonal and short-term
credit requirements in the agricultural sector as well as
working capital requirements in any sector.
III. Development Policies and Operating Principles
7.        It will be one of the Bank's important aims to
investigate and identify investment opportunities, and promote
and assist in the establishment of enterprises of importance
to the economy of the Solomon Islands.
8.        When determining whether assistance shall be given to
any enterprise, the Bank will give preference to enterprises
which will:

Major Assumptions for Operational and Financial
Pro ections  19801984
I.  Operational Projections
A.      ovals
1. Loan APprovals - DBSI in 1979 recorded a loan
approvals growth rate of 67 per cent by amount,
Loan approvals have continued to expand rapidly
during the first nine months of 1980. Based on
this historically high growth rate and DBSI's
pipeline of projects, loan approvals are projected
to increase by 25 per cent annually from 1981 to
1984 (actual shipping subsector loan approvals of
SI$0.85 million are considered as extraordinary
and are excluded from the base year (1980)'s total
to arrive at this rate of increase). The foreign
exchange component of approvals, based on actual
experience, is 50 per cent overall.
2.  Equity Investments - approvals are assumed to equal
10 per cent of yearly approvals, given the increased
prospects of localization,
B.  Disbursements
l. Of SI$2.5 million awaiting disbursement as of
30 September 1980, SI$0.5 million will be disbursed
before and 1980, SI$1.5 million in 1981 and SI$0.5
million in 1982.  Of the projected SI$0.4 million
in approvals for the last 3 months of 1980, SI$0.15
million will be disbursed in 1980 and the balance
in 1981.
2. Based on experience, two thirds of any given year's
approvals are disbursed the same year with the
remaining one third the following year.
(Reference to Text:   Paragraph 73, page 32)a



- 65 -
C. Repayments
1. Existing portfolio repaid based on existing
repayment schedules.
2. Existing approvals repaid based on approved
repayment schedules
3. New (projected) approvals repaid as follows:
a. micro loans      - 2 years
b. agricultural     - 10 years including 5 years
grace
c. forestry         - 3 years including 1 year
grace
d. fishing          - 10 years including 1 year
grace
e. cattle           - bullet payment after 2 years
(assume for weaner fatten-
ing only)
f.  pigs and        - 5 years including 1 year
poultry              grace
g. industrial       - 10 years including I year
grace
h. construction     - 2 years (bridge financing
only)
i. commerce         - 7 years including 1 year
grace
J.  services and    - 9 years including 1 year
transport            grace
II.  Financial Projections
A. Income Statements
1. Interest Income - is calculated on average
portfolio at a weivhted'        !,nrS7 ¢,.-wt '-t-
of t.05 per ce-i- during the projected period
of 1980-1984.
2. Other Income - Service fees are calculated at
standard DBSI rate of 1 per cent of approvals.
The yield on equity investments, expressed in
terms of dividends only, is conservatively~
assumed at 1 per cent; thus, dividends will
increase by SI$5,000 per year. Commissions
(from Insurance Sub-Agency) projected to



- 66 -Apendix 13
Page 3
increase by SI$1,000 per year. Rental income
will decline to SI$10,000 per year as DBSI in
1981 will occupy half the space now leased out,
and will cease in 1982.
3,  Administrative Expenses: Personnel
DBSI staff is expected to grow by 15 to 20 per
cent in 1980/1981 to cope with the present
rapid growth in portfolio and loan approvals,
then by only 3 to 4 per cent in 1982/1983,
expected to be a period of consolidation.
Salaries and wages therefore will increase
significantly, by about 50 per cent in 1980
and 1981 but moderately thereafter(not
including the salaries of 3 expatriates to
be hired in 1982). Wage inflation of 5 to
10 per cent is assumed. The remaining portion
of increases in salary expenses is made up of
merit increases and increased staff.
4. Financial Expenses - The following are interest
rates for anticipated borrowings (all are per
cent per annum):
a. ADB (including proposed loan)
and SIG/EDF                     -  5.0
b. SIG/UK and ADB/CDA               -  2.5
c. SIMA                             -  6.0
d. NPF                              -  8.0
5.  Provisions for Bad Debts - 3 per cent of annual
loan approvals in accordance with paragraph 32
of DBSI's Policy Statement.
T.  Cash Flow Statement   (items not covered in I and II)
A. Paid-Up Capital - expected to increase by SI$500,000
per year.
B.  Drawdown of Borrow      - assumed as per respective
loan documents.
