MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 54.5 million (US$75.0 million equivalent) to help
finance a Transport Rehabilitation Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years. A portion of the credit proceeds (US$3.1 million equivalent) would be passed on to
Uganda Railways Corporation (URC), of which US$2.1 million equivalent would be grant and US$1.0
million equivalent would be relent at the rate of 7 percent p.a., repayable over 15 years including 5 years
grace and with URC bearing the foreign exchange rsk. The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) would
provide parallel financing in the amount of US$4.6 million for capacity building in feeder roads activities.
2.    Background: Uganda's population, as enumerated in the 1991 census, is 16.7 million and growving
at about 2.7 percent annually. Per capita GNP was estimated to be US$170 in 1992; about 90 percent of
the population is rural. At independence in 1962, Uganda had one of the strongest, most promising
economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The countty is not well endowed vith minerals or fossil fuels, but has
rich soils and a fivorable climate for agricultural production. The years immediately after independence
demonstrated the country's economic potential: real GDP grew by 5.8 percent per annum from 1962 to
1970, with per capita GDP increasing more than 2.8 percent per annum. In the 1970's and early 1980's
Uganda suffered a period of severe economic decline and instability, from which it has been emerging again
since 1986. The Govemment has been pursuing a wide-ranging package of financial stabilization and
restructuring policies and has been successful in bringing inflation down as well as liberalizing the foreign
exchange, market. It is also pursuing improvements in revenue collection and the balance of payments
situation as preconditions for recovery and economic growth.
3.    Uganda's transport system went from relatively well developed to practically inoperative between
the early 1970s and the mid-1980s. This was a result of the breakup in 1977 of the East African
Cormunity with its customs union and common transport services, and the period of civil strife and
devastation, during which Uganda's infiwtructure was severely neglected. Moreover, landlocked Uganda's
access by road and rail to the sea through Kenya became unreliable, and an alternative rail/wagon ferry
route through Tanznia was started. Since 1986, however, the transport system has irnproved significantly
as a result of rehabilitation of trunk roads, and expansion of the vehicle fleet. Road maintenance has now
begun to receive much needed attention to prevent loss of these valuable investments. At the same time, a
large agricultural potential remains untapped because most of the extensive feeder road network remains in
neea of rehabilitation and maintenance. Large Government investments m the locomotive repair facility,
wagon ferries and rolling stock in the Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) are yielding a relatively small
contribution to traffic expansion due to low operational efficiency and weak financial management and the
absence of an effective commercial strategy and marketing efforts. Ministries and agencies operating in the
transport sector suffer from budget constraints and related understaffing, as well as weak management.



-2-
4.    Organization: The Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication (MOWTC) is responsible
for transport policy formulation and execution, and planning, construction and maintenance of the main
roads network. It also supervises and regulates transport and communication services to ensure their safe
and efficient operation. Two arms of MOW`rC, the Transport Licensing Board and the National Transport
Safety Council, execute licensing and safety control activities for road transport services. MOWTC
oversees the activities of six parastatal bodies namely: (i) the Civil Aviation Authority; (ii) Uganda Posts
and Telecommunications Corporation; (iii) Uganda Transport Company; (iv) People's Transport Company;
(v) Uganda Railways Corporation and (vi) Uganda Airlines Corporation. MOWTC is divided into two
directorates: Engineering, and Transport and Communications. The Engineering Directorate is responsible
for road planning, design, construction and maintenance. The responsibility for &-velopment and
maintenance of feeder roads lies with the District Administrations (DAs) under the District Adminis on
Act of 1967, but the Ministry of Local Government (MOLO); through its Engineering Department
(MOLG/ED) is presently undertaking rehabilitation of, and providing technical advice, and flnancial
support for the maintenance of feeder roads until district capacity has been improved. MOLG will
eventually retain responsibility for the formulation of regulations and the monitoring of their
implementation on the district level, once the Districts have assumed the tasks now assigned to them under
the Decentralization Policy of October 1992. Monitoring will include regular inspection of services and
financial and performance audits at the district level.
5.    Sector Policy: The Government's strategic objective is to promote cheaper, more efficient and
more reliable transport services so as to facilitate increased agriculture and industrial production, trade and
tourism, and the delivery of social and administrative services. The Republic of Uganda has issued "The
Way Forward II, Medium-Term Sectoral Strategy", and further elaborated its transport policies in two
major documents, namely the Transport Sector Memorandum and the Strategy Paper for Rural Feeder
Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance prepared with World Bank assistance. Uganda's Transport Sector
Strategy stresses the need for:
(a) a balanced and sustainable roads program through, (i) better planning, and adequate
financing of main roads maintenance, and increased maintenance management capability;
(ii) pursuit of a rational program of roads reconstruction/rehabilitation, and (iii) in the case
of feeder roads, use of cost effective techniques for feeder roads rehabilitation and
maintance;
(b)  commercial orientation for the railways;
(c) cost effective policy for air transport development; and
(d)  improvement of international transport security.
6.    The Strat Paper for Rural Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance endorses a progressive
reduction of the force account mode of operations for periodic maintenance as contracting capacity in
Uganda increases. It further proposes to adopt labor-based methods or a combination of equipment and
labor-based methods in addition to equipment-based work. The expansion of labor-based techniques would
be gradual as it is a technique which, although proven in other neighboring countries, is new to Uganda and
requires intensive training of personnel.



-3-
7.    Project Objectives: The project would support the Government's economic recovery program by
helping it to improve the basic road infrastructure to the economy, and ensuring that this and the rail/ferry
infrastructure will be well maintained and efficiently managed. The project would assist the Government
to: (i) protect the capital investment in selected rehabilitated main roads; (ii) improve maintenance planning
and operations of the main road network; (iii) effect institutional strengthening of MOWTC, MOLG and
DAs to improve project implementation; (iv) improve feeder road network accessibility in four districts; (v)
train  local contractors for feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance; and (vi) reorient  URC's
management towards commercial operation and promote its financial autonomy. Expected key outcomes
by project's end include: main roads: (i) 97.4 kms of main roads would have been rehabilitated and
included in the maintenance program; feeder roads: (i) 680 kms of feeder roads would have been
improved; (ii) about 10 private contractors trained in labor-based method of road improvements; and (iii)
district works departments would be strengthened and employment of about 20,000 persons arranged;
railways: URC would be a fully commercially oriented autonomous viable parastatal entity, with well-
defined business objectives and plan. Government contributions to URC revenues would be confined to
compensation for obligatory loss-making services.
8.    Project Description:  The project would have four components: (a) main roads: (i) IDA-
supported share of a four year (FY95-FY98) agreed National Maintenance Program, (ii) strengthening as
well as upgrading, regravelling/rehabilitation of selected main roads plus (iii) capacity building in
MOWTC (US$76.6 million); (b) feeder roads: rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads in Mbale,
Kapehorwa, Tororo and Palissa districts and capacity building in MOLG and the participating districts
(US$16.5 million); (c) railways: institutional strengthening of URC and procurement of ferry maintenance
spare parts (US$3.2 million); and (d) transport planning: institutional strengthening in transport sector
planning (US$1.0 million).
9.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$99.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
cost of about 75 percent. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and; of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Uganda are
shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached.
10.   Project Implementation: MOWTC would carry out all project activities related to main roads,
namely maintenance and rehabilitation as well as its institutional strengthening. MOLG/ED would be
responsible for feeder roads rehabilitation activities until the District administrations had been sufficiently
strengthened, but the Districts would be responsible from the start of the project for feeder roads
maintenance activities. The strengthening of the District Works Departments will be achieved through the
training of staff under the project; staff will be obtained through direct recruitment by districts or
secondment of engineers by the Engineering Department (ED) at MOLG. The monitoring of project
performance in feeder roads activities would be carried out by MOLG/ED.
11.   URC would be responsible for the execution of the railways component. The Planning Division in
the Transport and Communications Directorate of MOWTC would be responsible for managing the
training and technical assistance for strengthening of capacity for formulating transport policy and
maintaining the national transport data base.



-4-
12.   Project Sustainability:    The main condition for sustained provision of transportation
infrastructure is adequate funding of maintenance. The project contains measures to be undertaken prior to,
during and following project completion in order to improve resource mobilization and allocation of funds
on a continuous basis. Organizational strengthening is also an important condition for sustainability.
Efforts to build organizational, technical and managerial capacityv would rely primarily on using on-the-job
training supplemented by some formal institutional training. The project would help URC gradually gain
more financial viability by a fundamental reorientation towards commercial operations, and efficient
financial management.
13.   Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement: IDA has provided five Credits to the
Government in the transport sector, namely the First Highway Project (Cr. 108-UG) in 1967, the Second
Highway Project (Cr. 1640-UG) in 1969, the Third Highway Project (Cr. 1445-UG) in 1984, the Fourth
Highway Project (Cr. 1803-UG) in 1987 and the Railways Project (Cr. 1986-UG) in 1989. Moreover, the
South West Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1869-UG) of 1988 and the Northern Uganda
Reconstruction Project (Cr. 2362-UG) of 1992, also contain feeder road components and main roads
components, respectively. The first three road projects were completed on time and without cost overrun,
and the fourth road project is approaching completion. The railways project has been closed in December
1993; it has assisted URC in obtaining its own statute in 1992 and developing a Core Corporate Plan and
Performance Contract with the Government as a basis for a major reorientation towards commercial
operations and improved financial management.
14.   The most important lesson derived from IDA's experience with support to main roads activities in
Uganda, in particular with the Third Highway project, is that Government commnitment to provide adequate
and reliable local financing for a clearly defined main roads maintenance program is an absolutely
indispensable factor for sustainable road maintenance, with improved management as a very important
supporting factor. Under the proposed Transport Rehabilitation Projeot, IDA supports a National
Prioritized Main Roads Maintenance Program and will agree with Government on scope, composition, and
mechanism for release of funds for the financing of road maintenance.
15.   Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement: The objectives of the project
are consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on May 20, 1993, of reducing
poverty by supporting the Government's efforts to accelerate growth and employment and impr-ve the
delivery of public services, including those to vulnerable groups. The project would support v. %nsport
infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation, which has a direct impact on the efficiency of the productive
sectors, as well as human capital development and institutional reforms in the sector, which are also key
elements in the Bank's assistance strategy.
16.   The Government's transport sector strategy fully takes into account the Bank-prepared 1991
Transport Sector Memorandum and the continuous policy dialogue in the transport sector in the course of
the project preparation. IDA has also supported the multi-donor Road Maintenance Initiative in Uganda.
IDA support will be crucial to achieving major policy reforms, particularly the establishment of a
sustainable maintenance program and rehabilitation of the road network, firmly linked to institution
building and manpower development. In railways, it would support improvements in financial and market
oriented commercial management. It would also support the Government's efforts to transfer to the private
sector, road works execution which it has been performing up to now.

17.   Agreed Actions:  During negotiations, the following main assurances were obtained: (a)
Government would adopt the National Prioritized Main Roads Maintenance Program (NPRM) for FY95-
FY98, including the IDA-supported Main Roads Maintenance Pro3rani (MRMP), the size and composition
of which would be satisfactory to IDA, and would implement the NPRM in a manner satisfactory to IDA;
(b) Government would review and confirm with IDA not later than four months before the start of FY95
and each subsequent year, the proposed annual road maintenance program for main roads, including
budgetary requirements and allocations; (c) Government would conduct a Mid-Term Review, not later
than March 31, 1996, which will cover the implementation and management aspects of the project, revision
of the Strategy Paper on Rural Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance, evaluation of the financing
mechanism for main roads maintenance, evaluation of MOWTC performance with respect to road
maintenance mandate, environmental measures taken, reporting, accounting and auditing performance,
disbursement procedures and overall sustainability of the Project; and (d) URC will improve its operating
ratio continuously reaching a benchmark of 94 in 1999. The Governnent has already provided IDA with
the Letter of Sector Policy.
18.   The conditions of Credit effectiveness are: (a) submission of a satisfactory Transport Sector
Investment and Recurrent Expenditures Plan for FYQ5 through FY97; (b) submission of a satisfactory
project implementation manual; and (c) adequate staffing for MOWTC and MOLG.
19.   The conditions of disbursement are: (a) for main roads. Government has allocated not less than
US$13.5 million equivalent for maintenance related expenditure in its FY95 budget; (b) for railways: (i)
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and URC; (ii) that URC has appointed
three management experts; and (iii) that Government and URC have established URC's capital structure in
the context of the Performance Agreement; and (c) for feeder roads: (i) recruitment of key technical
assistance personnel to MOLG and DAs; and (ii) fulfillment of conditions for the effectiveness of the
Nordic Development Fund Credit Agreement.
20.   Program Objective Categories: The project seeks to promote the economic growth, increase
ermployment, improve the quality of life and lower the cost of living of the population, both in urban and
rural areas, through the provision of cheaper, more efficient and reliable transport services. Tli poorer
segments of the population as well as the women will share in the project's benefits in so far as it makes
transportation less expensive, increases people's mobility in rural areas, provides access to social centers
and increases the supply of agricultural products. The project's capacity building elements are
considerable, and will contribute to the sustainability of road networks as well as railway services.
21.   Environmental Aspects: The project has been classified as Category B. The risks of
environmental degradation in the main and feeder roads component were found to be minimal, because the
road activities would be undertaken within the existing rights-of-way, without intruding into any historical
sites of national interest or causing illegal incursions on the protected higher forest areas of Mount Elgon.
URC's ongoing ferry operations carry fire hazard and water pollution risks which need to be remedied
urgently. The project would include actions agreed between the Government and IDA to prevent or
nitigate negative impacts from the ferry operations. The project would provide financing where needed for
mitigation actions, both in AIDS awareness and in fuel spill containment.
22.   Benefits: The main justification of the project is the promotion of economic recovery through
reduction of transport costs and improved accessibility to productive agricultural areas. A major benefit of



-6-
the project will be the establishment of a sustainable main roads maintenance program. The project would
contribute to the strengthening of capacity and capability of the ministries and local authorities in road
construction and maintenance, which would result in efficiency gains in maintenance management, as well
as better resource allocation in the transport sector. The project would help an increasing number of
Ugandan contractors to operate efficiently through training, better access to equipment and regular Iiow of
financing. An economic analysis of the various components shows an aggregated economic rate of return
estimated at 17.8 percent.
23.   Risks: There is a risk that the increase in the presently very low ratio of revenues to GDP would
not be sufficient to alleviate the severe budgetary constraints, thus resulting in cutbacks on core road
expenditures. As the Government is getting an increasingly firm grip on budget availability of resources
for maintenance, and has agreed to establish a Special Road Maintenance Account, to help ensure the
timely maintenance expenditures, this risk is diminished. Moreover, annual discussions with the
Government to agree on a sustainable level of road maintenance and core road rehabilitation have been
included in the project to help mitigate this risk. Government and IDA macroeconomic policy discussions,
including a continuation of annual Public Expenditure Reviews will also strangthen the Government's
commitment to road maintenance. A sector--wide risk is that the Government will not substantially improve
its management of public investments, and thus allow deterioration of the country's infrastructure by
inappropriate prioritization of, and inefficient execution of investment projects. The Project, as well as our
macro-economic dialogue, would address this risk through the rate of return requirements for new projects
and through an ongoing review of the transport investment program. There is a risk that URC would make
insufficient progress in transforming itself into a commercial enterprise, which would result in further loss
of its market share and weakening of its financial position. The project would provide technical assistance
to URC's reorientation process as well as the areas of finance and marketing to assist URC in this crucial
transformation period. Kenya Railways(KR) and Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) must also
improve their performances, or URC will be unable to provide efficient services to the seaports. IDA is
simultaneously providing assistance to KR and TRC, which, if continued, could help alleviate this risk.
24.   Recommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

DISBURSEMENT ISSUES
1.    The active IDA portfolio for Uganda at the end of December 1993, consisted of 27
projects for a total commitment of US$1.09 billion with US$674.6 million undisbursed. This
included 24 investment projects for a total of US$796 million committed and US$514 million
undisbursed. Over the last five years, the investment portfolio has shown a trend of rapidly
increasing undisbursed balance, growing at an average rate of 17 percent per year, whereas
disbursements remained at about US$68 million per year on average - with US$78.8 million
disbursed in FY93. The corresponding disbursement factor (ratio of disbursements to cumulative
net undisbursed balance at the beginning of FY) declined from an average of about 20 percent for
FY89-91 to about 15 percent in FY92-93. Meanwhile, problem projects increased from 14 percent
in FY92 to 19 percent of the portfolio in FY93.
2.    The portfolio's modest disbursement performance is due in part to its relatively young age
structure (average of 4.8 years). However, as suggested by the increasing number of problem
projects, there are also other issues which have undermined progress.
3.    The major issues are: (a) shortage of counterpart funds resulting from poor mobilization of
domestic resources and an excessive portfolio of externally funded projects; (b) weakness in project
management and initial delays in meeting conditions of effectiveness; and (c) other deficiencies
regarding procurement, management of special accounts, and compliance with audit covenants.
4.    An in-depth Public Expenditure Review (PER) will be carried out in FY94, following upon
a similar exercise in FY93 to reach agreement on a core investment program for which the
Government will provide adequate counterpart funding (even if this means postponing or canceling
non-core projects). Thereafter, the CPPR (Country Portfolio Performance Review) will finalize
restructuring of the Bank's portfolio on the basis of the framework provided by the PER. At the
same time, Government and the Bank will review progress in overcoming generic implementation
issues identified during previous CPPRs. Other plans for FY94 include: (a) organization of Se tor
Implementation Reviews in association with the responsible project managers; (b) provision by the
Resident Mission of greater support to project managers on procurement, special accounts,
disbursements, and auditing; and (c) continuation of the practice of preparing implementation
manuals for new projects.
