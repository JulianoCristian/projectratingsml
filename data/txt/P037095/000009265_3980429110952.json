in\n            rural and coastal areas of Maluku and generate economic\n            growth. This project has five components. The first expands,\n            intensifies, and rehabilitates tree crops on land owned by\n            low income households. It procures seed stock; trains farmer\n            seed growers on nursery methods for tree crops; trains\n            farmers in controlling coconut and coffee diseases and pests\n            and in intercropping techniques; and trains staff in disease\n            and pest control, farming systems development and extension\n            methods, management information systems, and other\n            specialized areas. The second component comprises community\n            development for infrastructure and income generation,\n            focusing on agricultural production, post-harvesting\n            processing, fisheries-related activities, and women's\n            income-earning activities. It trains facilitators to assist\n            community participants in planning, developing and\n            implementing proposals. The third component funds support\n            services for agriculture and fisheries such as processing\n            and marketing, animal health and extension, technology\n            diffusion and demonstrations, fisheries and marine support,\n            and seed multiplication for irrigated agriculture. The\n            fourth component improves docks for sea transportation and\n            on-shore (storage) facilities. The fifth component provides\n            training, technical assistance, and equipment to strengthen\n            the capacity of agencies to manage, coordinate, monitor, and\n            evaluate projects."}, "docdt": "1998-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
