                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR provides an update on implementation progress reviewed during the February 2014 mid-term review mission. The mission included a field visit to the Conservation Mosaics
                         in the Neiva, Acevedo, Palestina and Pitalito area. The mission culminated with a knowledge sharing event to exchange experiences, successes and failures between the five
                         mosaics of the Additional Financing and one mosaic (Mosaico Galeras) from the the parent project. The implementation of the project is proceeding well and there has been
                         significant progress since the last supervision mission. The project is on track to meet its targets by closing date scheduled for October 18, 2014.

                         The endowment fund has been capitalized in the amount of US $ 15 Million. The Project supports a range of interventions that seek to promote sustainable management of natural
                         resources and improve conservation of the national parks, working closely with the communities represented by the local working groups. One of the main challenges of the mosaics
                         concept is to continue strengthening social capabilities as well as the creation of social capital at the local level to promote long term conservation.

                         The project has contributed to strengthening coordination and knowledge sharing between Patrimonio Natural and SIRAPM entities, which include the Regional Environmental
                         Authorities (CARs) and National Parks in each of the five mosaics considered under this Additional Financing. Taking into account that National Parks buffer zones are not clearly
                         delimited, the project is promoting an integrated conservation approach for strengthening regional and local planning. This is particularly important since national parks and their
                         buffer zones fall under the mandate of “Parques Nationales” and areas around them fall under the Regional Environmental Authorities (CARs).
