   aquatic resources, with its watersheds feeding into “the four massive sub-continental basins
   of the Amazon, Orinoco, Caribbean, Magdalena-Cauca and the Pacific”2.
2. Colombia’s large biodiversity, spread-out across the country’s geography, presents a difficult
   challenge for decision-makers. The design of protected areas (PA) and the implementation of
   sustainable initiatives must balance conservation priorities with the needs of local livelihoods
   and with the restrictions imposed by the country’s armed conflict. At appraisal in 2006,
   approximately 26 percent of Colombia’s population lived in rural zones, and close to three
   quarters of the total population resided between 0 and 2,000 meters above sea level (or 95
   percent of the country’s total area)3.
3. Colombia’s national natural protected areas system (NPAS) includes: i) the national natural
   parks system (NNPS) with 58 national parks; ii) other protected areas under various
   management categories4; and a regional protected areas system (SIRAP)5. Colombia’s NPAS
   and other collectively-owned ethnic territories represent 37 percent of the country’s area6.
   The Administrative Unit of the National Natural Park System (UAESPNN, in Spanish
   Unidad Administrativa Especial del Sistema de Parques Nacionales Naturales) is responsible
   for managing the NNPS and coordinating the NPAS.
4. At the time of appraisal, several factors were limiting the effectiveness of biodiversity
   conservation in the NPAS; in particular: (i) pressure on natural resources due to widespread
   poverty and unsustainable production models; (ii) financial constraints throughout the NPAS;
   (iii) incipient levels of coordination between complementary PA management categories and
   sustainable use strategies, weak inter-institutional coordination; and (iv) low levels of
   community organization. Additionally, the country’s internal conflict led to insecure land
   tenure, the fragmentation of social networks, and low institutional trust among some local
   communities7.
5. The project was seen as an integral response to the challenges described above that would
   contribute towards the Bank’s and GEF’s strategies to support specific national parks,
   conservation and sustainable management in rural landscapes. The project would further
   support the NPAS through the establishment of a new Trust Fund that would support a unique
   combination of a sinking fund (for financing on-the-ground conservation of protected areas),
   and an endowment fund (to develop a long-term financial sustainability mechanism to
   provide predictable financial resources)8. In addition, the project introduced a novel approach
   to management and sustainability of PA through the ‘mosaic’ concept.
6. Conservation Mosaics (CM) are defined as networks of protected areas and complementary
   landscapes that include combinations of national parks (i.e. the core conservation areas),
   production landscapes and collectively-owned ethnic territories (i.e. the surrounding areas) 9 .
   The project was implemented in 14 CM10. The approach recognized that protected areas are
   critical for protecting biodiversity, but that conservation is closely tied to land use pressures


                                                                                                  1
      outside the protected areas. The concept promoted sustainable landscape management
      processes that focused on biodiversity conservation and the social and economical needs of
      local communities11.
7. The project contributed to GEF’s Strategic Priority SP1 (Catalyzing Sustainability of
   Protected Areas) and Operational Program objectives OP2, OP3 and OP412. The project's
   global environment objectives were in line with the priorities outlined in national strategies
   and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Colombia and remain relevant to current
   strategies to support economically and ecologically sustainable development for national
   reconciliation and durable peace.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
8. The objective of the National Protected Areas Conservation Trust Fund project was to
   "launch a conservation trust fund that will: (a) support the consolidation of the Beneficiary's
   national protected areas system; and (b) contribute to arrest and reverse trends in biodiversity
   loss". There was a discrepancy in wording of the project objectives between the PAD of the
   parent project and the grant agreement. This discrepancy was identified and corrected in the
   PAD of the Additional Financing 13 . Table 1 presents the Original Project Development
   Objective (PDO), the original Global Environmental Objective (GEO) and key indicators. In
   line with IEG guidelines, the ICR used the wording of the legal agreement. Any possible
   effects of the identified discrepancies were properly taken into account in this document.

1.3 Revised PDO/GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
    Indicators, and reasons/justification
9. Neither the PDO nor the GEO were revised.
10. GEO Indicator 1 underwent a corrective adjustment in March 2010 following the
    recommendations of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission which were later approved as part
    of the Additional Financing in May 2011. Indicators were opportunistically adjusted in May
    2011 to increase targets, drop or rename indicators, when the Bank submitted the request for
    AF and a project extension, as a result of the highly successful project performance, seeking
    an opportunity to increase its impact15. Both the AF and the project extension were made
    official via a second grant agreement in August of the same year16.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11. Project beneficiaries were 752 families21. The project strengthened 37 social organizations
   and supported the creation of new organizations that promote environmental conservation22.
   The project also strengthened 22 indigenous and Afro-Colombian associations23. More than
   90 percent of baseline families, targeted to adopt sustainable production and improved
   management systems, continued to maintain them by project end.
12. Through the implementation of enhanced conservation, agro-ecological practices, and
    sustainable cattle ranching activities, the project helped beneficiaries improve their
    livelihoods by increasing food security and income generation for local communities24. By
    EOP beneficiaries had a better understanding of their territory and of the importance of
    conservation for future sustainability25.
13. Main beneficiaries included local farmers and fishing communities inhabiting seven of the
    project’s conservation mosaics, which included protected areas and their surrounding buffer
    zones. These mosaics26 were included as a way to ensure sustainable provision and use of
    environmental goods and services for local communities. In addition, the project intervened
    in seven ethnic-territorial mosaics where the target populations included indigenous and Afro-
    Colombian people. Here three mosaics overlapped with indigenous communities27 and four
    mosaics overlapped with Afro-Colombian communities28.
14. Main institutional beneficiaries were the Regional Autonomous Environmental Authorities
    (CARs, Spanish acronym for Corporaciones Autónomas Regionales), in charge of managing
    territories surrounding protected areas and their buffer zones, and the UAESPNN.


1.5    Original Components

Original Component/Subcomponents
Component 1. Capitalization of Endowment and Consolidation of FUNBAP
• The objectives of this component were to capitalize the endowment fund, design and implement a
    financial capitalization strategy, and provide sinking funds to support capacity-building investments in the
    19 selected conservation mosaics (14 in the parent project, additional five in the AF). This component was
    linked to PDO Outcomes 1 (FUNBAP operational) and 2 (conservation mosaics under improved
    management systems).
Component 2. Conservation Mosaics Program
• The objective of this component was to support the consolidation of 19 conservation mosaics (14 in the
    parent project, additional five in the AF) by improving their management. Subcomponents included (i)
    design and implementation of conservation programs (including management plans for national parks
    inside the mosaics), management strategies and sustainable production systems within conservation
    mosaics, and (ii) provision of support to potential beneficiaries (including technical assistance and


                                                                                                                         4

    training) to assist in the design and identification of sub-project proposals. This component was linked to
    PDO Outcomes 2 (conservation mosaics under improved management systems) and 3 (conservation
    mosaic work plans in place). Component 2 also contributed directly to the achievement of GEO Outcomes
    1 (maintaining at least 90% of the vegetation cover) and 2 (improving ecological connectivity); the
    component also supported the achievement of GEO Outcome 3, added for AF (improved biodiversity
    conservation).
Component 3. Project Management and Institutional Coordination
• The objective of this component was to provide the necessary support for FUNBAP (later Patrimonio
    Natural) to adequately implement the technical and fiduciary aspects of the project, including monitoring
    and evaluation. The component provided resources for (i) strengthening FUNBAP’s institutional
    structure, (ii) implementing outreach and communication activities to disseminate project information and
    results, (iii) setting up local participatory management structures, (iv) designing and implementing
    capacity-building actions, and (v) carrying out the project’s monitoring and evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components
15. The scope of some activities of components 2 and 3 was expanded for the AF. This
    expansion, being essentially an increase in the number of targeted conservation mosaics as a
    result of the successful achievement of initial target values, did not alter the objectives of the
    original components nor the PDO and GEO.
1.7 Other significant changes
Extension of Closing Date
16. The project underwent three extensions of the closing date. The original grant had a closing
    date of October 18, 2011. During the transition period between the original grant and the AF,
    the client requested an initial extension to April 18, 2012 to allow for information sharing and
   learning between the existing and new project sites (included under the AF). In 2012, the
   client requested another extension of the closing date for one additional year to April 18,
   2013, due to difficulties in raising the necessary co-financing for the Endowment Fund.
   Finally, the closing date of the project was extended to October 18, 2014 with the approval of
   the AF.
Reallocation of Loan Proceeds
17. The project did not reallocate Loan Proceeds.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18. From the beginning, project design was ambitious and innovative because it aimed to solve
    some of Colombia’s main conservation problems through an integral approach (the
    conservation mosaics) with an entirely new mechanism (the launching of a conservation trust
    fund). The mosaic concept supports a broader vision of landscape management, recognizing
    the importance of natural capital as well as the need to invest in social capital to promote
    long-term conservation. While the theory was known (conservation mosaics resemble
    Biospheres, the management concept promoted by UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere - MAB -
    Program)29, the concept had never been put to the test on a large scale in the field. Even
    Biosphere reserves have had a history of mixed results since its launch in 1974, due to the
    complex coordination arrangements and decision-making challenges associated with a large
    number of diverse stakeholders 30 . This particular project had a relatively intricate
    geographical, sociocultural and economic scope, as it was initially proposed to be
    implemented in 14 sites. The project included nine mosaics and five ecological corridors at
    the national level plus five additional mosaics at the regional level (in SIRAPM during the


                                                                                                                  5
   implementation of the AF) that were spread out across the country. They included ethnic
   territories (indigenous and Afro-Colombian) as well as fishing and farming communities.
   Annex 7 shows the original project sites and the five AF project sites.
19. The PDO and GEO were fully consistent with the context, limitations and opportunities
    identified during project preparation and design. The language for both objectives was simple
    and concrete, and their structure allowed for eventual adjustments in the results framework
    (which occurred, without affecting PDO and GEO during subsequent level two
    restructurings).
20. Lessons learned from other GEF/Bank-supported endowment funds were fully taken into
    account, and alternatives were evaluated, eventually discarded for not being considered
    comprehensive enough to achieve the planned PDO and GEO. At the time of project
    preparation and design, Colombia was experiencing an escalation of internal conflict, and the
    current peace process was not yet underway. As previously mentioned, the country context
    during project design and preparation was not favorable. The preparation and design
    acknowledged these difficulties and included enough flexibility for the project to adapt to
    unknown contingencies. This approach was crucial for a successful subsequent
    implementation. The lessons learned during implementation of the first grant were
    fundamental for the design and ultimate approval of the AF by the Bank and the GEF.
21. Quality at Entry was Satisfactory due to the reasons above. However, it is good to note that
    the original project PAD could have benefitted from a thorough editing and consistency check
    (see Endnote 13).
2.2 Implementation
22. Implementation reflected the care and due diligence put into the project’s preparation and
    design by the Bank and client’s teams. The PDO and GEO addressed actual needs filled by
    the project and contributed to the country’s national priorities. Project components, having
    been designed to target actual problems in conservation and landscape management, provided
    effective vehicles to channel project resources to local partners and stakeholders. The team
    highlights that, once the project became effective, Patrimonio Natural setup the necessary
    management structures with efficiency and in accordance with the plan. Strong support by the
    Colombian government, the UAESPNN and the various CARs involved in the project
    provided an adequate environment to start project activities on schedule. As the endowment
    fund structure had been extensively discussed and analyzed, Patrimonio Natural was able to
    design and implement the financial capitalization strategy without major difficulty.
23. The project relied heavily on proactive involvement of Local Working Groups (LWGs);
    structures that were established to promote strong inter-institutional coordination between
    national park authorities and the CARs in each of the target mosaics31. In Colombia, national
    parks and their buffer zones fall under the mandate of the UAESPNN, but areas around them
    are managed under CAR jurisdiction. As buffer zones are not clearly delimited, jurisdictional
    overlaps exist and can cause inconsistencies and conflicting conservation actions. Resolving
    inter-institutional conflicts was a key for successful implementation of project activities. The
    project’s outreach actions and permanent project team presence in the field provided an
    environment conducive for smooth interactions between the key stakeholders (UAESPNN,
    the CARs and Patrimonio Natural). During the AF, the project further strengthened the
    coordination between the three agencies, building on the structure of the Inter-administrative
    Framework Agreement No. 24 signed between the UAESPNN, the CARs and Patrimonio


                                                                                                  6
   Natural within the SIRAPM32.
24. The project was successful in setting up Patrimonio Natural from scratch and consolidating it
    as a well-managed non-profit organization33 with a mixed private-public board and private
    sector majority composition. The project effectively created a sinking fund that leveraged,
    administered, coordinated and allocated national and international financial resources for
    protected areas and sustainable conservation use strategies 34 , as well as strengthened
    interactions with different stakeholders (see Annex 9). Thanks to its structural flexibility,
    transparency and visibility, and to the additionality provided by project seed funding,
    Patrimonio Natural was able to allocate approximately US$ 68 million in sinking funds
    between 2006 and EOP in 2014, through the implementation of 214 projects 35 to an
    additional number of protected areas that were not even part of the original project (see
    Annex 9, Figure 7). Without the project funding, the team believes that this would not have
    been possible. Likewise, Patrimonio Natural was able to successfully capitalize the
    endowment fund with US$ 15.9 million, of which US$ 7.5 million were provided by the
    project. By EOP, the endowment fund was supporting incremental, recurrent costs in two
    Conservation Mosaics to perpetuity36.
25. It is noteworthy that extensive coordination between the Bank and Patrimonio Natural as well
    as permanent support by the Bank team went a long way in ensuring a successful
    implementation. Implementation support missions (including the MTR) provided adequate
    opportunities to discuss project advances and solve problems, and paved the road for the AF.
26. In summary, implementation was carried out satisfactorily, and issues related to government
    or implementing agency control were adequately addressed and did not affect project
    outcomes negatively. Any delays, for example the issues that resulted in extensions of the
    closing date, were due primarily to unforeseen technical difficulties. Examples of such
    challenges include unresolved disagreements between local stakeholders that spilled over to
    project implementation or factors outside government or implementing agency control, such
    as reduced access to project sites because of internal conflict-related contingencies, or
    fluctuations in global financial markets that made raising counterpart funding unexpectedly
    more difficult.
27. Based on the rational outlined above, project implementation has been rated Satisfactory.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design
28. The project was designed with operational simplicity in mind. PDO and GEO were concise
    and concrete, and project components were neither overambitious nor beyond the technical
    capabilities of the implementing agency or the available project funding. Similarly, the results
    framework was designed in a way that precisely reflected the overall project purpose. The
    project had five outcome indicators (three for the PDO and two for the GEO) and 14
    intermediate outcome indicators. Where indicators included qualitative metrics (e.g.
    ‘improved management systems’ in PDO Indicator 2), the parent project PAD provided
    detailed definitions, providing good directions to monitor and evaluate the impact of the
    activities (e.g. see Endnote 17). Most indicators were designed to directly measure advances
    on the ground (e.g. numbers of families involved in a given activity); some, like both GEO
    outcome indicators, relied on external sources (e.g. trends for vegetation and forest cover
    between 2000 and 2012; see Endnotes 18 and 19), which provided an additional layer of

                                                                                                  7
   verifiability of the project progress.
M&E Implementation
29. Data collection was straightforward. Simplicity of the results framework, a strong presence of
    project teams in the field and intensive outreach and communication between the
    implementing agency and local stakeholders all contributed to the efficiency of the process.
    Information was available in relative real-time, limited only by the frequency of field visits
    and the relative inaccessibility of some projects sites. As previously mentioned, Patrimonio
    Natural succeeded in setting up robust operational capabilities immediately after the project
    became effective, including its data processing abilities – another contributing factor for a
    satisfactory M&E implementation. In addition, as per GEF guidelines for projects carried out
    in protected areas, Patrimonio Natural also implemented the GEF Tracking Tools as a parallel
    monitoring mechanism.
M&E Utilization
30. Data was continuously evaluated for institutional and technical performance issues.
    Patrimonio Natural not only measured project progress against established indicators, but also
    evaluated the effectiveness of these indicators as M&E tools. Implementation Support and
    Results Reports (ISRs) generated by the 16 pre-EOP Bank missions (including the MTR)
    show that problems detected during implementation were promptly discussed and addressed
    between the implementing agency and the Bank. In fact, during the March 2010
    Implementation support mission, the collected M&E data was extensively reviewed and
    contributed to a number of decisions, including adjustment of the intermediate outcome
    indicators (see Annex 2) and the wording of both GEO indicators (see Endnote 13).
31. The utilization of the project’s M&E system also (i) contributed to the development of the
    National Monitoring Strategy at UAESPNN (i.e. policy guidelines for monitoring, technical
    guidelines for implementation and guidelines for the management of information for the
    entire NNPS); (ii) developed, with the support of Wildlife Conservation Society, an
    innovative monitoring system for the Mazico area that included structural, functional
    (biodiversity and ecosystem services) and social (skills, actors and relationships) monitoring
    ‘networks’; and, (iii) showed that GEF’s Tracking Tools were a less than ideal M&E
    mechanism for integrated landscape management concepts like mosaics. Patrimonio Natural
    concluded that UAESPNN’s in-house M&E system ADEMAPS was better suited for this
    purpose and should be further refined and adapted for future use 37 . Ultimately, M&E
    provided the required lessons to improve the project for the design and implementation of the
    AF38.
M&E Rating
32. The team considered that the M&E system was adequately designed and responded to the
    needs of the project’s objectives and components. The implementing agency was proactive in
    collecting and using data, and made required adjustments in a timely and effective manner.
    M&E was key for successful implementation and provided lessons and an enabling
    environment for future use. The overall M&E quality is rated High.
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
33. The project triggered safeguards OP 4.01, 4.36, 4.09, 4.11, 4.10 and 4.12. For the AF, OP
    4.04 was also triggered as a precautionary measure since the mosaic’s landscape approach
    could potentially include some natural habitats. The Project had a Category "B"
    environmental classification, requiring a partial Environmental Assessment (EA) but not a


                                                                                                8
   full scale Environmental Impact Assessment39.
34. Compliance was consistently rated Satisfactory in the ISRs throughout implementation,
    requiring only minor adjustments. Issues that arose were discussed during implementation
    support missions and were resolved in a timely manner by the implementing agency and the
    Bank Task Team40. There were no major concerns identified with relation to the meaningful
    participation of indigenous people in some communities (issue raised in Endnote 40).
35. The project’s work within the ethnic conservation mosaics fully complied with OP 4.10.
    Participation in the LWGs by indigenous communities was done through prior, free,
    informed, and culturally appropriated consultation with their traditional representatives and
    governance bodies. LWG’s integrated planning process supported governance strengthening
    and territorial management capacity building by supporting ethnic territorial planning41, while
    also recognizing their traditional and political authorities.
36. Likewise, environmental aspects were adequately taken into account in compliance with
    relevant environmental safeguards. An environmental and social management framework was
    prepared to screen, assess, and mitigate environmental impacts related to the proposed
    investments in productive activities. The project supported biodiversity-friendly production
    and improved management systems to enhance ecological connectivity, species and
    ecosystem protection and natural vegetation coverage. Project activities were based on
    voluntary agreements, social awareness and commitment to sustainable management of
    natural resources.
37. Project procurement and financial management were considered to be Satisfactory
    throughout project implementation. Since Patrimonio Natural had no prior project execution
    track record, the Financial Management and Procurement risks were considered High. In
    order to mitigate such risks, best practices and procedures were incorporated to meet Bank
    fiduciary and procurement requirements, in particular an adequate project structure for project
    execution and financial management42. Furthermore, as a condition to effectiveness of the
    AF, the hiring of a financial sub-director with experience and qualifications acceptable to the
    World Bank was included. Throughout the course of project implementation, Patrimonio
    Natural maintained a well-staffed project team with the necessary experience and
    qualifications for adequate project management. Financial Management and Procurement
    risks for the AF were considered Low. Towards the end of the project, Patrimonio Natural
    was asked to improve its financial management and procurement procedures, in response to a
    prior audit and observations made by the Bank regarding single-source procurement as well
    as delays in their updating its operational manual43. These observations were adequately and
    timely resolved.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38. GoC continuously supports the consolidation of the National Protected Areas System (NPAS)
    by promoting sustainable land use practices and better governance through the Forest
    Conservation and Sustainability in the Heart of the Colombian Amazon Project44 to reduce
    deforestation and conserve biodiversity in over 9 million ha in the heart of the Colombian
    Amazon.
39. The heart of the Amazon project applies the mosaic approach introduced by this project,
    supports an Integrated Management Approach 45 that integrates sustainable development
    plans with conservation goals, and includes in its target areas the newly expanded Parque


                                                                                                 9
   Nacional Natural Cerrania de Chiribiquete (PNNSCH), which is the biggest national park in
   Colombia with 2.7 million ha, and its buffer zone46.
40. In October 2013, GoC launched its “Amazon Vision.” It states that the Amazon “cannot
    simply be a large protected area, but ought to seek additional alternatives for development
    and integrate its population into the global economy, while also creating wealth and
    prosperity for the country at large”47.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
41. The Bank’s current CPS acknowledges that Colombia has made remarkable advances in
    environmental management, both in conservation of biodiversity and protected areas as well
    as in promoting sustainable agriculture with a landscape conservation approach. By citing this
    project, the CPS developed the ‘Sustainable Growth with Enhanced Climate Change
    Resilience’ partnership strategy, which includes three results areas and seven outcomes. Since
    the current CPS took into account lessons learned from previous initiatives (including this
    project) and focuses on the continuity of such initiatives, project objectives, design and
    implementation remain relevant. Specifically, the project contributed to the CPS’ results area
    3 (Improved Environmental Management and Climate Change Resilience), outcome 2
    (Government has mainstreamed improved environmental practices in the agricultural sector
    through a scaling-up of silvopastoral livestock systems)48.
42. Colombia is in the process of completing the draft 2014-2018 National Development Plan.
    The plan defines sustainable development, conservation of biodiversity and management of
    protected areas as key targets for the country’s development goals. Sustainable land
    management in areas directly affected by the Colombian conflict is also included 49 . The
    project, having implemented activities in all of these four areas, remains highly relevant under
    this plan.
43. The relevance of the project’s GEO was assessed against GEF’s current programmatic
    directions (GEF 6), which became effective on July 1, 2014. The project was successful in
    creating a dedicated trust fund to support Colombia’s protected area management structure,
    thereby enhancing its sustainability. The project also provided direct sinking funding for
    specific protected areas. Consequently, threats to biodiversity have been significantly
    reduced. The innovative system of combining conservation and productive landscapes is
    becoming mainstream by incorporating the project lessons in the country’s new National
    Development Plan (see above). As a result, project objectives clearly contributed towards
    GEF’s Biodiversity Objectives 1, 2 and 450.
44. Given that the project’s PDO and GEO are in line with current Bank strategy, GoC national
    development priorities and current GEF conservation priorities, the Relevance of Objectives
    is High.
45. Activities and results were clearly related to the expected outcomes and the project design
    was concise and simple in its approach, providing enough flexibility to adapt to variations in
    implementation, as well as creating a smooth transition to the project’s additional funding
    phase in 2011. The project’s results framework provided a well-defined logical structure to
    establish a clear causal relationship between project funding and outcomes. The team
    examined whether the conservation objectives could have been achieved without the trust and
    sinking funds. It was concluded that, without the additionality provided by the project, this
    would have been unlikely within the timeframe of the Bank’s current CPS, or in time to be

                                                                                                 10
   included in the country’s new development plan. In conclusion, project design was
   fundamental to the successful achievement of the project objectives. The Relevance of
   Objectives, Design and Implementation is therefore rated High.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
46. The wording of the PDO and GEO contained the phrase “to launch a conservation trust fund
    that will”, followed by “support the consolidation of the Beneficiary's national protected areas
    system” in the case of the PDO, and “contribute to arrest and reverse trends in biodiversity
    loss.” in the case of the GEO. For purposes of the ICR, achievement was measured against
    the evidence of having consolidated “the Beneficiary's national protected areas system” (for
    the PDO) and evidence of improved state of biodiversity as tested against trends in its loss
    (for the GEO). Establishing the conservation trust fund was considered an output included in
    the key indicator list.
47. The project successfully contributed to the NPAS consolidation through the establishment of
    Patrimonio Natural (a non-profit organization with a mixed public-private participation) and a
    Conservation Trust Fund to support a unique combination of a sinking fund (to finance on-
    the-ground conservation of protected areas), and an endowment fund (to develop a long-term
    financial sustainability mechanism that provides predictable financial resources beyond the
    lifetime of the project). The endowment fund was capitalized with US$15.9M of which
    US$7.5M was provided by the project. In addition, the project introduced a novel approach
    for sustainable management of PA and surrounding rural landscapes through the ‘mosaic’
    concept. Two conservation mosaics are now financed to perpetuity by the endowment.
    Eleven Conservation Mosaic Work Plans were prepared as a result of an integrated planning
    process linking national park objectives and surrounding landscapes' development plans.
48. Through the mosaic approach, the project promoted biodiversity conservation in the project’s
    national parks and buffers zones and empowerment of local communities. By EOP, 2,638,018
    ha of core conservation areas (108 percent of the revised target value) and 1,444,246 ha (51
    percent) of the surrounding territories were protected. Ecological connectivity had been
    improved in 8 conservation mosaics. The project strengthened 37 social organizations and
    supported the creation of new organizations that promote environmental conservation. The
    project also strengthened 22 indigenous and Afro-Colombian associations.
49. While a results framework-only analysis of outputs and outcomes is usually not the most
    desirable approach for an ICR since projects in many cases do not contain the straightforward
    causal chain of an ideal project, this project was unique in the sense that it was well-designed
    and included a strong M&E system that allowed clear measurements of the progress and
    direct achievement of the targets. As previously mentioned, metrics to evaluate indicators
    were clearly defined and provided good causal linkage between project contributions, outputs
    and outcomes, effectively leading to the achievement of the project objectives.
50. That said, the team did attempt to evaluate the counterfactual by analyzing the hypothetical
    scenario where FUNBAP/Patrimonio Natural had not been created and the endowment fund
    had not been established and capitalized. Although FUNBAP was created before the project
    became effective, the set-up was part of project’s preparatory activity. Its main purpose was
    to provide the enabling conditions for the establishment of the trust fund and for managing
    the sinking funds that were destined to support the country’s national park system. The team
    concluded that there was a clear attribution between project support and achievement of
    project objectives – had the project not been there, FUNBAP would most probably not have


                                                                                                 11
   been created (at least not in its current, successful iteration), and applying the concept of
   mosaics would not have been feasible (or at least would have been much more difficult).
51. In the case of the PDO, targets for all outcome indicators were not only achieved but also
    surpassed. In fact, despite occasional setbacks and some delays, implementation was so
    successful that the AF expanded the scope of the intervention and increased the target values,
    which were ultimately achieved as well. By carefully reviewing the project documents and
    results including aide-memoires of the Bank missions, interviewing staff at Patrimonio
    Natural, visiting project sites, and talking to local stakeholders during the ICR preparation
    mission, the team is confident that the PDO was fully achieved and, in some cases, exceeded.
52. The case of the GEO was similar to the PDO, except that measurement of progress included
    external sources of information that showed positive trends in vegetation and forest cover
    over a number of years (97% of the baseline natural vegetation coverage remain in each core
    conservation area at the project end, see Endnotes 18 and 19). Such results show that the
    project has indeed yielded a positive and measurable impact on biodiversity. As with the
    PDO, the GEO was fully achieved – with one caveat; as was stated in the PAD, measuring
    trends in biodiversity is difficult over the relatively short span of the project. Indirect data
    allows for inferences, but unless full field validations are carried out (which were not done in
    this project) there is no absolute certainty.
53. Based on the above discussion, the ICR rates the efficacy as Substantial51.
3.3 Efficiency
54. The project’s efficiency is rated as Substantial as the ex-post economic analysis reveals
    significant positive results calculated as net present values and economic rates of returns.
    These results are based on a range of simulated scenarios. The robustness of the results was
    confirmed by positive economic result assuming a reduction of economic benefits by 50
    percent coupled with lower reductions in deforestation figures. In this scenario, the NPV is
    estimated to US$ 8 million and the Benefit-Cost Ratio is 1.5, which indicates that net benefits
    still exceed net costs by 1.5 times.
55. Further, given the valuation methodology used to determine per hectare economic values for
    protected areas as applied in this analysis, the significant numerical economic benefits are
    still likely to be underestimated – or at least be at the lower end – of full economic values as
    other environmental services and co-benefits, not least carbon sequestration and storage,
    hydrologic and other watershed services, and amenity and bequest values, are not accounted
    for. Had those benefit categories been included in the quantitative modeling, the selected
    economic benefit parameters (ERR, NPV, BCR) would have been significantly magnified.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
56. As discussed above, the PDO and GEO were fully achieved or even exceeded. The efficacy
    for the PDO and GEO was rated Substantial. Efficiency was rated Substantial. The
    Relevance of Project Development Objectives and Design was rated High.
57. Based on the above, the Overall Outcome of the project has been rated Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
58. The mosaic concept aims at promoting conservation while also benefiting local communities
    through the implementation of sustainable production systems52, seeking local appropriation
    of conservation strategies to secure the sustainability of protected areas. Although the project
    was not specifically designed to alleviate poverty, the mosaic approach had intrinsic effects
    on poverty reduction. Through the implementation of agro-ecological and sustainable cattle
    ranching activities53, the project generated an increase of agricultural productivity that helped
    beneficiary families and local indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities improve their
    food security, as well as, in some cases, generate additional income from selling and
    marketing their products54.
59. Although the project did not specifically target the gender dimension, it contributed to the
    empowerment of women; through their participation in the LWGs, their technical,
    environmental and social capacities were strengthened and new networks were created in the
    communities. Women played a crucial role in the project’s successful implementation by
    actively supporting rural households, achieving food security and generating income.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
60. Institutional strengthening was part of the original outcomes and outputs of the project.
    Patrimonio Natural, UAESPNN and CARs benefitted from project interventions. LWGs were
    provided with the enabling conditions to demonstrate the advantages of inter-institutional
    coordination within a mosaic-style approach to landscape conservation and management. No
    additional institutional change or strengthening was intentionally or unintentionally
    implemented.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
61. No other unintended outcomes and/or impacts was registered.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
62. No EOP beneficiary survey or EOP-specific stakeholder workshop was carried out for the
    project. However, as mentioned in Annex 5, Patrimonio Natural regularly deployed
    evaluation exercises among local stakeholders to ensure that the project was achieving its
    goals, and when problems (including issues related to safeguards) arose, they were properly
    addressed and resolved. Private and public stakeholders generally agreed that the project
    provided extensive learning opportunities and practical choices to blend conservation with
    local livelihoods through sustainable landscape management. This was seen in both instances
    of the project; during the original phase, protected areas had an increased level of public
    support that helped enhance the project’s conservation goals. During the second phase of the
    project, which specifically targeted the macizo conservation areas, public engagement was
    even more pronounced, as local communities and authorities felt that this conservation
    approach was closely related to their own livelihood needs. According to the majority of
    surveyed beneficiaries, the project also let to creating a closer relationship between
    communities and Parques.

                                                                                                  13
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
63. Initial project risk assessments were carried out taking into account the most controversial
    aspects that could possibly affect implementation. Overall project risk rating was substantial.
    By EOP, most (if not all) of these aspects had been adequately addressed and mitigated in
    such a way that they ultimately had no impact on the achievement of the project’s objectives
    and outcomes. The team evaluated remaining threats as well as the probability of these threats
    affecting the maintenance of project achievements, and concluded that by EOP the project
    had strong institutional, technical, financial, social and environmental capacities to handle
    them– Patrimonio Natural was enshrined in legislation and was performing well beyond its
    initial role of project implementing agency; the mosaic concept was adequately integrated as
    a mainstream landscape management approach; the endowment fund was solidly established
    and was providing (albeit moderate) returns to support the country’s national park system;
    LWGs and project interventions led to a good recognition of the mosaic concept as a socially
    and technically acceptable approach by demonstrating their positive impact on local
    livelihoods; and environmental benefits had been achieved as a result of the mosaic approach.
    The team felt that there was an adequate overall environment for a continued, self-sustaining
    ex-post implementation of project activities and maintenance of project outcomes.
64. Political and governance issues remained as potential conflict areas. Although the Colombian
    peace process had made significant advances by EOP, no final agreements had been reached
    between the parties. Still, the team considers that despite risks still being present in some
    project locations, project achievements were generally fully integrated into the country’s
    policy mainstream (see section 3.1).
65. Although revenue figures were promising (averaging an annual return rate of 7.72 percent
    between 2007 and 2014; see Annex 9), the endowment fund was found to be growing slower
    than expected due to difficulties in raising additional capital. Significant variations in return
    and COP-USD exchange rates in those years also contributed to a less-than-smooth fund
    performance. The team concluded that the fund would benefit from a stronger commitment
    and enhanced fundraising strategies by Patrimonio Natural to locate this capital.
66. As a result of all of the above, the risk to project outcomes is rated as Moderate.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
67. The team highlighted the fact that project preparation and design was well done, with proper
    due diligence carried out and a solid results framework put in place, despite the overall
    project risk rating initially being substantial. Perhaps because of this, the initial Bank teams
    appeared to have made special effort on mitigating these risks by providing extensive support
    to the local project preparation teams. Fiduciary and administrative aspects were adequately
    designed to compensate for the lack of experience of the then-newly created implementing
    agency (FUNBAP), and all the necessary safeguards were triggered to ensure that social and
    environmental contingencies were sufficiently addressed.
68. The Bank team missed in-text discrepancies, which resulted in some efforts for interpretations
    during the preparation of the ICR (see Endnote 13). In particular, the original PAD could
    have benefitted from better editing and additional consistency checks to avoid these issues.
    Still, the team considers that these were minor problems that did not prevent successful
    project implementation.


                                                                                                  14
69. The team did not find any evidence that would imply that the Bank had a sub-optimal
    performance during project preparation, design and appraisal. During the ICR preparation
    mission, the team was able to interview some of the original local project staff and confirmed
    that the Bank played a significant and proactive supporting role. As a result, Bank Quality at
    Entry is rated Satisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
70. The team emphasized that implementation was successful largely thanks to proper project
    design and proactive and timely interventions by Patrimonio Natural and the Bank teams.
    Although there were three different Task Team Leaders over the project period, Bank teams
    were highly proactive in their supervisory roles, flagging potential issues and taking quick
    corrective actions. For example, the Bank’s presence was vital during the major revision of
    the project’s results framework in 2010, providing necessary support to improving the M&E
    system. The Bank team also actively engaged with the client, GEF and Bank management to
    discuss and find solutions when Patrimonio Natural faced difficulties in 2012 in raising
    approximately US$1.2 million that were crucial for the capitalization of the endowment fund.
    Finally, the Bank flagged the need (and supported the client) to strengthen project
    implementation and develop action plans to promote a closer follow up of the project
    activities.
71. The Bank team was extensively involved in the design and subsequent approval of the
    project’s AF, and worked closely with the client to ensure that the additional project targets
    were indeed achieved. During the ICR preparation mission, the client acknowledged that the
    Bank teams always maintained their role as a cooperation partner while at the same time
    refraining from intervening excessively in the actual project’s implementation. The
    implementing agency as well as UAESPNN made a point of highlighting the permanent
    availability of and timely responses from the Bank teams, and were highly appreciative of the
    candor with which the mutual relationship had been carried on since even before the project
    had become effective.
72. The Bank performance was noteworthy during the implementation responding well to the
    needs of the project and significantly contributed to the achievement of the project’s
    objectives and outcomes. Supervision is therefore rated Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
73. Bank quality at entry and during supervision have been rated Satisfactory. Consequently,
    Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
74. GoC was very supportive of the project from its initial preparation stages. The launching of
    Patrimonio Natural and the consolidation of the NPAS were a priority for the central
    government, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADS) and for
    UAESPNN. The latter was a key institutional stakeholder that was fundamental to the
    project’s successful implementation and achievement of its objectives. The consolidation of
    the protected areas system is included in a number of environmental policies in Colombia,
    and has been present in the country’s National Development Plans since 2002 (see section 3.1
    for GoC’s environmental outlook in its 2014-2018 development plan).
75. The GoC proactively supported the project and the implementing agency in resolving any
    issues within its jurisdiction. The ICR rates Government Performance as Satisfactory.

                                                                                               15
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
76. Patrimonio Natural was created from scratch as the implementing agency for the project. Its
    lack of fiduciary experience was considered a high critical risk for project implementation,
    which called for an especially intense scrutiny by Bank specialists prior to project approval.
    Patrimonio Natural’s creation benefitted from a solid and well-thought-out institutional
    design that was fully supported by GoC and included input from consultations with a number
    of eventual stakeholders. Lessons learned from other funds were also considered, as were
    different fund management alternatives that were ultimately rejected. During project
    implementation, Patrimonio Natural was able to develop strong administrative, technical,
    financial, and procurement capacities, and managed to maintain good coordination and
    leadership qualities throughout. Patrimonio Natural’s technical and administrative teams were
    flexible and responsive, which allowed them to adapt to the diverse implementation
    challenges encountered at the local level.
77. Project information was readily available and complete, and in such cases where additional
    questions arose, the project team’s response was quick and accurate. Patrimonio also
    maintained an adequate level of monitoring and evaluation, not only during reporting periods
    but also throughout the implementation. The fact that the project was granted an AF
    demonstrated that project performance and achievements were satisfactory enough for the
    Bank and GEF to approve additional funding and time to expand the project’s reach.
78. As a result, the Implementing Agency’s performance is rated Highly Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
79. Government and Implementing Agency performance were both rated Satisfactory. The ICR
    rates Overall Borrower performance as Satisfactory.
6. Lessons Learned
80. The main lesson obtained from the project is that the mosaic conservation concept, when
    designed and applied with the necessary due diligence, strict oversight and extensive level of
    local participation, does produce significant conservation benefits. While the concept of
    Biosphere Reserves (see section 2.1 and Endnotes 29 and 30) does not necessarily work due
    to challenges in its underlying premises (e.g. that the core protected area is the centerpiece of
    the concept and the surrounding areas are essentially nothing more than buffer zones),
    mosaics have shown that the idea of approaching conservation, landscape management and
    local participation with the same priority level does work. The concept also demonstrated that
    protected area networks need to include benefit sharing and promote agreements with local
    communities in order to reduce the trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and
    economic well-being. The project served as the very first trial of this idea and then further
    replicated it during the additional financing. The team suggests that the Bank consider testing
    the mosaic concept in other countries with similar conservation challenges.
81. As mentioned earlier, due diligence and a project design that reflected a thorough
    understanding of the country’s and project sites’ current and realistic context were the keys
    for successful completion. Strict adherence to timelines and quick reactions to contingencies
    by the client, as well as a high level of proactivity by the Bank teams in providing timely
    Implementation support created a perfect combination of factors that resulted in a successful
    project. While in principle this should not be surprising, the team considers that this project
    could serve as a platform for case studies in efficient Bank-Client relations and project
    implementation.


                                                                                                  16
82. Local participation as well as a solid strategy for continuous communication and
    dissemination were the key to promote local buy-in and appropriation of project activities.
    The project made a point of not relying exclusively on ‘vertical teaching’ mechanism and
    strongly encouraged horizontal knowledge exchanges between stakeholders. For example,
    ‘farmer to farmer’ exchanges practiced during the project to share learning experiences
    increased the understanding of project processes and facilitated the adoption of project-
    promoted good practices. Knowledge sharing is not a new concept; the Bank well
    acknowledges its importance, albeit at an institutional level55,56. The team would like to stress
    that knowledge sharing at a local stakeholder level is a relatively innovative approach that has
    shown to be highly effective in terms of assimilation of lessons learned and thus could be
    proactively encouraged in similar projects.
83. Best practices and lessons learned from other World Bank/GEF-supported trust funds were
    taken into account during the project design, and indeed contributed to paving the way for the
    successful establishment and growth of Patrimonio Natural, a Trust Fund that ultimately
    transcended its original project management role and became a significant fixture in the
    funding of Colombia’s PA system. The institution now leverages and allocates both national
    and international financial resources of up to US$68 million through 214 projects in protected
    areas and sustainable conservation. The endowment fund was carefully managed and showed
    an effective annual return rate of 7.72 percent on investments, a significant achievement
    given the impact of global financial crises and variances in US$ vs. COP exchange. By EOP,
    Patrimonio Natural was examining the validity of using GEF funds to establish a relatively
    small endowment fund as opposed to spending them directly to support conservation
    activities. Although this could generate a larger impact on a cost-benefit-time basis than
    waiting for variable annual returns, the overall concept of setting up Conservation Trust
    Funds through a project was demonstrated to be a valid approach, and the project experience
    should be replicated in similar country and region contexts, provided that proper supervision
    and due diligence are applied as they were in this project.

1 The purpose of the Dutch Trust Fund (TF094084) “Conservation incentives for land management and socio-
environmental conflict mitigation project” was Co-financing of this project to “Help consolidate local and regional
territorial planning processes, by structuring a component for Payment of Environmental Service scheme and other
incentives/compensation scheme for biodiversity and protected areas conservation, under the financial strategy of the
National Protected Area System – NPAS”. This Dutch grant was in the amount of US$6.425 million. Since it was
not possible to structure this component, the project was cancelled after disbursing US$1.547 million. This TF was
not considered in this ICR as the grant cancelled without achieving its objectives and unallocated funds (US$4.878
million) were returned to the donor. The corresponding approved GRM Completion Report is archived in Bank’s
systems.

                                management and communities. As a result,
                                local steering committees were set up and
                                the CM technical and directive committees
                                were strengthened. Successful local
                                implementation was the result.

                                3D: The subcomponent was implemented
                                transversally across all project activities.
                                However, the most notable result was that
                                90% of local families that were trained in
                                sustainable production systems and
                                improved management systems still
                                maintained them by EOP. This value
                                surpassed the original target value of 30%
                                of families.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


     1. Colombia is among the world’s five richest countries in terms of biodiversity. The country
        possesses 18 ecological regions and is home to 15 percent of all known terrestrial species.
        Protected Areas (PAs) of various categories and collectivity-owned ethnic territories
        already represent 37 percent of Colombia’s territory.

     2. The project development objective is to support the development of the National
        Protected Areas System (NPAS) by consolidating a Biodiversity and Protected Areas
        Trust Fund. This Trust Fund covers both endowment and sinking funds. The endowment
        supports incremental, recurrent cost on the NPAS, while the sinking funds undertake
        direct investment in selected conservation mosaics.

     3. One of the key project outcome indicators is “at least 2 million hectares of core
        conservation areas (national parks) and 20 percent of the surrounding territories within the
        respective conservation mosaics under improved management systems.” Another
        indicator is “90 percent of baseline natural vegetation cover maintained in core
        conservation areas.” In contrast to the efficiency analysis done at appraisal, where local
        conservation benefits (such as water supply and ecotourism) and global conservation
        benefits (such as carbon sequestration) were separately categorized, the efficiency
        analysis performed here applies updated values for protected areas as established by the
        World Bank’s WAVES 2 initiative published in The Changing Wealth of Nations:
        Measuring Sustainable Development in the New Millennium (2011). Here, protected
        areas are valued through an opportunity cost approach, i.e. at the lower of per hectare
        returns to pasture land and cropland.

     4. For Colombia, the economic value of protected areas is estimated at US$ 2,441 in 2005,
        US$ 2,681 in 2008 and US$ 2,754 in 2010. The average over 2005-2010 is valued at US$
        2,625. The project’s actual total cost at exit is US$ 56.31 million (based on the co-
        financing table). Bank commitment of $US 19 million represents about 34 percent of total
        project cost. Therefore only about US$ 886 will be credited to Bank contribution in this
        economic analysis.

     5. After implementation, 2.6 million hectares of core conservation areas (national parks)
        have been brought under improved management systems. During appraisal, deforestation
        rate was estimated at 0.6 percent. At closing, the deforestation has improved from 0.6
        percent to between 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, which represents 0.3 percent and 0.4
        percent of deforestation prevented. Four scenarios have been used in the analysis with 4
        different simulations based on the following discount rates: 2 percent, 4 percent, 5
        percent, and 10 percent. First, assuming the benefit level of US$ 886 per hectare and per
        annum, the analysis looks at the results for 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent of deforestation
        rates. Then, assuming that only half of the benefits are realized, results are computed still
        with 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent of deforestation rates. Benefits have been discounted
        over 10 years.

   6. Limiting the value of protected areas to the opportunity cost of preservation, however,
      probably captures the minimum value, but not the complete value, of protected areas.
      Thus, ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and storage, hydrologic and other
      watershed services, and amenity and bequest values are not – or only very limited –
      accounted for in this ex-post analysis.

   7. For example, and given that different forest types were brought under protection through
      the project, it is especially difficult to quantify its forest carbon stock. For the Amazon,
      estimates for density cover a range between 70 and 120 tons of carbon per hectare (tC/ha)
      (Rovere, 2000); 191 tC/ha (Fearnside, 1997); or 150 tC/ha (Andersen et al., 2001). With
      economic values of carbon recommended for the WBG to range between US$ 30 (2015)
      to US$ 80 (2050), carbon benefits generated by the project could theoretically range
      between US$ 2100/ha/a and US$12000/ha/a. However, given the uncertainty associated
      with determining correct values for this specific project context, it was deliberately
      decided to conduct a lower-bound economic assessment that included only conservative,
      defendable economic values.

   8. Applying such a conservative, lower-bound approach to the economic ex-post assessment,
      but still deriving significant economic benefits, underscores further the robustness of the
      analysis and the significant economic value the project has created. If all possible
      ecosystems services and co-benefits had been included in the economic analysis, overall
      results would have even dwarfed already significant current results.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

No formal EOP Beneficiary Survey was carried out. However, Patrimonio Natural deployed
evaluations on a regular basis among local stakeholders to ensure that the project was achieving
its goals and that problems (including issues related to safeguards) were properly addressed.

For the Borrower ICR (produced by Patrimonio Natural in Spanish in October of 2014; see
Endnote 6 and Annex 6), Patrimonio Natural provided testimonials of stakeholders to support the
successful accomplishment of project targets. During the ICR preparation mission the team
interviewed some of the local stakeholders to test the general assessment of these testimonials
and found them to accurately reflect the opinion of some of the project’s beneficiaries. Below is
the original text in Spanish as provided by Patrimonio Natural with translations made by the
Bank team:

“El proyecto Mosaicos no se vio nunca como un proyecto aparte. Este es un reflejo que la
articulación a procesos es posible y que la gestión conjunta entre parques y comunidades para
la intervención en terreno es real y concreta; el haber hecho presencia permanente durante la
ejecución, reconocer los intereses de ambos y poner a confluir los objetivos del proyecto con los
objetivos de los procesos del río y de los del parque, permitió significativamente el
posicionamiento de la entidad a nivel comunitario y con otras instituciones. Este es un proyecto
piloto, cuyos resultados muestran que lo que se está trabajando en Yurumanguí pueda ser
replicado en el resto del territorio-región pacífico.” Luis Fernando Gómez. Jefe Parque
Farallones de Cali. 2010.
The Mosaic project was never seen as a separate project. This is a reflection that insertion into
processes is possible and that joint management between parks and communities for intervention
on the ground is real and concrete; having had a permanent presence during implementation,
recognizing the interests of both parties and having project objectives converge with the
objectives of the processes of the river and the park, significantly allowed the positioning of the
organization at community and institutional levels. This pilot project’s results show that what you

“La articulación que se logró en este proyecto no se había visto antes. El Parque nunca había
tenido esa articulación con Alcaldías, nosotros habíamos trabajado con la gente pero no
habíamos trabajado con cada alcaldía el ordenamiento, y de esto sale un ejercicio concertado
con las comunidades primero, y luego pasa al comité técnico y el comité técnico lo aprueba
mirando la parte biológica.” Nancy López. Jefe Santuario de Flora y Fauna Galeras. 2010.
The leverage that was achieved in this project had not been seen before. The park had never had
this coordination with Municipalities; we had worked with people but not with each mayor on
[territorial] management. This results in a first concerted exercise with communities, which then
moves to technical committee who then approve them with the biological focus in mind. Nancy
Lopez. Chief, Galeras Wildlife Sanctuary. 2010.

We walk slowly but firmly, with every peso invested in the project invested well. We want to
show our town and surrounding municipalities that a temporary a joint venture focusing on the
sustainability of water resources has a future and benefits our children, which makes good
everything that we do. I more and more like being part of this process, and I feel it increasingly

“Lo que vimos durante el proyecto es que la gente si le abre la puerta a Parques y hemos
garantizado una continuidad de trabajo con la comunidad; el proyecto nos ayudó a estar cinco
años haciendo cosas por la comunidad y eso es bien visto. La gente manifiesta que Parques si
está haciendo algo para la comunidad, que no es una entidad aparte, se sienten cercanos a
Parques.” Marcela Cano, Jefe Parque Nacional Natural Old Providence McBean Lagoon. 2012.
What we saw during the project is that people do open the door to Parks, and we have secured a
continuity of our community work; the project helped us doing things for the community for five
years, which is locally appreciated. People say that Parks is actually doing something for the
community, that it isn’t a separate entity, and they feel close to Parks. Marcela Cano, Chief,

conocimientos que nos trajeron nos hicieron ver la realidad de la vida, mirar hacia adelante. Si
no hubiera sido así, se nos hubiera perdido la finquita. No conocíamos el valor de nuestra finca,

“Creo que ha sido el mejor proyecto que ha tenido la Unidad de Parques por la fácil
adaptabilidad a los Planes de Manejo de los Parques, porque no fueron paquete tecnológicos
introducidos o marcos lógicos introducidos, se respeto la autonomía de Parques, se respeto el
hecho de una planificación válida, legítima, no todos los cooperantes respetan eso sino que
quieren hacer el nuevo esquema de administración del proyecto independiente de que ya tenga
un Plan de Manejo, este fue muy respetuoso." Gustavo Mayor, Parque Sanquianga, 2010.
I think this has been the best project that the Parks Unit has had, because of its easy adaptability
to the park’s management plans, because they were not imposed technological packages or
logical frameworks. Parks’ autonomy was respected, a legitimate and valid planning [process]
was respected; not all cooperation agencies do this but want to design the new project
management scheme independently of already existing management plans. This was very
respectful. Gustavo Mayor, Sanquianga Park, 2010.

“Se conocen dos momentos... El primero en el que era un parque alejado, casi sin presencia
física en la región y sobre todo en el área de Buenaventura. Ahora el Parque se hace visible,
cobra protagonismo, hace presencia institucional, y los más importante, se integra perfectamente
con las comunidades a través de unos mecanismos de interlocución, denominadas mesas locales,
en las cuales hoy el Parque es protagonista en trazar políticas de manejo territorial en
Buenaventura.” Rolando Caicedo Arroyo, concejal distrito de Buenaventura, 2010.
Two moments are known ... The first one in which this was a remote park, with almost no
physical presence in the region and especially in the area of Buenaventura. Now the park is
visible, takes center stage, makes institutional presence, and most importantly, seamlessly
integrates with communities through mechanisms of dialogue, called local tables, where the park
today is the protagonist in drawing territorial management policies in Buenaventura. Rolando

The assessment of the overall outcome of the Project since its objectives is satisfactory. The
project is considered relevant to the National Environmental Management System. The project
met its key performance indicators, and results have been used to inform the responsible local
institutional and organizational sectors. The project also allowed providing models that could be
implemented, adjusted and replicated in ecosystems and similar contexts. This is significant
considering that the project included the natural and cultural diversity of the country:
conservation priority ecosystems of Colombia (rainforest, Andean forest, high Andean forest,
wetlands, dry forest, coral reefs and mangroves); main geographic regions (Caribbean, Pacific
Andes and Amazon) and human groups representing the country's ethnic diversity: peasants,
indigenous, afro-descendants and island communities.

The project contributed to the social development of communities beyond the specific
achievements associated with the improvement of sustainable production systems.

Improved production practices originated from a holistic view, which incorporated not only the
technical tools but also the participation of women, the family and the recognition of cultural
values in the territory. This favored territorial appropriation, recovery of the social fabric in areas
affected by violence, food security, and strengthening of community organizations, local leaders,
families and women.

The territorial ownership was an unexpected improvement of production systems impact where
families benefited from different approaches to assess their farms, their productive potential and
its meaning for their life projects at individual and family level. This impact is significant
considering the trend of displacement and abandonment of agriculture in rural areas. This has led
to dependence on products not grown in local territories, and the loss of traditional knowledge
and genetic variations associated with ancestral cultures.

The project strengthened the management of National Parks of Colombia and supported the
implementation of the management plans of nine protected areas. It also contributed to the
development of conceptual, methodological and applied management strategies, such as
monitoring, ecological restoration, buffer zone and watershed construction. These strategies
benefited from initiatives applied in the fourteen national parks linked to the Project and were
later deployed nationally. The project improved governance in and around protected areas.

The project favored the governance of protected areas by providing: i) increased presence of local
teams in the area and interaction with communities, resulting in a better understanding of the
context and management strategies; ii) increased technical capabilities in the park, due to the
formation and qualification of technical experts and local teams; iii) the establishment of
technical partnerships for development and implementation of management strategies; and iv)
strategic relationships with communities.




                                                                                                    28
Relevant lessons relate to i) the outline of the project, ii) the community participation approach,
iii) implementing effective measures and management, and iv) strengthening local capacities.

i) Project Execution plan for the management of financial resources

The outline of the project was practical, adaptable to the conditions and context of each protected
area mosaic. This allowed providing timely responses to the requirements of different
interventions and complementary social processes. Financial resources were executed in real
time, which allowed meeting the expectations of the teams and players with whom commitments
were made and/or who shared responsibilities.

ii) Community Participation

Community participation in the identification, decision-making and implementation of integrated
processes for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, was supported in areas such as: a
methodology for adaptive planning, which recognized and strengthened own agendas and
focused on generating local ownership of the proposal to be implemented by the project; a
participatory approach that seeks to strengthen local governance; and a focus on social relations
that are achieved from an ethical and political position of respect and support for the self-
government of ethnic territorial authorities (indigenous reserves, afro-descendant communities).

iii) Effective management measures

The measures developed in the surrounding areas of the mosaics were based on conservation
strategies and sustainable production already proposed and tested earlier, making emphasis on
improving and adapting the management model to local contexts, to be implemented by social
organizations. This allowed for: i) the adjustment of the strategies and actions in some cases
making them more cost-effective; and ii) local ownership of strategies, which in turn led to
greater sustainability.

iv) Strengthening collective management capacities

One of the great advantages evidenced by implementing the Conservation Mosaics management
model, was to effectively strengthening collective capacities in various ways, building from the
each mosaic’s particularities and opportunities. The strengthening of local capacity was evident
in six areas: local ownership, technical, administrative, managerial and collective in generating
alliances and institutional ownership of sustainability.

Annex 9. Endowment and Sinking Fund Performance

A. Endowment Fund Performance

The graphs display the Endowment Fund’s annual portfolio (Figure 1) and annual returns (Figure
2) from 2006 to 2014. Table 1 and Figure 3 show the variations in average annual exchange rates
between January of 2006 and December of 2014. The graphs show that the Fund’s performance
was subject to a number of variations in exchange rates and capitalization problems. Changes in
global financial conditions in 2008 and 2012 had an impact on performance because of
difficulties in securing GEF co-financing for the capitalization of the fund 58 . Variation in
exchange rates had also an impact on the Fund´s performance, especially considering the
significant difference between 2006 and 2012 (see Table 1 and Figure 3). Despite these problems,
average annual returns for the period ended at 7.72 percent, which the team considered
satisfactory. As the situation in Colombia tends towards financial stabilization, Patrimonio
Natural’s fund manager has projected future annual returns above 6 percent commencing in 2015.

     Other protected areas include: i) regional natural parks, ii) forest reserves, iii) integral management districts, iv)
     soil conservation districts, v) recreational areas, and natural civil society reserves. All these protected area types
     are administered by the Regional Autonomous Corporations (CARS), except for the integral management

     UAESPNN faces the challenge of persistent financial gaps in its budget. In 2014 UAESPNN budget was COP
     $ 66.835 millions (COP $34.160 millions for functioning (51.4%) and $ 32.675 millions for investment (48.6%))

     Conceptually, CMs are similar to UNESCOs Man and Biosphere Reserves, although on a potentially smaller
     scale and with an integral landscape management approach (as opposed to a strictly conservation-focuses
     approach where the surrounding territories are little more than buffer zones; see Endnote 29).
10
     The project was implemented in the following 14 Conservation Mosaics: 1) Mosaic Cahuinari, 2) Mosaic
     Puinawai, 3) Mosaic Utria, 4) Mosaic los Farallones, 5) Mosaic Old Providence-The Peak, 6) Mosaic

     The project supported the objective of GEF’s Strategic Priority SP1 (Catalyzing Sustainability of Protected
     Areas) by: (a) establishing a long-term financing mechanism for key protected areas in Colombia, and (b)
     consolidating fourteen conservation mosaics, to encompass national parks, buffer zones and surrounding
     landscapes. Global biodiversity benefits were expected to result from: (i) consolidating protected areas with
     globally important biodiversity; (ii) supporting ecological connectivity, and (iii) improving ecosystem resilience
     to climate change. The project also contributed to GEF Operational Program objectives relating to the
     conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, resources under threat and endemic species in: (i) OP 2 -
     coastal, marine, and freshwater ecosystems; (ii) OP 3 - forest ecosystems, and (iii) OP 4 - mountain ecosystems.

     There was a discrepancy in the wording of the project objective between the PAD of the parent project and the
     grant agreement. The PAD described the objective as follows: "The project development objective is to support
     the development of the National Protected Areas System by consolidating a Biodiversity and Protected Areas
     Trust Fund." This discrepancy was identified and corrected in the AF PAD, which used the same wording as the
     parent project grant agreement. Additionally, neither the PAD nor the grant agreements specifically differentiated



                                                                                                                         41
     between the PDO (part a) of the objective) and the GEO (part b) of the objective). The PAD also contained two
     different wordings for Key Indicator 4 (the first indicator for the GEO); one version was used during the initial
     implementation phase, and was then substituted for the second version after an evaluation carried out during
     MTR. References to these changes are contained in project ISRs 8 and 9. The team recommends more attention
     to detail in order to maintain consistency between project documents.

     FUNBAP’s name was changed in December of 2006 to Patrimonio Natural, with which it was known for the rest
     of the project. For purposes of the ICR, FUNBAP and Patrimonio are synonymous.

     The team considers that the new indicator was poorly worded and could have benefitted from a clearer distinction
     between metrics applied. It is noteworthy, however, that this was an issue with the way the indicator was drafted;
     actual results did show improved conservation of biodiversity in terms of recorded presence of the species
     monitored and reduction in the amounts of firewood used.

     The project supported the creation of the following organizations with conservation objectives: i) Asociación
     Agroambiental Las Orquídeas, ii) Asociación Ecoturistical Guiders Asociation at the Peak, iii) Asociación de
     Guías de Cayo Cangrejo en Old Providence, iii) and the Asociación Anadaki in the Macizo.

     Some of the indigenous and afro-Colombian organizations that the project strengthened are: Consejos de
     Comunidades Negras de Yurumanguí y Los Riscales, Asociaciones de Autoridades Tradicionales Indígenas del
     medio y bajo Caquetá y Asociación del pueblo Nasa del sur del Tolima – ASONASAT. Through the strengthening
     of indigenous organizations, the project supported the creation of agreements to diminish the pressure on natural
     ecosystems (i.e. fisheries), and helped formalize special management plans and Planes de Vida.

     Good examples of income generating mosaics are Galeras Mosaic and Utria Mosaic. In Galeras, 12 coffee farms
     were in the process of being certified by Rainforest Alliance. Utria promoted agro-ecological practices, crop
     diversification and increased agricultural production to promote food security and marketing of product surplus.

     LWGs were key in promoting strong inter-institutional coordination between UAESPNN, CARs, local authorities
     and Patrimonio Natural (in particular during the AF), but faced the great challenge of working with poor local
     communities with general low organizational and technical capacities as well as with indigenous and afro-
     Colombian communities with diverse visions of the territory. Thus, the establishment of LWG´s took most of the
     times longer than expected, lengthening the project’s planning phase and shortening project’s implementation
     time.

     Patrimonio Natural was established by public deed of the Chamber of Commerce in Bogota on January 17, 2006.
     The Board is composed of 8 members (5 private sector representatives and 3 public sector representatives).
     Government representatives include the UAESPNN Director (that has the Board’s chair), a representative from
     the CARs, and one from the research institutes associated to Ministry of the Environment (in this case the
     Humboldt Institute). Private-sector members include the Javeriana University, Fundación Natura Colombia,
     Fundación Centro para la Investigación en Sistemas Sostenibles de Producción Agropecuaria – CIPAV; one seat
     is reserved for a renowned expert, selected based on his/her previous personal and professional experience.
34
     Patrimonio Natural strengthened interactions with different stakeholders, in particular with the Ministry of
     Environment and Sustainable Development, UAESPNN and CARs.

     A competitive selection process was undertaken to select those mosaics that would receive financial resources to
     cover their incremental, recurrent costs to perpetuity. Selection criteria included best resource management
     implementation scores and potential for long-term conservation and sustainability. Mosaic Galeras and Mosaic
     Orquideas were selected under this process.

     During the October 2012 supervision mission, the Bank Task Team flagged the need to strengthen project
     implementation and develop an action plan to promote a closer follow up of project activities. The project team
     created a very participative follow-up system with LGWs to measure the implementation status of each one of the
     subprojects in the mosaics, which was applied every three months. This had a great positive impact on project
     implementation.

     An Environmental Assessment (EA), Social Assessment (SA), Indigenous People Plan (IPP), Resettlement
     Process Framework (RPF), and an Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS) were drafted for the project.

     During the Mid Term Review of the AF (February of 20414), an issue related to the lack of participation of a
     group within the Gaitania Resguardo (Mosaic Nevado del Huila) in planned project activities was brought to the
     attention of the Bank team. As part of the Mid Term Review, the Bank’s Social Safeguard Specialist made a visit
     to Mosaic Nevado del Huila to visit the Gaitania Resguardo and Indigenous Authorities. The Safeguard Specialist
     assessed the situation and confirmed the compliance of project implementation with the IPP.

     Since the changes made to the indicators in the result frameworks between the original and AF were mainly to
      increase the targets and/or merge indicators, ICR considers that there was no strong need for a split rating.

      Beneficiaries agreed to participate in conservation activities in exchange for technical support, supplies, labor,
      and knowledge-sharing activities for the establishment of sustainable production systems in their farms.
      Sustainable production systems included agro-ecological and sustainable cattle ranching activities.
53
      The implementation of sustainable production systems took into account traditional and cultural knowledge
      practices.
