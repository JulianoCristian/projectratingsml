contribute to arrest and reverse\n            trends in biodiversity loss. The closing date of the project\n            will be extended from October 18, 2011 to April 18, 2012.\n            The extension was needed to allow for information sharing\n            and learning between the new project areas and the existing\n            project. This will be the second extension of the project.\n            This extension is required due to the unanticipated\n            consequences of the global financial crisis.
