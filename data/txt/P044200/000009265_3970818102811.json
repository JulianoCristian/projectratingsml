    institutional capacity for sound economic analysis in\n            support of market-oriented structural reforms. To meet this\n            objective, the project has three sub-goals: (1) to increase\n            the quantity and quality of cross-sectoral economic policy\n            studies for government use; (2) to establish the BEA outside\n            of but accountable to government, for an objective,\n            economy-wide perspective in assessing economic policy\n            options, and (3) to improve the reliability of the national\n            accounts as a basis for sound economic analysis. The project\n            will finance three components: (1) Policy studies- for local\n            and international consultants, and to obtain data to use in\n            medium-term policy studies focused on macroeconomic analysis\n            and public finance, social policy, and enterprise economics\n            and financial sector reform; for production of the annual\n            report, quarterly indicators, and quick-response policy\n            notes, and for databases to support these initiatives; (2)\n            Bureau of Economic Analysis- for the technical and human\n            resources needed to increase capacity for economic policy\n            analysis both in the BEA and in the core economic\n            ministries, including computer and information technology, a\n            library, on-line databases, and training, study tours, and\n            fellowships; and (3) Improvement of national accounts- for\n            computer equipment, training, and technical assistance\n            needed to improve the quality of economic statistics."}, "docdt": "1997-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
