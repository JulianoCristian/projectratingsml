Second, that by establishing\n            the think-tank as an independent entity, yet with a\n            governance structure that makes it fully accountable to the\n            government, allows to maintain objectivity of the analysis,\n            and recommendations, while preventing the institution from\n            deviating into researching topics of purely academic\n            significance. The Project shows how important it is to build\n            capacity for quality public policy analysis in the design of\n            an appropriate market model, in how to generate demand, in\n            how to deal with the informational asymmetries that cause\n            inefficient use of resources, and in how to ensure\n            independence and objectivity avoiding political capture of\n            an institution. Third, that for achieving all of the above,\n            the quality oversight of the research on the Bank side plays\n            an important role. It makes supervision labor-intensive\n            because it requires involvement of a broad team of Bank\n            staff in reviewing key analytical products of an\n            institution. Fourth, that long-term financing of\n            institutions, should be based on very solid assumptions,\n            i.e., creating highly professional institutions within the\n            public sector is contingent upon public sector salaries\n            being attractive - often not realistic - thus project design\n            should take into account options that foster public-private partnerships."}, "docdt": "2005-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
