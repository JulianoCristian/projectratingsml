1.  Ex-Post Review:  All other remaining contracts will be subject to ex-post review.  
Periodic ex-post review by Bank staff will be undertaken.  Procurement 
documents, such as bidding documents, bids, evaluation reports and all 
correspondence related to bids, contracts will be kept readily available for Bank’s 
ex-post review. 
 
2.  Training:  Budget allocated for training activities may include expenditures related 
to covering logistics of the participants and/or expenditures related to cost of 
services of training providers/consultants, and/or a mix of both.  In case the costs 
relate to logistical expenditures of participants (travel, per diem, conference fees, 
etc), these will be recorded against the Statements of Expenditures (SOE). In case 
training activities require hiring a consultant firm or a training provider, selection 
will follow applicable methods as per Consultant's guidelines. Such individual 
packages for consulting services related to training will be identified and 
individually included in updates of the procurement plan with appropriate 
selection method."
