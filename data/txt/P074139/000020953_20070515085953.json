There are 4 components to the\n            Project. Component 1 is made up of 2 sub-components:\n            Component 1-A is the Wastewater management in Soroca, which\n            will finance: (i) the rehabilitation of wastewater\n            collection system, necessary sewerage pressure pipelines and\n            the construction of wastewater treatment facility using\n            constructed wetlands technology for the municipality of\n            Soroca; and (ii six months' operations of the facility\n            in order to train the Apa Canal staff in the proper\n            operations and maintenance of the facility; Component 1-B,\n            Engineering Consultant and TA, will support: (i) Engineering\n            services for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and sewer\n            network design, procurement, supervision support, and a six\n            months' operational assistance for WWTP; and (ii)\n            Feasibility studies for 10 towns and pre-feasibility studies\n            for an additional 5 towns, including replication of\n            constructed wetland system in the studies. Component 2,\n            Dissemination and Replication Component related to\n            Constructed Wetlands, will target the dissemination of\n            experience and knowledge obtained from operation of the new\n            Soroca WWTP. Component 3, Institutional Strengthening\n            Component, will finance: (i) the development of a\n            communication strategy and capacity building for media\n            campaign and community and civil- society outreach to\n            prepare for the necessary increase of a sewage treatment\n            surcharge; and (ii) Apa Canal staff training for operational\n            efficiency improvements. Component 4 is Project Management,\n            which will support management and implementation of the\n            project, including auditing services, by the Project\n            Implementing Unit (PIU) in the Agency for Construction and\n            Territorial Development (ACTD)."}, "docdt": "2007-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
