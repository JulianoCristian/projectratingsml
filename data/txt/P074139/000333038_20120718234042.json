Some lessons learned included:\n            the Bank should be proactive in making the decision to\n            either withdraw from a project or adopt other alternative\n            measures to change a project's course when it is\n            recognized that critical implementation issues cannot be\n            resolved in a timely manner. The Constructed Wetlands (CW)\n            technology was new to Moldova, which had been used to the\n            overdesigned former Soviet conventional Wastewater Treatment\n            Plants (WWTPs). The technology was perceived as inferior and\n            therefore unacceptable. Moreover, the Bank may face a\n            reputational risk in appearing to be promoting and/or\n            \"overselling? specific activities or technologies with\n            strong resistance from critical stakeholders even where the\n            activities may be technically and economically justified. In\n            this case several clients referred to the technology as\n            'the Bank's' technology which increases the\n            Bank's reputational risk. The importance of preparing a\n            sound Results Framework comprising adequate indicators to\n            capture key project outcomes, with baseline data and\n            reasonable targets or a clear plan to obtain this data as\n            soon as possible after the onset of implementation if not\n            available, cannot be over-emphasized for good project design\n            and implementation readiness."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
