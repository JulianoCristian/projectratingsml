                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The key development objectives of the project are: (i) improve the quality of sanitation services in Soroca; (ii) reduce the discharge of pollutants, including
                         nutrients, from Soroca municipal sources that flow into the Nistru River and, subsequently, into the Black Sea; and (iii) demonstrate and disseminate through
                         feasibility studies and workshops, cost-effective and affordable technologies for municipal wastewater treatment for the potential benefit of similar projects for
                         Moldova's existing wastewater treatment plants, for those towns in Moldova that have no wastewater treatment, and for the countries that drain into the Black
                         Sea.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The engineering designs for the wastewater treatment facility for Soroca (constructed wetland technology) financed by this grant were completed, but actual construction of the

                         wetland could not be implemented due to the disagreement on the location of the wastewater treatment facility. For this reason the GEF grant was canceled.
