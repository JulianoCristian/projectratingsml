Some lessons\n            learned included: adaptation is at the center of sustainable\n            development. For adaptation programs to be successful,\n            information and inputs need to be top-down, bottom-up and\n            sideways. The benefit of this project, that incorporated all\n            of these modalities, lie in the experience that it generated\n            for internalizing adaptation in the Government's\n            programs at all levels. Communities that have been made\n            aware of potential consequences of climate change have\n            become totally receptive to adaptation programs, and have\n            become proactive in changing and adapting their systems in\n            order to improve their livelihoods and reduce their\n            vulnerabilities. Communities that perceive that Government\n            institutions address their concerns and suggestions become\n            motivated and participate in the development and design of\n            projects that produce sustainable initiatives. For projects\n            to be successful, community involvement from the outset is important."}, "docdt": "2012-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
