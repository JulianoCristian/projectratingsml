likely sustainability, in spite of\n            negligible institutional development impacts. Implementation\n            of the programs supported by the project, has been uneven:\n            while progress has been achieved in improving macroeconomic\n            stability, implementation of structural reforms was slower\n            than expected; in areas such as public expenditure\n            management, divestiture of state owned assets, energy and\n            public sector, reforms proved difficult, especially given\n            the international market conditions making the sale of\n            enterprises impossible, or the domestic coalition in support\n            of reforms, weakened. The recent experience points to three\n            main lessons. First, Government commitment to reform is\n            critical if policy actions are to be sustained. Recent\n            reforms - such as the preparation of the Ghana Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy - show that significant progress can be\n            achieved, provided the authorities take the lead, and adopt\n            a communication strategy in implementing the policy agenda.\n            Second, the development of \"ownership\" may take\n            longer than expected when a new Government comes to power,\n            and a time-consuming consensus building needs to be attained\n            to gain support of the civil society. Accordingly, Bank\n            adjustment operations need to pro-actively, identify the\n            potential for electoral-induced policy lapses; incorporate\n            measures responsive to slippages, should these occur; and,\n            ensure ownership of reforms by government, and civil society\n            to improve the likelihood of policy implementation.\n            Likewise, careful consideration needs to given as to what\n            constitutes policy conditionality, as submission of\n            legislation to Parliament does not necessarily translate\n            into policy implementation. Third, selectivity, and realism\n            are essential when the reform agenda is vast, and available\n            capacity might be less strong than desirable. Overall,\n            shortcomings of the traditional adjustment lending point to\n            a different institutional environment, such as the one\n            provided by programmatic lending under the envisaged series\n            of Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits."}, "docdt": "2003-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
