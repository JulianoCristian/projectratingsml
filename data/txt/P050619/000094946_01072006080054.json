aims at supporting macroeconomic\n            stability, and market confidence towards the development of\n            the Government's reform agenda for accelerated growth,\n            and poverty reduction, through a broad-based consultative\n            process with civil society, and stakeholders. Governance,\n            and macroeconomic stability will be restored by: 1) reducing\n            the domestic, and foreign debt, through curtailed fiscal\n            deficit, and seeking debt relief under the enhanced Heavily\n            Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative; 2) strengthening\n            the management, and control of public expenditures; and, 3)\n            eliminating the deficit of key public enterprises. Moreover,\n            the reform process will be reinvigorated in the areas of\n            budgetary management, public enterprise divestiture, banking\n            sector, and cocoa export marketing, and in addition, the\n            country's Poverty Reduction Strategy will be prepared,\n            and implemented within a broad participatory process. These\n            actions will stimulate private sector growth, and lead to\n            fiscal adjustments, needed for increasing expenditures for\n            poverty reduction, in addition to improvements in producer\n            prices for cocoa farmers, and the liberalization of export\n            marketing. Nonetheless, risks include political weaknesses,\n            capacity constraints, and, vulnerability to trade shocks;\n            however, the new Government's commitment to the reform\n            agenda, to increase implementation capacity, and, a strong\n            donor support will substantially mitigate those risks."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
