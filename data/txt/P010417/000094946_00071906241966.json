satisfactory insofar\n            as the project has largely met, and in some cases, surpassed\n            specific targets with respect to increasing access to\n            primary education--especially for girls, improving equity,\n            developing learning inputs--such as teacher training and\n            instructional materials, and establishing partnerships with\n            nongovernmental organizations to mobilize communities. Based\n            on assessing the government's commitment to sustain\n            proven project gains, and as evidenced by low allocations to\n            current low-salary recurrent and developmental budgets and\n            structural arrangements to ensure a smooth transition to a\n            non-project mode of operation in mainstream institutions, it\n            is unlikely that most of the project's gains will be\n            sustainable in the short to medium-term. World Bank\n            performance is adjudged satisfactory while Borrower\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory. Some lessons for the\n            Bank include avoiding complex project designs, incorporating\n            an agreed exit strategy into project design, ensuring the\n            borrower's ownership of project design, assessing\n            procurement capacity properly, addressing financial\n            management in the project design, setting up a declining\n            scale allowing the borrower to gradually absorb recurrent\n            liabilities, ensuring continuity in supervision teams,\n            backing supervision missions with appropriate budgets,\n            staffing managerial and technical units with qualified\n            personnel, and involving the community and NGOs in designing\n            and implementing interventions."}, "docdt": "2000-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
