MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A BALOCHISTAN PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 76.4
million, US$106.0 million equivalent, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity
of 35 year,, to help finance a Balochistan Primary Education Program.
2.    CountrvlSector Background.  Despite substantial economic growth, human
resource development in Pakistan has lagged well behind other countries at
similar stages of development and income levels. Pakistan's gross
participation rate of 50% in primary education compares poorly with developing
countries of similar or lower GNP per capita, for example, Nepal at 64%, Laos
111%, Bangladesh 70%, India 98%, China 135%, Nigeria 70*. The low level of
human resources development is a major constraint to a qualitative
transformation of Pakistan's economy into a dynamic, middle-income country
like its East Asian neighbors. The Government's own Five-Year Plans since
1955 have placed universal primary education as a priority. However, this
policy is far from being met as it has not been backed up by adequate
financial and political commitment, nor was the institutional framework
adequate to implement it. Since the mid-80s, IDA and other donors have
devoted substantial resources to primary education. Major programs of quality
improvement and expansion in primary education, with emphasis on girls, are
financed by IDA and other donors in Punjab and Sindh. USAID is providing
budgetary support for the primary education sector development program in NWFP
and Balochistan. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), UNICEF, the European
Communities, Britain, Norway, the Netherlands and Germany are also supporting
improvements in quality or coverage in primary education in Pakistan.
However, all donor-supported projects have experienced implementation problems
and disbursement lags. In 1991, the Government of Pakistan began drafting a
Social Action Program (SAP) to improve the provision of services in education,
family planning, health and rural water and sanitation. The SAP is a
framework for action to improve the planning, programming, budgeting and
implementation of all ongoing and new programs in the social sectors, and to
expand sector absorptive capacity. The Balochistan Primary Education Program
constitutes the education component of the SAP in the province of Balochistan.
3.    Compared to the nation, Balochistan has the lowest participation rate in
primary education at 34%. The female participation rate of 15% is among the
worst in the world. As a result the base of primary graduates is not
sufficient to support any kind of significant expansion at higher levels of
education. With an average density of about 16 persons per square kilometer,
Balochistan encompasses almost half of the land mass of Pakistan but contains
only about six million of the country's 120 million people. The majority
(84%) of the population is rural, living in approximately 9,000 settlements.
4.    The provision of schooling opportunities in Balochistan is insufficient,
while at the same time ineauitable and inefficient. Approximately 3,800
villages are without any school. The province has 6,800 boys' schools but
only 668 girls' schools. Gender disparities are worse in rural areas where



- 2 -
the ratio of girls, to boys' schools iS 1:13, as opposed to 1:4 in urban
areas. Inefficient utilization of facilities is evidenced by the existence of
2,100 schools with fewer than 20 students. Inequity as well as inefficiency
could be alleviated by having girls and boys within the same village attend
the same school. This is made difficult by the requirement for segregated
schools, managed by two separate, duplicate male and female education
administrations at the divisional and district levels. Senior administrative
positions above the divisional level are generally not open to women. Recent
surveys indicate parental acceptance of mixed schools: as many as a third of
the girls in primary education unofficially attend boys, schools. There would
be greater parental willingness to send their girls to a mixed school if the
teacher was female. An optimal solution at present is therefore to open
girls' schools which boys may attend. A major constraint to this solution is
the limited number of educated women in the province who could become
teachers, which is a direct result of the lack of girls' schools in the first
place.
5.    A poor learnincr environment may explain why only 9% of the students who
begin kindergarten complete grade 5 within the normal time period of six
years. About 700 schools are without any building, only 6% of all schools
have toilets, and 4* storage space. As many as 25% of kindergarten students
drop out within the first year of schooling alone, reflecting the historical
neglect of curriculum, materials development and teacher training for this
level. Ninety-six percent of the schools have multi-grade classes, for which
the teachers are not trained and instructional materials not suitably
designed. Over 50* of all schools have only one teacher, who is often absent.
Inadeauate organization, planning and manaQement result in school location and
teacher recruitment decisions being made on political bases, without regard to
enrollment size or demands of the communities. School supervision is hampered
by the vast areas to be covered; supervisors also lack training.
6.    Proaram Obiectives.  The Balochistan Primary Education Program (BPEP),
which is the first phase of a long-term Government program, has the objectives
of: a) improving access, equity and efficiency in primary education,
particularly for girls; b) improving the quality of the learning environment
for all schools; and c) improving the organizational framework, planning and
management of the provincial education system.
7.    Program Descriltion.  The BPEP consists of all provincial activities in
primary education, including improved operation of the current system as well
as a gradual expansion of the system over the Eighth Five Year Plan period
from FY94 to FY98. The degree of system expansion is based on a detailed
appraisal of the maximum capacity each year, based on two constraining
factors: the number of female teachers that could be recruited and trained,
and construction management capacity. Special measures are built into the
program to remove implementation constraints and to expand the absorptive
capacity of the Government implementation agencies.
8.    The BPEP integrates all donor inputs in primary education in a coherent
manner and synchronizes all the inputs to ensure efficient delivery. Access,
ecuitv and efficiency would be increased by: a) provision of buildings and



- 3 -
facilities in priority order for girls', then boys' schools with mixed
population, then schools without any building; and b) an experiment to provide
scholarships for girls in urban slum areas to attend privately-run schools. A
new policy would be introduced to permit double-shifting of boys' and girls'
schools in the same building (with different teachers) where segregation is
demanded by the community or in overcrowded urban schools. Ouality of the
learning environment for all existing and new schools would be improved by:
a) establishing an appropriate pre-service and in-service teacher training
system geared to the multi-grade school condition in Balochistan; and b)
develcping' core student activity books and other instructional materials,
suitable for multi-grade teaching and learning. In addition, an instructional
support system using Learning Coordinators to provide on the job training to
teachers would be institutionalized. Orcranization framework, planning and
manaaement would be improved by: a) establishing a separate Directorate of
Primary Education (DPE), at provincial and district levels; b) establishing a
Policy, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit within DPE; and c) continuing the
development of a management information system to facilitate planning and
management. To achieve the above objectives, beneficiary participation would
be instituted by establishing parents' committees, and involving these
committees in school opening and supervision. IDA would finance construction
of schools, furniture, equipment and educational materials, specialist and NGO
services, fellowships, training, recurrent costs for incremental staff, and
operation and maintenance.
9.      The five year BPEP is currently estimated to cost about US$330
million; US$151 million for development and $179 million for recurrent
expenditures. Based on this indicative program, Annual Reviews will be held
between IDA and Government of Balochistan (GOB) to agree on specific targets
and budgetary requirements to carry out the annual work program for the
following fiscal year. Financing sources for this total program include IDA,
USAID, ADB, UNICEF, CIDA, the Netherlands and GOB, through ongoing and planned
commitments. The proposed IDA credit of US$106 million would finance any item
of the total program (both development and recurrent) not already committed by
other donors or the Government, which are considered critical to achieve the
above objectives. A preliminary base case estimate of the items which IDA
could finance has been made. Based on this indicative estimate, the proposed
IDA credit would finance items having a total cost of US$ 120 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$35.1 million. The financing plan for the
entire five-year program and the indicative breakdown of foreign and local
costs for the base case IDA-financed items are shown in Schedule A. The
amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule for the IDA-financed items are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing the
geographical coverage of the program is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 11403-PAK is being distributed separately.
10. Program Imolementation. The program would be implemented by the newly
established DPE and line agencies of the Balochistan Education Department.
The DPE would be in charge of daily operation of the program, and coordination
of all activities in primary education. It will be responsible for



- 4 -
implementing the sub-component on strengthening the institutional framework
(provincial directorates program, education management information system,
planning, research and evaluation as well as mobilization of private sector
resources and beneficiary participation). Other implementation line agencies
are: (a) the Directorate of Civil Works in charge of school building and
facilities; (b) the Bureau of Curriculum and Extension in charge of teacher
training programs; and (c) the Balochistan Textbook Board in charge of books
and inetructional materials. Resident long-term technical assistance
supplemented by short-term consultancies will be provided to strengthen these
agencies.
11. Procqram Sustainabilitv. The BPEP is a time-slice of the Government's
long term program in primary education. Sustainability of BPEP is enhanced
through a focus on institution building to improve the absorptive capacity and
delivery system of the regular Balochistan Government line departments and
agencies. Since this program relies heavily on donor financing, preparation
of the follow-up phase of the BPEP would need to begin in the third year of
the implementation to ensure continuity of inputs.
12.   Lessons Learnt from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The program draws
heavily on lessons learnt from previous donor-siupported basic education
projects: a) emphasize operations limited to one province at a time to tailor
them to the specific needs of the province and to avoid implementation delays
at the federal level; b) ensure all donor inputs in the sector are fully
integrated; c) strengthen the regular line departments/agencies to implement
donor-financed operations rather than creating parallel temporary structures
such as Project Implementation Units; d) institutionalize Annual Reviews as
both a planning tool and a monitoring and evaluation mechanism; e) provide
institution building through resident technical assistance; and f) advance
program start-up activities during the preparation period, including selection
of school sites nine months in advance of actual construction.
13.   Rationale for IDA Involvement.   IDA has a policy of promoting universal
primary education worldwide and has considerable experience in this sector.
Through its policy dialogue with Pakistan, IDA has been promoting the need for
increased basic social services and has embarked on a strategy of supporting a
series of province-based sectoral programs in primary education. The proposed
IDA support dove-tails with the phase-out of the Primary Education Development
Program (funded by USAID) in Balochistan and with the completion of the Second
Primary Education Project, financed by IDA covering all provinces. It
continues an institution building program which is still at an embryonic
stage, to interrupt which would cause a major setback to sectoral development.
IDA's support also complements the inputs of other donors active in the
province (ADB, UNICEF, the Netherlands, CIDA, Germany) in a coherent program
that covers the entire primary education sub-sector.
14.   Actions Agreed.  Agreements were reached during negotiations with the
GOB that it will: (a) provide an official letter setting forth the province's
primary education sector policy, strategy and priorities by June 30, 1993; (b)
review annually with IDA, program implementation for the past fiscal year and
agree on an Operational Plan for the following fiscal year, and ensure that



adequate development and recurrent budgetary allocations will be made, both
from domestic and external sources, to carry out the agreed Annual Operational
Plan; (c) base school location planning and building decisions, regardless of
funding sources, on needs and/or demonstrated demand as shown in the yearly
school census and community requests; (d) annually submit for IDA approval the
list of school construction sites selected according to agreed priority
criteria before Mid-Year reviews; during the first year of project
implementation, carry out school construction in sites already approved;
(e) introduce double shifts where needed; (f) follow procedures and criteria
acceptabla to IDA for selection of students to receive project scholarships
for poor girls to attend private schools, and for the choice of schools;
(g) by December 31, 1993 amend the service rules to include women in senior
level administrative positions in the Department of Education; (h) in
consultation with IDA, undertake a Mid-term review by June 1996; (i) transfer
progressively all incremental teacher and administrative posts to the
Government's recurrent budget for permanent posts before the end of the
program. There are two special Conditions of Credit Effectiveness:
(a) approval of the project PC-1 by the Executive Committee of the Federal
Government's National Economic Council; and (b) submission to IDA of
evaluation and recommendation reports in respect of the consultants to be
employed for the provision of technical assistance. The first Condition has
already been met and GOB has completed all critical preparatory steps to
enable it to meet the second Condition.
15. Environmental Aspects. No detailed environmental analysis of the
program was carried out, since by its nature it does not include items which
are likely to have a significant environmental impact. The criteria for
school construction would include construction standards designed to minimize
any harmful environmental impact.
16.   Program Obiective Cateqories.  The program focusses on poverty
alleviation through provision of basic education services. It has a special
emphasis on girls' education through a series of special measures to improve
both supply and demand. The BPEP supports private sector development by
contracting out the bulk of implementation activities to the private sector
where it has comparative advantage: for example, const^uction of all schools,
construction management, textbook and materials develop.nent and publishing, as
well as a pilot experiment in provision of school places through private
schools.
17.   Benefits.  The five-year program is expected to increase primary
enrollment by about 380,000, nearly double the participation rate for girls
from 15% to 29t, and improve the rate for boys from 49t to 72%. Worldwide
research has shown that primary education has very high social returns and
that education of girls, in particular, will also lead to reduced fertility --
which is particularly important in light of Pakistan's high population growth
rate of 3.2%. Through recruitment and training of local women as teachers,
the economic returns of education for girls will become more apparent to rural
parents, who would be encouraged to send their girls to school.
Information-based decision mak. ig in education management and involvement of
parents in school establishment process will lead to increased participation



rates and enhanced resource mobilization through parents donating services.
Increasing the number of hours of active learning by pupils in class as a
result of developing a pupil-centered approach will improve performance, and
thus students' and teachers' levels of satisfaction with schooling. This in
turn should reduce drop-out and repetition rates and increase the efficiency
and decrease costs of primary education.
18. RigS)M The major risk is that the Government implementation agencies
lack capacity to implement the program. This risk is being addressed by a
one-year overlap in the resident technical assistance team between the USAID
Primary Education Development Program and IDA support, and the Government's
agreement to contract similar technical assistance during the five-year
program. Another risk is the lack of female teachers to staff the girls'
schools. This risk is addressed by a community survey of all 9,000 villages
in the province to identify educated girls who are willing to be teachers,
then to recruit and train them through a Mobile Teacher Training Program.
Continued professional and materials support are provided to these teachers
through the Learning Coordinators System. Risks also attach to the
development of community involvement. In the past, beneficiaries have not
been involved in community decisions about schooling, which were taken by a
few traditional community leaders who tended to oppose girls' education. The
program would be hindered if they do not relinquish control. This risk is
being addressed by establishing school committees which would consist only of
parents of children in the school service areas, regardless of their status in
the community. The school committees would be involved in determining school
sites and monitoring quality. A pilot experiment conducted during program
preparation confirmed the viability of beneficiary participation.
19. Recomnendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
