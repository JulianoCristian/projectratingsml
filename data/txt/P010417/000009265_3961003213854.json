"This project provides financing over\n            five years to implement the long-term Balochistan government\n            primary education program, with special measures to improve\n            girls' education. The project will: (a) establish a new\n            girls' school which boys are allowed to attend; (b)\n            provide classrooms and facilities to mixed shelterless\n            schools; (c) introduce a scholarship program for girls in\n            urban slum areas to attend privately-run schools; (d)\n            establish an appropriate pre-service and in-service teacher\n            training system geared to the multi-grade school conditions\n            in Balochistan; (e) develop core student-activity books and\n            other instructional materials, suitable for multi-grade\n            teaching and learning; (f) establish a Directorate of\n            Primary Education separate from the secondary school\n            administration at provincial and district levels; (g)\n            establish a policy monitoring and evaluation unit within the\n            Directorate of Primary Education; and (h) continue to\n            develop the management information system to facilitate\n            planning and management. Beneficiary participation will be\n            instituted by setting up parent's committees and\n            involving these committees in school establishment and\n            supervision. The project finances construction, furniture,\n            equipment and educational materials, specialist services,\n            fellowships, training, incremental recurrent cost for\n            additional staff, and operation and maintenance."}, "docdt": "1993-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
