Cambodia's physical capital has run down and\n            its human resources have been depleted because of\n            insufficient resources to generate productive income. A\n            foundation for a new pattern of development in private hands\n            is being esablished. Private activities took the lead in\n            fostering economic growth. The Emergency Rehabilitation\n            Project for Cambodia will support the implmentation of\n            critical activities to help restore and maintain capacity\n            utilization and production in key sectors. The project will\n            provide critical imports for specific rehabilitation\n            activities in the transport, agriculture, health, education,\n            power and water supply sectors; and commodities essential\n            for the Cambodian economy to underake economic recovery.
