{"cdata!": "The ratings for the Public Finance\n            Management Project for Turkey were as follows; the outcome\n            was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that substantial commitment and\n            support is required from the highest levels of government in\n            a project involving institutional development, the\n            restructuring of the organizations, systems and procedures\n            for economic management and public finance and introducing\n            change on a massive scale in several key ministries and\n            agencies. Comprehensiveness of the reform agenda, as\n            envisaged in the original design, ensured that all relevant\n            areas are covered and all key issues addressed. However, the\n            resultant complexity and extended scope made project\n            implementation very difficult. The availability of qualified\n            and committed high level and influential staff at the\n            Treasury and the Customs departments was a major factor in\n            the smooth and efficient implementation of these components.\n            Bank and the Government counterparts worked closely to be\n            flexible, adjust the project scope and settle for a more\n            gradual pace of reform and more modest objectives in some\n            areas, in order to better match the scope to implementation\n            capacity. As mentioned above, the close linkages between the\n            PFMP and public sector adjustment lending (the PFPSAL\n            program) have been particularly useful in focusing high\n            level Government management attention on the importance of\n            achieving milestones in the PFMP project. Conversely, The\n            project closing date had to be extended by two and a half\n            years to complete the activities under the various\n            components. The time actually taken to introduce changes in\n            the legal framework and organization structures, re-engineer\n            functional processes and introduce new systems, procedures\n            on such a large scale across multiple government agencies\n            needs to be recognized in planning similar projects."}, "docdt": "2003-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
