objective of the Public Financial\n            Management Project (PFMP) is to enhance the ongoing fiscal\n            consolidation and reform efforts initiated by the Government\n            in 1994 by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of tax\n            administration, expenditure and personnel management, and\n            customs operations. The tax administration component will be\n            directed at modernizing the organization and systems of the\n            tax adminstration in Turkey, with particular focus on\n            strengthening the compliance enforcement and policy\n            formulation capabilities of the tax authorities, and\n            improving conditions progressively for tax payers who\n            comply. The expenditure and personel management component\n            will seek to enhance the government budget's usefulness\n            as a fiscal policy instrument, and as the tool for managing\n            public finances by reducing the number of sources of\n            government spending that now operate outside budgetary\n            channels, and by introducing budgeting of public\n            administration positions and payroll. It also aims to\n            modernize the complex and outdated budgetary and accounting\n            control procedures and sustems that impede effective and\n            efficient control over government finances. The customs\n            modernization component is directed at shifting the customs\n            agency's policy from its present costly and inefficient\n            ex ante, full coverage, sanctioning approach to a more ex\n            post and efficiency seeking stance, still capable of\n            gathering appropriate revenues and enforcing relevant\n            national and international laws, and at advancing the\n            changes in the national customs organization required to\n            enable Turkey to enter into a customs union with the\n            European Union (EU) in 1996. Project activities for the\n            three components can be grouped under five common heads: 1)\n            studies to complete the details of the programs for reform\n            and modernization; b) advisory services and training in new\n            procedures, organizational arrangements and analytical\n            techniques; 3) design studies and modeling activities to\n            determine the specifications of information technology\n            investments; 4) pilot and nationnwide information technology\n            investments and associated training and civil works; and 5)\n            project management support services."}, "docdt": "1995-08-29T00:00:00Z"}
