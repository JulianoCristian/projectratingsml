which is a\n            follow up to the Third Highway (Rural Roads) Project, is\n            designed to improve the level of access and increase\n            agricultural production in rural areas in Tunisia. It\n            consists of the following components: (i) a three-year\n            (1983-85) program of rural road improvements and\n            improvements in agricultural extension and credit services;\n            (iii) a program of improved rural road maintenance; (v) a\n            program of spot improvements to feeder roads; (v) a road\n            safety component comprising equipping five vehicle\n            inspection stations; and (vi) technical assistance for\n            project preparation, implementation and monitoring extension\n            training; research on materials, construction techniques and\n            maintenance for unpaved roads; and a study of the\n            socio-economic, agricultural and transport impact of rural\n            roads. The main benefits of the project would be in the form\n            of assured and less expensive transport of essential\n            agricultural inputs and crops, and increases in farm income\n            and employment."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
