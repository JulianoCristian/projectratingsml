TheProject

1.  OnApril 22, 1997,IBRD'sExecutiveDirectorsapproveda loanof US$90millionequivalent
    to the FederativeRepublicof Brazil(GOB)(LoanNo.4147BR)to financea market-based
    land reform operation. Accordingto the project documents, the project will test a
    mechanismwherebypoor rural laborersand farmers,who are either landlessor have
    insufficientlandfor subsistence,andwho organizeintoassociations,canobtainfinancing
    to purchaseagriculturalproperties,as well as grantsfor initialinvestmentsand start-up
    activities.The loanbecameeffectiveon September12,1997. The Projectis to becarried
    out in the Northeaststates of Bahia,Caera,Maranhao,Pernambuco,and MinasGerais
    (theProjectStates),andseeksto increasethe incomesof about15,000poorruralfamilies.

TheRequest

2.  On December14, 1998, the InspectionPanel (the "Panel") receiveda Requestfor
    Inspection(the "Request")dated December10, 1998&submittedby the F6rumNacional
    PelaReformaAgrariae PelaJusticaNoCampo(TheNationalForumfor AgrarianReform
    and Justice in Rural Areas), ("the Forum"),and signedby representativesof ABRA -
    Associac,o Brasileira de Reforma Agraria (Brazilian Agrarian Reform Association),
    ANMTR- ArticulacaoNacionalde MulheresTrabalhadorasRurais (NationalGroupof
    RuralWomenWorkers),CaritasBrasileira(BrazilianBranchof Caritas),CIMI-Conselho
    IndigenistaMissionario(MissionaryIndigentsCouncil),CNASI- ConfederacaoNacional
    das Associacoesdos Servidoresdo INCRA(NationalConfederationof Associationsof
    INCRAstaff),CONIC-Conselho Nacionalde IgrejasCristasdo Brasil(NationalCouncilof
    ChristianChurchesof Brazil),CONTAG- Confedera,coNacionaldos Trabalhadoresna
    Agricultura(NacionalConfederationof AgriculturalWorkers),CPT-Comissao Pastoralda
    Terra (Pastoral Land Commission),INESC- Instituto de Estudos S6cio-Econ6micos
    (Instituteof SocioeconomicStudies),MST- MovimentodosTrabalhadoresRuraisSem
    Terra (Movementof LandlessRuralWorkers),RedeBrasilsobre Institui,6esFinanceiras
    Multilaterais(BrazilianNetworkon MultilateralFinancialInstitutions)and 853 individuals
    (the Requesters). In a letterdated December21, 1998,the Secretaryof the Forumand
    Presidentof the CPT providedon behalfof the Requesterscertain clarificationsto the
    RequestindicatingwhatBankpoliciesand procedureshad,in their opinion,beenviolated
    bytheallegedactionsandomissionsof Management.

3.  Theabovesignatoriesto the Requestincluderuralworkers,poorfarmerswithoutland,or
    withlandinsufficientfor subsistence,and organizations
                                                       who representthem,includingthe
    Forumand/orits memberorganizations.The Requestclaimsthat theyare beingor may
    likely be materiallyand adverselyaffected by the designand executionof the project


See Annex I

     financedby the Bank loan and that theyare likely to be similarlyaffectedby follow-up
     loans,whichtheBankintendsto maketo supportsuchkindof projectsinBrazil.

4.  Specifically,the Requestersclaim thatthe projectis(a) notachievingits objectives,(b) is
    not being implementedas a pilot project,(c) will make it impossiblefor its alleged
    beneficiariesto repaythe debtsthey enter into underthe project,(d) has increasedthe
    prices of agriculturalland availableto rural workers,(e) is being implementedas an
    alternativeinstead of as a complementto Brazil's constitutionallymandatedagrarian
    reformprogram,and(f) that the Bankhasfailedto consultand adequatelyinformproject-
    affectedpeopleand their representatives.The foregoingwouldconstituteviolationof the
    followingBankpoliciesand procedures:OD 4.01on EnvironmentalAssessment;OD4.15
    on PovertyReduction;BP 17.50on Disclosureof OperationalInformation;and GP 14.70
    on Involvementof NGOsin BankOperations. The GP is not underthe purviewof the
    Panel.

     receiptof the Request(meaning"Registration"underthe Panel'sOperatingProcedures).  2


ManagementResponse

6.    Managementsubmittedits responseto the Requeston March8, 1999(theResponse). In   3

     short,the Responsestatesthat,

        'Managementconsidersthat the Brazil Land Reform and PovertyAlleviation
       Project is a very well designed operation. As a pilot, it is being closely
       supervised,studied and fine-tuned. The Projectis alreadyyieldingsignificant
       resultsonthe groundfor a largenumberof poorruralfamiliesin the Northeastof
       Brazil, and shows exciting promiseas a cost-effective,expeditiousand non-
       conflictivemeans of achievinga redistributionof land assets. It has not and
       would not replace all altemative approachesto land reform, such          as
       expropriation,but it does constitute an extremely important option in the
       Govemment'sarrayof instrumentsfor dealingwithseriousand longstandingland
       issues."

Addingthat,

       "The Requestorsdo not demonstraterealor potentialharmto any directProject
       beneficiaries,nor dothey seekto improvethe Projectdesignor execution.The
       objectiveis to stop the Projectand preventexpansionof market-basedland

       meansto redistributelandassets in Brazil.The foundationof this argumentis
       philosophical,and centerson a policychoiceof the Govemment,andnot onthe
       properapplicationbythe Bankof its ownpoliciesand procedures."

        Request. On the otherhand,there is now voluminousdocumentationfrom the actual
        beneficiaries,expressingtheirclearand passionatesupportfor the Project. In addition,
        among the signatures to documentsrepudiatingthe Request are those of local
        representativesof churchesof various denominations,local mayors and municipal
        assemblies,and rural syndicates(affiliatesof the nationalCONTAG),also voicingtheir
        supportfor thebeneficiaries'position."

    Addingthat,

        "The Request does not meet the requirementsfor Registrationor Inspectionin
        Resolution93-10of September22, 1993,establishingthe InspectionPanel,or in the

QuestionsUnderConsIderation

9.    Both the Requestand Responseagreeon the overallobjectiveof the project- reducing
      rural poverty- but disagreeon the specificmeansto attain it.The statementsmadein
      Management'sResponserequirethatthe Panel,beforemakingits Recommendation,must
      review questionsraised about the registrationof the Request and the status of the
      Requesters. As required by the recent 1999 Clarificationsto the Resolutionthat
      establishedthe Panel, it willlimitits commentsonthe contentof the Request.
                               6


QuestionAboutTheRegistrationoftheRequest

10. The Resolutionthat establishedthe InspectionPanelstates clearlythat the Panelshall
      establishthe eligibilityof the Requesf. In spiteof this, Management,in its Response,
      questionsthe Registrationproceduresfollowedby the Paneland,asnotedabove,states
      that the Request"doesnotmeetthe requirementsfor Registration".In pointof fact,there
      are no requirementsfor Registrationin the Resolutionthat establishedthe Panel. The
      Registrationis purely an administrativestep introducedby the Panel as a means of

     informingthe Board,Management,the Requestersand the publicin a concisemanner
     about the existenceof a Requestfor Inspectionand its main content. It does not and
     cannot be construed as implying any judgement on the eligibility of the Request.
     Paragraph16of the Panel'sOperatingProceduresprovidesthat the "Chairperson,onthe
     basis of the informationcontained in the Request,shall either promptlyregister the
     Request, or ask for additional information,or find the Request outside the Panel's
     mandate."8

11. Managementclaims that the "specificclaims of non-compliancewith Bank policiesand
     proceduresare unsubstantiatedand are drawn in a separate letter signed by one
     Requesterand not part of the Requestas definedby thePanel". In fact,the Requesters,
     throughthe Secretariatof the Forum,providednota separateletterof requestasstatedby
     Management,but somesupplementalinformation(the specific policiesand procedures
     that in their view were violatedby the Bank'sactions and omissionsdescribedin the
     Request)to complement,or supplement,theoriginalsubmissionto the Panel.9Giventhe
     clearsupplementalcharacterof this letter,the Panelsawno needto referto it                specifically
     inthe Registrationnotice.

12. As providedby paragraph19of the Resolution,the Paneldealswith the eligibilityof the
     Requestafter receivingtheResponseof Management.

13. ThePanel,therefore,findsthat thereis nofoundationforManagement'sallegationthatthe
     Requestdoesnotmeetanyallegedrequirementsfor registration.

QuestionsAboutTheRequesters

14. Management states that "of all signatories of the Request identifiable by name,
     organization,locationand nationalidentitynumber,noneis a Projectbeneficiary"andthat
     "there is no evidencethat any beneficiarydesignatedby the Requestorsto act as their
     agentsin presentingthe Request"butManagementacknowledgeshoweverthat, by its
     own account,4.8% (about 41 individuals)"are from States where the project is being
     implemented"(Para.3.5)

15. The 1999Clarificationsof the Resolutionprovidethat an"affectedparty consistsof any
     two or more persons with common interestsor concernswho are in the borrowers
     territory." By Management'sown account,at least41 individualswho are in the Project
     Statesvoiced their concernsabout the Projectby filing the Request. This fact aloneis
     sufficient for the Panel to consider the Request and ask Managementto respond.
     Management,however,wantsto restricteligibilityto"Project beneficiaries"10, that is civil
     associationsthat are alreadyparticipatingin the project.As statedbefore,however,the
     Resolutionallowsany partythat feelsthat its rightsor interestshave beenor arelikelyto
     bedirectlyaffectedbyan actionor omissionof the Bankto file a Request. Suchactionor
     omissionmustbea resultof a failureof the Bankto followits ownoperationalpoliciesand
     procedures.

16. Managementalsoraises,as groundsfor a summarydismissalof the Request,theissueof
    the representationof affected people by the organizationsthat are signatoriesto the
    Request(whichis a mootpointgiventhe factthat at least41 individualsthat feelaffected
    by the Projectalso signed the Request). The Panel notes that these organizations'
    representationof the intendedprojectbeneficiaries,rural workers,and small farmersis
    widelyacceptedthroughoutBrazil. Managementalso statesthatrepresentativesof these
    organizationsat the State levelopposedthe Request. The PanelMemberswereableto
    meet with representativesof these organizationsat the State level who, contraryto
    Managementstatements,vigorouslysupportedthe Request. Indeedorganizationslike
    CONTAG(theNationalConfederationof RuralWorkers)havebeenlegallyrecognizedas
    legitimate representativesof rural workers and smallholdersthroughoutthe national
    territory.' Furthermore,Managementin its Responseon matterssuchas Disclosureby
            1

    the Bank (para 4.37), Disseminationby the Borrower(para 4.38) and Participationby
    NGOs(para4.41)doesacknowledgethe role of theseorganizationsas representativesof
    the interestof the rural poorandthe project's"targetpopulation".This acknowledgement
    is alsosharedbythe Panel.

17. If as a directresultof the Bank'sfailures,the projecthasresultedor is likelyto resultina
    deteriorationof the living conditionsof the rural poor in the ProjectStates,any groupof
    themcansubmita Requestfor Inspection.

Questions About The Request

18. TheRequestersraisea numberof politicaland pragmaticissuesthat do not relatedirectly
    to Bankpoliciesand procedures.The role of expropriationandthe legalityof alternative
    methodsto carryout the constitutionallymandatedagrarianreformprogram,for example,
    are clearly outsidethe purviewof the Panel althoughthey providea useful contextto
    understandthe concernsof the Requestersaboutthe Bank'srole in the Project. In any
    event,Managementhasstatedthatthis andfutureloanswill not includefarmsthat maybe
    expropriatedunderthe agrarianreformprogramme.

19. Aftercompletingitsfieldvisit andthereviewof the Requestand Response,thePanelmust
    ascertainwhetherthere is any prima facie evidenceof acts or omissionsof the Bank,
    resultingfrom violationsto its ownpoliciesand procedures,that haveor mayhavecaused
    materialadverseeffectson peopleaffectedby a Bank-financedproject. As providedin
    paragraph7 of the 1999Clarifications,"in respectof suchfield visits,the Panelwill not
    reporton the Bank'sfailure to complywith its policiesand proceduresor its resulting
    materialadverseeffect"

20. The Panelmust,however,base its recommendationonan analysisof the evidenceand
    informationgatheredby the Panel on specific policyviolations,and the nature of the
    allegedactual or potentialharm that mayhave beenor could be causedby the Bank-
    financedproject. Inthis context,thefollowingconsiderationsmustbemade:

       a) The project was given an EnvironmentalCategoryUB" (no significantadverse
       environmentalimpactsare expected)in accordanceto Bank policiesand procedures.
       The project OperationalManualsreviewed by the Panel provide for environmental
       analysisand mitigationmechanismsfor each subprojectand no evidenceof alleged
       negativeenvironmentalimpactswassubmittedto the Panel.


 SeeGOBDecreeNo.53.517ofJanuary31,1964andtheArticlesofAssociationofCONTAG.

                                             5

      b) The Panel Membersvisited sub-projectsselected by           boththe Requestersand
      Managementand met withthe beneficiariesand their      leadersas well as withseveral
      leadersof othersub-projects,andwere able to discussand        raiseissuesof cultivation,
     output projectionsand their personalsituationsbeforeand duringthat       stageof project
     execution.

      c) Managementprovidedthe Panelwithevidenceof          effortsto informandconsultwith
      potentialprojectbeneficiariesinthe Projectstates.

      d) Duringits assessment,the Panelneitherencounteredanysituationthat constituted
     prima facie direct materialharm to the project participantsnor      was it providedwith
      evidenceof actualor potentialpriceincreasesfor agriculturallandthat      mayresultin a
      deteriorationof the Requesters'presentlivingconditions.On      the contrary,the projects
      that the Panelvisitedshowedmarkedimprovementsin       the livelihoodof the participants
      at this stage of the process. The direct beneficiariesof     the project did emphasize,
      however,that theyneededthreemaintypesof assistance:
             i. technicalassistanceto improve their agriculturalprojects and        marketing
                 skills,
             ii. workingcapitalto facilitatethesustainabilityof theirprojects,and
             iii. assistanceto improvetheir managementskillsespeciallyin       the conductof
                 the actionsof theofficersof theirassociations.

      e) Of particularconcernto the projectin certainStates of       Brazil was the impactof
      continuous drought in project site areas. Special attention        was neededby the
      beneficiariesof the projectwithrespectto waterharvestingtechnologies,adaptationof
      seedcultivatorsto localsoil conditionsfor bothdomesticand commercialcropsandthe
      improvementof theirlivestock.

21. Giventhe project beneficiaries'lackof resources,the terms and conditionsof      creditsfor
    landpurchases,initialinvestmentsandworkingcapitalareessentialto        ensurethesuccess
    of theirsubprojectsandto avoidthelikelihoodof the possibleharmallegedin      theRequest.

22. The Panel'sassessmentis alsomadeon the basisof theintroductionof         improvedrevised
    terms of the loans receivedby the beneficiariesfor the      purchaseof land claimedby
    Managementinthe Responseandconfirmedby theMinistryof AgrarianReformandother
    governmentagenciesduringthe Panel'svisit: "20-yearrepaymentperiodwiththreeyears
    of grace,anda fixedinterestrateof 4%"(para4.10).

23. Also,contraryto whatis statedinthe Response(para4.17)the projectbeneficiariesdonot
    have access to the highly subsidizedPROCERAcredit.           The Panel howeverlearned
    assurancesthata similarlineof creditwill beavailableto them.


Recommendation

24. In light of the above, the Panel does not recommendan         investigationof the matters
    allegedinthe Request.
