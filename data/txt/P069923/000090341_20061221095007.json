Lessons learned from the project:\n            Harnessing the trust and ownership of local communities is\n            essential to successfully undertake major mitigation works.\n            In the case of this project, the early involvement of the\n            disaster agency (NEMO) in building community awareness and\n            informing the local population of the purpose and benefits\n            of major mitigation works was a key factor to achieving a\n            positive outcome of the project. When a project is put in\n            abeyance during preparation and subsequently re-activated on\n            a fast track processing schedule, the Bank needs to pay\n            closer attention to the revision of design and cost\n            estimates for major civil works. When faced with critical\n            shortage of technical expertise as it was the case for major\n            civil works with the Ministry of Works, the Government\n            should consider more systematic recruitment of outside\n            expertise. The Bank needs to consider requiring performance\n            guarantees in consultant contracts and applying penalties\n            for late submission of expected outputs."}, "docdt": "2006-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
