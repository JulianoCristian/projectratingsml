protection works at Layou Beach,\n            which has suffered considerable erosion over the past few\n            years; and riverbank protection of the Colonarie River, the\n            Langley Park River, and the Buccament River by building\n            gabion structures along sections of the three rivers. The\n            riverbank protection improvements and sea defense are of\n            themselves a mitigation exercise. Some issues to be\n            addressed are common to all of the riverbank protection\n            projects: a) Uncertainty over ownership of riverbanks and\n            riverbeds can be resolved by seeking legal interpretation on\n            the boundary of public and private land at riverbanks and\n            riverbeds generally. b) Risks to public health and the\n            environment from farming practices should be reduced by\n            advising farmers to exercise better monitoring and\n            surveillance of their chemical use, and by enforcing laws\n            seeking to regulate the use and disposal of plastics. 3)\n            Existing policy assuming the government to shoulder the cost\n            of riverbank and property protection should be reviewed.\n            Criteria should be established as the basis for future\n            government involvement in riverbank protection projects. 4)\n            Gabion structures could be made more endurable by utilizing\n            PVC coated wire baskets for the areas close to the sea and\n            subject to corrosion."}, "docdt": "2001-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
