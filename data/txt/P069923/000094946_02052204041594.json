Management Program Project in St.\n            Vincent and the Grenadines, which aims at strengthening the\n            OECS countries' ability to manage effectively emergency\n            situations, thus reducing the likelihood of loss of life,\n            and assets. The project components will: 1)\n            institutionalize, and strengthen the Office of Disaster\n            Preparedness, i.e., elaborate and revise emergency\n            procedures, by procuring specialized equipment, emergency\n            supplies, and developing a comprehensive disaster management\n            training, and a public awareness program. The component will\n            also develop emergency communications, and improve\n            meteorological assessment capacity country-wide, through\n            technical assistance (TA), and training provision. Shelter\n            programs, retrofitting of public buildings, and, capacity\n            building within the Ministry of Communications and Works,\n            and the Environmental Unit of the Ministry of Health and\n            Environment, will be enhanced through TA, training, and\n            provision of specific equipment; 2) support a preventive\n            physical mitigation program, that includes river flooding,\n            and coastal erosion protection. A comprehensive drainage\n            improvement, flood control, and watershed management study\n            will provide an optimal design on storm drainage systems,\n            while a retrofit program will prioritize on health\n            facilities; and, 3) provide project management, including\n            funding for specialists in financial management, accounting,\n            and procurement, in addition to a disaster management\n            specialist. Moreover, project management training will be\n            provided to participating Government staff."}, "docdt": "2002-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
