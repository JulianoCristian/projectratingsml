Some lessons were culled for\n            future GEF projects: 1) The subsidiarity principle, where\n            decisions on implementing a particular policy should be made\n            at the lowest appropriate level, can help identify areas\n            where a regional institution will have a comparative\n            advantage over well-established national and local agencies.\n            Ask whether an action in this field is part of the core\n            mandate and whether a transnational approach is the most\n            appropriate.
