The first focuses on implementation of maritime\n            conventions and port state control. It identifies\n            \"baseline\" conditions; identifies technical,\n            commercial, institutional, and legal impediments to\n            ratification; promotes ratification and recommends\n            additional treaty protocols; establishes a regional system\n            and the capacity for port state control; and prepares an\n            assessment of self-financing mechanisms to reduce navigation\n            risk and prevent and control maritime pollution. The second\n            element formally establishes new traffic separation schemes\n            and extends an existing one. The third element funds\n            hydrographic surveys and navigation aids. The fourth element\n            helps establish vessel traffic systems; and the fifth\n            element assists oil spill prevention and management.\n            Component 6, supporting integrated coastal zone management,\n            has four complementary elements. It sets up a regional\n            network of experts and funds workshops to enhance capability\n            in ICZM; facilitates and expands information exchange,\n            particularly the application of geographic information\n            systems; helps implement model ICZM plans; and focuses on\n            institutional capacities and applied training of personnel."}, "docdt": "1999-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
