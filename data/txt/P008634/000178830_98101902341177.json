(ii)\n            upgrading of university engineering, agricultural and\n            science teaching, and (iii) expansion of practical and\n            vocational training in secondary schools. It would also\n            assist in upgrading teacher training and help increase\n            farmers' skills. The project would include\n            construction, furniture and/or equipment and technical\n            assistance, as required, for forty-three science\n            laboratories and vocational workshops in secondary schools;\n            two agricultural and three industrial technician training\n            institutes; seven primary teacher training institutes; seven\n            farmer training centers and three demonstration farms; two\n            mobile agricultural training units; a nutrition education\n            program and an agricultural information center; and\n            university faculties of agriculture, veterinary medicine,\n            education, science and engineering. The project faces no\n            undue risks.
