INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LCAN TO THE
CITY COUNCIL OF NAIROBI FOR A
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $8.3 million to the
City Council of Nairobi.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In March 1967, the City Council of Nairobi (NCC) requested
Bank assistance in financing a project, estimated to cost about $25
million, for increasing the water supply to Nairobi. The Government of
Kenya endorsed the application and agreed to guarantee the lcan. Bank
missions to Nairobi in May 1967 and September 1968 reviewed the preparation
and scope of the project, and the latter mission recommended that consultants,
retained by the NCC, study alternative methods of supplying Nairobi's water
needs. These studies resulted in a revised project which would provide
the necessary capacity at a substantially lower cost than the original
proposal. This project was appraised in November 1969.
3.        Negotiations for the proposed loan took place in IWTashington in
June 1970. The Kenya delegation consisted of Messrs. J. M. Keriri, Deputy
Permanent Secretary, MHinistry of Finance; H. E. Leonard Kibinge, Ambassador
of Kenya to the United States; 0. S. Chege, Director, Water Department,
Ministry of Agriculture; A. J. Ng'ang'a, General Manager, Water and Sewerage
Department, NCC; C. K. Mathenge, Chief Assistant Attorney, NCC; and V. Smith,
Commercial Manager, Water and Sewerage Department, NCC.
4.        The proposed loan would be the fifth Bank loan to Kenya, two of
which were made prior to independence and are guaranteed by the United
Kingdom. Kenyahas also received ten IDA credits. All loans andl credits
have been made to the Government. The position of these loans and credits
as of September 30, 1970 is summarized below:

5.        There have been a number of problems in the execution of agri-
cultural projccts, wh'ich have comprised the major part of Bans group
activity in Kenya.   Implementation of thie Smallholder Agricultural Credit
Project (Credit No. 105 KE) has been delayed because of problems in re-
cruiting and retainin- satisfactory mana ement and adequate staff.   The
rate of disbursement has recently improved,but there are still a number
of problems to be solved if the project is to achieve its original pur-
pose.  The matter is under active discussion witn the Kcenya authorities.
6.        The Livestock Development Project (Credit No. 129 XE) started
slowly and only $100,000 has been disbursed so far. The low level of
disbursement is directly related to the project's pioneering nature,
for wlhich there was little or no prior expericnce in Kenya.  At one
stage inability to obtain land titles held up lending to individual
ranchers' a problem which has been solved. Loans to individual ranchers
are now being made and reimbursement claims can be expected shortly.
Contrary to expectations there has been little demand for loans to
commercial ranchers; the reasons for this situation are under study.
The whole project is under close supervisJon, and a mission currently
in the field will examine in detail its fu-ture.

7.         The Association has made two credits (Credit No. 64 KE in 1964
and Credit No. 119 KE in 1968) for financin; the Smallholder Tea Planting
Pro-ram of the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA), which as a whole
has been very successful. Pro-ress under the first Tea Development Pro-
ject (Credit No. 64 KE) was satisfactory an.. although disbu:sement was
slower than originally estimated, largely due to KTDA's field e-penses
being lower than forecast at the tim.. of appraisal, the Association ag;reed
in June 196d, at the reouest of the Governm nt, to make available a further
Credit (Credit No. 119 KE) to finance tle extension of the planting pro-
gram whicn by that time was progressin,; rapidly.  However, tea yields and,
therefore, the income to KTDA provided by a levy on green tea have turned
out to be higher than expected, while capital and operating, costs turned
out to be lowier. This has meant t,at MTMA has been able to finance a
larger share of devd;lopment expenditure than forecast. The net result
was that ITDA completed the planting program under the first Tea Develop-
ment Project (Credit No. 64 KE) with a saving of $592,000 which, at the
Government's request, and witi the approval of the Executive Directors
(IDA/R70-7), was allocated for upgrading roads in the tea growin- areas.
This credit is now expected to be fully disbursed by September 1, 1972.
In addit.on, XTDA has been able to proceed with its expansion program
under the second Tea Development Project (Credit No. 119 KE) without
drawin,g on IDA funds. The KTDA is now expected to start drawing in
Aarch 1971.
8.         The Second Highway Project (Credit No. 120 KE) is on schedule.
The Third Highway Project (Loan No. 639 KE) is ge-tting under way sat-is-
factorily and disbursements are expected to start shortly.   Other lendin,-
under active consideration consists of a credit of $ 12.6 million for high-
way maintenance, for which negotiations have been substantially completed,
and a loan of about $ 29 million for the Kamburu hydroelectric power scheme.
9.         In addition to the lendting set out in para.-raph 4 above, tne
Bank has made six loans for common services in East Africa. All these
loans are -uaranteed jointly and severally by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda,
the United Kingdom is also guarantor of the first loan for railways.
The followin- is a summary stateni nt of Banki loans for common services
as of September 30, 1970:

PART II - DE.SCTIPTION OF TTIF PROPOSED LOAN
10.        BORROVl71:                The City Council of Nairobi (NTCC)
GUARANTOR:                The Republic of Kenya
AiiOUNT-                 US $8.3 million in various currencies
PURPOSE:                  To help finance an increase in the
capacity of tht. Nairobi water supply
system.
AMORTIZATION:             In 20 years, including a period of
grace of approximately 4-1/2 years,
through semiannual installments
beginnin- August 1, 1975 and endin-
Au.!ust 1, 1990.
INTEREST RATE:            7-1/4% per annum.
COIMflITIENT CHARGrE:     3/! of 1% per annum.
RATL OF RtETURN:          Internal financial rate of return
estimated at between 10 and 15 percent.
PART III - TiE PROJECT
11.        A report entitled "Appraisal of the Nairobi Water Supply Project"
(No. PU-4Oa) is attached.  The proj ct, which is e.-pected to increase tile
capacity of the Nilairobi water supply system by 10 million imperial ;allons
per day (from 20 Ilid to 30 Iild), comprises the following:   (a) the
construction of an intakce and ancillary worics on the Chania River; (b)
the provision and installation of a raw water pumping station; (c) a water
treatmi nt plant; (d) a 24-mile long transmission main to Nairobi; (e)
a terminal reservoir; (f) strenOthenini! and expansion of the distribution
system includin; provision of water meters; and (X) necessary consultin-
services.



- 6 -
12.        The cost of thle projc-ct is estimated at $12.1 million.  The
proposed Bank loan of $3.3 million w-uld cover the estimated forei n exchange
conmponent of $7 million and $1.3 million of interest on the Bank loan. The
local currency component would be financed out of NCC's internally generated
funds.  Disbursements wvould bc miade a,ainst t!e actual for-:i';n exchan-e
costs of imported -oods and services and the estimated forei-n exclhan"e
component of construction contracts and locably procured -oods.  The
NCr has recuested the Bankc to reimburse t,ie foreijn exchan;e costs of
consultants' services incurred after January 1, 1970. The consultants
retained are acceptable to th1e Ban,, and the loan includes retroactive
financing of about $50,000 of their fees.
13.        The ex-isting water supply for Nairobi is almost fully utili%ed
and the minor improvement and e-pansion schlemes currently under-way iwill
not meet the expected demand beyond 1973-74.   Nairobi's population of about
half a million is expected to increase at an average annual rate of about
6 percent. The city is not only the capital but is the focal point of the
industrial, commercial and tourism activities of lIenya, and in some re-
spects, of the whole of East Africa.  As a result of the growth in popu-
lation, commerre, tourismn and industry, Tiater consumption is expected
to increase at an average annual rate of 6-1/2 percent. The proposed
proj cGt would meet tVat demand throu-h 1980.
14.        In the past, the water supply operations of the CTCC have covered
oneratin  costs and debt service attributable to them and have yielded
modest surpluses. A wfater rate increase recently made and a further rate
increase expected in 1972 would result in an avera2 e financial rate of
return of 9.4 percent durin, 1971-76 on net water supply assets in service.
Thle internal financial rate of return for tie project is estinmated at
between 10 and 15 percent the economic return .would be considerably
higher due to the favorable effects on public h1eatltl, tourism and fire
protection.
15.         Jairobi was incorporated as a city in 1950 by Royal Charter.
It is administ;ered by trie NCC, which has 43 members, Ito of whom are
elected.  Like otner local authorities in iienya, the IJCC is responsible
to the M4inister of Local. Governm nt who exercises control over its
borrowin-s, annual budget and appointment and dismissal of officers.
16.        In tihe 20 years since its incorporation the NCC has acquired a
reputation for sound management and ;1as become an established borrowler in
both local and U.Ii. financial markets.  Loans outstanding- as of December 31,
1969, including loans from USAID and the Commonwealth Development Corpora-
tion, totalled about $42.5 million equivalent; these loans have been
raised on the _eneral credit of thil City wTithout specific security and
without restrictions on further borrowin-s.

17.        The HCC performs a wide range of municipal functions.   It has
operat-.d the existing water supply system satisfactorily for many years
and has the administrative capacity to undertak.e the proposed project,
which inll be carried out under the immediate responsibility of a new
W4ater and Sewera.-e Department (!JSD) in which the NCC has concentrated
all water supply and seweragee functions.  The qualifications and exxperience
of the General ilanager of the WSD are acceptabl. to the Bank, and the
Ban- lhas received assurances that adequate numbers of qualified technical
staff would be retained in the LED.
18.        The procurement of goods and the lettinr- of construction con-
tracts would be in accordance with the Bank's normal international biddin,-
procedures.  Local manufacturers are expected to compete, probably success-
fully, for the supply of a few items such as small diameter PVC pipes for
the distribu-tion system. The preference to domestic manufacturers would be
limitec to 15 percent, or actual customs duty, whichever is the lower.   At
present the import duty is suspended.
PART IV - LEGAL INST,UIJT'ENTS A1ND ATJTHORITY
19.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the City Council
of Nairobi and th, draft -ruarantee Agreement between the Republic of Kenya
and the Banic, the report of the committee provided for in Article III,
Section h(iii) of the Articles of A:yreemc:nt and the text of a resolution
approving, the proposed loan are bein: distributed to the Execulive Directors
separately. Thie draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements conform substantially
to the pattern of existing loan and -uarantec agreements for projec-ts of
this ikind.
PART V - TTHE ECOTIOfY
20.        An economic report entitled "Econo.nic Development Prospects in
Xenya" (Report No. AE-6a, in two parts, dated October 22, 1969) was
distributed to the ETxecutive Directors on October 31, 1969 (R69-209).
Since then the Government of Kenya has published its 1970-74 Development
Plan,whicfl  is essentially the same as the lraft plan examined in the
economic report.
21.        The Developm. nt Plan 1970-7b appears to be realistic and on
the basis of past economic performance and the sound financial ancl economic
policies of the Government, Kenya should continue to receive substantial
external assistance.  The meetin'- of the Consultative -roup for East Africa
on Kenya in February 1970 generally a7reed writh these conolusions.  Because
of the probable increase in the inflow of private capital and t'e end of
post-independence *rants, the average terins of the inflow of capital into
Kenya are licely to harden.   While Kenya needs to secure as much aid as



- 8 -
possible on concessionary terms, the economy can, within moderate limits,
sus-tain narder temins than in the past, and a somewhat larrer proportion
of assistance could be on conventional terms.
22.        An economic and preinvestraent studies mission to review recen-t
economic developments in Xenya and to help prepare a program for preinvest-
inent studies is currently in the field.
23.        A basic data sheet is anner'ed.
PA-RT VI - COAPLIANCE T.TITH ARTICLES OF AGREEIENT
24.        I am satisfied that th.- proposed loan -would comply with the
Articles of Ar,reemQnt of thle Bank.
PART VII - RECOiHiE3DATION
25.        I recomrend that the 2xecutive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
