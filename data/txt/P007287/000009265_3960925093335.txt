PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1281-HA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Power
Project, which was partially financed by Credit 1281-HA (SDR 23.1) of
June 1982. The Borrower is the Republic of Haiti and the Executing
Agency was Electricite d'Haiti (EdH). Project works started on time but
were concluded 18 months behind schedule.
The Infrastructure and Energy Division, Department III of the
Latin American and Caribbean Regional Office (LA3IE) prepared Parts I
and III of the PCR based on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit and
Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between IDA and
the Borrower; internal IDA memoranda; and on final project data prepared
by the Executing Agency. Part II was not prepared because it would have
been difficult for the Borrower and Executing Agency to complete since
many of their representatives have moved on to new assignments.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ELECTRICITE D'HAITI (EdH)
THIRD POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1281-HA)
EVALUATION S'JMMARY
Objectives
1. The project's main objective was to provide additional generating
capacity by June 1984, promote the use of indigenous resources,
reduce energy losses, and improve EdH'.  institutional performance.
In addition, an important prc:-ct objecti7e was construction of a
new headquarters office buildi) ) for EdH, rehabilitation of part of
the Port-au-Prince distribution network, and repairs of Peligre
hydro facilities. (para. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
2. Overall completion of the project suffered 18 months delay, mainly
because of the unsatisfactory performance of the principal
consultant which was unable to expeditiously prepare designs for the
new diesel generating plant, and the distribution renovation
program. Further, their design for the headquarters building was
unsuitable and had to be redone by others, thereby delaying its
completion (para. 5.01).
Result
3. The project achieved its main objective with a delay of only 5
months. But it was unsuccessful in reducing energy losses during the
project period, promote the use of indigenous resources, or improve
EdH's performance. On the other hand, it succeeded in improving
electricity service reliability and with the new headquarters
building, provided a sound foundation for improvements in EdH's
institutional performance (paras. 6.01 and 8.01).
Sustainability
4. Through two subsequent credits, IDA has assisted the sector by
financing required additional generating capacity, reducing
technical losses through distribution network rehabilitation, and
strengthening of EdH to improve its performance. Nevertheless, EdH
continues to depend too much on foreign consultants. This practice
should cease because it is expensive and constrains autonomy. If



- iii -
EdH is unable to operate effectively without such help, Government
should consider transferring some, or all, of the utility's
operation to the private sector. (para. 7.01).
Findings and Lessons Learned
5. The institutional framework was not diagnosed in dept'Ž to permit
design of improvements, if requi-ed (para. 9.01).
6. When the institutional framework is adequately diagnosed by staff
specialized in this field, IDA should then determine if required
remedies may be achieved and sustained through a specific project
(para 9.02).
7. The project did not provide for preparing EdH to operate without
foreign consultants in its day-to-day activities (para. 9.03).
8. IDA did not examine the effects of high tariffs on energy losses, or
the relationship between tariffs and the residential and commercial
consumers' ability to pay for electric services. It also did not
pursue options to lower costs such as fuel substitution and
rationing. As a consequence, tariffs are very high (third highest
in the Americas and in the top quarter in the world), which induce
electricity theft and principally contributed to EdH's dismal
financial performance (para. 8.02).
9. The economic analysis assumed that financial constraints did not
exist, which was not the case. Instead, IDA should have determined
more affordable investment routes for EdH to follow, taking into
consideration particularly the financial capacity of its residential
and commercial consumers to pay for electricity services (para.
9.04).
10. IDA should thoroughly assess Government's and the Executing Agency's
attitudes towards expected commitments with IDA prior to Credit
approval and should continuously assess the appropriateness of
certain agreements under current circumstances (para. 9.05).

THIRD POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 1281-H4)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM IDA'S PERSPECTIVE
1.     Project Identity
Name:            Third Power Project
Credit Number:  1281-HA
RVP Unit:        LAC Region
Country:         Haiti
Sector:          Energy (Power)
2.     Background
2.01   IDA Lending to the Sector.  IDA has assisted Haiti in development
of its power sector since 1976, through five credits totaling the
equivalent of US $102.0 million, of which the project under review
(Credit 1281-HA) was the third operation. IDA's assistance through
these operations has been through: (a) the formulation and application
of least-cost national power development plans; and (b) institutional
and financial strengthening of EdH.
2.02 The First Power Project (Credit 645-HA of July 1976 for US $16.0
million) comprised the installation of the first three diesel generating
units totaling 21 MW at the new Varreux plant, plus corresponding
transmission facilities; and reorganization and institutional
strengthening of EdH, through technical assistance. The Second Power
Project (Credit 895-HA for US $16.5 million signed in May 1979) covered!
the installation of three additional diesel generating units at Varreux,
totaling 23MW; transmission lines and substations; renovation of the
Port-au-Prince distribution system; some diesel units and related
distribution networks in the provinces; and consulting services and
training of EdH's staff. The Third Power Project continued assistance
in increasing generating capacity; the Fourth Power Project (Credit
1527- HA) for SDR 21.8 million (US $22.1 million of December 12, 1984)
followed up on increasing generating capacity and improvement of the
distribution network of Port-au-Prince, and institutional strengthening
of EdH. The Fifth Power Project (Credit 2053-HA for SDR 18.6 (US $24.0
million) of August 9, 1989) continues assistance towards improving
system reliability by increasing generating capacity, reducing system
losses, and supporting EdH's institutional performance.



-2-
2.03   Electric Power Sector Organization.  EdH, an autonomous
government agency created in 1971, is the agency reFpcnsible for
electric power generation, transmission and distribution !.n Paiti.
EdH's Board of Direetors is composed of the Minis-er of Public Works,
Transport and Comnunications (Chairman), the Minister of Economy and
Finances, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, the Minister of
Planning and External C3operation, the Governor of the Central Bank, and
EdH's General Manager.  The Board approves majo-; investments and
borrowings, sets policy, and approves tariffs.
2.04   EdH's present organization, which is based on a 1981 study by
consultants financed under the Second Power Project, worked well until
about 1965. Improvements were deemed to be required for more effective
work between the Technical and Commercial departments and higher
productivity in the Administration Department. These improvements are
being sought through the Fifth Power Project.
3.     Project Objectives and Description
3.01   Project Objectives.  The projects objectives were many, varied
and ambitious: a) rationalize sector development and promote the use of
indigenous resources; b) provide access to electricity to a greater
number of households; c) accelerate connection of labor-intensive
industries; d) establish a continuous training prograr,i for EdH
personnel; f) establish a program to reduce energy losses to reasonable
levels; g) achieve EdH's financial independence through adequate
pricing, and h) increase the institutional and managerial efr iency at
EdH.
3.02   Proiect Description.  Based on the findings of the appraisal
mission, the Project consisted of:
A. Generation
a) Installation of two 7.8 MW diesel generating units at the new
Carrefour power plant, designed to accommodate these units plus
three future ones;
b) repair of the Peligre hydro works, comprising several
hydromechanical components that needed to be repaired or
replaced, plus extensive repairs of concrete works,
particularly in the stilling basin;
B. Distribution SZstem
a) Rehabilitation of about 10 km2 of the Port-au-Prince
distribution network;
C. Office Building
a) Construction of a new EdH headquarters building;



-3-
D. Consultl.ng Services
a) Survey, feasibility study and preparation of bid documents for
the Guayamouc hydroelectric plant;
b) General and utility management assistance; and
c) Personnel training.
4.     Project Design and Organization
4.03   Origin.  In 1976 UNDP financed the preparation of the study
entitled "Long-term Preinvestment Study of the Power Sector", which was
carried uut by the French consuling firms SOFREMINES and SOFELEC and
supervised by IDA, as executing agency.  This study was updated and
expanded under the Second Power Project. The principal conclusion of
these studies was that power development in the urban centers was needed
to enhance the country's economic development.  The Third Power Project
was designed to meet the defined power -equirements between the period
1982-1986.
4.04   Preparation.  Based on the above mentioned study, and with the
assistance of EdH's staff and consultants, I'A defined the generation,
transmission and distribution components of the projects and assessed
EdH's organiza,ion and performance. IDA designed the other proiect
components, which comprised construction of a new headquarters building,
repairs of the Peligre hydro works, consulting services, aid training of
EdH's staff.
4.05   Appraisal and Negotiations.  The appraisal mission concentratel
efforts on completing updating of the generating plant expansion
program, final designs of the Carrefour power plant, and the
headquarters building, but prudently did not subject credit processing
to such completion since it was not crucial for reliable cost estimates.
Nevertheless, the appraisal mission had to be postponed from April to
July 1981 due to budgetary restrict.ions and staff constraints.
Negotiations were completed by the end of May 1982 without substantive
chanr.>s in the draft credit documents. The Board of Executive Directors
app -ved the credit in June 1982.
4.06   Estimated Proiect Cost and Financing.  The estimated cost of the
project, excluding financing charges, was US $34.0 million. The US
927.0 million foreign currency component was financed by IDA (US $26.0
million) and Government (US $1.0 million). EdH financed the total local
cost (US $7.0 million).
5.     Project Implementation
5.01   Generation and Distribution ComDonents.  Overall completion of
the project suffered 18 months delay mainly because of the
unsatisfactory performance of the principal consultant Hydro Quebec
International which was unable to expeditiously prepare designs for the
Carrefour plant and bidding documents for the generating units thereby
delaying contracting and commissioning of the plant. They did not



-4-
diligently prepare the distribution renovation program, de!aying its
executin.l in the field. And third, they prepareo an unsuitable design
of the headquarters building which had to be redesigned completely,
causing some 12 months delay in construction completion. This
consultant's contract was reduced considerably in May 1985.
5.02   Execution Timetables.  The project timetable as forecast and
executed appears in Table 4, Part III.
5.03   EXecution Problems.  Aside from the delays in executing the
project for the above reasons, no major problems were encountered in
carrying out the proji'^t.
5.04   Prgcurtment.  Procurement of all works and goods, as well as
contracting of consultants, were carried out in close adherence to IDA's
guidelines.
5.05   Project Cost and Financing.  Table 5, Part III, shows a
comparison of the estimated and actual costs of the project. The
projen^t was executed some 8% below the estimated cost in "IS dollars
equivalent and the financ'.ng originally envisaged was carried cut: IDA
financed all foreign cost, except 50% ($0.9 million) of those for
repairs of the Peligre hydro works; this and all local costs were borne
by EdH.
5.06   Disbursements.  Project execution delay-, particularly in the
Carrefour plant delayed credit disbursements by 12 months (See Table 4,
Part III)
5.07   Performance of Consultants. Coatractors. and Suppliers.  As
stated above, the performance of EdH's general consultant was not
satisfactory. The rest of the consultants performed well: TAMS (USA)
in the Peligre repairs, Hydroplan (Germany) ard Benjamin and Jadotte
Architects (Haiti) in the headquarters building, DECON (Germany) in the
distribution network, and Prise Waterhouse in administration and
financial management assistance.
5.08   All the contractors involved performed well:  TECINA (Haiti) ih
Carrefour, Les Chantiers Modernes (France) with International Underwater
Contractors (USA) in Peligre and COMEI (Mexico) in the distribution
network.
5.09   Covenants.  The key covenants for the Credit (CA) and Project
Agreement (PA) deal with financial performance and are summarized in
Table 7, Part III.
5.10   Not once during the project period (1982-86) did Government or
EdH comply with the most important financial covenant dealing with rate
of return (CA 4.02 and PA 4.03).



-5-
6.     Proiect Results
6.01   The project failed its main objective of promoting the use of
indigenous resources, because to date not a single new hydro, wind,
biomass, or new hydro power project has been put into service, except
the Guayamouc hydro plant which was already underway. However, it
succeeded in improving supply reliability and, with the new headquarters
building, notably excelled in providing a sound foundation for
improvements in EdH's institutional performance.
6.02   Following immediately after the Third Power Project, the Fourth
Power Project was also intended to accomplish the institutional
objectives expected through the Third Power Project. This objective was
also not met.
6.03   Market Growth.  Forecast and actual sales differed sharply from
the beginning (1982), when total actual sales were 248 GWh instead of
283 GWh. forecast at appraisal a year earlier, or 14% lower. Throughout
the 1982-86 period, total sales grew steadily at 5.5%, instead of 14%
expected at appraisal (See Table 4, Part III), while recorded total
generation increased evenly also at 5.5%. Although total average losses
during the same period were somewhat higher (28% vs. 23%) such minor
difference had no effect on the growth trend in total sales. In
summary, appraisal forecasts were off significantly and the only
explanatiGn available is that the growth trend was not reliably
estimated.
6.04   Rate of Return.  The approach described in the appraisal was to
determine the rate of return of the investment program for the period
1981-1991, containing the project and other components which extended
beyond project completion. Since none of the assumptions on
investments, which comprised the so-called least-cost program,
materialized, except the project, a realistic way of gaging the
project's economic merits would be to analyze it, as it actually began
to operate and could continue to do so during its prescribed economic
life of 15 years. In this analysis, the maximum possible benefits were
assigned to all components of the project. The result of these
calculations appear in Table 6, Part III, and show that the project has
an acceptable rate of return of 11.0%, compared to 13.0% expected
originally for the ten-year investment program.
6.05   Comparison of Forecast and Actual Performance.  Annexes 1, 2, and
3 show appraisal forecast income statement; sources and application of
funds, and balance sheets for EdH. The ink had not dried on the
appraisal report when EdH's financial position began to decline to the
extent that forecasts and reality became distant relatives. From 1981
to 1983 the rate of return fell from 6.8 to zero, when it was expected
to stay at the agreed 8%.  Such weak performance was principally due to
lower than expected sales; increase in accounts receivable from
inadequate monito.ing, and an ineffective service disconnecting policy;
higher operating expenses, fuel prices, and inadequate tariffs.  For the
same reasons the self-financing ratio was also considerably lower than
expected, as well as the debt-ser-ice coverage, which deteriorated from
7.4 to 1.0, together with the debt-equity ratio, which went from an
adequate 36/64 to a poor 54/46.



-6-
6.06   The rate of return, which was the principal financial covenant of
the credit, was, throughout the entire project period, considerably
lower than the agreed 8%. However, IDA did not once press Government
and EdH to comply with their commitment on this important provision.
Although on several occasions IDA discussed with Government and EdH
these problems, and officially requested them to improve the latter's
financial situation, particularly in public sector arrears on
electricity bills, it did not strongly pursue remedial action to reverse
the obviously deteriorating financial situation of EdH. The only steps
taken to improve EdH's finances (and late ones at that) were a modest
tariff increase (10.2%) in 1984 and an agreement signed between
Government and EdH in May of that year to settle the former's
accumulated arrears of US $2.5 million during the subsequent three
years.
7.     Sustainability
7.01   Through two subsequent credits, IDA has assisted the sector by
financing required additional generating capacity, reducing technical
losses through distribution network rehabilitations and strengthening of
EdH to improve its performance. Nevertheless, Edh continues to depend
too much on outside consultants and this practice should cease because
it is expensive and constrains autonomy. If EdH is unable to operate
effectively without such help, Government should consider transferring
some, or all, of the utility's operations to the private sector.
8.     IDA Performance
8.01   The Borrower. Executine Agency, and IDA.  The appraisal
assessment of EdH's institutional features concentrated on outlining
some of the achievements reached under the First and Second Power
Projects and reiterate the objectives to : a) establish a continuous
training program for EdH personnel; b) achieve EdH's financial
independence through adequate pricing and reduction in losses and
electricity thefts; and c) increase the institutional and managerial
efficiency at EdH. lowever, it failed to define how these objectives
were to be met. It provided for consultants to assist EdH in
administration and finances but without guidelines or clear schedule of
goals. It is no simple task to pruperly diagnose institutional
performance and tougher still to prescribe the right medicine for any
ailments. In the absence of such diagnosis, a sound judgment cannot be
made on the contributions that the Third Power Project may have made to
institutional improvements, if any. In spite of this constraint, the
new headquarters office is a major achievement of the Third Power
Project in establishing modest, yet well designed and comfortable
working facilities, while giving EdH a prestige symbol to uphold.
8.02    At the time of appraisal EdH's tariff averaged US cents 11.0/kWh
and the appraisal team argued that this cost was reasonable in
comparison with countries in "similar economic circumstances". In
addition it felt that any incremental demand had to be supplied by
thermal generation and for such reason, rates should be maintained at
least at that level in real terms. It went on to argue that future
expansion would not be able to change the trend because it comprised



-7-
either thermal generation with high-cost fuel or hydro generation with
high capital cost. Further, it agreed that Government was not in a
financial position to contribute substantially towards EdH's expansion
program. Consequently, continued power expansion depended largely on
adequate internal generation of funds, i.e. adequate rates. During
project supervision, however, these admonitions were not observed and
EdH's financial performance was dismal, because it had inadequate rates
throughout the entire project period. IDA did not behave consistently,
in ellowing EdH to default on the rate of return covenant, while it
apparently held fast to the notion that EdH's average rate was
reasonable. In reality, the average revenue was very high (third
highest in the Western Hemisphere and in the top quarter in the world)
in one of the poorest of countries and where residential and commercial
electricity consumption is about one third of total consumption. IDA
should have examined Instead EdH's finances in light of current sales,
since revenues were consistently much lower than forecast figures, then
it should have reassessed EdH's financial objectives and adjusted system
operations to sustain EdH's financial health.
9.     Lessons to be Learned Regardinz the Performance of IDA
9.01   Institutional DeveloRment.  From all indications at appraisal,
EdH was performing well institutionally. There was no predominant
reason, then, to improve upon it. It appears that appraisal
commentaries on this matter were window dressing.
9.02   When institutional problems are clearly defined IDA should then
determine if remedies may be achieved and sustained through a specific
project.
9.03   At appraisal, EdH was dependent on consultants to carry out its
day-to-day operations, but the project did not provide for preparing EdH
to operate effectively without them.
9.04   Expansion Program.  The "least-cost" expansion program was based
on meeting the demand apparently at any price, under the premise that it
was "crucial for economic development". The economic analysis assumed
that financial constraints did not exist, which was definitely not the
case. IDA should have determined instead more affordable investment
routes for EdH to follow, taking into consideration the financial
capacity of its consumers to pay for its electricity services. These
options could have been: rationing, delegating investments to serve
private industry to the private sector, small hydro (such as the
successful Guayamouc hydro, initiated with the project) to substitute
costly thermal generation, or a combination of all these options.



-8-
9.05   Compliance with Agreements.  IDA should thoroughly assess
Government and the Executing Agency's attitudes towards expected
commitments with IDA prior to credit approval. Government and EdH
repeatedly defaulted with major contractual agreements with IDA, and
weak reactions of IDA on their defaults apparently encouraged them
further. To reduce the risk of non-compliance, IDA should seek
fulfillment of selective policy conditions such as tariffs, service
policies and supply, on which there are questions on the Government's
commitment prior to, or as conditions for, processing the credit.
Deferral of such obligations to later stages of credit preparation
jeopardizes the carrying out of related provisions. However, project
supervision should not only monitor compliance with credit agreements
but should assess continuouslv their appropriateness under current
circumstances and make adjustments when necessary.

II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
This part will not be prepared because it would have been
difficult for the Bozrower and Executing Agency to complete since many
of their representative have moved on to new assignments.
