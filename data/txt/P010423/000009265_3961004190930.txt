NDIORANDUK AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF t s INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AD DEVELOPMENT
TO THEX EMCUTE DIRECTORS
ON A PMOPOSED LOAN
TO TER NATIONAL TEERNAL POWE CORPORATION LIITED (NTPC)
FOR A NTPC POWER GENERATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the National Thermal Power Corporation
Limited (NTPC), with the guarantee of the Government of India, for the
equivalent of US$400 million to help finance a NTP'C Power Generation Project.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
matu.rity of 20 years, including five years of grace. NTPC will bear the
foreign exchange risk.
2.        Sector Background.  Despite progress in system expansion, power
shortages persist and power supply is likely to continue to constrain economic
growth in India well into the niext century.  Supply capacity expansion alone
vill not substantially improve the critical power demandisupply situation. A
major challenge facing Government of India (GOI) in the power sector is to
attain a better balance in sector development between supply expansion and
improvement in the efficiency of supply, consumption and pricing of power.
3.        Power Sector Reform.  GOI recognizes that the growth targets of its
economic stabilization and liberalization program will be threatened as long
as power supply continues to severely constrain industrial development. Faced
with a growing power gap and diminishing public resources available for the
sector, GOI has opened the powpr sector to private sector participation. GOl
has simultaneously started to promote reforms at the state level in the State
Electricity Boards (SEBs): (a) the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) was
established to raise resources and lend only to utilities, which have
undertaken to improve their resource mobilization and operational efficiency.
Other discretionary financing is similarly being directed by 001 to the
performing states; (b) GOI established POWERGRID to improve the efficiency in
power transmission and system operations, through an extensive restructuring
of the transmission sector; and (c) GOI has adopted new investment and
commercial policies and electricity tariffs for its main generating utility,
NTPC. The new policies allow NTPC to limit its power supply to match the
level of payments from each client, to direct its future investments to
regions and states meeting their obligations to NTPC and to construct power
stations in its investment program with private sector partners.
4.        The reform process in the power sector has only just begun and much
remains to be done at both the central and state levels. Pending policy and
regulatory issues and the poor financial position of most SEBs constrain
private power development. At the state level the precarious financial
position of most state governments together with political obstacles to
raising power tariffs will continue to hinder the financial strengthening of
the SEBs including their ability to pay the central entities and private
generators. POWERGRID will have to establish itself as a coordinator of
system operations and pursue improvements in bulk power and transmission



-2-
5.        GOI's program supports policies for effectlve institutional,
regulatory and financial reform in line with the recently approved guidelines
for Bank lending as shown in the following paragraphs. GOI's recent actions
through NTPC, POWERGRID and PVC and the opening the sector to private
investment demonstrate a clear commitment to reform as shown in the following
paragraphs.
6.        Transparent regulation.  India has in place, In its Electricity
Supply Act, a workable regulatory framework for the sector and transmission
regulation is being studied under Ln. 3577-IN POWERGRID System Development
Project. Progress has been made in designing a regulatory framework making
private investment in the power sector more attractive, by amending the Act.
The major remaining regulatory area which needs to be tacklad is that
applicable to the SEBs as in practice the state governments do not allow the
SEBs to operate with the autonomy provided by the Act.
7.        Pricing and Demand Sidti Management.  The sector's financial
distress and resource constraints stem from operational inefficiencies and low
retail tariffs which average ebout 50X of the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of
supply. New two part bulk tariffs for NTPC coal fired staticns became
effective in November 1992, which price the output of the new plants at LRiM.
Further reforms in bulk power and transmission tariffs will be studied and
implemented under Ln. 3577-IN. At the state level progress on tariff reforms
has been generally unsatisfactory. Until recently, agricultural tariffs on
average recovered less than 10? of LRMC. Several states have in 1992/93
adjusted their agricultural tariffs by implementing 001's minimum agricultural
tariff policy directive, which brings the agricultural tariffs to about 201 of
LMRC. The tariff reform process in the States has only started and the
challenges ahead are formidable: regular adjustments going well beyond the
minimum agricultural tariff - as well as improvements in other tariff
categories - would be needed to restore the financial viability of the SEBs
and make a meaningful contribution to financing future investments. Major
changes are also required in the structure of the SEB tariffs to ensure that
it provides appropriate incentives to conserve energy. Demand side management
(DSM) is being introduced in India and incentives for conservation are only
emerging with the ongoing trade liberalization, which will promote the
required competi.ive pressures and with state-by-state electricity tariff
reform.
8.        Importation of Services.  As part of its liberalization program,
India has opened up its power sector to entry by foreign investors and import
duties an advanced technology and equipment have been reduced. Compared to
most other developing countries, India has an abundance of educated and
trained manpower and the use of foreign consultants would mainly be required
in high-technology projects and in the management of projects of less-
efficient SEBs/states.
9.        Commercialization and Corporatization.  The centrally-owned
entities in the power sector are all incorporated under the Companies Act and
already enjoy reasonable autonomy in decision making and day-to-day
operations.   Following an intensive dialogue with the Bank, the Department of
Power has approved new c3mmercial and investment policies for NTPC aimed at
putting India's power sector on a commercial basis. The main features of
these policies are to permit NTPC to shut-off or restrict power supply to
states which are not meeting their payment obligation. These policies have



-3-
states which are not meeting their payment obligation. These policies have
been notified to all the states and are incorporated in the bulk power supply
agreements between NTPC and its clients. Significant progress has been
achieved in establishing comercial contracts between the SEBs and the central
utilities under the POWERGRID System Development Project and the proposed
project. POWERGRID has now concluded interim ccomercial arrangements with
most SEBs and NTPC has signed one regional bulk power supply agreement. The
dialogue on commercialization and corporatization of the SEBs has been
initiated and the Bank in its future operations will seek to support those
states ready to take upfront action to commercialize their SEBs.
10.       Private investment.  India, unlike most developing countries. has a
few large private utilities. The Bank has been actively involved, in close
cooperation with IFC, in supporting their investment programs. Following the
opening of the power sector to private developers, the Bank is supporting the
implementation of the new policy under the Second Maharashtra Power Project
(Ln. 3498-IN, approved in June 1992) by helping Maiarashtra develop its
private power policy and regulatory framework and negotiate contracts with
private developers for major power generation projects. These activities are
partly financed by two grants from the Japan Grant Facility. A Technical
Assistance Project for Private Power Development to provide State Electricity
Boards and other power utilities the required specialized expert services to
assist soliciting, evaluating and negotiating private power project proposals
has been negotiated with the Bank and is scheduled to be presented to the
Board in June 1993. Under the proposed project the Bank would assist NTPC in
establishing joint ventures with p:ivate domestic and foreign investors.
11.       Experience from Previous NTPC Operations.  As of January 31, 1993,
the Bank Group had invested US$ 3 billion in 15 operations with NTPC. The
total undisbursed balance under five ongoing projects amounted to US$461
million. In FY93, NTPC generated about 22? of India's total power supplies at
operating efficiencies far exceeding those of the state utilities.  NTPC which
currently has an installed generating capacity of 13.054 MW, is likely to
remain by far the largest generating company in the country. Project
completion reports for the first nine NTPC operations recognize the
achievements and success of NTPC in implementation; despite some delays in the
pre-construction stages, NTPC generally completed the projects on schedule and
within budget, reflecting the strong project management capability it has
developed. Quality control procedures introduced by NTPC helped improve the
quality standards of power equipment supplied by Indian manufacturers.
However, the financial health of NTPC has been threatened by the accumulation
of receivables from the SEBs. Intensified collection efforts and central
appropriations (direct payments by GOI from budgetary support intended to the
concerned states) have reduced NTPC's accounts receivable and further
improvements have been achieved after the approval of NTPC's new investment
and commercial policies by the Government in October 1992 after a prolonged
dialogue with the Bank. The Bank's latest Performance Audit Report noted that
its own efficiency notwithstanding, NTPC did not bring about the expected
sectoral improvements. The reports also identified areas for further
improvement for NTPC itself, highlighting the need to pay more attention to:
(a) internal resource mobilization by NTPC for its future investment; (b)
adequacy of coal supply arrangements; (c) environmental impact mitigation and
rehabilitation and resettlement of project affected persons; and (d) pre-
implementation activities including preparation of tender documents and timely



-4-
award of contracts. These issues have been discussed with NTPC and have been
incorporated in the design of the proposed project.
12.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project helps implement the
Bank's lending strategy for the power sector, which: (a) promotes private
investment in the sector; (b) supports the development of utilities that
demonstrate a firm commitment to improve their operational performance and
finances; and tc) encourages investments designed to improve the utilization,
operations and efficiency of existing generation, transmission and
distribution facilities. The project is in line with the Country Assistance
Strategy, which calls for operations that help improve sectoral policy
framework and support institutional development and private sector investment
and in the power sector emphasizes the need for major policy reforms aimed at
improving operational efficiency, financial performance and resource
mobilization. It will also help strengthen NTPC's environmental management
practices and addresses a wide range of environmental problems in existing and
planned power stations.
13.       Project Objectives.  The project has been designed to support
India's reform program for the power sector and its principal objectives are
to: (a) help improve commercial discipline in the power system through the
implementation of new commercial and investment policies (para. 9); (b) help
NTPC meet its targets for capacity additions through increased mobilization of
funds from internal resources, domestic and foreign capital markets as well as
from the private sector through joint operations; tc) upgrade environmental
performance of NTPC power stations and make its new power stations
environmentally more sustainable; and (d) strengthen its environmental and
resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) management capability.
14.       Project Description. The proposed project comprises: (a) Generation
Capacity Additions: a five year time-slice of NTPC's least cost investment
program of new coal and gas-based power stations for which full funding has
not yet been arranged; (b) Private Sector Components support to NTPC to
undertake several joint venture operations; and (c) Environmental
Strengthening and Resettlement and Rehabilitation: implementation of an
Environmental Action Plan (ZAP) which includes environmental upgrading
projects, training and technical assistance for strengthening of Nt'PC's
environmental management and R&R capability and the implementatior, of the ZAP.
15.       The proposed loan of US$400 million is the first of a series of
three operations to support NTPC's investment program which would be proposed
-r consideration by the Board at intervals of 18 to 24 months for a total of
about US$1.2 billion, provided that NTPC remains in compliance with the Bank's
legal conditions.
16.       NTPC's current investment program includes nine coal-fireed power
plants with an aggregate installed capacity of 8,260 MW and one 400 MW gas-
based combined cycle power plant expected to be initiated during the Eighth
Plan. In addition, NTPC is planning to develop several projects as a minority
partner in joint ventures with private companies. During the Ninth Plan, NTPC
expects to start construction of seven projects (six coal-fired and one gas-
based combined cycle) for a total capacity of 8,400 MV.  To be elig.ble for
Bank financing, the projects would have to meet the following criteriat
(a) technical, economic and financial viability would have been established;
(b) all necessary GOI clearances including Public Investment Board (PIB) and



-5-
environmental would have been obtained; Environmental Impact Assessments would
have to be carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines and for 'AO projects
an environmental assessment sumuary would have to be circulated to the Board
before issuance of tender documents; (c) the SEB of the state in which the
plant is to be located would be in compliance with the terms of the existing
bulk power supply agreement; (d) a sound financing plan would have been
confirmed; and (e) a satisfactory Resettlement Action Plan, where required,
duly endorsed by the State authorities would have been prepared. Th6 first
two projects out of NTPC's investment program for which Bank finance has been
requested are Stage TT expansions of the Rlihand and Vindhyachal thermal power
plants in the Singrauli area in the north-eastern part of India.
17.       Project Implementation.  The project would be executed by NTPC.
NTPC's investment requirements including interest during construction during
the FY93-FY97 (Eighth Plan) period amount to Rs. 177 billion (US$4,960 mi1lion
equivalent) and Rs. 380 billion (US$9,039 million) during the Ninth plan
period. The investment program includes capital expenditures for the
implementation of the EAP. The Bank would Initially finance US$400 million.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. External
co-financing will be raised and the use of the Bank's ECO program to help
mibilize private financing and supplement the Bank loan, in particular for the
joint sector projects is being explored. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11827, dated June 4, 1993, is being
distributed separately.
18.       Environmental and Resettlement and Rehabilitation Aspects.  NTPC
has realized that its environmental management systems need to be further
developed beyond the mere compilation of environmental data for compliance
purposes towards the pro-active identification and mcnagement of increasingly
complex environmental and socio-economic issues. During the preparation of
the proposed project, NTPC adopted a resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R)
policy which will be applied to all its operations and which is broadly
consistent with the Bank's operational directives. NTPC also formulated a
comprehensive EAP in consultation with the Bank, in order to strengthen its
environmental management practices and to address outstanding environmental
and R&R problems. The objectives of the RAP ares (i) to rationalize and
improve NTPC's organizational structure for environmental management at the
corporate and plant levels; (ii) to improve environmental monitoring and the
preparation of environmental impact assessments; (iii) to execute a specific
program of remedial environmental measures for NTPC's existing power stations;
and to address outstanding R&R issues and to upgrade NTPC's capability to
prepare and execute R&R programs. The ZAP covers all NTPC power stations and
supports the required institutional strengthening of NTPC to deal effectively
with environmental and R&R problems. It includes investments to enable
existing plants to meet the latest GOI environmental standards. The EAP also
includes training of ITPC staff and technical assistance to help undertake
studies and implement environmental projects.
19.       Agreed Actions. Agreement has been reached with NTPC and the
Government on the following: (i) Bank funds can only be used for NTPC power
stations which have met the eligibility criteria given in para. 16; (ii) for



-6-
joint venture projects to be eligible for Bank financing the same eligibility
criteria as for NTPC's own projects would apply, suitably modified with
respect to Government clearances and the signing of a Power Purchase Agreement
satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) NTPC shall furnish to the Bank, for the Bank's
review, not later than December 31 of each year, starting December 31, 1993,
its financial projections, including its investment program and financing
plan; (iv) GOI confirmed that adequate and timely supplies of fuel and
financing for the associated transmission systems for Rihand I: and
Vindhyachal II will be made available and that adequate measures have been
taken to ensure the coordination of construction sohedules; (v) NTPC shall
create, not later than December 31, 1993, an equitable mortgage/charge in
favor of the Bank on its unencumbered assets by way of security for the
proposed loan; (vi) NTPC will implement the Environmental Action Plan dated
May 10, 1993 agreed with the Bank; (vii) NTPC will implement the agreed
Resettlement Actions Plans in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (viii) NTPC
shall carry out socio-econoric surveys not later than December 31, 1994, to
ascertain the present socio-economic status of Project Affected Families of
ongoing Bank financed projezts and draw up and implement an agreed remedial
action program thereafter; (ix) NTPC shall submit to the Bank not later than
December 31, 1993 the scope of the financial management systems review to be
undertaken and discuss with the Bank not later than June 30, 1994 the
implementation of the recommendations; (x) NTPC shall furnish to the Bank, not
later than seven months after the close of each fiscal year, its audited
financial statements, as well as the audit reports of the special account and
withdrawals made against statement of expenditures for the project; (xi) NTPC
shall, not later than March 31, 1994, enter into regional bulk power supply
agreements satisfactory to the Bank with all the SEBs provided that at least
two more such agreements will be signed not later than December 31, 1993;
(xii) GOI to settle remaining SEBs arrears through Central appropriations in
accordance with an agreed schedule; (xiii) NTPC shall take all necessary steps
to maintain its accounts receivables at a level not exceeding an amount
equivalent to the preceding two months; (xiv) NTPC shall discuss with the Bank
the results of the study on alternative strategies for financing NTPC's long
term development not later than September 30, 1994 and shall thereafter
implement the agreed recommendations; and (xv) NTPC shall take all necessary
measures to produce, starting from FY94, funds from internal cash generation
equivalent to not less than 15Z of its capital expenditures (three-year moving
average) and not less than 20? in each fiscal year thereafter.
20.       Project Benefits. The proposed project would: (a) improve
commercial discipline in the power system in India through the implementation
of NTPC's new commercial and investment policies; (b) help NTPC meet its
targets for capacity additions through in-reased mobilization of funds from
internal resources, domestic and foreign capital markets as well as from the
private sector through joint venture operations; (c) upgrade environmental
performance of NTPC power stations and make its new power plants
environmentally more sustainable; and (d) strengthen NTPC's environmental and
resettlement and rehabilitation management capability. Of India's proposed
investments Li thermal generation capacity, those of NTPC are among the
lowest-cost options and warrant support when overall investment resources are
constrained and an increasing share of the total funds available is devoted to
rehabilitation of existing generating facilities and strengthening the
transmission and distribution system. It would help meet the energy needs of
the Indian economy at a relatively low cost and high efficiency to support the
far reaching macro-economic and structural adjustment program.



21.       Risks. The project does not pose any particular technical risks as
proven technologies will be utilized and project implementation vill follow
practices well-established at NTPC. Its investment program is constrained
more by the availability of financing than by the demand for electricity or by
its implementation capability. The core investment program has been prepared
taking into account NTPC's capability to raise resources through internal cash
generation and from the capital markets. NTPC's main risk Is financial and
relates to its ability to recover its charges from its clients, the State
Electricity Boards. As long as it recovers, the level and structure of the
tariff will safeguard its financial position and provide adequate self-
finanring for the implementation of its investment program. Special attention
has therefore been paid during pro3ect processing to develV, Ag satisfactory
commercial policies and arrangements which would ensure sa-isfactory revenue
recovery, and would allow NTPC to divert supply from non paying customers and
direct !nvestments to the financially viable SEBs. The environmental risks
associated with this project will be minimized through the implementation of
the ZAP, which includes an institutional strengthening component and provides
for implementation of improved resettlement and rehabilitation policies.
Implementation of the EAP will ensure that NTPC power stations will operate in
an environmentally sustainable manner.
22.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
