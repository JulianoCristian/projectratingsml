NOTICE OF REGISTRATION 
Dear  Sir: 
 
Re: Request for Inspection
 
- India:  NTPC Power Generation Project (Loan 3632-IN) 
 
 
The Inspection Panel (the “Panel”) received on May 1, 1997 a Request for Inspection (the 
“Request”) dated April 25, 1997 from residents of Singrauli, India, represented by Ms. Madhu Kohli, who 
live in the project area (the “Requesters”) who claim that they have been directly, materially and adversely 
affected by acts and omissions of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the “Bank”).  
The Request claims that the  people living in the project area have been, and may potentially be,  directly 
and adversely affected as a result of the execution of the NTPC Power Generation Project—located in the 
Singrauli region of India about 1000 Km away from Delhi—and the Bank’s omissions and failures in the 
preparation and implementation of the project.  The Requesters claim to be harmed as a result of alleged 
violations of various provisions of Bank policies and procedures set forth, inter alia, in the following: 
 
\01\02
Economic Evaluation of Investment Operations (OD 10.04) 
\01\02
 Environmental Assessment (OD 4.01) 
\01\02
 Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30) 
\01\02
 Indigenous Peoples  (OD 4.20) 
\01\02
 Supervision (OD 13.05) 
 
 
Ms. Madhu Kohli has submitted original copies of authorization of representation signed by the 
Requesters, who have requested that their names be made available only to the Inspection Panel members, 
but otherwise remain confidential. 
 
 
In accordance with paragraph 17 of the Panel’s Operating Procedures (the “Operating 
Procedures”),  I am notifying you that I have on May 2, 1997, which is also the date of the dispatch of this 
notice, registered the Request in the Inspection Panel Register. 
 
All communications with the Requesters in connection with the Request will be sent to             Ms. 
Madhu Kohli at the address listed below.
