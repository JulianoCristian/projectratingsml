the project is to\n            support the efforts of the government to improve the\n            efficiency of financial and human resources management in\n            the Central Administration.  It will provide long- and\n            short-term foreign and local consultancies, computer\n            hardware and software, office supplies, vehicles, and\n            training of local staff in support of four components.\n            Under the financial management component, the project will\n            assist the government to revise the budget model according\n            to program classification, and adapt the present accounting,\n            cash management and financial reporting systems to the\n            revised budget model.  Under the program management\n            component, it will introduce in selected ministries and in\n            statutory bodies critical to the functioning of those\n            ministries, a corporate planning methodology that will\n            assist managers to define the institutions' objectives\n            and priorities, identify relevant programs, rationalize the\n            relationship between the ministries and key statutory\n            bodies, and monitor the progress of program implementation.\n            Under the computer component, the project will set up a\n            financial management information system to support the\n            budgeting, accounting and cash management process in\n            selected ministries.  A human resources management\n            information system will also be introduced.  A training\n            component will provide courses in corporate planning,\n            program budgeting, accounting and computer skills."}, "docdt": "1991-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
