                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Guyana's Education For All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) continues at a high level of implementation.The Continuous Professional Development for Trained Teachers Policy (CPD)
                         was approved by the professional arm of the Ministry of Education in December 2010 andvetted with stakeholders including the Teachers' Union. Next steps for implementing the
                         policy were defined and work has begun on a detailed operational manual, development of course offerings, and monitoring and evaluation.

                         To date, EFA-FTI has built 11 teacher houses which provide apartments for 44 teachers in the hinterland, and it has provided utility upgrading to 51 primary schools country-wide.

                         School feeding and School Improvement Plans continue to perform well. The Community-based School Feeding Program (SFP) benefits 93 out of 138 hinterland schools which
                         amount to over 14,625 children. Results of a three year impact evaluation show significant positive results on school attendance, academic performance, classroom behavior,
                         nutritional status and parent and community participation, especially for the poorest.
