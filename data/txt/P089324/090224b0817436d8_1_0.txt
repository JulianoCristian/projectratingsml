                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the EFA-FTI has consistently performed well, achieving and maintaining the goal of universal primary school completion for girls and boys in Guyana. To improve the quality
                         of teaching force, in the Hinterland, the EFA-FTI has built 20 teacher houses, established 13 Learning Resource Centers, as well as provided cash incentives to more than 900
                         teachers. The project is training 71 teachers in the Hinterland through the Guyana Basic Education Teacher Training (GBET) and has engaged 480 teachers nationwide in the
                         Continuous Professional Development Program. Meanwhile, aiming to enhance the teaching and learning environment, the EFA-FTI has provided learning materials for all primary
                         schools in Guyana and upgraded the basic utilities (water, electricity, and sanitation) in over 100 schools. Furthermore, the EFA-FTI has strengthened school-community

                         SIP, and 344 schools have received grants designated for school improvement which benefit 71,896 students. With SPF, more than 16,000 school children in the Hinterland now
                         receive a daily meal at school. Findings of a three year impact evaluation of SFP show significant positive results on school attendance, academic performance, classroom behavior,
                         nutritional status and parent and community participation, especially for the poorest.

                         During the past seven months two key decisions were made: (i) On March 23rd, 2012, the Project was restructured to reallocate the remaining funds in Category 10 (Works, Goods.
                         Consultants’ Services, RA Incentives, Training and Operational Costs) to Category 6 (School Feeding Program). The reallocation was necessary given the success of the School
                         Feeding Program. On July 19, 2012, the project was restructured to extend the closing date from October 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012. The extension is necessary to facilitate: (i)
                         a smooth transition with respect to the ownership and administration of subprojects completed by the Project to regions, sub-regions and communities; (ii) some schools/communities
                         to complete the implementation of school improvement projects; and (iii) the distribution of textbooks and other learning materials to schools in the remote and riverain areas.
