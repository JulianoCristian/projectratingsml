Executive Summary

Guyana’s Hinterland Community-Based School Feeding Program (SFP) began in 2007 with the
objective of building more community participation in schools and improving children’s human
development outcomes, such as student enrollment and attendance, nutritional status and
learning outcomes. In addition, the program supports improvement of schools’ organization of
primary level in Regions 1, 7, 8 and 9. In order to participate in the program, schools and their
associated communities are required to submit school feeding proposals, undergo training in
basic financial bookkeeping, food hygiene and nutritious meal preparation, using locally
produced foods whenever possible. Communities must also ensure school kitchens meet the
requirements and guidelines of the Ministry of Health, ensuring an adequate safe-water supply.
To evaluate the program, the Government of Guyana and the World Bank collected survey data
from schools, students, teachers and parents in three rounds 2007, 2008 and 2009 in Regions 1
and 7. This report shows the findings and impacts of SFP using all survey rounds.

Regions 1 and 7 are characterized by high poverty levels and agricultural labor intensity. Both
factors highlight the potential of organizing SFP around local producers, so that a regular supply
of low-cost food can be guaranteed to the local schools and children living in precarious
conditions. Seventeen of the sixty-four schools participating in the impact evaluation are in
Region 7, and the rest are in Region 1. Randomization for the selection of comparison groups
was not achieved, due to the participation rules. However, sample selection correction methods
were used to correct for observable and unobservable biases.

The conceptual framework to evaluate the SFP addresses the following questions:

       Quantitative
       • Has the hinterland school feeding program had a positive impact on students’
          enrollment, attendance, learning outcomes, and nutritional status?
       • Has the program provided a safety net against food price increases or shocks?

       Qualitative
       • Has the program led to improvements in students’ classroom participation and
          behavior, school performance, and parental participation in school activities?
       • Has the program improved diets of households as well as food frequency intakes?

The following findings are separated by topic:

Enrollment and Attendance Findings

       •   The total increase in enrollment observed in three rounds of survey data equals 338
           students. Around 53 percent (178 students) of the observed change in enrollment
           between 2007 and 2009 can be attributed to the SFP.
       •   In percentage terms, the treatment group increased enrolment by 16 percent between
           2007 and 2009, while for the control group enrolment declined 7.5 percent.
       •   SFP increased average attendance by 4.3 percent between 2007 and 2009.



                                                                                                 1
Nutritional Status Findings

       •   Control schools showed consistently higher levels of stunted children because i)
           treatment schools enjoy better economic conditions (selectivity) and / or ii) because
           control groups may have a higher proportion of Amerindian children, who have, in
           turn, consistently higher levels of poverty.
       •   Children in treatment areas grow 0.8 centimeters more compared to children
           attending schools without school feeding. Children at risk of wasting in the treatment
           group improved their Body Mass Index (BMI) between 1.07 to 1.34 standard
           deviations compared to the control group.
       •   The SFP contributed to preserving frequency of food consumption and diet diversity,
           particularly in a period of food price volatility. The lowest food diversity scores with
           relatively large variability are seen when children in the household do not receive a
           school meal, and when the household hosts an extended family, regardless of whether
           the household head is employed or not.

Students’ classroom behavior and school performance

       •   Almost two-thirds of head teachers and class teachers consistently noted that the
           behavior of students changed positively with the SFP. However, this perception
           declined in each survey round.
       •   Survey data showed that SFP schools had higher levels of class participation.
           Students’ of disconnect and distraction from classroom activities showed lower
           incidence in treatment schools. Average student participation in control schools
           declined compared to increases shown in treatment schools over the period of 2007 to
           2009. Student disconnect in classroom activities showed a reduction in treatment
           schools and a relative increase in control schools.

Academic Performance by Students

       •   These impacts are expected to manifest in the longer-term measured through
           nationally standardized test-scores. However, in Round 3 there is already evidence
           that the treatment group is beginning to perform better than the control group in
           English, math and social studies. This last subject showed higher scores in treatment
           groups than control groups, although this test was only applied to 6th graders.
       •   Using Propensity Score Matching techniques (PSM) to correct for differences in
           students’ characteristics, showed significant impacts in Math and English. Social
           studies showed modest impacts. Reading and Science showed non-significant
           impacts.

Parental/Community Participation

       •   Survey data shows that parents are actively participating in cooking, cleaning and
           serving meals. Other important activities in which parents participate are food
           provision and commercialization.



                                                                                                 2
       •   An important contribution of the program is to actively engage communities and
           parents in the school feeding program. Parents and school teachers showed high
           levels of involvement in fund raising and other activities that improve the quality of
           the program.

Household Diets

       •   The diet of rural and Amerindian communities often lacks nutrient diversity. In poor
           and Amerindian communities diets are low in vegetables, fruits and dairy products.
           Treatment areas kept the frequency of consumption relatively steady. During the food
           price shocks the gap in food consumption frequency and diet diversity between
           control and treatment groups increased substantially.

Food Prices Shocks and SFP as a Safety Net

       •   SFP implementation coincided with a period of uncertainty and high volatility in food
           and agricultural commodities prices. A daily meal to children living in a poor
           household represents a safety net mechanism by keeping household’s purchasing
           power relatively constant from adverse food prices shocks. An increase in food prices
           harms the spending capacity of households which in turn affects food consumption,
           nutritional intake and poor nutrition outcomes.
       •   On average, before the food prices shocks a household in control areas consumed
           US$2.40 less per month on food, compared to treatment areas. During and after the
           food prices shocks control areas consumed US$9.00 less per month worth on food.
           Control areas would have 150 more children at risk of falling into poverty, compared
           to treatment areas, before the food price shocks. During and after the food price
           shocks 510 more children in control areas would be at risk of falling deeper into
           poverty.
       •   The financial returns of the SFP can be substantial if it expands. It can also bring a
           safety net mechanism to regions with economic adversities. Compared to other large-
           scale programs SFP has a relatively low cost per child enrolled.

The evaluation findings and the experiences of the SFP raise a number of important issues that
need the attention of the Ministry of Education:

       •   Although attendance was indeed better in treatment schools, absenteeism remains a
           serious concern. More than 59 percent of all children included in the evaluation were
           absent for at least one day in the two weeks preceding the survey application. Of
           those children, more than 22 percent gave labor of some kind as a reason for their
           absence. Labor included care of younger siblings, work on the farm or at their
           homes.
       •   A further 6.6 percent of children with absences in the two weeks preceding the survey
           were absent because of the household’s economic condition: no food, no uniform, no
           cash or no stationery. Interestingly, of those who gave lack of food as the reason for
           absence, all children except one attended control schools where no lunch was offered.



                                                                                               3
       •   The short-term hunger which occurs if a child receives an inadequate breakfast and/or
           has a long and arduous journey to school, is a major contributor to poor classroom
           behavior and academic achievement (see Annex 3). Single parents were least likely
           to offer a full breakfast to their children. An important finding of the evaluation was
           that students attending treatment schools were significantly less likely to receive a full
           breakfast. Are parents of treatment school children withholding a full breakfast
           because they know the child will receive a substantial lunch? If this is indeed the
           case, then the training offered by the school feeding program needs to stress the
           importance of an adequate breakfast, even when a full lunch is to be offered at noon.
       •   Sustainability of the community-based school feeding program when external funding
           ends is an issue for urgent attention. A formal consultation with SFP communities to
           garner their opinions of the program and ideas for sustainability produced actionable
           items and recommendations, some of which have been implemented and others
           require government attention. When considering the obvious educational and
           nutritional benefits of the Program, the Government should take into account the
           important role of the Program in providing a safety net, as well as aspects that address
           poverty in hinterland communities. Thus, for example, the Program offers guaranteed
           markets to farmers for their produce and employment for women as cooks.
       •   While the SFP is a cost-effective program, the Ministry may wish to consider ways
           by which the Program’s costs may be maintained or reduced so as to increase the
           likelihood of sustainability. These include establishing school gardens to provide
           produce for the meals, encouraging home gardens, seeking partnerships with the
           private sector, and finding ways in which the school kitchens could be used on
           weekends and during school holidays to raise funds through small business
           enterprises. These are possibilities that have been discussed with community
           members and could be explored further.

Finally, the SFP’s achievements with regard to improving community participation in school
activities can make a key contribution in finding solutions to many of the challenges faced by the
Ministry of Education for service delivery and quality education in rural, remote areas.

1     Introduction


          1.1 Guyana and its people

Guyana is situated on the north eastern shoulder of South America, bordering Suriname on the
East, Venezuela on the West, and Brazil on the South and Southwest. Its population of
approximately 700,000 persons consists of five main ethnic groups: East Indian, African,
Amerindian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population (97%) lives in the urban and
rural coastal areas and in communities bordering Guyana’s major rivers. The remaining 3
percent of Guyana’s population, largely the Amerindians who are the indigenous population of
the country, live in the hinterland which consists of rainforest, savannah, deep riverine and
mountainous topography. Much of the country’s agricultural produce is cultivated in rural areas
because of the presence of rich alluvial soil.

Administratively, Guyana is divided into ten regions. Regions 1, 7, 8 and 9 constitute the
hinterland regions and are inhabited largely by Amerindians, although some Amerindian
communities are also found in other regions. 1 Many of the communities in the hinterland
regions are small and remote, and access to these communities is difficult. The country’s capital,
Georgetown, is located on the coast in Region 4.

The three main ethnic groups (East Indian, African and Amerindian) of Guyana present different
patterns of malnutrition. In particular, the Amerindian population generally presents a much
higher prevalence of chronic malnutrition (stunting) and a lower prevalence of acute malnutrition
(wasting). The few studies available indicate that malnutrition among Amerindian children is
linked to deficiencies in key micronutrients which are probably caused by lack of diet diversity
rather than general food insecurity. These issues are discussed in further detail in Annex 2
(Nutrition Notes).


          1.2 Guyana’s educational system

Guyana’s post-independence educational development included the expansion of access to
education from the pre-primary to the university level. However, many factors militated against
the Government’s achieving the goal of providing quality education to all of its citizens. The
topography of Guyana and the remote location of segments of the population in the hinterland
regions created a major challenge for good quality service delivery. Children from many of the
most remote communities travel for up to two hours by boat or a combination of land and river to
reach their schools.

Most of the larger educational institutions are found on the populous coastland, thus requiring
greater budgetary allocations. This resulted in the educational service offered on the coastland

    Many Amerindian communities are now communities of mixed ethnicities.


                                                                                                5
being of a higher quality than that offered in the interior (hinterland). The Ministry of Education,
with the assistance of bilateral and multilateral agencies, has attempted to grapple with the issue
of providing equitable and quality education to all, as is articulated in its Education Strategic
Plan, 2008-2013.

Primary school, where attendance is compulsory, provides six years of education (Grades 1 – 6).
Academic performance at the primary school level is assessed in Grades 2, 4 and 6. Performance
at the Grade 6 level (with a small contribution from the Grade 4 assessment) determines which,
if any, secondary school the child is to attend.


2   Education for All – Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI): Program description

Guyana was one of the first of seven countries to apply for funding from the Education for All
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) 2. Their proposal for covering the period 2003 to 2015 was
endorsed by the donor partnership in November 2002 and awarded US$12.0 million in 2004 to
cover the first three years of implementation. The aim of the funds is to assist the government in
its effort to reach the EFA-FTI goals for primary education by 2015. This first allocation of
funding helped to design, launch and maintain the community-based school feeding program
which is a sub-component within Guyana’s overall EFA-FTI program. In 2008, upon successful
execution and progress, Guyana’s EFA-FTI program was re-endorsed and received funding for
another three years for a total amount of US$32.5 million.


         2.1 Program rationale and components

Guyana’s EFA-FTI program encompasses three initiatives:

    •    Initiative I - Improving the Quality of the Teaching Force in the Hinterland;

    •    Initiative II – Enhancing the Teaching/Learning Environment in Primary Schools; and

    •    Initiative III – Strengthening School and Community Partnerships.

These three main initiatives are consistent with Guyana’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS),
the National Development Strategy, the Education Strategy Development Plan and the EFA-FTI
goals for primary education, all of which seek to achieve quality education and produce a literate
and numerate society.

Guyana’s Hinterland Community-Based School Feeding Program (SFP) is a key sub- initiative
of Initiative III. The objectives of the SFP include building more community participation in
schools, and improving school attendance, school performance and the nutritional status of
primary school children in Region Nos. 1, 7, 8 and 9. Implementation of Guyana’s SFP for these

known as the Global Partnership for Education (GPE).

four hinterland regions began in 2007. In order to participate in the program, schools and their
communities are required to submit project proposals, undergo training in basic bookkeeping,
food hygiene and good food handling practices, basic nutrition and nutritious meal preparation.
Communities that prepare their own meals on premises are also required to ensure that school
kitchens meet the requirements and guidelines of the Ministry of Health, passing certifications
and providing a safe and adequate water supply.


       2.2 The impact evaluation of the community-based school feeding program

In 2007, the Ministry of Education, with funding and technical assistance from the World Bank,
began the impact evaluation of the SFP in Regions 1 and 7. The first survey round covering 64
schools was conducted in June 2007, the second in May / June 2008 and the third and final round
in May / June 2009. At the start of the evaluation, five schools had started school feeding, but no
more than a month before data collection for the first survey round. By Round 3, nineteen
schools were providing school meals in the two regions.

This report presents the final results of the three surveys (2007, 2008, and 2009) of the impact
evaluation of the SFP in hinterland areas. Additional details of the impact evaluation methods
are presented in Annex 4.

Given the evaluation design and they way in which the SFP was structured, full randomization
for the allocation of the SFP to treatment and control groups was not achieved. Treatment and
control groups arose largely from a process of self-selection. Preparatory activities of the SFP
comprised three phases of activities prior to the provision of grants to establish community-run
kitchens in schools.

The first phase included a promotion campaign and awareness-raising sessions with parents,
teachers, village councils, and other members of communities. Overall this phase enjoyed high
levels of participation from school and community members. During phase 2, training was
provided to elaborate a proposal to request grants in order to create the conditions for food
preparation, agricultural production, financial management and administration of the school
feeding program. A standard template for proposals was developed by the EFA-FTI team which
was used during the training to allow communities to become familiar with the contents and
structure their proposals with ease. The sessions were carried out with school representatives and
community members interested in implementing the SFP in their communities. This phase was
very important because it led to the production of a quality proposal to access funding for the
provision of school meals. In parallel, phase 3 included a certification of cooks and the facilities
essential to launch the program. Without certification, the SFP could not start.

While the process through which schools and communities were enabled to submit proposals
was open and on a rolling basis, it could have created selectivity into the comparison groups.
This selectivity biases impact estimators. In particular, because phase 2 involves schools’
proposal submission as a prerequisite to the time when a school enters into the program, it may
result in better organized schools entering more rapidly while less organized schools take longer
to reach approval and ultimately the grant. Thus, school and community characteristics play a



                                                                                                  7
role in the timing of program entry. Intuitively, the characteristics that may affect this sample
selection have to do with observed and unobserved attributes of the schools and communities, as
well as regional and sub-regional characteristics. Thus, it was essential to incorporate the sample
selection bias correction in the regression analyses. An aspect that also may bias results relates to
the student’s absence when the survey was applied. If this aspect modified the sample
substantially it will bias impacts particularly in the educational performance outcomes (e.g.
students did not report their scores).


       2.3 Context and Locations of treatment and control schools

The surveys conducted to evaluate the community-based school feeding program were applied in
Regions 1 and 7 in Guyana. Barima-Waini (Region 1) is located in the northwest of the country.
It covers an area of 20,339 km² with a population of around 26,000 inhabitants in 2007. It
borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the region of Pomeroon-Supenaam to the east, the region
of Cuyuni-Mazaruni to the south and Venezuela to the west. Major settlements include the
regional capital Mabaruma, Port Kaituma, Matthew's Ridge, Morawhanna, Towakaima, Koriabo,
Hosororo, Arakaka and Moruca. Barima and Waini are the two main rivers that flow through the
densely forested and sparsely populated region.

Region 1 is ethnically diverse and has a low population density. The region is predominantly
forested highland, bordered at the north by a narrow strip of low coastal plain. Both the region’s
two main rivers impede transportation access so many households depend upon subsistence
agriculture. Many schools do not have electricity, and lack of other social facilities, which
combined with the high cost of living, makes education inaccessible for many children. Other
than agriculture, Region 1 communities are engaged in fishing, mining and logging activities.

Region 7 is Cuyuni-Mazaruni which borders the Barima-Waini, Essequibo Islands-West
Demerara and Pomeroon-Supenaam to the north, the region of Upper Demerara-Berbice to the
east, the region of Potaro-Siparuni and Brazil to the south and Venezuela to the west. Its capital
is Bartica. Other major settlements include Issano, Isseneru, Kartuni, Peters Mine, Arimu Mine,
Kamarang, Keweigek, Imbaimadai, Tumereng and Kamikusa. Region 7 covers an area of 47,213
km² with a population of almost 18,000 people according to the last estimates of the Statistics
Bureau in 2007.

Region 7 is also ethnically diverse and has the lowest population density in the country. The
population in this area consists mainly of Amerindians and Coastlanders who work as miners,
and Government employees (public servants). The Regional Administration's main office is at
Bartica and a subsidiary office is located in Kamarang in the Upper Mazaruni. The inhabitants of
Region 7 villages are engaged in subsistence agriculture, mainly ground provisions, cassava and
peanuts. In addition to agriculture, many communities are engaged in logging and mining and,
to a lesser extent, fishing.

The distribution of agricultural intensity of subsistence farming in Regions 1and 7 is shown in
Maps 1 and 2. Region 1 has high agricultural intensity in its northeastern sub-regions. The
southern sub-regions have lower agricultural intensity owing to facilitation of trade and



                                                                                                   8
households’ engagement in the home-based manufacture of non-agricultural products. In Region
7 employment in agriculture is highest in Bartica (its capital) located in the far east of the region
and in the Kamarang district, predominantly of seasonal crops and rotational agriculture of
tropical fruits and grains.

The agricultural intensity profile of Regions 1 and 7 is important to the communities’ ability to
organize the SFP around local producers, so that a low-cost supply of food can be guaranteed to
the schools’ kitchens.

Regions 1 and 7 are characterized by high poverty levels as shown in Figure 1. Although regions
1 and 7 contain only 2.8 and 2.2 percent of the country’s population respectively, more than half
of their populations are below the poverty threshold. Both regions also have a large proportion
of children who do not attend school or attend irregularly or who leave school with an
incomplete education 3. Low rates of access to education have reinforced the vicious circle of
poverty in the last years, particularly in regions 1, 7, 8 and 9. The SFP provides poor households
in remote rural areas with an incentive to send their children to school and save the cost of a
daily meal, which in some cases represents a considerable proportion of disposable income.

Seventeen of the sixty-four schools participating in the impact evaluation are in Region 7, and
the rest are in Region 1. The 21 schools that had started providing school meals by Round 3 are
designated treatment schools, while the rest served as the control or comparison group. Further
details of the treatment and control groups are given in Section 3.3. The full list of schools is
provided in Annex 1. Map 3 shows the locations of the treatment and control schools in Region
1. For each treatment school there are two to four control schools in each cluster. The location of
the treatment group is located in the eastern and northern sub-regions, which are characterized by
high agricultural intensities.

Map 4 shows the location of the treatment and control groups in region 7. Region 7 has a lower
population density than Region 1 and high dispersion of its communities across the whole
region. The central part of Region 7 has very few communities so all treatment and control
schools are located in the east (Bartica) and in the west.
Although Region 7 has far fewer schools than Region 1, Region 7 has demographic, social and
economic indicators representative of Guyana’s hinterland regions. The geographic distribution
of schools in treatment and control schools is fairly even in both regions. Nevertheless, the
sample of schools in Region 1 was distributed over a wider range of geographical coverage than
Region 7 in order to gain statistical representativeness.


3   Methodology


       3.1 Study design

All state primary schools in Regions 1 and 7 that had not started providing school meals by the
start of the third term of the 2006 – 2007 school year were included in the impact evaluation.
These 64 schools were assigned to treatment and comparison groups according to whether they
had or had not started school feeding by the end of the second term of the 2008 – 2009 school
year. Some schools had only single-grade classes, others only multi-grade classes, and the
remainder had a mix of single and multi-grade classes.

Three survey rounds were conducted, during May and June of 2007, 2008 and 2009. In Round 1
(baseline), information was gathered on Grades 2, 3 and 4; in Round 2, on grades 2, 3, 4 and 5;
and in Round 3 on grades 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. A grade was added each year to enable the impact
evaluation to follow and include the original students as they progressed to the next grade level.
These students made up the longitudinal group. The impact evaluation design did not entail a
randomized assignment of treatment and control groups, for reasons elaborated in Section 2.2.
As a result of the self-selection process, some characteristics at baseline for control and treatment
groups were dissimilar (see section 4.1). The impact analysis tried to correct for selectivity in the
treatment and control group assignment, but selectivity cannot be addressed fully using
correction techniques.

Table 1 shows control and treatment school enrollment and dates of entry into the SFP. The dates
of entry of schools vary depending upon the submission of proposal and completion of training
phases to obtain certification for the start of school feeding. Surveys were stratified in six
clusters to gain internal validity. Representativeness was achieved at the regional level.

         3.2 Survey instruments

Five questionnaires were used in the surveys:

Head teacher questionnaire: collected information on the school, on parental participation in
school-related activities, and on the head teachers themselves, including their academic and
professional qualifications, and their views on the impact of school feeding on student attendance
and behavior. School-level average attendance was added in later.

Class teacher questionnaire: were completed by class teachers of the grades covered in each
survey round, these questionnaires gathered information on grades taught and the numbers
enrolled in each grade, numbers of repeaters, the teacher’s academic and professional
qualifications, and their views on the impact of school feeding on student attendance and
behavior.

Class observation: conducted in each participating grade by the enumerators, these recorded
classroom conditions (state of desks, number of books), numbers of students present, subjects
taught, methods of teaching, signs of participation in class activities, and signs of disconnect
from class activities.




                                                                                                                       15
Parent questionnaire: administered to up to ten parents per school by the enumerators, to gather
information on the household’s socio-economic and demographic data, on participation in
school-related activities, access to services and amenities, access to schools (distance and mode
of travel), and frequency of consumption of specific food groups.

Student data form: used to record the student’s date of birth, attendance, weight and height,
family literacy and composition, access to schools (distance and mode of travel), selected
household possessions, and breakfast consumption. National assessment scores were added later
as they became available from the Ministry of Education. Student data forms were completed
for all students present on the survey day in one class of each grade covered in survey rounds.

Minor adjustments and additions were made to the questionnaires after Rounds 1 and 2.


       3.3 Training and fieldwork

Enumerators from Regions 1 and 7 were trained prior to each survey round. The training took the
form of presentations by training officers, demonstrations, role playing and question and answer
sessions. Role play was used to practice the administration of the parent questionnaire. The
measurements of weight and height were practiced at local primary schools, and a
standardization exercise was conducted to identify weak measurers. Topics covered included:

   •   Purpose of the exercise
   •   How to conduct an interview / meeting
   •   Weighing and measuring children.
   •   Correct use and care of the equipment
   •   How to complete the questionnaires
   •   How to conduct focus groups
   •   Logistics and fieldwork instructions.

Fieldwork was carried out by the trained enumerators during a period of four to five weeks in the
third term of each school year. In addition to administering questionnaires, weighing and
measuring children, observing classes and arranging for the completion of head teacher and class
teacher questionnaires, enumerators conducted focus group discussions in each community in
which the school was located.


       3.4 Data management and analysis

Data were coded, and then entered into computer files by trained data entry clerks using EpiInfo
6. A system of duplicate data entry followed by validation of the two entries and corrections
where necessary was employed. National assessment scores (NAS) were entered later, when
these were available.

After data entry, validation and correction, epidemiological and nutrition indicators were
calculated in EpiInfo. EpiInfo and SPSS-Macro use the new WHO reference standards which is


                                                                                              16
  needed to calculate the nutrition indicators, height for age and body mass index (BMI) for age
  (see Annex 2, Nutrition Notes).

  Basic analyses were done using SPSS v12.0. An initial frequency was run prior to further
  analysis. Data analysis involved simple frequencies and distribution statistics, and bivariate
  analyses (chi square tests, t-tests, analysis of variance and linear correlation). A p value less than
  0.05 was used to define statistical significance. More elaborate regression analyses were carried
  out using STATA v10. Details of these analyses are given in Annex 4.


           3.5 The samples

  Table 2 gives the number of schools and students included in treatment and comparison groups

4    Descriptive Statistics and Impact Estimation

Section 4.0 begins by qualitatively and quantitatively describing the data gathered, by survey
round and by group (treatment and control), as appropriate (Sections 4.1 and 4.2) cross-examines
comparison group composition and outcomes at the individual and community level,
respectively. Section 4.3 concludes by presenting the results of the impact analysis, summarizing
the results obtained with different estimation methods.

Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual (logic) framework for the school feeding program. This
section addresses the following questions:

         •   Has the hinterland school feeding program had a positive impact on students’
             attendance, nutritional status, classroom behavior and school performance?

         •   Has the program encouraged parental participation in school activities?

         •   Has the program improved diets of children and household members?

         •   Has the program provided a safety net against food price increases?

        4.1 Outcomes: The students


        4.1.1    School attendance

School attendance is an important outcome indicator to assess the impact of a school feeding
program. We obtained both school-level and individual-level attendance data. We also asked
head teachers and class teachers whether they had noticed any change in attendance since school
feeding had started (Table 4). Most respondents agreed that school feeding was associated with
increased attendance, although head teachers in Round 3 had a relatively lower rate of positive
perception 4.

Figure 3 shows mean school-level attendance by treatment and control groups for each school
year covered by the impact evaluation. Between round 1 and round 3 (school years 2006-07 and
2008-09) mean attendance fell marginally in the control groups, but rose in the treatment
schools. Figure 3 illustrates the school-level differences between comparison groups in
attendance rates, which can certainly bias the impact estimators. However, both groups show
similar trends.

  One possible explanation may be due to unawareness of SFPs presence in schools by new or incoming head
teachers that began to work by the time round 3 was conducted.

Table 5 provides information on individual-level attendance by survey round and by group. At
baseline, full attendance (all days) is fairly similar and the difference between the comparison
groups widens as time progresses. In addition, low attendance rates (<50%) between comparison
groups is quite similar at baseline. Given that low attendance rates are relatively large and affect
comparison groups unevenly, the impacts could by biased by selectivity in the sample of
children. This issue is addressed in Section 4.3.

Figure 4 illustrates the percent of the sample with high attendance in the two weeks preceding
the survey, for Rounds 1 and 3, by treatment and control groups. The figure shows that while the
percent fell slightly for the control group, it rose sharply in the treatment group. This change in
the sample of students reinforces the point that selectivity can become an issue when estimating
impacts.

Figure 5 is a flow chart describing the individual-level absence data collected for the survey day
and the two weeks preceding the survey day, in Round 3. Table 6 gives the reasons for absence
in Rounds 2 and 3 for the two weeks preceding the survey day. In both rounds around 20 percent
of students were kept at home to provide labor for the family: housework, farm work or child
care. In Round 2, 72 children (3.7%) were absent for economic reasons (no food, no money, no
uniform, no stationery). The figure rose to 127 (6.6%) in Round 3. All children except one who
stated they were absent because of lack of food in Round 3 were from the control schools where
no lunch was provided. Because the survey did not capture child employment and detailed
information about reasons for absence it is not possible to control for the bias with observed
characteristics.

             4.1.2     Students’ nutritional status

    It is well-accepted that poor linear growth (stunting) can be the result of a number of factors,
    largely related to the environment, socioeconomic factors and education. Nutrition, infections
    and mother-infant interactions have been cited as ‘environment’ factors having the greatest
    influence on child’s growth (Waterlow & Schürch, 1994). Other authors (Martorell et al, 1988)
    highlight the link between stature and poverty. In the context of nutrition, poor stature is
    associated with diets of poor quality, namely that are deficient or marginal in micronutrients or


                                                                                                       23
protein rather than in energy. Specific micronutrients mentioned in various studies include zinc,
calcium and vitamin A, but there may be others that have not yet been studied. Skoufias et al.
(2009) estimated income elasticities in rural Mexico for a variety of macro- and micro-nutrients,
showing positive elasticities for vitamins (A,C) and calcium. The authors used fixed-effects and
instrumental variables to correct from biases resulting from measurement errors associated to the
outcome variable.

While breastfeeding practices and mother-infant interactions are generally excellent in
Amerindian communities in Guyana, diets are often monotonous and low in vegetables, dairy
products, proteins, legumes and fruits. A study conducted in Regions 8 and 9 compared the
stature of children of two tribes: the Wapishana in Region 9 and the Patamona in Region 8
(Dangour, 2001). The Wapishana villagers were substantially wealthier and had access to a
more diverse diet than the Patamona villagers, who lived in relatively remote areas. The study
found that Wapishana children were on average more than 3 cm taller than their Patamona
counterparts.

The descriptive statistics on stunting and wasting indicators based on Guyana’s Community-
Based School Feeding Program surveys reiterate findings of earlier studies: high levels of
stunting and a low prevalence of wasting (less than 3%). The results show that even at baseline,
the prevalence of stunting (height-for-age less than -2 z-scores) was slightly higher in control
schools (20%) than in intervention schools (17%). By the third round of the evaluation (2009),
the prevalence of stunting had fallen by nearly three percentage points among intervention
children, and risen by more than three percentage points among the children attending control
schools. The differences in the prevalence of stunting between the two groups had thus risen
from four percentage points in 2007 to ten in 2009. Table 7a highlights differences between
coastal and hinterland regions in key health and nutrition indicators.

Table 7, and Figures 6 and 7 show the information on one of the key outcome indicators, the
students’ nutritional status. Annex 3 provides a brief discussion of these indicators and the
relevant cutoffs used to estimate the impacts on children at risk.

In Amerindian communities stunting levels are high. If data on ethnicity had been gathered on
SFP’s surveys, we would have seen even higher levels of stunting among children of Amerindian
descent, when compared to the non-Amerindian children living in these communities. Thus, for

          example, Guyana’s Basic Nutrition Program found a prevalence of almost 31 percent of stunting
          among Amerindian children aged 12 – 24 months and 12 percent among children of other
          ethnicities living in Amerindian communities. 5 A study of nursery school children reported a
          prevalence of 26.6 percent stunting among Amerindian children aged 4 – 6 years. 6

          Table 7 and Figure 6 show that even at Round 1, stunting was a much greater problem among
          students attending the control schools: 20.9 percent were stunted or severely stunted in the
          control group, as compared to 14 percent in the treatment schools. There are three possible
          explanations for this finding: either treatment schools were in more organized communities with
          better economic conditions (selectivity), or treatment schools had a higher proportion of non-
          Amerindian children, or a mixture of both situations.

The difference between control and treatment schools in relation to stunting continued in rounds
2 and 3. However, Figure 6 shows that while the mean height-for-age fell slightly for children
attending control schools, it rose among children attending treatment schools. Figure 7
illustrates the differences of the school feeding on children who were stunted or severely stunted
at Round 1. As found in all other studies (see footnotes 3 and 4), the prevalence of wasting in
Amerindian communities is lower than in the coastal communities of Guyana.


       4.1.3   Students’ academic performance

Guyana’s Ministry of Education assesses school performance of children in Grades 2, 4 and 6.
In Grades 2 and 4, mathematics, English and Reading are the assessed subjects, and for Grade 6,
Mathematics, English, Science and Social studies are assessed. These National Assessment


                                                                                                                                               26
Scores (expressed as percentages) are presented in Tables 8 and 9. Figure 8 shows results for
Grades 2 and 4 by group, for survey rounds 1 and 3.

Looking at significant differences in the descriptive statistics (average scores) between treatment
and control groups in the three survey rounds, we find the following:

       •   Mathematics: no significant differences between groups in any grade or survey
           round;
       •   English: no significant differences at either baseline (Round 1) or Round 2, but the
           treatment schools perform significantly better at round 3 in all grades;
       •   Reading: in Round 1, the control group performs better than the treatment group for
           grade 4, but there is no significant difference in the performance of grade 2 children.
           In Round 2 there are no significant differences in either grade, but by round 3,
           performance is significantly better in both grades among children of the treatment
           schools;
       •   Science: no significant differences between groups;
       •   Social studies: the treatment school children perform better than the control school
           children.

In short, it would appear from these basic analyses that while virtually no differences between
the treatment and control groups existed at Round 1 (except for Grade 4 reading when the control
group did better), by Round 3 the treatment group is performing better than the control group in
English, reading and social studies. The impact of SFP on educational attainment outcomes
(subject scores) used matching to balance individual and household characteristics between
comparison groups in order to explore causality. The results in section 4.3.4 are only estimated
for the Average Treatment Effect of the matched groups, so that generalized impact results
cannot be drawn from this exercise.

         4.1.4    How students behave

Both head teachers and class teachers of schools where school meals were offered were asked if
they had noted any change in the behavior of the students (Table 10). 7 While the majority
responded that behavior did change, the proportion of head teachers giving this response was
highest in Round 1 while the proportion of class teachers was highest in Round 3.

Details of classes observed by the enumerators are provided in Annex 5: grades observed,
subjects taught and methods of teaching used (Table A5-3), the state of the desks, number of
books, class enrolment and number of students present (Table A5-4).

A primary objective of the class observation exercise was to record the numbers of children who
demonstrated signs of active participation in classroom activities, and the numbers of students
who showed visible signs of disconnect with these activities. The results of this exercise are
presented in Table 11. Since improved class participation is a key outcome indicator for the
impact of school feeding, results are separated by treatment and comparison groups for each
round.

Participation and disconnect scores were calculated for each observed class using the percentage
of children in class who showed the sign, then calculating the mean disconnect and participation
scores for classes in treatment and control schools. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate these findings.
Figure 9 shows that, while the mean participation score for treatment schools was lower than that
for control schools in Round 1, by Round 3, treatment schools had substantially higher mean
scores. The reverse is seen in Figure 10 for disconnect scores: in control schools, the mean fell
marginally from 5.3 to 4.7, the fall in treatment schools was substantially greater, from 6.8 to
2.1.

 For the teachers’ survey, they reported meals that were not necessarily offered exclusively through the Ministry of
Education’s EFA – FTI Program. In some cases, other meals could have been provided by NGOs or religious
organizations as well.

          4.2 Outcomes: The communities


          4.2.1    Parental participation in school activities

 To establish and sustain a successful school feeding program, the EFA-FTI requires active
 participation by the community. In preparation, community members are asked to submit a
 proposal, undertake training, and raise funds and provide labor for the building of the school
 kitchen. Once the provision of meals starts, community farmers are required to provide
 commodities for the meals; local cooks provide nutritious meals; and an active committee
 member manages the program.

 In the head teachers’ questionnaire, the head teacher was asked to state whether parents assisted
 with specific school feeding activities, if the school had a school feeding program. The
 responses indicated a very high degree of involvement: nearly 80 percent of head teachers said
 that parents helped with cooking, cleaning and serving, 30 percent said parents helped to provide
 foods, and nearly 60 percent that they helped to raise funds.

 The surveys asked parents to assess their own level of involvement in school feeding-related
 activities, and head teachers to assess parents’ involvement in such activities. The results are
 given in Table 12. While there are differences in head teachers’ and parents’ perceptions, in all
 survey rounds, more responses from treatment school parents and head teachers indicated a high
 level of involvement in fund raising and school feeding activities than those from control
 schools. It should be noted that many control schools are actively preparing for the SFP, hence
 their positive responses to involvement in fund-raising and school-feeding activities.

       4.2.2   Safety net and price shocks


           4.2.2.1.    Food prices shocks and SFP as a safety net

SFPs around the world have been limited in finding benefits to better understand how they can
serve as a safety net mechanism for poor families, particularly when linking social protection,
consumption of nutritious foods (frequency and diversity) and uninterrupted education.

SFPs can provide and/or maintain diversity/balance in food consumption and micronutrients to
complement, and not compete, with other nutrition programs. Little has been explored about the
interrelation between food delivery modalities and SFPs effectiveness. At the local level, SFPs
may contribute to creating new markets for agricultural produce. Guyana’s SFP was
implemented in a period of unprecedented increases in food prices (2007 and 2008). This gives
the program a unique timing to be evaluated from a safety net perspective in the face of food
price shocks.

A meal for poor families can represent a safety net mechanism to counter adverse shocks in
prices and production of agricultural commodities. For instance, the food crises faced around the
globe produced average increases of 130 percent in commodity prices (de Hoyos and Lessen,
2008). Commodities such as corn, wheat, rice and soybeans rose by 190, 162, 318 and 246
percent respectively (Lustig, 2009). The value of transfer of in-school meals appears to fall in the
range of transfers common to other safety net programs.

Guyana is largely independent of agricultural imports: around 32 percent of its GDP depends on
agriculture and agricultural exports represent around 37 percent of export earnings (Ministry of
Agriculture, 2008). Since food represents a relatively large share of developing countries’
consumption baskets, inflationary pressures are common, with a negative impact on the living
standards of poor net consumers. In the hinterland areas of Guyana, the SFP provides incentives
to continuous local food production which can affect prices paid by poor households. In this
way, governments can use SFP safety nets to protect the poor from rising food prices. Such
broad school-based interventions may be even more effective in targeting the poor than food
subsidies or import restrictions to stabilize food prices.

Safety net programs implemented around the world can be arranged in four categories: Cash
Transfers, Food for Work, Food rations/stamps and School Feeding (see Figure 11). These
programs have been shown to prevent steep and sudden declines in poor people’s income in the
advent of economic crises and price shocks. According to Lustig (2009), 19 (out of 49) low-
income and 49 (out of 95) middle-income countries do not have safety net programs of any kind.
Given the characteristic of the adverse shock—i.e., an increase in the price of a basic good takes
up a substantial portion of a poor person’s budget—the most adequate safety net is to
compensate the affected population for their loss in purchasing power in cash or in kind.

In the absence of cash transfer programs, countries could resort to school feeding programs.
While they will not compensate the poor for the loss of purchasing power associated with higher



                                                                                                 34
food prices, school feeding programs can insulate (at least in part) children of poor households
from suffering a cut in their nutritious food intake.

Figure 11 shows how school feeding programs are widely prevalent among low and middle
income countries, compared to other safety net programs. Since vulnerable populations are most
affected by food price shocks, the presence of school feeding programs provide enormous non-
tangible benefits by i) investing early in the health and education of children, and ii) shielding
partially from economic shocks the disposable income of households, at least in the short-run.

In Guyana, Regions 1 and 7 are rural areas where many families depend on local agricultural
markets to preserve their purchase power on food consumption. Other adjacent regions within
Guyana contribute to meeting the agricultural and food needs of regions 1 and 7, but subsistence
farming is common. In Guyana, food deficit and dietary requirements rise and fall, respectively,
in the period where food prices increases took place (see Figure 12) 8.

Evidently, food price increases may have reduced the consumption capacity of poor households
on food products. As a consequence the food deficit among the population increased or, at least
remained constant. The food deficit can also be explained by income and substitution effects
(changes in relative prices and spending capacity on food products). Although Guyana has
improved substantially in terms of nutritional status of its population 9 the pace nutrition
improvements could have more rapid if dietary changes would have been more steady.

  Although production data in Guyana has several shortcomings, the FAO estimations based on Food Balance Sheets
provide an approximation of the diet trends in the country given the supply and demand side levels.

  According to FAO (2008) Guyana is one of the five countries in LAC that have relatively high rates of income
growth, and strong productivity in the agricultural sector (along with Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay). In
Guyana the proportion and numbers of undernourished decreased over the 1990s and 2000s. Incidentally, the
numbers and proportions undernourished are derived from statistics using the DES figures, and not on any food
consumption or nutrition surveys.

Generally speaking, if the percent of calories (dietary energy supply, DES) from fat in a country
rises (Figure 13), it means that people may be eating “more expensive” diets but not necessarily
more nutritious ones. Going along with this, based on the FAO Guyana country profile, the
percent of DES from carbohydrates decreases (from 76% to 70%). Apparently, this may
improve the nutritional balance of households. However, the marked shift over the past 20 years
to diets high in saturated fat, sugar and refined foods, trends in Guyana might pose a double
burden on households: to health and purchasing power. Over the long run, changing dietary
patterns and lifestyles - spurred by urbanization, the liberalization of markets, demographic shifts
and declining levels of physical activity - may contribute to overweight and chronic diseases,
along with nutrition deficits. In this way, school feeding programs have the objective of
preserving healthy diets among children and prevent this double burden that is present in
countries like India, Philippines, Mexico, South Africa, China and Egypt where both under- and
over-nutrition have seriously posed a significant burden in their health care systems (FAO,
2008).

Given that Guyana is a net food exporter, recent increases in food prices provide an incentive to
Guyana’s export market to expand supply, which could possibly shrink local supply. This local
scarcity can in turn increase prices. A reduction in purchasing power of the rural poor population
takes place. This leads to an increase in the internal demand for substitute food groups (see
Graph 13).

An increase in food prices can not only harm the diet and nutritional intake of poor households, it
can also reduce spending capacity which can bring a household to below the poverty threshold.
To measure the price shock transmission to household poverty, price change simulations in
treatment and control areas were estimated based on food consumption (see Annex 4). With
price and consumption differences, the SFP safety net contribution to preventing households and
individuals to falling below the poverty threshold can be estimated. If an SFPs is seen as a
transfer program with specific safety net mechanisms towards poor households (Alderman,
2009), then not only education and health outcomes need to be assessed but also more general
welfare effects should be explored. When comparing school meals to transfer programs then cost
per meal compared to alternatives including take home rations and snacks are relevant. The main
advantages of Guyana’s SFP compared to the general experience of other SFP around the world
are adequacy, equity, cost effectiveness and sustainability, which position it as a program with
high potential for welfare protection program conditioned to a national expansion.

Costs and Sustainability of the SFP Safety Net

The Guyana EFA-FTI SFP has also financial returns. Beyond the benefits of increasing school
enrollment, height of children, and providing a safety net mechanism to poor rural households,
the program shows financial viability. To illustrate the financial viability of the program it is
important to estimate the unit average costs and ratios as benchmarks for comparison with other
similar school feeding programs.

The program costs can be estimated using the costs per child, the fixed start up costs, and the
variable costs (see Annex 4 for cost details by schools). The recurrent cost is G$175 per school
day (approximately US$ 0.90 per child enrolled). This covers all running costs: food, cooks'
salaries, cooking fuel, water etc. The academic year comprises 192 schooldays. In addition, each
school receives a one-off start-up sum. This is equal to one-third the annual recurrent costs:
G$175 x 64 schooldays x number of children enrolled. With these costs we can estimate the
average costs per day per school. Also by using actual data on the costs absorbed by the
government of Guyana and the EFA-FTI funding it is possible to compare program expenditures
with other programs.

Table 14 shows the costs indicators for the Guyana SFP program and the Day Meal Program
(DMP) in India, which is co-financed by the government of India and the World Food Program
(WFP). Although the DMP has expanded substantially to cover 5,700 schools, it is arranged in
similar fashion to Guyana’s SFP operation.

The average SFP cost is around US$230 per school per day 10. The DMP has a lower average cost
per day of around US$193 11. However, the DMP expanded to 5,700 schools which allowed the
program to have economies of scale based on a large numbers of schools. This reduces
substantially the sunk costs to start the program, since they are averaged to the total number of
schools. Conversely, the SFP has a cost of $0.90 USD compared to the $1.14 USD that cost the
DMP per student per school-day. The Guyana SFP has lower costs than a large scale program in
India which sets it in a good benchmark against costs increases. The unit cost ratio between the
DMP and the SFP is 1.31 indicating that the SFP unit cost is 30 percent lower than the DMP.

The average cost per day per school shows a ratio of 0.84 between the DMP and the SFP, which
is partially a result of the large scale presence of the DMP program 12. Expansion not only can
bring benefits to a target population with reasonable program costs, it can also serve as means to
achieve a financially sustainable program that takes advantage local agricultural markets to
stimulate local/communities’ economies. As such, local purchase of food for school feeding is
seen as a multiplier, benefiting children and the local economy at the same time.


             4.2.2.2.      Household diets

Household diets vary considerably by ethnic group in Guyana. The diet of Amerindian
communities, especially the more remote/rural ones, often lacks diversity. A diet that is
monotonous risks being nutritionally unbalanced, and it is likely to be deficient in one or more
micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

In Amerindian communities, diets are low in vegetables, fruit, legumes and dairy products. The
reason is likely two-fold: on the one hand meat and/or fish and cassava are culturally the most
acceptable commodities, and on the other hand, vegetables, fruit, legumes and dairy products are
scarce and expensive.

A primary objective of the nutrition training provided as part of the hinterland school feeding
program is the promotion of nutritionally balanced diets with the increased consumption of
vegetables, fruits and legumes. This objective is linked to the promotion of community
development and participation: schools are encouraged to procure all commodities needed to
provide nutritious meals from local farmers, and farmers are encouraged to grow the products for
this guaranteed market, thereby increasing their incomes.

The impact evaluation surveys included a limited food frequency questionnaire as a sub-
component of the parents’ questionnaire. Parents were asked how often certain commodities had
been consumed in their households during the previous week. Table 15 shows the results of this
dietary assessment. 13 We also developed two scores: a food frequency score which is based on
the frequency of consumption of each item included in the food list (1 lowest, 21 highest), and a
diet diversity score which simply sums consumption/non-consumption of each food as 0/1
variables (1 lowest, 8 highest consumption), and takes no account of frequency of consumption.
The means of these scores by survey round and group are shown in Table 15 and are presented as
graphs in Figures 14 and 15.

   Foods included: meat of any kind, including poultry, seafood, legumes, milk, cheese, eggs, vegetables, fresh
fruits and juices. Specifically excluded were root vegetables, called ground provisions locally, which include the
staple cassava. This was not intended to be a full food frequency questionnaire which would have been too time
consuming to administer and would have required substantially more training.

The treatment group began at baseline with higher food frequency and diet diversity scores, in
line with the higher wealth indicators noted in Section 5.2. Food prices rose substantially in
Guyana in the period between rounds 1 and 2. Both the figures and the table show that while
food frequency and diet diversity fell between rounds 1 and 2, they fell more sharply in the
control group. By Round 3, the gap between the groups had increased substantially. These
findings suggest that the school feeding program was able to at least partially cushion the schools
in the treatment group against the increase in food prices.

Another way to look at this last point is to build food frequency ratios between treatment and
control areas. Figure 16 shows the ratios for 2007 through 2009 by food group categories. At
baseline the gap between comparison groups was relatively small for all food groups. During
2008 the ratios of all food groups increased, particularly for fruits and dairy products. This
means that the treatment areas kept the frequency of consumption relatively steady while the
control group areas reduced food consumption frequency, which in turn is manifested in larger
gaps between comparison groups.

Section 4.3 presents SFP impacts on diet diversity and food frequencies using regression
analysis. Food frequency and diet diversity scores are defined exactly as defined in this section.

           4.2.2.3.                                          Breakfast consumption

Consuming an adequate breakfast helps a child stay alert and to benefit more fully from the
education offered during the morning hours. We asked both parents and students in Rounds 2
and 3 about the kind of breakfast consumed by the student on the survey day. Table 16 shows
their responses.

In Sections 5.1.2 and 5.2.3 we note the facts that more than 30 percent of students with an
arduous travel to school each morning received at most a light breakfast, and that single parents
(especially fathers) were least likely to provide a full breakfast.

Table 16 shows that in rounds 2 and 3, students attending treatment schools were significantly
less likely to receive a full breakfast. This is potentially a serious concern. Are parents of
treatment schools withholding a full breakfast because they know the child will receive a
substantial lunch? If this is indeed the case, then the training offered by the school feeding
program needs to stress the importance of an adequate breakfast, even when a full lunch is to be
offered at noon.


         4.3 Impact analysis: What was the impact of the school feeding program?

Regression analysis can shed light on some of the impacts of SFPs on children and schools while
controlling for demographic, social and economic characteristics. In addition, the data collected
in three rounds is rich enough to even allow controlling for observed factors that may have
enhanced comparison group differences and sample selectivity. The regression analysis
considered the following outcome variables:

1)       Health Indicators: Stunting (height-for-age) and Wasting (BMI)
2)       School enrollment
3)       Attendance
4)       Educational attainment
5)       Household food consumption

The regression analysis cannot be limited to reporting on simple estimators. Because the groups
were not selected randomly and because SFP implementation was delayed in some schools, there
is sample selectivity in the treatment group, which may bias the estimates. To control for sample
selectivity a technique was used to correct bias in the SFP estimates (see Annex 4 for a detailed
description of the methodology).




                                                                                                    44
           4.3.1    Health Indicators

Stunting (height-for-age)

Stunting, measured by the height-for-age z-score (HAZ), is an important variable for the
program. It allows us to explore whether the program is actually supporting early childhood
development. The SFP will be highly effective if it can produce changes at this level,
independently of which subgroups (age, gender) concentrate the larger share of impacts. The
long term consequences of reducing stunting among children in Guyana’s hinterland regions will
produce better cognitive abilities of children and higher probabilities of completion rates of
primary school (Alderman, Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2006).

As mentioned before, selectivity in unobserved variables might be present between comparison
groups, given the baseline difference. In order to estimate the impacts and to highlight the
sensitivity of impact estimators, fixed effects and sample selection (2-stage) models were run.
Figure 17 shows the effects of SFP on height-for-age z-scores of children 14. There are two
important aspects to highlight. First, by not correcting for sample selectivity impacts are
overestimated. We expect a positive coefficient, which is the case, to infer that the SFP causes an
increase in z-score mean. Second, by separating the effects between girls and boys it is found
that the selectivity is predominant among girls, leading to a higher overestimation of SFP
impacts for girls rather than boys.

Figure 18 shows the differences in height for the children sample in 2007, 2008 and 2009. For
2008 and 2009 the mean height for children is fairly similar. However, for the baseline year
(2007) the height of children is higher for the treatment group than the control group. This
intuitively implies that girls selected in the treatment group at baseline were taller than control
group girls. Overall, girls included in the sample were taller at baseline that boys.

SFP impacts on the height-for-age scores are small but not negligible. The impacts are larger for
boys than girls. Overall, the mean impact coefficient of the SFP on HAZ is around 0.09. Because
the mean height of children is 1.26 meters in our sample, and because our HAZ score is
standardized to a normal distribution, the coefficient will be translated in a proportional shift to
one standard deviation. Because the standard deviation of children’s height is 8.7 centimeters,
the impact coefficient of 0.09 will imply on average an increase of 0.8 centimeters (8.7 cm x
0.09) of children that participate in SFP compared to children that do not participate in the
program. An increase in 0.8 centimeters in children’s height might be small, but the long term
consequences of such a height increase will be enormous in terms of human capital gains.

Subsample of Children at-risk of Stunting and Wasting

Annex 3 shows the cutoff points to define children at-risk of stunting based on height-for-age z-
scores. Based on these cut-off points, two models were run containing an interacted term
between the SFP dummy and the at-risk-of-stunting dummy (see Annex 4). The results of these
models with full controls show no significant impact of SFP for children at-risk of stunting, even
after using the PSM matched sample. Although it was shown that the average treatment effect is
small and statistically significant, the impacts for the vulnerable subgroup (at-risk children) are
not significant.

Wasting, on the other hand, showed a different story. The impacts were close to zero and
insignificant even after sample selection correction 15. Baseline characteristics were fairly similar
between treatment and control groups, but BMI’s composition is affected by the height
differences shown at baseline.

Nevertheless, the estimated models for at-risk children of wasting (Annex 4) show that SFP
increases the BMI from 1.07 (0.704/0.65 16) to 1.34 (0.874/0.65) standard deviations compared to
non-participants. The average treatment effect for the complete sample of children that reported
BMI was insignificant, but it was significant for the subgroup of children that are at higher risk
of wasting, according to the WHO cutoffs.

Enrollment at baseline was higher for control schools. More schools were incorporated in the
treatment group in 2008 and 2009 making the total number of children enrolled in treatment
schools higher than in control schools. The changes in enrollment can be confounding because
comparison groups were dissimilar at baseline. This is suggestive of sample selection in the
outcome variable and would lead to biased program impact estimates.

Figure 20 shows the differences in school enrollment estimated through a simple model. We
cannot infer if the program caused an increase in enrollment because simply the groups have
different enrollment levels at baseline and randomization was not achieved. The impacts might
be driven come from those intrinsic differences rather than from SFP participation. These
estimations can be carried out by modeling the proportion of enrollment present in each region
and the composition of girls and boys present in each school.

The impact estimators measure the increase in the number of enrolled children by the program 17.
With sample selection correction we can reduce the bias from the intrinsic enrollment differences
shown at baseline. Simple OLS estimates show that the SFP increases enrollment by 200
children; with the sample selection correction model there are only around 178 children enrolled
because of the SFP. The total increase in enrollment observed in the survey data equals 338
students. This means that around 53 percent of the observed change in enrollment between 2007
and 2009 could have been induced by the SFP 18.

  The differences in enrollment for the control group are the same between 2007 and 2009 from survey data and
from official data from the Ministry of Education. It is worth to mention that Enrollment data may have
measurement errors even from Administrative records from the Ministry of Education. The degree of the error is
unknown but can indeed bias estimates.

The predictions in enrollment by region are shown in Figure 20. These includes the estimations
of the mean enrollment after running the two models one with sample selection correction and
the other with simple fixed-effects regression. Selectivity is present predominantly in Region 1
and total enrollment had higher predicted values for Region 7. Primary enrollment in Region 1 is
higher than Region 7. A marginal increase in enrollment in Region 7 relative to Region 1 will be
better captured in the model because of the higher enrollment gap existing in Region 7 between
primary-age population and primary enrollment.

Figure 20a shows the model estimations in the number of students enrolled in SFP schools
compared to non-SFP schools. The overestimation of impacts, given by selectivity present in
SFP participation variable that affect the enrollment outcomes, was predominantly biased
towards girls in the predictions. This is because the program had a higher effect on increasing
girls’ enrollment. On average, the program creates 196 newly enrolled girls compared to an
average of 161 newly enrolled boys.

         4.3.3    Students’ attendance

As noted in Section 4.1.1, attendance rates show differences at baseline between treatment and
control groups. Again, self-selection is present and thus it is necessary to correct with an
econometric technique to reduce bias on impact estimates of SFP on attendance.

The impact coefficients for the fixed-effects model and the two-stage sample selection 19
correction are shown in Figure 21 (full regressions in Annex 4). A positive coefficient indicates
that children exposed to the program attend school more days on average. Treatment schools had
higher attendance rates than control schools at baseline (sample selection), but control schools
catch up with higher growth rates of attendance between 2007 and 2009. Both factors bias the
effects of the program.

The estimated impacts of SFP in attendance rates are reported in Figure 21, showing that SFP
increased average attendance by 4.3 percent between 2007 and 2009. With the selectivity
correction estimates it was found that underestimation of impacts was driven by boys. Boys
showed an increase in attendance of 6.7 percent compared to an increase in girls’ attendance of
1.6 percent using the 2 stage sample selection correction. Girls have higher attendance rates than
boys and non-reported attendance was primarily skewed towards boys. Boys often contribute
with labor at early ages to enhance household incomes, so the economic incentive of the SFP
within beneficiary households might be reflected in these findings.




19
  The influence of self-selection effects must be assessed in order to accurately interpret outcome data. The analysis
then should directly model the process of entry into a program and incorporating information on the factors affecting
self-selection into estimation of program effects. The two-stage sample selection models are designed to address
such situations.

Assessments in grades 2, 4 and 6. In this case, the issue of non-random selection of comparison
groups can be corrected using propensity score matching on students’ characteristics 20.

For grade 6 there are two additional subjects tested: science and social sciences. However, the
scores of 6 graders were only collected in the third round so it is not possible to draw conclusions
of SFP impacts without baseline data 21. As shown in section 4.1.3 the education performance
outcomes of students show ambiguous results in terms of the simple average differences between
2007 and 2009 (Table 8). The causal impact of the program can be measured only if the
comparison groups can be matched to student characteristics are similar and preserve fairly
similar scores for the matched subsample of treatment and control groups. Sample selection
correction is not enough since the scores of students can be modeled to gain comparability of
students in terms of educational outcomes. In this case, it provides better statistical justification
to perform matching methods to explain the existence of any difference in the educational
outcomes induced by the SFP. The techniques available for matching will only allow the
identification of Average Treatment on the Treated (ATT) effects 22.

To verify the importance of estimate educational performance impacts using Propensity Score
Matching (PSM) method (see Annex 4), given that scores are observed, table 17a shows the
effects estimated using standard fixed effects and sample selection correction (unobserved
attributes explaining treatment and control allocation). In the case of Science and Social Studies
(only for 6th graders) there is indeed an impact of the program. The main issue with these
estimations, as previously noted, is that it is possible to increase the accuracy of the estimations
by matching students with similar characteristics and scores into the treatment and control
groups. In the cases of the English, Math and Reading PSM estimates cannot be compared to the
F.E. and SSC models given that the coefficients for both methods are statistically insignificant
and the source of bias unobserved.




20
   All estimates using with sample selection correction, showed no significant impacts in Reading, English and
Mathematics for grades 2 and 4.
21
   However, the data will be useful to evaluate educational outcomes in future survey rounds.

The PSM common support distribution is shown in Figure 21a. The balancing of both groups
with the characteristics and the performance scores make both distributions fairly similar. This
depicts the level of comparability gained by estimating the scores for each block of
characteristics. All other observations where there cannot be a match are dropped from the PSM
estimation. However, the number of observations that remained after the PSM was enough to
proceed to the next stage of the estimations 23. Table 17b shows the PSM ATT results with the
kernel matching. The estimators are expressed in percent increase (decrease) from the average
scores. English and Math scores show statistically significant increases of scores: 28.5 and 29.8
percent, respectively. Reading and Science scores showed statistically significant increases and
close to zero. The Social Studies scores increased marginally and statistically significant, with an
ample confidence interval which makes the results less robust that Math and English scores. This
may be due to the fact that Social Sciences is only evaluated for 6th graders, while English and
Math scores are measured for a larger sample of individuals: 2nd, 4th, and 6th graders.

Performing simple propensity score matching estimators to assess impacts at the educational
attainment level increased the accuracy of the estimates. The small coefficients shown with the
conventional econometric estimations could be explained by confounding factors that played a

         4.3.5    Households’ food consumption and Food Price Volatility Impacts

The parent’s survey has important information regarding the diet diversity and food frequency of
households. With this information regressions were estimated to explore if SFP participation
enhances the diet diversity and food frequency scores 24. In principle, because the parent surveys
were drawn randomly from the sample of eligible schools (treatment and control) we would not
expect to find significant bias from sample selectivity. However, both simple regression and
sample selection correction regressions are reported (see Annex 4).

The food frequency score has a mean in 2008 of 7.3 and rose to 7.9 in 2009. A higher food
frequency score implies that the household consumed more food products rich in nutrients at a
higher frequency on average per week. Figure 22 shows the impact coefficients from sample
selection correction regressions 25. The food frequency score is the outcome variable 26. The
coefficients show that compared to 2007 SFP increased the food frequency score on average 2.2
points in 2008 and 1.3 in 2009. The standard deviations from the food frequency scores for 2008
and 2009 are fairly similar, 3.7 and 3.8 respectively.

   Food frequency is recoded as 0 or 1, where 1= consumption frequency in last week of at least 2-3 times. The
frequency is summed by food group to build the diversity score. The food frequency ranges from 0 to 25 (being 25
the highest frequency) and the diversity score ranges from 1 to 8, being 8 the highest diversity in consumption of
different food groups (protein, vegetables, etc.).

of household access to services and human capital. Having a household with electricity or water
access increases the food frequency index by an average of 1.1. Similarly, the education level of
the head of household also increases the food frequency scores. High frequency of consumption
of nutritious food products enables a nutritionally balanced dietary intake which produces long
term health and education benefits, particularly to children at early ages.

Figure 23 shows the predictions of the food frequency scores from the regressions and food
frequencies by food group. Overall, after controlling for socio-demographics and other
characteristics, the predicted scores are higher for the SFP group compared to non-SFP.
Regardless of the number of children in each household, SFP is an important contributor in
keeping higher food consumption frequencies, thus preserving adequate child nutrition.

Another important outcome is diet diversity. Using the diet diversity score (defined in section
4.2.2.2.) it is possible to qualitatively assess how the diversity score changes based on household
characteristics. This is important because school feeding programs are considered important


                                                                                                                                                                                                                           56
safety nets whereby households alleviate food consumption pressure that rises from adverse
economic and social conditions. We computed box plots of the diversity scores with three
variables (Figure 24).

The first variable is SFP participation which shows higher average diversity scores than non-SFP
participants. The second variable is employment status of the head of household. 27 This is
relevant because when the head of household is not fully employed there are consumption
restraints, particularly on food. The third variable included is “family type”: whether the
household is composed of a single parent, both parents, or is an extended family. More strain in
consumption would be present in single parent households (which generally have a single source
of income at best). Extended family households can present a mixed picture, depending on how
many adults are employed and how many family members are supported by the household’s
income.

First it is important to note in Figure 24 that households without the SFP have the lowest mean
diversity scores and higher variability in these scores, regardless of the employment status of the
head of the household (Figures 24a and 24c). Households with SFP show higher diversity scores,
again regardless of the employment status of the head of the household (Figures 24b and 24d). In
this way, the SFP acts as a mechanism to keep diet diversity high and relatively equal among
families that have higher propensity of consumption restraints. The lowest food diversity scores
with relatively large variability are seen when children in the household do not have SFP, and
when the household is an extended family. This combination represents the worst case for
children because they do not have access to a safety net and the household structure increases the
likelihood of restraining food consumption diversity. On the other hand, families where the head
of household works and children have access to SFP have higher levels of the food diversity
scores in all types of family structure (single parent, both parents, extended family28), but are
especially high among extended families.

But these types of households show higher variability in the scores compared to those
households where head does not work and children have access to SFP. If the head of household
is partially or totally unemployed, household income is very low. Moreover, unless the
employed household head is a single parent, the care of the kids is generally the responsibility of
the mother, who is very often a housewife or only partially employed (Table 17c). Both
frequency of food consumption and diet diversity are important indicators to evaluate SFPs from
a social safety net standpoint. School feeding programs are often used for social protection
purposes as much as or more than for education goals.




27
   The questionnaire asked simply if the household head was fully employed. If the answer was no, the s/he could
be either partially employed or unemployed. The former is the more likely scenario.
28
   Extended families can mean more incomes – it all depends on the child to adult ratios, but most of the time more
adult members in the households tend to disproportionally consume more, leaving lower levels of disposable
income.

Figure 25 shows the results of the simulations of price shocks on the consumption of four food
categories between treatment and control groups. On average, in control group areas there was a
reduction of food consumption worth GY$2,000 per household per month in protein food
groups, compared to treatment areas. Fruits and vegetables food groups averaged shocks in
consumption are worth GY$1,700 and GY$2,300 respectively.

On average, before the food prices shocks a household in control areas consumed US$2.4 less
per month (all food categories) compared to treatment areas. With the food price increase from
mid-2007 to the beginning of 2009, control areas consumed US$9 less per month worth of food
compared to treatment areas. The SFP shielding mechanism in preserving the diet balance and
the purchasing power of nutritious food can become even more pronounced in those households
that have more than two children as program beneficiaries.

Table 13 shows the estimation of poverty rate and population at risk of falling into poverty
before and after the food prices crisis between treatment and control areas. Using the national
poverty rates in rural areas and assuming that the program would operate in all regions, rural
areas without the program would have 6 percent more poverty prior to the food price crisis.

Because the SFP contributes to developing local agricultural production, prices will be less
volatile than in those areas without the SFP which are more likely to import agricultural products
from other regions. In consequence, the period of food price increases (between the second half
of 2007 and the beginning of 2009) increases by 21.5 percent the population at risk of falling into
poverty in control areas.

Although it is hard to conclude whether these poverty risk changes are dominated by price
differentials prior to the food crisis, the food crisis itself, or other local contextual factors, it is
illustrative of the risk gaps present in areas with a safety net mechanism compared to areas that
lack these types of programs. These relationships can be estimated for the child population at
risk, based on the proportion of child population. Around 2,500 more children in all regions in
rural areas without a safety net fall in the poverty risk category before the food prices crisis.


                                                                                                                           60
After the food prices crisis, the number of children at risk of falling into poverty will rise to
9,000. Based on the proportion of children that live in regions 1 and 7, control areas would have
had 150 more children at risk of falling into poverty compared to treatment areas, before the food
price crisis. After the food price crisis more than 510 children in control areas would be at risk of
falling into poverty. This illustrates under modest and conservative assumptions (see Annex 4)
that safety nets can provide solid mechanisms against adverse shocks that limit poor households
spending power, particularly those households with young children.

using the school-level and teaching staff survey. Median school enrollment rose steadily with
survey round. Enrollment was substantially larger in the treatment schools. For control schools,
the median rose from 70 to 80, and for treatment schools it rose from 132 to 152.

    Schools had single grade classes, multigrade classes or a mix of the two. Of the 64 schools
    surveyed, twelve had single grade classes only, 31 had multigrade classes only and 21 had both

A significantly larger proportion of students in the treatment group lived in single parent homes:
20.6 percent in the treatment group as compared to 12.6 percent in the control group. We
examined whether single parent children differed significantly from those living with both
parents with regard to key outcome indicators, in both treatment and control groups. There was
no significant difference in school attendance, but children living with their mothers only were
less likely to be stunted than all other children, and children living with their father alone were
more likely to obtain higher mathematics scores in the National Assessments.




                                                                                                       63
Students were asked also if they had consumed a breakfast on the day of the survey, and if so
whether it had been a beverage only, a light or a full breakfast (see also Sections 4.2.2.3 and
5.2.3). Single parent families were least likely to provide a full breakfast when compared to
families with both parents present, in both the treatment and the control groups. Of the single
parent families, students with only the father present fared worst in relation to breakfast.


           5.2 The parents, their households and communities

One important aspect of the hinterland school feeding program is the promotion of the
communities’ participation in all the program's activities. Equally important, especially for the
impact analysis of the survey data, is the extent to which treatment schools and their
communities differ from control schools and their communities, in terms of the households’
wealth, the amenities they enjoy and their access to services. The surveys therefore gathered
information on the schools’ communities and their households. This section presents
information on the parents and their households, the parents’ participation in school activities,
and their children’s ease of access to their schools. More detailed information is provided in
Annex 5, Tables A5-5 and A5-6.


           5.2.1    Socio-demographic profiles of parents and their households

Table 21 presents a profile of the parents interviewed and their households. Details of the
occupations of the mothers and fathers are given in Table A5-5 (Annex 5). Focusing on Round 3
data, we see significant differences between communities served by treatment schools and those
served by control schools. In treatment communities there are:

           •   More single parent families;
           •   More female household heads; 29
           •   Fewer household heads in full employment;
           •   Fewer children;
           •   Mothers and fathers with higher education levels.

In Round 3 only, students were asked if they were able to read a full page from a storybook, if
there were any books or newspapers in their homes, and if they had ever heard their mother and
father read a book or newspaper. Responses are given in Table 22. A significantly higher
proportion of students in the treatment group stated that they had heard their mother read a book
or newspaper.




29
     In some cases, the household head may have been a male absent due to employment in mining or logging.

services differ substantially between survey rounds, in each round respondents from
communities with the treatment schools have better access to piped water, electricity and roads.

As with access to services, both parents and students from communities with treatment schools
indicate significantly better amenities and a greater number of possessions than those from
control schools. In short, the information shown in Tables 23 and 24 indicates strongly that
communities served by treatment schools are wealthier and have better access to services than
those served by the control schools.


         5.2.3    How children get to school

In Rounds 2 and 3 only, we asked both parents and students how the child goes to school and to
estimate the time taken to travel to school. Their responses are given in Table 25. A large
proportion of children walk to school, or travel by paddle boat. Of those who travel by paddle
boat, more than 25 percent take an hour or more to reach school. Of those who walk, more than
15 percent take thirty minutes or more to reach school. Of these children with long and arduous
travel to school, more than 30 percent leave homes with at most a light breakfast to sustain them.
These data are based both on parents’ and students’ responses.

6   Conclusions

The impact evaluation of Guyana’s hinterland school feeding program was successfully
conducted in sixty-four schools in Regions 1 and 7. Survey data were collected from schools,
students, teachers and parents in three rounds in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Out of the 64 schools
included in the surveys, twenty one had started school feeding before Round 3 and constituted
the treatment group. The rest formed the control group. Because of the procedures followed to
assign communities and schools into treatment and control groups, self-selection in the sample
produced uneven treatment and control group characteristics, in some cases differing
significantly at baseline. In addition, sample selectivity was manifested in student samples
because of absence in the day when the survey and the tests were applied. Parametric and non-
parametric corrections in both cases were carried to reduce, not eliminate, these sources of bias
in the estimates.

Primary level education poses challenges to the Ministry of Education in its efforts to improve
academic achievement in the hinterland regions, mainly due to:

       •   Poor school attendance;
       •   High levels of stunting, associated with a poor diet and with important consequences
           to cognitive development;
       •   Poverty and limited access to essential resources and services impose constraints to
           increase nutritionally-balanced diets.

The conceptual framework to evaluate the SFP addresses the following questions:

       •   Has the program had a positive impact on students’ attendance, nutritional status and
           school performance?
       •   Has the program led to improvements in students’ classroom behavior and parental
           participation in school activities?
       •   Has the program provided a safety net against food price increases?
       •   Has the program improved diets of households?

The evaluation’s most robust findings are listed as follows:

       •   The SFP increased average attendance by 4.3 percent between 2007 and 2009.
       •   Control schools showed consistently higher levels of stunted and severely stunted
           children in all survey rounds, because of their poorer economic status (selectivity)
           and perhaps also because they had more children of Amerindian ethnicity than
           treatment schools. Children in treatment schools grew 0.8cm more than children
           attending control schools, a small but significant difference.
       •   Children’s classroom behavior improved with the introduction of a school meal. By
           Round 3, students in treatment schools had higher levels of class participation than
           those in control schools. Conversely, students’ disconnect and distraction from
           classroom activities showed a lower incidence in treatment schools.


                                                                                              68
       •   SFP had impacts on academic performance for Math and English scores. However,
           further academic performance will take time to achieve, especially for Reading and
           Science subjects. Better attendance, improved student participation in classroom
           activities, and better nutritional status, when combined with the EFA-FTI’s efforts to
           improve schools’ human and physical resources, must ultimately promote the
           Ministry’s aim of improving academic achievement in the hinterland regions.
       •   Community participation in school feeding-related activities has been achieved:
           parents actively participate in cooking and serving meals, and in growing and
           providing food commodities.
       •   SFP implementation coincided with a period of uncertainty and high volatility in food
           and agricultural commodities’ prices. A daily meal to children in poor household
           represents a safety net mechanism from adverse price shocks. An increase in food
           prices harms the spending capacity of households which in turn affects food
           consumption, nutritional intake and poverty levels.
       •   The diet of rural and Amerindian communities often lacks diversity. In poor and
           Amerindian communities, diets are low in vegetables, fruits, dairy products and
           legumes. The SFP improved diet diversity and frequency of food consumption in
           treatment communities as compared to control communities, despite higher food
           prices. During the food price shocks the gap in food consumption frequency and diet
           diversity between control and treatment groups increased substantially. The SFP has
           thus successfully provided a safety net against food price increases.
       •   The financial returns of the SFP can be substantial if it expands considerably.
           Expansion can also bring a safety net mechanism to regions and communities facing
           economic hardship. Compared to other large-scale programs SFP has a relatively low
           cost per child enrolled. Expansion to all rural schools could drop the unit cost by half.

The evaluation findings and the experiences of the SFP raise a number of important issues that
need the attention of the Ministry of Education:

       •   Although attendance was indeed better in treatment schools, absenteeism remains a
           serious concern. More than 59 percent of all children included in the evaluation were
           absent for at least one day in the two weeks preceding the survey day. And of these
           children, more than 22 percent gave labor of some kind as a reason for their absence.
           Labor included care of younger siblings, work on the farm or in the home.
       •   A further 6.6 percent of children with absences in the two weeks preceding the survey
           were absent because of the household’s economic condition: no food, no uniform, no
           cash or no stationery. Interestingly, of those who gave lack of food as the reason for
           absence, all children except one attended control schools where no lunch was offered.
       •   The short-term hunger which occurs if a child receives an inadequate breakfast and/or
           has a long and arduous journey to school, is a major contributor to poor classroom
           behavior and academic achievement (see Annex 3). Single parents were least likely
           to offer a full breakfast to their children. An important finding of the evaluation was
           that students attending treatment schools were significantly less likely to receive a full
           breakfast. Are parents of treatment school children withholding a full breakfast
           because they know the child will receive a substantial lunch? If this is indeed the



                                                                                                  69
           case, then the training offered by the school feeding program needs to stress the
           importance of an adequate breakfast, even when a full lunch is to be offered at noon.
       •   Sustainability of the hinterland school feeding program when external funding ends is
           clearly a serious issue and one that needs urgent attention. When considering the
           obvious educational and nutritional benefits of the Program, the Ministry needs also
           to take into account the important role of the Program in providing a safety net, as
           well as aspects that address poverty in hinterland communities. Thus, for example,
           the Program offers guaranteed markets to farmers for their produce and employment
           for women as cooks.
       •   While the SFP is a cost-effective program, the Ministry may wish to consider ways
           by which the Program’s costs may be reduced so as to increase the likelihood of
           sustainability. These include modest parental cash contributions, a reduction in the
           number of days when a meal is provided, establishing school gardens to provide
           produce for the meals, encouraging home gardens, seeking partnerships with the
           private sector, and finding ways in which the school kitchens could be used on
           weekends and during school holidays to raise funds through small business
           enterprises. These are possibilities that should be discussed with community
           members.

Finally, the SFP’s achievements with regard to improving community participation in school
activities can make a key contribution to finding solutions to many of the challenges facing the
Ministry of Education.

 Nutritional status indicators

 Nutritional status is assessed by measuring the weight and height of the individual, and then
 comparing these quantities to international reference standards obtained from healthy well-
 nourished populations. For this study, the latest WHO reference standards were used, published
 in 2007. Using weight and height, two indicators are calculated for this sample of primary
 school children:

       •   Height for age – a measure of stunting or chronic malnutrition. This is calculated by
           comparing the height of the individual to the reference height of an individual of the
           same age and sex.

       •   Body Mass Index (BMI) for age – a measure of wasting (acute malnutrition) or obesity.
           BMI is calculated first 31, then the BMI is compared to the reference BMI of an individual
           of the same age and sex.


 Nutritional status of the individual is then defined by means of cut-off points below the
 individual’s reference median:

 < -2 standard deviations (SD)              Stunted or wasted
 ≥ -2 SD and < -1 SD                        At-risk of stunting or wasting
 ≥ median                                   Not stunted or not wasted

 a)        Stunting

 Stunting or chronic malnutrition is generally considered to be the consequence of a diet lacking
 diversity and / or a high level of disease. A monotonous diet is likely to be deficient in a number
 of nutrients. A stunted child may be receiving adequate quantities of energy (calories), protein
 and fat, but yet be lacking in vitamins and minerals. Consequences of stunting include poor

mental development and poor school achievement.                                                                     Other consequences may be linked to
deficiencies of specific vitamins and minerals.

Stunting has been the subject of the classic “nature vs nurture” debate i.e. whether it is the result
of a person’s genetic make-up or because of environmental insults suffered during a child’s
growth periods, insults such as high morbidity or poor nutrition. In favor of the nurture position
is the fact that ethnic groups, such Indian, Chinese and Japanese, traditionally considered to be of
short stature, are now achieving heights comparable to those found in European and North
American populations. This is especially so when economic status improves or when these
groups migrate to the States or Europe. A PhD study conducted in Guyana 32 compared the
heights of two groups of Amerindians: the group with the better economic status and a more
diverse diet was taller than the other. The diet of Amerindian communities, especially the more
remote ones often lacks diversity. Specifically, as found in this baseline survey, consumption of
vegetables is low. Consumption of dairy products and legumes may also be low.

It is important to appreciate that what matters with stunting is not the fact of being short, but
rather the failure to achieve one’s full growth potential, and why this failure has occurred.

Wasting, or acute malnutrition is the result of an inadequate intake of energy (calories) and / or a
recent illness. The diet is primarily deficient in energy, but going along with what is essentially
an insufficient food intake are deficiencies in many other nutrients. Extreme thinness, or severe
wasting, of the form seen in famine conditions, is associated with a high risk of disease and,
ultimately, death.

c)     Short-term hunger

During the course of the day, a child may receive an adequate quantity of nutrients, and thus
his/her nutritional status may be satisfactory. If, however, a child arrives at school with no
breakfast or an inadequate breakfast, the child will experience short-term hunger until it is
offered a snack or a meal. Studies have shown that short-term hunger is associated with a short
attention span and with poor school achievement, even if the child’s nutritional status is good.

d)     Diet diversity

Diet diversity is linked to the diet’s nutritional adequacy. Simply put, a diet that is monotonous
and deficient in one or more food groups is likely to be deficient in specific vitamins and
minerals, and result in sub-optimal linear growth (height). This manifests itself in children as
stunting or short stature.

Guyanese Amerindian diets are reportedly monotonous, and the prevalence of stunting in
Amerindian children is significantly higher than that found in children of other ethnicities. A
major thrust of the EFA-FTI hinterland school feeding program is to promote the production and


                                                                                                                                             81
consumption of a wider range of foods than is traditionally the case. Thus the program has
stressed in the course of community training exercises the importance of including a range of
fruits, vegetables and legumes, and of encouraging the production of these items on local farms.

The food frequency questionnaire for the impact evaluation was restricted to a selected number
of foods. The choice of foods was based on deficiencies identified anecdotally and from earlier
studies. 33 The questionnaire did not ask about the frequency of consumption of staples, mainly
cassava in these communities. Studies on Amerindian diets are limited, and it is important to
recall that food consumption patterns differ from tribe to tribe and according to the ecology of
the area.

  Vegetables were subdivided into three categories (green leafy, yellow/orange, and other) because different
vitamins and minerals are supplied by these categories. For example, orange and yellow vegetables are rich sources
of β-carotene, a precursor of Vitamin A, while green leafy vegetables are important sources of iron.

Program Evaluation Framework

Program monitoring provides ongoing information on the direction and the magnitude of change
in outputs or outcomes of the project. Monitoring is then critical to know whether the project is
moving in the right direction. Program monitoring, however, is not a tool that provides
information to determine if the observed changes in specific outcome indicators are the direct
consequence of the intervention. The main purpose of an impact evaluation study is to provide
convincing and reliable evidence that the changes in the outcome indicators are attributed
exclusively to intervention and not to other factors.
In order to be able to establish causality, the impact evaluation designs a credible
“counterfactual” that describes what would have happened had the project never taken place. For
example, in the case of the impact evaluation of the school feeding program the counterfactual
consists of what participants would have experienced had their communities not participated in
the SFP.
The central problem in the evaluation of any program is the fact that communities participating
in the program cannot be simultaneously observed in the alternative state of no treatment. At a
first glance, one has to resort to statistical methods to address this problem (e.g., see Heckman,
LaLonde and Smith, 1999). But when the impact evaluation is planned prospectively, the process
of selecting the unit of analysis fitted into the design can be understood and randomized methods
to select counterfactuals may provide enormous advantages to infer causal linkages.
The idea to evaluate a program lies on constructing a suitable counterfactual outcome in the
untreated state conditional on receiving treatment. If T=1, the state that denotes participation,
then the treatment parameter can be express as:




The equation above shows the counterfactual that is impossible to estimate. We can observe,
however, the average outcome in the untreated states conditional on similar characteristics:




Since in the equation above,




                                                                                               83
The evaluation problem arises when finding an accurate estimate that makes both elements of the
equation above to be closer. Formally, “randomization provides a mechanism to derive
probabilistic properties of estimates without making further assumptions.”(Rubin, p 693)
Randomized trials of participants in the intervention may also be useful for incorporating causal
effects. Holland (1985) reminds to us that randomized trials for participation can be a powerful
aid in investigating causal relations. Randomly assigning individuals or communities into
treatment and control groups, solves the evaluation problem by using information from
communities or households in the control group to construct an estimate of what participants
would have experienced had they not participated in the program. Therefore, impact evaluation
with randomized participation criteria focus attention on impacts across persons with certain
similar features.


Fixed-Effects Regression

Non-experimental data can get much closer to the virtues of a randomized experiment.
Specifically, by using the fixed effects methods it is possible to control for all possible
characteristics of the individuals in the study—even without measuring them—so long as those
characteristics do not change over time. There are two key data requirements for the application
of a fixed effects method. First, each individual in the sample must have two or more
measurements on the same dependent variable. Second, for at least some of the individuals in the
sample, the values of the independent variable(s) of interest must be different on at least two of
the measurement occasions.

In panel data analysis, the term fixed effects estimator (also known as the within estimator) is
used to refer to an estimator for the coefficients in the regression model. If we assume fixed
effects, we impose time independent effects for each entity that are possibly correlated with the
regressors.

Formally, the model is specified as:

                                    yit = β0 + Xitβ + Ziγ + αi + uit,


where yit is the dependent variable observed for individual i at time t, Xit is the time-variant
regressor, Zi is the time-invariant regressor, αi is the unobserved individual effect, and uit is the
error term. αi could represent motivation, ability, genetics (micro data) or historical factors and
institutional factors (country-level data).

The two main methods of dealing with αi are to make the random effects or fixed effects
assumption:

1. Random effects (RE): Assume αi is independent of Xit,Zi or E(αi       | Xit,Zi) = 0

                                                                                                   84
2. Fixed effects (FE): Assume αi is not independent of Xit,Zi.

To get rid of individual effect αi, a differencing or within transformation (time arranging) is
applied to the data and then β is estimated via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The most common
differencing methods are:




Sample Selection Correction

The Heckman correction (the two-stage method) is any of a number of related statistical methods
developed by James Heckman in 1976 through 1979 which allow the researcher to correct for
selection bias. The Heckman correction, a two-step statistical approach, offers a means of
correcting for non-randomly selected samples.

Heckman discussed bias from using nonrandom selected samples to estimate behavioral
relationships as a specification error. He suggests a two-stage estimation method to correct the
bias. The correction is easy to implement and has a firm basis in statistical theory. Heckman’s
correction involves a normality assumption, provides a test for sample selection bias and formula
for bias corrected model.

The Heckman correction takes place in two stages. First, the researcher formulates a model,
based on economic theory, for the probability of participating in a program. The canonical
specification for this relationship is a probit regression of the form:



where D is an indicator variable (D = 1 if the respondent is employed and D = 0 otherwise). Z is
a vector of explanatory variables, γ is a vector of unknown parameters, and Φ is the cumulative
distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Estimation of the model yields results
that can be used to predict this probability for each individual. In the second stage, the researcher
corrects for self-selection by incorporating a transformation of these predicted individual
probabilities as an additional explanatory variable.



which leads to,


                                                                                                  85
The model for sample selection that allows treatment and control comparability needs further
specifications. The model obtains formal identification from the normality assumption when the
same covariates appear in the selection equation and the equation of interest, but identification
will be tenuous unless there are many observations in the tails where there is substantial
nonlinearity in the Inverse Mills Ratio. Generally, an exclusion restriction is required to generate
credible estimates: there must be at least one variable which appears with a non-zero coefficient
in the selection equation but does not appear in the equation of interest, essentially an instrument.
If no such variable is available, it may be difficult to correct for sampling selectivity.

In our models we included many selection variables which are uncorrelated with the error but
that explain the selectivity of the sample and the comparison groups. First by including the days
taken to implement SFPs in schools we have a variable that controls exogenous conditions that
modified entrance into the treatment group. Because many factors such as school
organization/performance dealt with the delays in SFP implementation, the variable captures
both the organizational skills of schools to submit SFP applications, and other institutional
aspects that played a role in postponing the planned date of entrance of schools to the SFP.
Another important variable included in the selection equation are the clusters, regions and
schools. This can be thought of as fixed effects that play a role in determining the selection of
schools into the treatment and control groups. In addition it corrects for all sample limitations
derived from attrition rates from the longitudinal sample.


When data are collected over two or more points in time, it is common for some participants to
drop out of the study prematurely. The attrition of the original sample can occur in longitudinal
research as well as in experimental designs that include pretest, posttest, and follow-up data
collection. In longitudinal research, which often lasts many years, some participants move
between data points and cannot be located. Others, especially older persons, may die or become
too incapacitated to continue participation
in the study. In clinical treatment studies, there may be barriers to continued participation in the
treatment program, such as drug relapse or lack of transportation. Attrition of the original sample
represents a potential threat of bias if those who drop out of the study are systematically different
from those who remain in the study. The result is that the remaining sample becomes different
from the original sample, resulting in what is known as attrition. In our sample the mean attrition
rate is of 25 percent for all schools in treatment and control groups.

Still attrition rates where very variable by school. Graph A4-1 shows the attrition rates and the
number of matched students in survey rounds by each school included in the sample. Although
the variability shown in the attrition, only in few cases attrition was high enough to drop the
majority of children followed in the longitudinal sample.

absence of the intervention, and impact is estimated by comparing counterfactual outcomes to
those observed under the intervention. The key challenge in Impact Evaluation is that the
counterfactual cannot be directly observed, but must be approximated with reference to a
comparison group. There are a range of accepted approaches to determining an appropriate
comparison group for counterfactual analysis, using either prospective (ex ante) or retrospective
(ex post) evaluation design. Prospective evaluations begin during the design phase of the
intervention, involving collection of baseline and end-line data from intervention beneficiaries
(the ‘treatment group’) and non-beneficiaries (the ‘comparison group’), and may also involve
selection of individuals or communities into treatment and comparison groups. Retrospective
evaluations are usually conducted after the implementation phase, and may exploit existing
survey data, although the best evaluations will collect data as close to baseline as possible, to
ensure comparability of intervention and comparison groups.

There are five key principles relating to internal validity (study design) and external validity
which rigorous Impact Evaluations should address: confounding factors, selection bias, spillover
effects, contamination, and impact heterogeneity.

Confounding occurs where certain factors, typically relating to socio-economic status, are
correlated with both exposure to the intervention and, independent of exposure, are causally
related to the outcome of interest. Confounding factors are therefore alternate explanations for an
observed (possibly spurious) relationship between intervention and outcome. Because nutrition
status and educational outcomes might be influenced by many factors, the SFP may capture
confounding factors. This is why the regressions include fixed-effects and the sample selection
correction.

Selection bias occurs where intervention participants are non-randomly drawn from the
beneficiary population, and the criteria determining selection are correlated with outcomes.
Unobserved factors, which are associated with access to or participation in the intervention, and
are causally related to the outcome of interest, may lead to a spurious relationship between
intervention and outcome if unaccounted for. In the case of the SFP, Self-selection occur where,
for example, more able or organized individuals or communities, who are more likely to have
better outcomes of interest, are also more likely to participate in the intervention. Endogenous
program selection occurs where individuals or communities are chosen to participate because
they are seen to be more likely to benefit from the intervention. Ignoring confounding factors can
lead to a problem of omitted variable bias. In the special case of selection bias, the endogeneity
of the selection variables can cause simultaneity bias. All these types of bias can be addressed
substantially with sample selection correction models.

Impact evaluation designs are identified by the type of methods used to generate the
counterfactual and can be broadly classified into three categories – experimental, quasi-
experimental and non-experimental designs – that vary in feasibility, cost, involvement during
design or after implementation phase of the intervention, and degree of selection bias. White
(2006) and Ravallion (2008) discuss alternate Impact Evaluation approaches.

Under experimental evaluations the treatment and comparison groups are selected randomly and
isolated both from the intervention, as well as any interventions which may affect the outcome of
interest. These evaluation designs are referred to as randomized control trials (RCTs). In
experimental evaluations the comparison group is called a control group. When randomization is
implemented over a sufficiently large sample with no contagion by the intervention, the only
difference between treatment and control groups on average is that the latter does not receive the
intervention. Random sample surveys, in which the sample for the evaluation is chosen on a
random basis, should not be confused with experimental evaluation designs, which require the
random assignment of the treatment.

The experimental approach is often held up as the ‘gold standard’ of evaluation, and it is the only
evaluation design which can conclusively account for selection bias in demonstrating a causal
relationship between intervention and outcomes. Randomization and isolation from interventions
are seldom practicable in the realm of social policy, and may also be ethically difficult to defend,
although there may be opportunities to utilize natural experiments. Bamberger and White (2007)
highlight some of the limitations to applying RCTs to development interventions.
Methodological critiques have been made by Scriven (2008) on account of the biases introduced
since social interventions cannot be triple blinded, and Deaton (2009) has pointed out that in
practice analysis RCTs falls back on the regression-based approaches they seek to avoid, and so
are subject to the same potential biases. Other problems include the often heterogeneous and
changing contexts of interventions, logistical and practical challenges, difficulties with
monitoring service delivery, access to the intervention by the comparison group and changes in
selection criteria and/or intervention over time. Thus, it is estimated that RCTs are only
applicable to 5 per cent of development finance.

Quasi-experimental approaches can remove bias arising from selection on observables and,
where panel data are available, time invariant unobservables. Quasi-experimental methods
include matching, differencing, instrumental variables and the pipeline approach, and are usually
carried out by multivariate regression analysis.

If selection characteristics are known and observed then they can be controlled for to remove the
bias. Matching involves comparing program participants with non-participants based on
observed selection characteristics. Propensity score matching (PSM) uses a statistical model to
calculate the probability of participating on the basis of a set of observable characteristics, and
matches participants and non-participants with similar probability scores. Regression
discontinuity design exploits a decision rule as to who does and does not get the intervention to
compare outcomes for those just either side of this cut-off.

Difference-in-differences or double differences, which use data collected at baseline and end-line
for intervention and comparison groups, can be used to account for selection bias with under the
assumption that unobservable factors determining selection are fixed over time (time invariant).
Instrumental variables estimation accounts for selection bias by modelling participation using
factors (‘instruments’) that are correlated with selection but not the outcome, thus isolating the
aspects of program participation which can be treated as exogenous.

The pipeline approach (stepped-wedge design) uses beneficiaries already chosen to participate in
a project at a later stage as the comparison group. The assumption is that as they have been
selected to receive the intervention in the future they are similar to the treatment group, and
therefore comparable in terms of outcome variables of interest. However, in practice, it cannot be
guaranteed that treatment and comparison groups are comparable and some method of matching
will need to be applied to verify comparability.


Propensity Score Matching

In the evaluation literature, data often do not come from randomized trials but from (non-
randomized) observational studies. In seminal work, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) proposed
propensity score matching as a method to reduce the bias in the estimation of treatment effects
with observational data sets. These methods have become increasingly popular in medical trials
and in the evaluation of economic policy interventions.
Since in observational studies assignment of subjects to the treatment and control groups is not
random, the estimation of the effect of treatment may be biased by the existence of confounding
factors. Propensity score matching is a way to partially “correct” the estimation of treatment
effects controlling for the existence of these confounding factors based on the idea that the bias is
reduced when the comparison of outcomes is performed using treated and control subjects who
are as similar as possible. Since matching subjects on an n-dimensional vector of characteristics
is typically unfeasible for large n, there are new methods that propose to summarize pre-
treatment characteristics of each subject into a single-index variable (the propensity score) which
makes the matching feasible.

The propensity score is defined by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) as the conditional



                                                                                                  89
Probability of receiving a treatment given pre-treatment characteristics:




where D = {0, 1} is the indicator of exposure to treatment and X is the multi dimensional vector
of pre-treatment characteristics. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that if the exposure to
treatment is random within cells defined by X, it is also random within cells defined by the
values of the mono-dimensional variable p(X). As a result, given a population of units denoted
by i, if the propensity score p(Xi) is known the Average effect of Treatment on the
Treated(ATT)can be estimated as follows:




For practical ends, the methodology for propensity score matching used first an equation that
included individual and household characteristics and student test scores (grades) to explain
participation in the treatment dichotomous variable. Given the relatively small number of
observations included in the individual-level sample the command pscore in Stata v 10 was used
to include common support blocks to minimize the dropout of observations. After the propensity
scores are estimated, they are used to balance the sample and estimate the Average Treatment on
the Treated effects (ATT) for each type of test (Reading, English, Math, etc.). The method to
match the scores is based on the kernel distribution. This facilitates a robust distributional
configuration of the scores along the subsample derived from the propensity scores. The method
estimates the standard errors via bootstrapping so that estimators are efficient as well. The ATT
effects should be interpreted carefully. They do not represent results beyond the sample in
question, given the non-random assignment. But they do represent impacts at the survey sample
level, which is relevant at least from the program perspective.

The procedure to match treatment and control subsamples encompasses 3 steps. First, a simple
probit model is estimated with a set of observable characteristics, where the outcome variable is
the dummy of program participation. The most relevant variables for the probit model step are
shown in the following table:

Why SFP participation has Selectivity Issues?

In non-experimental studies like this one, researchers often try to approximate a randomized
experiment by statistically controlling for other variables using methods such as linear
regression, logistic regression, or propensity scores. While statistical control can certainly be a
useful tactic, it has two major limitations. First, no matter how many variables are controlled for,
there is always room for arguing that selectivity still remains.

Given this evaluation design and they way in which the SFP participation was structured, fully
randomization for the allocation of the program to participant schools was not achieved. The
program comprised 3 phases of training prior to the provision of grants to establish community-
run kitchens in schools. The first phase included a promotion campaign and awareness sessions
with parents, teachers, village councils, and members of communities. Overall this phase have
high levels of participation from schools and dwellers. During phase 2, training was provided to
elaborate a proposal to request financing grants in order to create conditions to food preparation,
agricultural production, financial management and administration of the school feeding program.
The sessions were carried with school representatives and community members interested in
implementing the SFP in their communities. This phase was very important because it involved
producing a quality proposal to receive the award. In parallel, phase 3 included a certification of
cooks, and readiness of facilities to launch the program. Without certification SFP could not
start.

Based on this design and steps to select schools, there are sample selection issues that may bias
the impact estimators of the SFP participation to the above mentioned outcomes. In particular,
phase 2 contributes to enhance self selectivity. Schools and communities that are better
organized and show higher commitment to implement an SFP will tend to have higher
probabilities of success in elaborating high quality proposals and, as a consequence, receive the
grant to launch the SFP. Intuitively, the characteristics that may affect this sample selection have
to do with attributes at the school, region and sub-region levels. In addition, community


                                                                                                               93
organization will be fundamental to submit on time the proposal and to timely implement the
SFP.

Fortunately the richness of the information contained in the surveys provides important
observable characteristics to reduce the bias generated by the aforementioned selection process
reflected in the outcome variables. Other unobservable characteristics may be corrected through
statistical techniques. Correcting for both observable and unobservable characteristics of sample
selection between comparison groups will minimize the bias, therefore improving statistical
inference of SFP’s impacts.

Non randomness in the assignment of treatment and control groups can be partially corrected if
we have observed factors that could determine the selection bias that is manifested in the
outcome variables. Graph A4-2 shows the relationship between the delay in days of SFP
implementation and attendance rates. It is worth noticing that there is a clear relationship
between the outcome variable (attendance) and the delay in days. The delays in SFP
implementation was caused by multiple factors that range from school organizational level to
budgetary and grant allocation delays. However, this variable captures intrinsic characteristics of
schools and other contextual characteristics that produced higher quality schools to enter in the
treatment group in the initial phase of the SFP. Because of this reason, the delay in days to
implement SFP was used as a control within the selectivity equation of Heckman’s two stage
procedure.

In order to verify how strong is the variable “days of delay in SFP implementation” in terms of
capturing school quality attributes, graph A4-3 shows the relationship between the days of delay
in SFP implementation and the standardized z-scores. Schools with no delays in implementation
show higher average z-scores than those schools that presented at least one day of delay in SFP
implementation. More days of delay in SFP implementation is associated with consistently lower
total standardized z-scores.

Sample selection correction included this variable to increase accuracy in the observable
attributes that may contribute to increase sample selection bias. In addition, other regional,
school and cluster unobserved attributes were included in the selection equation to improve the
accuracy in the estimations. Although the results reported are consistent, they should be
interpreted with caution because sample selectivity will always be present in non-random
assignments. However, the models allow approximate a fairly accurate estimate of SFP’s
impacts.


Overall Sample Changes and Children At-risk (stunting and wasting) subsample results

The school datasets (Round 1, 2 and 3) contain rich information of programs and activities
undertaken in each school. The longitudinal database was constructed based upon face-to-face
interviews to head teachers. Baseline and the first follow up surveys show a perfect matching of
64 schools. However, when the third round is merged, 6 schools do not match with baseline and
round 2 data. This represent 90 percent of information kept at the school level for all three
rounds (58 schools).

Student level data was also merged for baseline, round 2 and round 3. The merge of baseline and
round 2 showed 3,590 students 35 that were perfectly matched. In other words, the sample of
children that was followed in baseline and the subsequent round was of 3,590 students. Out of
these children, 616 belong to the treatment group (considering the dates of entrance to the
program) and 2,974 were in control areas. Using the third round data, the sample increased to
6,581 students, but 3,590 were perfectly matched. This means that at the student level, there was
not a single child that did not matched between the baseline-round2 merged data and the round 3

  The total sample of children is 5,405 students but the sample was reduced due to missing data on children and
unsuccessful follow up of children.

data. Out of the 3,590 children with data for the three rounds 36, 1,982 belong to the control group
and 1,608 to the treatment group. This means that from the baseline-round2 merged data there
was an increase of 992 children (which compensated the decrease from 2,974 to 1,982 children
in the control group).

The treatment and control groups show the following distribution of children by region:

With the longitudinal sample the analysis can be done at the student level controlling for student,
school and region characteristics. Additional controls for school/community quality proxies
(absenteeism, days taken to implement SFP and test scores). Long-term health outcomes cannot
be assessed at this point, although marginal effects can be computed for changes in BMI and
HAZ. Two additional models that included dummies to identify the children at-risk of stunting
and wasting were run to verify if the program had any these impacts across these vulnerable
subgroups (see Table below). The first model included a simple regression (OLS) with matched

On merging the “parents” data there are several points worth mentioning. For the baseline
survey, parents and food frequency data were collected separately. Merging both datasets caused
a reduction in 27 observations. This represents around 95 percent (567 observations) of data kept
in the baseline where food frequency and parent data is available. For the second round data
(first follow-up) the parent and food frequency data was built in the same dataset. By merging
both, the baseline parents-food frequency and the second round parents-food frequency data
there were left 546 observations (58 observations were lost). After merging the final Round (3)
to the merged panel of parents for baseline (R1) and follow-up (R2), the number of observations
preserved were 506. In the R1 and R2 data there were 376 parents interviewed in control and 130
in treatment areas. Subsequently, R3 added 47 new parents from the control to the treatment
group ending up with 329 and 177, respectively for control and treatment groups.

The regional distribution of parents in treatment and control areas for the longitudinal sample is

Simulation: Price Shocks and SFP’s Role as Safety Net

Given a change in producer and consumer staple prices, the net effect on household welfare
depends on the household’s condition as net seller or net buyer. If staple prices increase, the
household will experience a welfare gain in the short run if it is a net seller or a welfare loss if it
is a net buyer. To quantify this change in welfare in an intuitive manner a useful notion is that of
compensating variation, which equals the gain/loss to the income/monetary transfer needed to
restore the household to the position it was before the (price) shock occurred. In this paper the
compensating variation is expressed as a percentage of the initial welfare level.

The methodology used in this paper has several antecedents, starting with Deaton (1989), and
many other empirical applications thereafter, including Budd (1993), Barrett and Dorosh (1996),
Minot and Goletti (2000) and, recently, Ivanic and Martin (2008). A change in the staple food
price is the original income (here proxied by total consumption expenditure) of each household
with the original price of the staple.

The three rounds of SFP’s impact evaluation surveys are based mostly on the same sample of
households, and can be combined with the household budget and expenditures survey (HBE),
with additional socioeconomic characteristics of individuals and households. Additionally, the
prices are calibrated with GMC data 37. When the two data sets are combined and observations
with missing sampling weights are dropped. Weights from national HBE survey are used for the
merged dataset with slight calibration based on the sample in each cluster of the evaluation
surveys.

One must ensure that outcomes from the micro-simulation model are consistent with the
aggregate results from the poverty estimates both before and after the price shock for each
comparison area. This includes aggregating the simulation results at the community level using
average socioeconomic characteristics, prices, purchases and food groups by SFP participant and
non-participant communities.

The model requires information on household consumption expenditure (C), the agricultural
intensity of communities and a dummy variable that indicates whether the household receives
SFP (Ict), and time-series price levels by food groups. The household survey provides
information on the poverty line. The model simulates the impact of higher commodity prices on
households by simulating attendant changes in consumption and the poverty line. We assume
that simulated and baseline consumption by individual j in food group i has the following
formula:




This implies that the simulated percentage change in consumption (abstracting from changes in
SFP status) is identical for every household in a community. Further, the change in SFP status
over time is assumed to be unconditional. An increase in commodity prices will increase the cost
of the poverty basket. Baseline and simulated increases in the real poverty line (PL) are
calculated as follows:




The simplicity of this equation leads to extensive use in the analysis of the poverty impact of
increases in food prices. However, it is worth reminding that bias exists from its use. Individual
food prices rarely increase by the same percentage or proportion. An individual would typically
substitute away from a good whose relative price has increased. Thus this assumption results in a
substitution bias that over-estimates the poverty impact of the increase in food prices. Because
GMC prices measurement error tends to under-estimate prices, there could be an under-
estimation of impact, which in combination with the substitution bias, both biases may cancel-
out (based on their magnitudes). Given the short-run orientation of this simulation model, it is
possible that this bias may not be substantial.
Let Ipj be a dummy variable indicating whether household j is poor:

37
 Prices from the Guyana Market Corporation may have substantial measurement error as communities become
more isolated and rural.


                                                                                                          112
The national poverty incidence for the baseline and simulation outcomes (Hb and Hs
respectively) are given by:



To build the model and estimate how many children in SFP areas did not fall below the poverty
threshold with an increase in food prices, different data was used and several assumptions were
made. First, monthly prices of food and food groups from 1990 to 2010 were used to explore the
price index changes and trends. Based on frequencies of food group consumption and local food
prices in sub-regions 38 the estimated price changes for the main food staples/groups were listed
in frequencies. The estimations were then separated according to the price indices reported in
markets adjacent or close to treatment and control areas 39.

With food prices changes estimated for treatment and control areas it is possible to calculate the
differences shown in the period before and after the food price shocks by each food group. The
price shocks reduce spending power and increases the likelihood of a household to fall into the
poverty line. Guyana´s extreme and moderate poverty lines were estimated through a household
consumption and expenditure survey collected nationally, reported in the Guyana Poverty
Assessment. The thresholds are reported in Table A4-19.

Price differences between treatment and control areas changes relative households’ food
expenditures and income levels, so it is possible to estimate changes in poverty levels as well.
Since the differences in prices are expressed in percentage between the price levels paid in

   The Guyana Market Corporation (GMC) provided useful quarterly data from 2007 to 2009 on all prices paid in
local markets for 50 products that included fruits, meats and proteins, legumes, ground and roots, vegetables,
seasonings, starch and nuts.
39
   Local markets can provide food products to both treatment and control areas particularly when they are close
enough. Prices were imputed to the comparison group that had schools close to the local market.


                                                                                                              113
treatment and control areas, it is feasible that, with the incentive to provide additional meals with
the SFP, local market production and food frequency-intake stability could lead to lower price
levels in treatment areas. Graph A4-4 shows that the simulations produced an increase in the gap
of comparison group food prices due to the assumptions made and the presence of the SFP.

The estimations of price differences between treatment and control areas for the period 2000 to
2010 is shown in graph A4-20 (for proteins and vegetables). All food groups showed price
stability and small differences in the period previous to the food price crisis in both treatment and
control areas. During and after the period of food price increases (mid-2007) the price
differences for all food groups become higher. When the price difference is negative it indicates
lower price levels for treatment areas.

Average yearly price differences, expressed in percentages, are imputed into the poverty line
thresholds, assuming that any percent change in food prices will proportionally affect household
expenditure. Because the poverty thresholds were built from expenditure data based on price and
quantities of good consumed in the household, this is not an unreasonable assumption. Once
price shocks are translated into poverty line changes it is possible to estimate the changes in the
total number of poor people and estimate the number of people that did not fall into poverty
because of the presence of the program. To do so, we need to further assume that the distribution
of the children and region’s population remains constant from 2006-2009 (see Figure A4-1).

The final step is to estimate actual poverty changes. To do so, we need the total poor population
distributed by area (urban, rural) and the proportion of population distributed by region. In
addition, poverty rates for 2009 were estimated using a conservative rate of population increase
and poverty changes. Table A4-2 shows the total number of poor people and poverty rates in


                                                                                                                                                                115
2006 and 2009. For 2009, the difference in prices was used to change the poverty rate
threshold 40. In consequence it could be estimated the difference in the number of people that fall
below the poverty threshold according to the price shock differential in treatment and control
areas. In other words, without the program food prices increases would have caused an upward
shift in the poverty threshold and consequently in the number of poor people.

The predictions based on the conservative scenarios using the baseline population of the Census
2002. The population growth is declining in Guyana in recent years therefore the 2009 estimates
in Table A4-22 show an actual decrease in rural population and nationally. But overall there is an
increase in both extreme and moderate poverty in rural areas, whereas urban areas experience a
decline over the baseline and simulated year.
Graph A4-23 shows the UN Population predictions for Guyana from 2005 to 2050 under three
fertility scenarios. This shows the tendency of population reduction in this country.

  Because the difference is expressed between price levels in treatment areas minus the price levels of control areas,
the changes in poverty will be a result of an increase in the poverty threshold when prices in the control group are
higher.

The simple estimations of the changes in poverty due to food price changes relied on several
assumptions, which are enlisted below:




                                                                                                                          117
Assumptions

1. Price changes entirely affect consumption (all income effect); no confounding factors of
consumption and poverty change considered. This assumption does not consider changes and
shift in patterns and preference of consumption. Although it does consider the frequency of food
groups to approximate changes in consumption, a better model will incorporate percent changes
in consumption or price elasticities of the various products included in the consumption basket to
estimate poverty lines.

2. Poverty and Population Growth in the 2006 to 2009 period is constant. Population growth in
Guyana’s hinterland rural areas is decreasing, according to Guyana’s Bureau of Statistics.
Poverty has experience modest decreases in early 2000s. From 2006 and 2009 modest and
conservative changes in population and poverty changes were considered.

3. Poverty rates change proportionally to the poverty line threshold. This is a strong assumption.
However, in Guyana’s context, relatively steady and low levels of inflation makes this
assumption reasonable. This assumption will be unreasonable in countries that experience sharp
changes in inflation rates.

4. Regional distribution of children population is proportional to the regional distribution of poor
children. This is an assumption that prevents overestimating the poverty effects of the children
that are at risk of falling into poverty in the presence of food price shocks. In other words, this
represents a lower bound estimate since the number of children that may become poor is
estimated by multiplying the total change in poor people in rural areas and the proportion of
children dwelling in regions 1 and 7. In reality, in hinterland areas the proportion of poor
children is higher than the proportion of children population.

5. Food groups and categories used determine the consumption basket. The consumption basket
used to estimate the poverty thresholds comprises the same food groups but more products.

Based on the methodology and assumptions described above, Table A4-3 shows the results in
poverty changes and the potential children that could fall below the poverty line in the absence of
a safety net program. We use four main food group categories and estimate the treatment and
control price differences before and during the food prices shock. Since food prices are reported
in indices (constant terms) the changes are expressed in percentages.

For instance, the protein food group showed a marginal 4 percent difference between treatment
and control areas during 2006 and mid-2007. The difference for the same food group in the food
price shock period escalated to 15.1 percent. The price shocks or percentage differences are then
expressed in terms of changes in the poverty line threshold. The moderate poverty line of
GY$11,143 per month (USD 1.85 daily) would have increased on average G$445.4 per month
(USD 0.07 daily) more in control areas for protein products in the period before the food price
crises. In the food price crisis period there was around GY$2,000 per month (USD 0.33 daily)
shock for control areas.




                                                                                                118
These estimates can then be used to estimate the average change in poverty using the poverty
line and the population under the poverty threshold.
