2.       The Guyana Education for All – Fast Track Initiative Project continues performing
well. Guyana now has achieved a primary education completion rate of 100 percent. The
Project has assisted in the reduction of educational inequalities between coastal and
hinterland regions in Guyana. The Community-based School Feeding Program (SFP)
benefits 93 out of 138 primary hinterland schools which amount to over 16,625 children.
Results of a three year evaluation show significant positive results on school attendance,
academic performance, classroom behavior, nutritional status and parent and community
participation, especially for the poorest.

3.       The proposed reallocation is necessary to reallocate the remaining funds in Category
10 (Works, Goods, Consultants’ Services, RA Incentives, Training and Operational Costs) to
Category 6 (SFP). Given the upcoming closing of this Project (October 1, 2012), this
reallocation seeks to make use of unspent balances to further the success of the School
Feeding Program.
