                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of Guyana Education For All Fast Track Initiative (EAF-FTI) continues performing well. It has achieved and maintained the goal of primary education completion.
                         Support to teachers country-wide, through the Continuous Professional Development of Trained Teachers program and targeting incentives to teachers in hardship areas such as
                         remote areas incentives and provision of housing, has assisted in retaining trained and experienced teachers in Guyana. The EFA-FTI has also improved the quality of the learning
                         environment through provision of core textbooks nationwide. To date, it has built 16 teacher houses which provide apartments for 64 teachers in the Hinterland, and it has provided
                         utility upgrading to 66 primary schools country-wide. The program continues to partner with other donors to support effective schools through child-friendly classrooms. The

                         Community-based School Feeding Program (SFP) has benefited 93 out of 138 hinterland schools which amount to over 16,625 children. Findings of a three year impact evaluation
                         show significant positive results on school attendance, academic performance, classroom behavior, nutritional status and parent and community participation, especially for the
                         poorest. School Improvement Plans (SIP) have benefited 440 schools nation-wide, through improvement initiatives such as Libraries, Kitchens, Resource areas, Water & Sanitation
