Community-Based\n            School Feeding Program (SFP) began in 2007 with the\n            objective of building more community participation in\n            schools and improving children\u2019s human development outcomes,\n            such as student enrollment and attendance, nutritional\n            status and learning outcomes. In addition, the program\n            supports improvement of schools\u0092 organization of primary\n            level in Regions 1, 7, 8 and 9. To evaluate the program, the\n            Government of Guyana and the World Bank collected survey\n            data from schools, students, teachers and parents in three\n            rounds 2007, 2008 and 2009 in Regions 1 and 7. This report\n            shows the findings and impacts of SFP using all survey\n            rounds.  Regions 1 and 7 are characterized by high poverty\n            levels and agricultural labor intensity. Both factors\n            highlight the potential of organizing SFP around local\n            producers, so that a regular supply of low-cost food can be\n            guaranteed to the local schools and children living in\n            precarious conditions. Seventeen of the sixty-four schools\n            participating in the impact evaluation are in Region 7, and\n            the rest are in Region 1. Randomization for the selection of\n            comparison groups was not achieved, due to the participation\n            rules. However, sample selection correction methods were\n            used to correct for observable and unobservable biases. This\n            study's finding fall under the following topics:\n            enrollment and attendance, nutritional status,\n            students' classroom behavior and school performance,\n            academic performance by students, parental/community\n            participation, household diets, food prices shocks and SFP\n            as a safety net. Finally, the SFP\u2019s achievements with regard\n            to improving community participation in school activities\n            can make a key contribution in finding solutions to many of\n            the challenges faced by the Ministry of Education for\n            service delivery and quality education in rural, remote areas."}, "docdt": "2012-07-13T09:15:04Z"}
