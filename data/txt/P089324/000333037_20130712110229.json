for Guyana were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Grantee performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            team carried out a close supervision of all Project\n            activities. Substantial resources and time were placed in\n            field works to ensure capacity building of beneficiaries and\n            to pass on the know-how the team itself had acquired through\n            training and technical support from the Bank. With extensive\n            work on the ground, the project succeeded in changing\n            mentalities and transforming behaviors in schools and\n            communities. The project was implemented with a highly\n            participatory approach. The beneficiaries and their\n            communities developed strong local ownership, which was\n            critical for the maintenance and sustainability of the\n            project outcomes. The participatory approach also enabled\n            the project implementation process to incorporate the\n            knowledge and skills of the local communities. Regional\n            Education Officers and staff were involved at all times\n            during the implementation of the project, such as training\n            and supervision and monitoring missions. This allowed them\n            to absorbed the standards and the procedures used by the\n            project team, which was important to the sustainability of\n            outcomes beyond the completion of the project."}, "docdt": "2013-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
