1.      The closing date for the Guyana Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI)
Project TF053679, P089324, will be extended from October 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012.

2.       Overall, the EFA-FTI Project has been consistently performing well, achieving in
2008 and maintaining the goal of universal primary school completion for girls and boys in
Guyana. It has met its major targets, resulting in twenty (20) teachers’ houses being built;
thirteen (13) learning centers being set up in the Hinterland; approximately 900 primary
school teachers in the Hinterland receiving monthly cash incentives; upgrading of basic
utilities (water, electricity, and sanitation) in over 100 schools; learning materials being
provided for all primary schools in Guyana; 340 primary schools receiving school
improvement grants; 71 teachers in the Hinterland being trained using the Guyana Basic
Education Teacher Training Program approach; and 480 teachers participating in the
Continuous Professional Development Program; the Community-based School Feeding
Program (SFP) benefits 93 out of 138 primary hinterland schools which amount to over
16,625 children. Results of a three year evaluation show significant positive results on
school attendance, academic performance, classroom behavior, nutritional status and parent
and community participation, especially for the poorest.

3. The extension is necessary to facilitate:

(i) a smooth transition with respect to the ownership and administration of subprojects
    completed by the Project to regions, sub-regions and communities;

(ii) some schools/communities to complete the implementation of school improvement
     projects; and

(iii) the distribution of textbooks and other learning materials to schools in the remote and
     riverain areas.

4. This will be the first extension of the Project.
