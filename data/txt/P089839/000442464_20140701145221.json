follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcomes were moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: rural\n            communities are willing to accept a new management model\n            using a professional operator model and payment for water\n            based on volume consumed. The maintenance responsibilities\n            for institutional latrines should be agreed upon before\n            construction begins. A better mechanism for source\n            protection needs to be developed. Finding the right match\n            for South-South knowledge exchanges improved the\n            operators' commitment and confidence in the new\n            profession. Engaging in sector transformation with a\n            long-term programmatic approach has a lasting impact.\n            Development objectives and intermediate results for\n            different funding to the same project need to be harmonized."}, "docdt": "2014-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
