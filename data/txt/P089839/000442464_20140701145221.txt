1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

    1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Country Context. At project appraisal, Haiti was going through a transitional period following the
abrupt end of the Aristide regime in 2004. More than three-quarters of its 8.6 million population was living
below the poverty line, as well as 54 percent in extreme poverty, and the absence or poor state of basic rural
infrastructure led to high rural-urban migration. The State and Peace-Building Fund (SPF) application noted
in addition that Haiti was in crisis in 2008 due to the devastation of three hurricanes and a tropical storm,
with total damages estimated at 15 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Public institutions
remained weak, despite progress on democracy, security, economic governance and institutional reform in
2006-2008. Haiti further suffered from setbacks in political stability in April 2008, when riots broke out
over rising food and fuel prices, highlighting the need to improve socio-economic conditions and provide
basic services to reduce the risk of social unrest.

2.       Sector Context. Access in rural areas to improved water supply and sanitation (WSS) was the
lowest in the Western Hemisphere with 54 and 16 percent, respectively, and institutional capacity for rural
WSS provision was low. The National Drinking Water Service (SNEP), the main institution for water
supply outside Port-au-Prince, focused its limited capacity on intermediate cities of more than 10,000
people and the Ministry of Health had a small and inactive unit for hygiene and water supply due to lack of
funds. No institution was charged with the responsibility of rural sanitation at the time. Without an
institutional presence in rural areas and with little knowledge about levels of coverage and needs, it was
thus difficult to prioritize investments which were, as a result, carried out in a piecemeal manner and did not
necessarily reach the neediest citizens.

3.      The Government had drafted legislation for a new institutional setup for rural WSS, which would
be in place after project effectiveness. This legislation included decentralization of the responsibility for
water supply provision to communes, creation of regional water and sanitation companies, and delegation
by the communes to third party water service providers, which could be the regional companies, the private
sector or community water associations. The legislation became law in 2009, creating the National Water
and Sanitation Directorate (DINEPA) and replacing SNEP, as well as other national entities.

4.      Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Project would support objectives in the World Bank Group
Transitional Support Strategy for Haiti FY05-FY06 (Report # 30541), as well as the Interim Strategy Note
for Haiti FY07-FY08 (Report # 37720-HT), discussed by the Executive Directors on December 10, 2004
and December 14, 2006, respectively, specifically to deliver quick wins in basic service provision, building
public-private partnerships to promote inclusion and restore credibility in public institutions, and to deepen
good governance and institutional reforms.

5.      Also, a World Bank-assisted pilot project for rural water supply, school sanitation, and hygiene
education had been implemented by SNEP in 2005-2007, using US$855,000 from a Low-Income Countries
Under Stress (LICUS) grant. The LICUS project had been successful in building SNEP’s capacity, testing
in 3 schemes a new approach to service provision using professional operators, as well as selling water by
volume through metering household connections and converting communal standposts to water kiosks. 1

  Standposts (fontaines in Haiti) distribute water freely, while kiosks sell water by the bokit (5 US gallons or 18.9
liters).

6.      Contribution to Higher Objectives. The Project would contribute to 4 higher level objectives: (i)
Improved governance and public sector capacity: Build SNEP capacity; introduce transparent procedures
for allocating infrastructure investment; (ii) Greater social stability and state credibility: Demonstrate
quickly and effectively state capacity to provide jobs and services to vulnerable populations; (iii) Social
cohesion: Improve community capacity to mobilize inhabitants to obtain and sustain water services; (iv)
Improved health: Reduce diarrhea, particularly in children and infants, through integrated water supply,
hygiene, and sanitation services.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The IDA and the SPF grants were different sources of funding, and therefore had different
guidelines and objectives. The practice at the time of project design (for IDA) was to list PDOs together
with specific project objectives, while the format of the SPF proposals did not include the definition of the
PDO in the main text. The PDO for SPF was instead expected to be included in the Results Framework.

    IDA Grant                                                                 Indicators2
    - PDO: Increase access to and use of WSS services in participating        - Number of beneficiaries gaining access

    SPF Grant                                                                 Indicators3
    - PDO:                                                                    - Increase in the number of beneficiaries
        Increased access to safe and continuous water supply;                receiving improved water service (access,
        Increased use of sanitary facilities;                                continuity, and safety)
                                                                              - Increase in the number of beneficiaries
        Enhanced credibility of the government, as proven by its ability
                                                                              using sanitary facilities
          to deliver water and sanitation services to participating
                                                                              - Positive beneficiary perception of
          communities.
                                                                              government support for WSS service
                                                                              provision

8.      Additionally, while for SPF grants, indicators only reflected the PDOs, the initial IDA Results
indicators reflected both the PDO and the specific objectives. See Table 1 for the exact wording of the
development objectives and indicators in the original documents.




2
  The PAD defined “sustainable” as: tariffs at a level that finances O&M; 80% minimum of revenue collected; water
committees meet regularly; professional operators fulfill their contractual obligations. The PAD also defined “basic
sanitation systems” as any system that met the WHO -UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program definition of improved basic
sanitation.
3
  The SPF grant application stated that the given indicators were preliminary results, and the final versions would be
part of the project’s operation manual. The project operation manual gave (in French) the indicators shown in this table.


                                                              2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.       The Project was restructured on December 2, 2010, primarily to put in place a single, common set
of PDO- and intermediate-level indicators for both grants. As a result, (i) the SPF development objective of
enhanced government credibility would now be measured only by increased access to water and sanitation
services; and (ii) sustainability as an objective was dropped entirely. After restructuring, for all practical
purposes, the Project had now one objective, to increase the number of improved WSS facilities, and the
target for beneficiaries of improved water supplies was revised upwards, while the target for beneficiaries
of improved sanitation facilities was revised downwards, as explained in Table 2.

Table 2:         Revised PDO-level Indicators4 for IDA and SPF Grants
Revised PDO-level indicators             Comments
REVISED: People provided with            This indicator was revised to be consistent with Bank-wide Core Sector
access to “Improved Water Sources”       Indicators
under the project (number)
REVISED: Number of households            The target value for sanitation was revised downward mostly due to delays
using basic sanitation systems in        in recruiting a consultant or firm to lead the hygiene promotion and
participating localities                 sanitation activities.
DROPPED: Positive beneficiary            This indicator was deemed as impractical to measure in a meaningful way,
perception of government support for     and thus a poor indicator for the intended outcome
WSS service provision

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.      Poor and vulnerable citizens: The social analysis for the IDA grant concluded that the Project
would benefit the poorest and most underserved of Haiti’s citizens, particularly women and c hildren, by
virtue of the Project’s geographic focus on rural areas. The rural populations, roughly two-thirds of the total
population, were the poorest people in Haiti with 86 percent living on less than US$2 a day and 69 percent
on less than $1 a day.

11.     Selected communities located in the Sud Department: The beneficiaries would be located in the Sud
and Nippes departments where an IDB study had identified 40 communities eligible to be considered for the
project based on technical criteria. Eligibility criteria included: (i) the number of inhabitants had to be less
than 10,000; (ii) availability of a nearby, sufficiently productive, good quality source of water; (iii)
protection of the source or indication of willingness and likelihood that the source would be protected; (iv)
estimated per capita costs of less than US$150; (v) acceptance to pay volumetric tariffs covering operation
and routine maintenance (O&M) costs; (vi) acceptance of the professional operator model; and (vii)
payment of an up-front financial contribution (equivalent to an estimated 3 months of O&M costs) into a
fund managed by the water committee. If the above criteria did not reduce the number of eligible
communities sufficiently, the following additional criteria would be applied: lowest unit cost, and greatest
average walking distance to current sources.

12.     SNEP and CAEPs: Project documents identified public sector institutions as beneficiaries, because
the Project would work through government to strengthen sustainable service delivery. At project appraisal,
SNEP was the public sector institution which would receive assistance from the Project, the scope of which

4
 Intermediate outcomes indicators and target values were also revised but for different reasons: the difficulty in
measuring them; to harmonize the SPF and IDA indicators; and delays due to the 2009 hurricane and January 2010
earthquake.


                                                          3
would be based on a 2005 technical audit concluding that: (i) SNEP’s water service delivery capacity was
inadequate due to limited human and financial resources, particularly to the rural population, and due to the
lack of a control system for service quality. Donors generally concentrated their financial resources on
infrastructure, leaving SNEP with insufficient public resources to finance operation, management and
maintenance; (ii) management capacity in SNEP was deficient; and (iii) local water committees (CAEPs)
often did not receive support from SNEP to manage local water systems. Both the PAD and SPF documents
also highlighted the importance of providing support to these CAEPs, which later became water and
sanitation committees (CAEPAs), as well as to professional operators.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13.      The IDA Grant had two components and the SPF Grant had four. This difference was due to the
latter defining smaller and more specific components. This section describes in turn each IDA component,
along with its corresponding SPF components. The SPF Grant divided the water supply and
sanitation/hygiene activities into two distinct components.

14.     Component 1: Capacity Building and Project Management. The IDA activities under this
component comprised: (i) technical assistance and resources for the SNEP regional office in the Sud
Department; (ii) financing for SNEP to finalize and disseminate the national rural water and sanitation
strategy developed under the LICUS project; (iii) financing for project management, documentation,
reporting, information technology, environmental management, and financial audits; and (iv) financing for
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) surveys to measure indicators.

15.      The SPF capacity-building activities would finance training for: (i) community water and sanitation
committees (CAEPAs) and the community organization members formed under the Bank’s Community-
Driven Development (CDD) Project, PRODEP, in communication, community mobilization, conflict
resolution, and the roles of the various stakeholders under a professional operator management model; (ii)
professional operators (and CAEPAs if they choose to act as operators) in billing and accounting, meter
reading and repair, water disinfection, plumbing, community relations, and conflict resolution; (iii)
members from umbrella associations of the community organizations (COPRODEPs or Participatory
Project Development Councils) in how to form a water and sanitation sub-committee; and (iv) service
providers under the CDD and rural water projects in the form of annual departmental workshops to
exchange experiences. The SPF component for project management and M&E would fund consultant
services, equipment, and operating costs for SNEP.

16.       Component 2: Water Supply, basic sanitation and hygiene promotion. Water schemes, sanitation
facilities, and hygiene promotion activities would be in the approximately 12 communities selected to
receive the water schemes. The Project would finance interventions in:
     Water Supply: The Project would construct or rehabilitate piped water schemes, as well as boreholes
      equipped with handpumps, and put in place the professional operator management model. Water
      would be sold based on volume consumed through household connections and kiosks, at tariffs that
      would at a minimum, cover routine O&M costs. The Project focused on supporting SNEP in small
      towns of 1,000 to 10,000 people. Preliminary designs, social mobilization and supervision of works
      would be provided by an engineering firm throughout project implementation;
     Household Sanitation: The IDA Grant included financing for household latrine construction, including
      a subsidy, whereas the SPF grant specifically excluded any direct financing or subsidy for household
      latrines. Both grants would support activities to promote demand for household latrines. SPF would
      also finance training for local masons in household latrine construction;




                                                     4
     Institutional Sanitation: Both grants would support the construction of ‘’latrine blocks’’ or blocs
      sanitaires5 in schools and health centers;
     Hygiene Promotion: The service provider (private firm or NGO) in charge of sanitation activities
      would also conduct hygiene promotion campaigns in the project communities. The SPF application
      specified that this should include training for teachers, women leaders, water committee members, and
      the community organizations participating in the CDD project.

1.6 Revised Components

17.      Change in national sanitation strategy. With the creation of DINEPA came a new sanitation
strategy which prohibited household latrine subsidies, encouraging households to build, use and maintain
their own sanitation facilities, through the development of various incentive mechanisms, awareness and
education campaigns and training of local masons. This strategy had been under discussion and preparation
since at least 2008 and explains why the SPF Grant did not follow the IDA Grant component in subsidizing
household latrines. The household latrine construction aspect of the Project was dropped, and the focus
shifted to the construction of institutional latrines, as well as to hygiene and sanitation promotion.

18.      COPRODEPs. The first restructuring, approved in December 2010, changed the SPF capacity
building component by eliminating the proposed training to prepare COPRODEPs to establish water and
sanitation sub-committees for their councils and prepare communal water and sanitation investment plans.
COPRODEP funding was dropped in order to align the Project with the new institutional structure for the
sector which did not assign investment planning responsibilities to the COPRODEPs. Rather, CAEPAs and
the regional offices of the new DINEPA were supposed to cooperate in planning and procuring water and
sanitation investments, as well as promoting household sanitation.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.       Other significant changes included:
         SPF Funding. The SPF funding was approved two years after the IDA Grant was appraised, and
          came with a slightly different development objective, as well as additional indicators;
         Change in implementing agency, from SNEP to DINEPA. The 2010 restructuring approved the
          change in the project implementing agency, resulting from the new law in 2009 creating DINEPA,
          but the transition led to delays in implementation;
         Forego counterpart-funding. The January 2010 earthquake made government financing difficult
          and the requirement to provide US$250,000 in counterpart funding was foregone. This did not
          affect the achievement of the PDO;
         Change in Results Framework to consolidate monitoring for IDA and SPF financing. This
          change was part of the 2010 restructuring, and is further described in Section 2.3;
         No-cost extension of project closing. The World Bank approved a no-cost extension to the SPF
          Grant twice, to December 31, 2012 and November 30, 2013, respectively, to allow works to be
          completed. The completion of water supply and sanitation works had been delayed by: (i) natural
          disasters and the cholera epidemic; (ii) administrative delays from an extensive sector reform, and
          change in management of DINEPA; and (iii) political instability. The closing date extensions
          contributed to the achievement of project targets.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

20.     The project design for water supply drew on the positive experience of Bank projects in
Madagascar and Rwanda supporting new management models for piped water schemes, including service
delegation to a local private operator by the beneficiary community through a lease contract as well as the
Haiti LICUS Project. Given that the LICUS Project was quite limited (3 schemes), this project was
basically designed to test the management model at a larger scale.

21.     The new management model for piped water schemes was fully in line with the sector reforms that
were under discussion during project preparation and enacted during project implementation. The
government decision to seek an alternative management solution with professional operators was based on
the deteriorating performance of the community management of piped water schemes as revealed by a
national sector diagnostic and analysis carried out by the Government in 2005.

22.    The IDB had prepared a similar project (approximately US$15 million) in three adjoining
departments, which was approved in September 2006. Both projects were designed to use the same
implementing agency, operational manual and coordinator.

2.2 Implementation

23.    The Project was financed by two sources, namely a SDR3.4 million IDA Grant (P089839)
approved in December 2006 and a complementary US$5 million SPF Grant (P114936) approved in
November 2008. The first phase of implementation was dedicated to feasibility studies and social
mobilization activities prior to construction and rehabilitation of water systems.

24.      The new management model for water supply with professional operators proved promising. Two
reasons that communities accepted the professional operators were: (i) the role given to communities in
selecting their operators, and (ii) the operators being members of the community. The initial planning did
not include sufficient resources for social mobilization after construction, as capacity-building for
professional operators and CAEPAs, but this deficiency was eventually corrected during implementation.
Despite the communities expressing general acceptance of the new model in public meetings, several
factors can explain resistance in the first years of implementation:
    An indirect consequence of the earthquake, bringing in a number of organizations providing free
     services as relief, which in turn had a negative impact on community attitudes toward a management
     model based on paying for water according to volumes consumed;
    Some local politicians campaigned on promises to reduce the tariff or provide free water; and
    The professional operators lacked clear directives and support from DINEPA or the mayors regarding
     disconnection of water services due to nonpayment. Furthermore, recruitment of operators was
     initially slowed down by the lack of interest from the private sector (firms), and the approach had to be
     reformulated to focus instead on local candidates.

25.     The selection procedures for communities also worked well, but it was noted that some aspects
needed to be improved such as: (i) how to accommodate the demand and interest from initially reluctant
communities, as they watch implementation proceed in the selected communities, and (ii) how to integrate
water source protection activities and incentives into the model.



                                                      6
26.     The engineering firm implemented social mobilization activities prior to construction, 6 and
SNEP/DINEPA provided capacity-building support to the CAEPAs and professional operators during and
after construction. In addition, the Project recruited an international consultant to support the professional
operators and the then German Development Service (DED) provided technical assistance to support
operator training and CAEPA capacity-building.

27.      The Project was strategically restructured in 2010 to simplify and update the results framework as
well as to adapt to DINEPA’s new sanitation strategy. The Project shifted from household latrine subsidies
to institutional latrine construction as well as hygiene and sanitation promotion. Procurement delays in
selecting the firm in charge of the sanitation activities also limited the construction of institutional latrines
in only a portion of the communities served by the water schemes.

28.    Other factors affecting implementation:
   Natural disasters and epidemics: Hurricanes, the 2010 earthquake and the subsequent cholera
    epidemic required government agencies to place priority on emergency activities. This led to a
    considerable amount of project funding being reallocated to emergency responses. Additionally, some
    local construction firms had suffered losses or had demobilized following these events;
   Passage of the 2009 Water Framework Law: The transfer of staff and authority from SNEP to
    DINEPA delayed project implementation. The final transfer of authority and amendment of subsidiary
    agreements were completed in March 2011. Political uncertainty in Haiti exacerbated this problem.

29.    It is important to note that, despite the natural disasters, cholera epidemic and political instability,
DINEPA’s institutional response was strong and maintained the project on track throughout
implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

30.     The system for monitoring construction and activity implementation functioned adequately. This
system comprised reports from the implementing agency and frequent World Bank supervision missions.
However, the system for monitoring PDO and intermediate results suffered from a number of indicators
impractical to measure over the life of the project, overly ambitious initial targets, as well as the initial lack
of harmonization between the different indicators for the IDA and SPF results frameworks.

31.     M&E Design. The M&E design suffered from two main problems: (i) separate sets of indicators for
the IDA, SPF, and IDB financing of the program; and (ii) poorly defined indicators in some cases. Initial
project design planned for consultants to design and implement surveys to collect most of the required data,
offering little prospect for putting in place a sustainable M&E system.

32.      M&E Implementation. The 2010 project restructuring allowed harmonization of the results
framework from the different sources of financing, consolidating targets and simplifying monitoring
arrangements. The revised framework was more pragmatic and indicators were more easily measurable and
relevant to the reality on the ground. No indicators for institutional sanitation were included, despite this
becoming the major focus of the sanitation and hygiene promotion activities. The Results indicators were
also aligned to the Bank’s core sector indicators in 2010 and targets were revised, at a time when the first
waterworks had been completed, and sanitation activities had not yet started. Also, DINEPA had plans to
develop a sector M&E system with which the project’s system would be aligned. Despite the initial

professional operator, and forming CAEPAs.


                                                        7
problems with the design and lack of clarity on some results indicators (for example “Percent of target
audience receiving training on hygiene and sanitation in communities”), the M&E design had no negative
impact on project implementation.

33.    The final figures for the PDO- and intermediate-level indicators were agreed upon by the DINEPA
Coordinator and ICR Team based on a review of information gathered in supervision missions and the
hygiene and sanitation consultant reports, supplemented by the Coordinator’s first -hand knowledge of the
schemes and interactions with the various professional operators.

34.    M&E Utilization. Information on progress from reports and supervision missions was closely
reviewed and used to take actions to deal with implementation delays. Data on the various results indicators
were systematically used to inform decision-making or resource allocation in the course of the Project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.      Safeguards. The Project triggered the safeguard policies on environmental assessment, natural
habitats, and cultural property, and was classified as Category B. An Environmental Assessment report and
an Environmental and Social Management Framework were prepared. In December 2009, the
environmental management frameworks for the IDA, SPF and IDB projects were consolidated. The
implementation of potential environmental and social impacts mitigation measures which, for all sub-
projects were only minor, went well, but overall safeguards compliance was rated “Moderately
Satisfactory” as monitoring and documentation were not performed systematically.

36.     The main environmental concerns were to: (i) protect the catchment area and source from pollution
and degradation; (ii) select scheme sites that were safe from flooding, washouts and landslides; (iii) control
wastage of water water points; (iv) mitigate pollution, nuisance and accidents during construction; and (v)
take proper measures in case of archeological discoveries and in protected areas. To address these concerns,
each feasibility study had to include an environmental management plan. DINEPA’s environmental
safeguards monitoring capacity throughout implementation depended heavily on the engineering firm which
developed the feasibility studies. No dedicated DINEPA environmental specialist was in place.

37.      A December 2011 supervision mission noted a number of environmental issues, namely: (i) lack of
protection of areas around the source in Arniquet and Cavaillon; (ii) inadequate drainage around the kiosks
and standposts; (iii) faucets left continuously open at some standposts, exacerbating the drainage problem;
and (iv) guidelines on latrine location were not disseminated. These issues were later fixed and helped to
improve the remaining works financed under the Project. Completed works throughout the Project also did
not interfere with natural habitats or physical cultural resources.

38.     DINEPA’s capacity in monitoring the Project’s social aspects was adequate. The Involuntary
Resettlement policy was not triggered and no specific problems were identified, but documentation of
resolved issues, such as negotiating the price of water with residents living close to water sources, was not
systematically performed and was done on an ad-hoc basis.

39.     Fiduciary Compliance. Financial management was rated “Moderately Satisfactory” throughout the
project period. The problems affecting the management of project funds included: (i) continued use of
Excel, rather than the DINEPA financial accounting software (ACCPAC), due to technical problems; (ii)
late submission of audit reports; (iii) budget management based on the global allocation of annual funds to
the project, rather than a budget for the estimated cost of implementing activities; and (iv) a delay in the
bank account reconciliation. In addition, a 2011 supervision mission observed that professional operators


                                                      8
needed more training in financial management. Procurement was also rated “Moderately Satisfactory”
throughout project implementation, mainly due to delays related to the preparation of bidding documents.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

40.      A key goal of the Project was to introduce a new water management model based on professional
operators, which will have greater prospects for sustainable water services. A new project (estimated US$30
million) is under preparation, which will build on the lessons learned from the implementation of this model
and expand to other regions of Haiti, particularly in zones affected by cholera. Additionally, the World
Bank, through the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) financed a study tour to Benin so that stakeholders
could learn from the implementation of a national strategy for supporting private operators for rural water
supply. The new operation will seek to include the main findings from the Benin trip and adapt them to the
Haitian context, including: (i) gradually decentralizing planning and execution to local government levels;
and (ii) preparing the WSS sector for a shift from a project approach to a programmatic approach. A budget
support operation7 with inputs for the water sector will also strengthen the enabling environment for the
project. A similar World Bank-assisted budget support operation in Benin in the early 2000’s was
instrumental in laying the foundation for the expansion of private operators for rural piped schemes.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial
41.     Increased access to improved water supplies and basic sanitation remain priorities, especially given
the Bank’s interest in contributing to the elimination of cholera from Haiti. The PDO-level indicator for
water services began with the dual goals of increasing access and sustainability, but it was eventually
reinterpreted to focus on access. The thrust of the Project, however, was to put in place a management
model that would deliver sustainable water services.

42.      Although the PDO related to sanitation was successfully achieved, the strategy and approach
toward sanitation proved more challenging, given DINEPA’s change in sanitation strategy during project
implementation which ruled out household latrine subsidies. As a result, a stronger emphasis was given to
institutional over household sanitation, and hygiene and sanitation promotion were implemented on a
smaller scale than originally planned.

43.      Water and sanitation remain highly relevant to Haiti’s current development priorities, as indicated
in the Government of Haiti’s Strategic Development Plan (PSDH) to become an emerging country by 2030
and 3-year investment plan for 2014-2016. Additionally, by increasing access to drinking water and
sanitation, the Project’s objectives are consistent with the current World Bank Group’s Interim Strategy
Note for Haiti FY13-FY14 (Report # 71885-HT) discussed by the Executive Directors on September 27,
2012, particularly with regards to reducing Haiti’s vulnerability to cholera. The Project also supports the
World Bank’s twin goals of reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity, as reflected by its objective
of increasing access to basic services in rural areas where the highest poverty levels are still found.

3.2 Efficacy

Rating: Substantial
44.     Increased access to water supply services. The Project has successfully increased access to water
services in participating rural communities, by providing 59,367 people with access to improved water
supplies in 15 communities. This corresponds to a 116 percent target achievement. Additionally, 8 piped
systems were rehabilitated, 4 piped systems were constructed, and 3 communities were served with a total
of 8 handpumps. This corresponds to a 137 percent target achievement.

45.     Increased level of service. As a result of the Project, 1,598 new piped household water connections
were installed and 159 improved community water points were constructed or rehabilitated. Over 20
percent of the households in the project area now have a private connection to the water network, compared
with 8 percent in 2008. This also favorably compares with the rural proportion of Haitians with a household
connection to a piped system (5 percent in 2011).8 Additionally, an evaluation of project results estimated
that the average water consumption at household connections was 30 liters of water per capita per day
(lpcd) and 19 lpcd at kiosks. For this consumption, households paid between 150 and 250 gourdes per
month (between US$3.50 and 5.75 per month), a rate which allows operators to cover operating and
maintenance costs.

46.     Sustained quality of drinking water. As a result of the Project, every drinking water system
constructed or rehabilitated under the Project is equipped with a chlorinator and every operator uses a kit to
measure residual chlorine (a proxy for water quality). These analyses are performed by the operator and the
TEPACs and results are incorporated into the national water quality monitoring system called SISKLOR.
Water distributed by the systems financed under this Project has consistently complied with safe drinking
water standards in place in Haiti, of particular importance in the context of the cholera epidemic.
Additionally, close to 50 percent of the survey respondents (see Section 3.6 for description of survey)
pointed to the quality of water as the reason why they asked to be connected to the network or why they
chose to use kiosks for their water needs.

47.      Increased access to and use of sanitation at household and institutional levels. The Project
successfully contributed to increasing access to and use of sanitation to 4,964 households in the 7
communities targeted for this intervention. This corresponds to a 122 percent target achievement, despite
the reduced target audience receiving training on hygiene and sanitation and reduced number of masons
trained in these communities. According to field surveys, 27.5 percent of households have built, with their
own resources, a latrine in the last 5 years, following sanitation and hygiene promotion campaigns under the
Project and other organizations present in the zone. This increased the proportion of households owning and
using a latrine to about 81 percent,9 which compares favorably with the Haiti rural coverage figure of 59
percent, as shown in the WHO-UNICEF 2013 Progress Report. In addition, sanitation was improved in one
health center and 14 schools which received a total of 25 new or rehabilitated latrine blocks to benefit 5,547
students and teachers.

48.      Enhanced social stability and state credibility. The Project contributed to improved social
stability and state credibility, as suggested in the beneficiary survey which shows that beneficiary
communities are satisfied with the water service provided, as well as by the general acceptance of the new
management professional operator model and the water services it delivers. According to the beneficiary
survey:

 Although the beneficiary survey did not systematically verify whether the latrines were being used in every surveyed
household, usage was confirmed on a number of occasions throughout project implementation.


                                                         10
    77 percent of surveyed households with a connection to the network have expressed confidence in the
     quality of the treated water, compared with 15 percent in 2008;
    67 percent of surveyed kiosk users have expressed confidence in the quality of the treated water,
     compared with less than 4 percent in 2008;
    Over 80 percent of the clients (household connections and kiosks) are satisfied with the private
     operator and expressed their support and desire in maintaining the new management model;
    65 percent of the surveyed users at water kiosks have expressed their interest in requesting a household
     connection.

49.      While it is uncertain whether water supply interventions financed by the Project directly improved
social stability in the selected communities, the improved infrastructure and level of service were able to
provide water of acceptable quantity and quality to customers who had to deal with water stresses related to
natural disasters and a cholera epidemic. Additionally, facilities were not vandalized or misused (except in
one case where a local politician ordered the transmission line from one of the Bank-financed systems to be
diverted to provide water to a neighboring community not included in the project) and solar panels were not
stolen, as originally feared during project preparation.

50.      Capacity of the implementing agency, local water committees and professional operators
strengthened. The Project successfully strengthened the key actors in delivering sustainable water services
to rural populations, including in project management, financial management technical O&M, community
relations, chlorination and social mobilization. These have had their challenges over the life of the Project,
but the new piped water scheme management model piloted under the Project now seems to be well
established. This model was successfully implemented in 9 communities who have signed a contract with
an operator and a model based on a management committee (CAEPA or other) was put in place in 6 smaller
communities. Fifteen CAEPAs were created in line with the 2009 sector framework law. Eight of these
systems have been operational for over 3 years now, with various degrees of efficiency and cost recovery.
To address this variability, the project team worked on defining performance indicators for these operators
during a workshop in October 2013. Professional operators still require support and training from DINEPA.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial
51.     As the location of project activities was not determined at the time of appraisal, the PAD’s
economic analysis focused on providing screening tools for selecting sub-projects. A cut-off value
(US$170) for per capita investment levels was determined, under which sub-projects would likely achieve
an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) higher than 12 percent and could be accepted without further
analysis. The overall EIRR and the net present value (NPV) of the Project were not provided in the PAD.
The SPF documentation did not include any economic analysis.

52.      Therefore, the ex-post economic analysis follows a different approach and consists of a cost-benefit
analysis of the water supply investments (representing about 71 percent of the overall base costs of the
project), for which quantifiable benefits can be measured (value of the additional consumption of safe water
and costs savings accruing to project beneficiaries). The analysis was carried out for each sub-project as
well as for the overall project, and estimates for the EIRR and NPV (with a 10 percent discount rate) stand
at 10.0 percent and 0.10 US$ million. The average investment cost per capita was US$118.

53.     The EIRR of the individual sub-projects spreads from -4.3 percent (in Fonds des Blancs, which is
penalized by cost overruns due to the low success rate of drilling) to 18.9 percent (in Arniquet, which



                                                     11
benefits from the lowest per capita investment cost of all piped systems), with a majority of sub-projects
having an EIRR close or higher than the 12 percent cut-off rate set in the PAD. In hindsight, it seems that
the PAD overestimated the water demand by relying on optimistic time savings assumptions and the overall
EIRR of 10 percent is considered as satisfactory, given the challenging environment. The ex-post efficiency
is therefore rated as “Substantial”. Annex 3 presents the results in more detail.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
54.      The rating for Overall Outcome is “Satisfactory”. The new management model for water supply has
proved promising, contributing to the achievement of the PDOs related to water supply, sanitation, social
stability and state credibility, as well as capacity building. Relevance, efficacy and efficiency were all rated
“Substantial”.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
55.     Poverty. In reaching the PDO and its targets for sanitation and hygiene promotion, the Project
provided water supply services to the beneficiaries described in Section 1.4, one of the poorest and most
vulnerable populations in the Western Hemisphere. Preliminary results of the 2012 Household Living
Standards Survey indicate that, while extreme poverty has declined in Haiti from 2000 to 2012 by 7.5
percent, particularly in urban areas, poverty headcounts have remained high in rural areas with 38 percent
(extreme poverty) and 75 percent (moderate poverty) respectively.

56.      Gender aspects. In the beneficiary survey, it was found that fetching water is a task mostly
undertaken by women (24 percent) and girls (39 percent). By providing household connections, kiosks
strategically positioned in town centers, as well as standposts along the transmission lines, the Project
contributed to time savings, especially for women and girls, who can dedicate time to other revenue-
generating activities or education. Additionally, of the 28 trainers and 28 community workers trained in the
Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) approach, 22 were women, highlighting the
importance of women in behavioral change activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
57.      The Project supported the Haitian government’s commendable efforts to put in place a new
institutional structure for the sector. The implementing agency, DINEPA, is a pivotal organization in the
new structure and received considerable support. The implementing agency’s low project management
capacity, as identified in the 2005 technical audit of SNEP, was successfully addressed during project
implementation and considerably strengthened with specialized training. Capacity-building for professional
operators, such as provided by the Project, was equally key to developing new and more sustainable
management models for the Haitian rural water sector.

58.      DINEPA’s decentralized structures (OREPAs, URDs and TEPACs) came into existence during
project implementation and were involved as soon as their training had been completed. They are now fully
in place and are gradually assuming the supervision of the systems developed under the Project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

59.     The WSP financed a project results assessment, which included the implementation of a survey to
324 beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries in 6 out of the 15 communities assisted through IDA and SPF
financing. The survey results suggest the following:
    As many as 37 percent of the households with a connection sold water to their neighbors;
    The price for water bought from an on-premise connection is similar to the price at a kiosk (up to 2
     gourdes per bokit – US 5 gallon or 18.9 liter container);
    Most people who currently do not have an on-premise connection hope to get one eventually. The
     principal reason given for not having one is that the people live in an area too far from, or inaccessible
     (too elevated) by, the network ;
    The majority of consumers believe the water is safe to drink: 73 percent of users with a household
     connection have confidence in the network’s water quality and the proportion of users treating at home
     the water fetched at water points such as kiosks and standposts has decreased from 96 (before the
     Project) to 33 percent (after the Project);
    95 percent of both kiosk users and household connection holders prefer management by a professional
     operator rather than by the CAEPA.

60.     The above findings suggest that communities now accept the model of professional management
based on generating revenue through the sale of water by volume. However, these findings do not take into
account the many households with on-premise connections prior to the Project who often did not allow the
professional operator to install meters on their connections. This points to continued social mobilization and
education campaigns prior to, during and after the implementation of works in communities.

61.    Comments from CAEPA members and professional operators during a stakeholder workshop in
October 2013 also indicate broad support for the new management model (see Annex 5).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
62.      The beneficiary survey and stakeholder workshop indicate a high commitment among consumers to
the new management model and their satisfaction of the quality of service is high. The government and
DINEPA are also committed, as evidenced by their support for this Project and the legislation passed for the
sector in 2009. Nonetheless, moderate risks remain, among them many exogenous factors resulting from the
context of fragility, lack of resources and political instability in Haiti.
    Institutional: The financial dependency of DINEPA, particularly its decentralized structures on donor
     funding interferes with the consolidation and sustainability of the decentralized institutional structure
     in place in the medium and long terms. Around 90 percent of DINEPA’s operating expenses are
     financed with donor funding and not by the Treasury of the State. The Bank’s new operation and other
     donors aim to support DINEPA in building sustainable structures in the longer term;
    Environmental: Deforestation and agricultural practices threaten the quantity and quality of water
     sources;10
    Natural disasters: The past record of hurricanes and earthquakes indicates risks for the future;11

10
   In 2011, the forest area in Haiti was 3.6 percent of its territory (World Bank Indicators). This area has decreased by
nearly 13 percent from 1990 to 2010 (UNDP).
11
   Haiti ranks as one of the countries with the highest exposure to multiple natural hazards with 96.5 percent of its
population living at risk, as well as with the highest vulnerability to hurricanes among the region’s small island states
with 13 deaths per million exposed.


                                                            13
    Social: The management model and volumetric billing approaches and their value added in terms of
     sustainability of the service are only viable in the long run if they are implemented at scale, which
     DINEPA intends to do, with the support of the new Bank operation as well as other donors. The
     existence of different management models or tariffs in communities may put at risk the sustainability
     of volumetric billing and the viability of the professional operator management model;
    Financial: The revenue collection rate for professional operators has reached an average of 50 percent,
     up to 66 percent, and the operators currently set aside an average of 8 percent of revenues for
     maintenance. It is also to be noted that even though operators received initial start-up funds and water
     meters, they do not benefit from government subsidies for operation and maintenance. However, this
     balance remains fragile and CAEPAs and operators need support after they have been put in place,
     mostly related to commercial aspects to increase revenue collection.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
63.      The project design built on the LICUS pilot project which had tested a professional operator model.
The project designers also drew on experiences with this model in Africa. The collaboration with the IDB in
testing this model further was commendable. As a result, better managed water schemes have been put in
place in a number of communities, and the implementing agency has gained experience with this
management model. Despite the initial problems with the design, the M&E design had no negative impact
on project implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
64.      The Project was closely supervised and action taken to keep construction and activity
implementation moving forward, and delays in contracting and progress were mostly due to severe
conditions in Haiti such as natural disasters and political instability. The Bank Team strategically used
restructuring to adapt to DINEPA’s change in policy with regards to sanitation and issues with the original
M&E system design were also addressed. Additionally, Bank staff arranged a highly successful study visit
to Benin, which contributed to strengthening planning for the next project. One area in which Bank
supervision could have been improved was environmental monitoring by increasing the number of missions
including an environmental specialist, as DINEPA’s capacity was low in that aspect.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
65.     The rating for Overall Bank Performance is “Satisfactory”, mainly due to the incorporation of
lessons learned from Bank experience in other countries and Haiti, to its engagement with partners such as
the IDB and the DED to implement a joint rural WSS program, to the strategic us of restructuring to adapt
to DINEPA’s change in policy with regards to sanitation and issues with the original M&E system design ,
as well as to the quality of supervision.




                                                     14
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
66.     The Government passed legislation that put in place an institutional structure that was supportive of
the project objectives. This caused problems for the Project initially in that the implementing agency
changed (from SNEP to DINEPA) and this transition held up implementation for many months.
Outweighing these short-term delays is the long-term government commitment to sector reform, giving
DINEPA’s autonomy to make strategic decisions for the sector, and a coordinated use of donor funds.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
67.      Throughout project implementation, DINEPA showed commitment, vision and flexibility to adapt
and learn from other countries, in the numerous visits to Central America, as well as to the Dominican
Republic and Benin. DINEPA also maintained the same core team during the entire project implementation
period, bringing continuity to an environment constantly challenged by external shocks. Financial
management and procurement by DINEPA were rated “Moderately Satisfactory” and DINEPA also lacked
capacity in environmental safeguards compliance and monitoring, but these shortcomings proved to be
minor in the light of the Project’s achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance. Some
allowance should also be made to the fact that DINEPA only came into existence after the Project was
underway, at a time when Haiti faced many water and sanitation crises due to natural disasters. The
DINEPA Project Coordinator’s 30-year experience in the rural WSS sector as well as constant presence on
the ground, negotiation skills and timely delivery of information and procurement documents were also a
central piece to the success of this project.

68.      During project implementation, DINEPA also developed a number of initiatives for the rural sub-
sector which further highlight its commitment to bringing sustainable WSS services to these populations.
Two examples are the development of: (i) a performance indicator monitoring system for rural water supply
and (ii) the SISKLOR water quality monitoring system which publishes, on a monthly basis, information on
chlorine residuals in urban and rural water systems across the country.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
69.     The rating for Overall Borrower Performance is “Satisfactory” mainly due to the Government’s
commitment to sector reform and the quality of implementation from DINEPA and its staff.

6. Lessons Learned

70.     Rural communities are willing to accept a new management model using a professional
operator model and payment for water based on volume consumed. It was not certain at the project
outset that consumers would accept professional operators and water payments based on the volume of
water consumed. However overall, the consumers have accepted these changes, and, according to the
beneficiary survey, prefer this approach to the previous model. The success stems in part from (i) the role
given to communities in selecting their operators, and (ii) the operators being members of the community.
Nonetheless, this model remains fragile. Once they are put in place, the CAEPAs and professional operators
require additional training and technical assistance that the lower tiers of DINEPA (OREPAs, URDs and
TEPACs) are hard-pressed to provide, due to understaffing and lack of other resources. Additionally,
professional operators must be selected before the construction of water supply systems in order to enable
them to acquire a better knowledge of the network they are about to manage.



                                                      15
71.     The maintenance responsibilities for institutional latrines should be agreed upon before
construction begins. The project approach focused mainly on construction, with the consequence that
latrine maintenance in some of the schools was poor. Interventions should also bring a connection to the
water network, as well as arrangements for cleaning latrines.

72.     A better mechanism for source protection needs to be developed. The environmental
management plans for source protection did not prevent intrusion and environmental degradation in the
various catchment areas. The problem was that communities and people benefiting from the schemes had
limited means to prevent intrusion into the catchment areas by others not served by the schemes and forest
coverage in catchment areas was not sufficient. Infrastructure to protect water sources should be coupled
with the involvement of local farmers or landowners, with schemes such as simplified payment for
environmental services.

73.      Finding the right match for South-South knowledge exchanges improved the operators’
commitment and confidence in this new profession. Throughout project implementation, South-South
knowledge exchanges (Dominican Republic and Benin), as well as regional workshops with operators from
across Haiti (including those from communities supported by the IDB) allowed operators to exchange with
their peers and strengthen themselves on a number of topics, such as community relations and billing and
collection, proving valuable in creating long term operators. Despite challenges with billed revenue
collection, operators are interested in continuing to operate the systems.

74.      The exchange with Benin was particularly relevant in that it provided Haiti with a case of a country
which had dramatically increased rural access to water supply, with similar vision and challenges. Among
the lessons learned during the exchanges between Haiti's professional operators and their peers from Benin
were: (i) creating a nationwide operators umbrella association to bring mutual support for technical issues,
community relations and conflict resolution; and (ii) ensuring that the personnel in charge of operating the
systems and collecting bills are from the community, even if the manager to which the service has been
delegated can be from another community and manage several systems. Lessons from South-South
exchanges will serve to improve the design of new operations in Haiti.

75.      Engaging in sector transformation with a long-term programmatic approach has a lasting
impact. The decade-long Bank engagement in the WSS sector in Haiti started at a time when the sector was
struggling with investment and capacity in rural areas. Local communities did not maintain infrastructure
well and many rural water systems were managed by water committees often consisting of unpaid
volunteers elected by the community. The performance of water committees varied widely, but most water
committees lacked the capacity or were unwilling to perform their functions adequately and collected
insufficient funds for operation and routine maintenance.
    The Bank deployed the LICUS Grant to explore innovative options to deliver sustainable water supply
     services to rural populations, adapting experience from Africa to the Haitian context. This included the
     piloting of professional operators and the replacement of standposts serving free water by water kiosks
     at which water was to be sold in buckets;
    This positive experience led to a regional scale-up of the experience with the professional operators,
     with IDA and SPF funds. In this effort, DINEPA was also able to leverage support from other partners
     such as the IDB and the DED to increase the scope of this regional program. The program used the
     same project coordinator, operations manual, environmental management framework and
     implementation arrangements, allowing for a more efficient and effective use of resources, decreasing
     the demands on the implementing agency;



                                                     16
    The lessons learned in this operation as well as from South-South exchanges will allow DINEPA to
     further scale-up the use of professional operators to a national scale, with the support of the new Bank
     operation under preparation.

76.     Development objectives and intermediate results for different funding to the same project
need to be harmonized. The differences in the objectives and intermediate results for the IDA, SPF and
IDB financing meant that three separate results frameworks were developed for the operational manual.
This was a highly complex approach to introduce to a new agency in a country context where monitoring
systems are generally weak and need to be strengthened. In a context of fragility, results frameworks need
to be pragmatic and indicators easily measurable to avoid confusion and complexity in reporting.

                                          roles of various stakeholders and the supervision of professional
                                          operators. Professional operators were trained in billing and
                                          accounting, meter reading and repair, water disinfection, plumbing, as
                                          well as in social mobilization and conflict resolution;
                                         Following the cholera epidemic, a number of members of CAEPAs,
                                          professional operators and plumbers were trained in disinfection and in

Note: All of the above schemes are located in the Sud Department, with the exception of Fond Tortue, Fond des Nègres, and St- Michel/Dimizaine which are
located in the Nippes Department. Non-functioning kiosks have been closed mainly because of an insufficient number of paying customers to make service
viable at these water points. Non-functioning standposts have been closed because the users did not shut off the faucets, decreasing the pressure in the network
for users downstream.

Professional operators typically collect payment by the bokit (US 5 gallon or 18.9 liter container) at kiosks and by the metered m3 at the household level.
Operators have specific tariff structures in each community, but it typically includes a standard number of m3 at a fixed price and an incremental portion for
additional m3.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Economic Analysis Section of this Annex aims to assess the economic impact of the water
supply investments of the project through a cost-benefit analysis. The Financial Analysis Section
aims to assess the financial viability of water services delivered by professional operators.

A. Economic Analysis

Methodology and Scope
The methodology used in the ex-post analysis differs from the PAD, which followed a specific
approach. The location of project investments was not defined at the time of the PAD, and the
economic analysis then focused on providing screening instruments for selecting sub-projects.
The PAD determined a cut-off value (U$170) for per capita investment levels, under which sub-
projects could be accepted without further analysis. The threshold was computed on the basis of
the results of household surveys of water supplies and consumption that were previously carried
out in three departments of Haiti (Artibonite, Grand Anse and Ouest). The benefits that were
expected to accrue to potential sub-project beneficiaries consisted of time savings valued with
opportunity costs (based on daily wages in the agricultural sector) and increased water
consumption.

As in the PAD, the ex-post economic analysis consists of a cost-benefit analysis that is carried out
on the water supply sub-projects. Project benefits are the benefits accruing to the actual project
beneficiaries, which may be measured by using the results of the survey of beneficiaries and of
the results evaluation study that were carried out in November 2013, complemented by estimates
of benefits for the facilities that were not yet in operation at that time. Project costs include the
direct investment costs in piped systems and water points (boreholes equipped with handpumps),
the additional implementation costs, and the operating costs. All calculations are carried out over
a 20-year period, using constant prices and excluding taxes and transfer payments.

Water Supply Investments
The investment costs associated with water supply are drawn from the disbursement and
procurement data. They include: (i) direct costs of facilities; (ii) consultants services for design,
community outreach and works supervision; and (iii) implementation support costs. The total
investment costs are thus estimated at US$7.02 million, i.e. 71 percent of the total disbursements
under the IDA and SPF grants.

The average per capita investment cost is well below the cut-off value specified in the PAD
economic analysis. Only two individual centers (St-Michel and Fonds des Blancs) are above the
threshold. In the latter case, this is attributable to a low success rate of drilling, which was
unpredictable.

Household Supply Sources and Water Demand
The survey of beneficiaries – carried out in eight centers supplied by piped systems – and the
evaluation study were used to assess the main source of supply and the average daily water
consumption of the households. The resulting estimates are given in the table below.

                   Table 3-2: Supply Sources and Water Demand (Piped Systems)
                                                 Kiosks           Standposts       HH Connection

  †
      1 bokit = 5 US gallons (18.9 liters)

The survey shows that 37 percent of households with a private connection share it with other
households (on average 1.9 households), so that a connection serves on average 9 people. The
high numbers of persons served per kiosk or standpost reflect the impact of the frequent closing
of facilities by the operators, following excessive spillage or non-payment (see Table 3 of
Annex 2).




                                                 25
The survey also provides information on the source of water used by the households before the
Project. The figure below shows that the current users of private connections were more likely to
be supplied by distant sources (spring and river) than the users of kiosks, of whom 87 percent
were supplied by closer sources (private wells or standposts).

Project Benefits
In the “without project” situation, the population had no access to safe water. This is confirmed
by the fact that 90 percent of the households currently served by connections and 96 percent of
the households currently served by kiosks and standposts used water treatment. Therefore
benefits are associated with the total water consumption of the served population.

The PAD analysis relied on estimates of time savings to determine the value of water and the
consumer surplus. Estimating ex-post time savings is, however, quite challenging in the absence
of adequate quantified information on average times for fetching water before and after the
project. In addition, time savings are quoted by about 40 percent of the beneficiaries as the main
reason to shift to the new sources of supply.

Therefore, the assessment of the benefits in the ex-post analysis is based on: (i) the actual
willingness-to-pay as a proxy of the value of water; and (ii) the cost savings accruing to
beneficiaries. The currently applicable water rates are given in the table below.

The above rates may not always coincide with the actual willingness-to-pay. They often result
from political interferences pushing for a revision of the original tariff, particularly to increase the
volume included in the monthly fee paid for private connections (which leads in practice to a flat
fee for all consumers, irrespective of their actual consumption). By contrast, a vast majority of
surveyed households agreed with the statement that water users should be billed in accordance
with the volume they consumed. Therefore, the analysis is based on a reference rate schedule
consisting of a 3 m3 volume included in the monthly fee and an additional rate of HTG 50 for
each m3 consumed above this threshold (or the actual additional rate, if higher). The water
consumed at the kiosks, standposts or water points is valued at HTG 1 per bokit (or the actual rate,
if higher).

The beneficiaries also save costs associated with the treatment of water. This applies to 80
percent of beneficiaries, who previously boiled water before use and are now satisfied with the
quality of piped water. The cost of treatment is estimated, by reference to international standards,
to about US$2 per month per household.

Incremental Costs
The evaluation study provided some information on the annual expenditures of 6 private
operators, which is summarized in the table below. The expenditures include staff costs
maintenance and other expenditures. In the absence further information, it is assumed that
expenditures are mainly related to the number of people served.

The EIRR of nine of the 15 sub-projects is close or higher than the 12 percent cut-off value used
in the PAD. The individual EIRRs are closely correlated to the per capita investment cost of the
sub-projects. The overall outcome, albeit satisfactory, is mainly attributable to a water demand
that is lower than anticipated in the PAD. The PAD, using time savings estimates that are likely
higher than the actual ones, assumed a per capita daily consumption that was twice as high as the
actual demand.

B. Financial Analysis

Financial Information. The evaluation study points out several weaknesses that impact the
reliability and integrity of the financial information available from private operators: (i) the
agreed reporting forms are not used; (ii) water sales at kiosks and standposts are not correctly
reported; and (iii) water sales at connections are generally under-billed and metering is not
properly used. These findings are confirmed by a comparison between the revenues reported by
the operators with the potential revenues estimated in the economic analysis, which shows a



                                                  28
substantial differences, even though the assumptions of the economic analysis are very
conservative.

Financial Viability. The current shortcomings of the financial information available from the
operators make the assessment of their financial viability particularly challenging. The data
provided in the Evaluation study show that only one operator (Simon) is likely to cover its
operating costs in a sustainable manner, while the other operators may restrict expenditures to a
level consistent with their cash-flows. Implementing the recommendations of the Evaluation
study regarding the application of more realistic water rates and a continuation of support to the
operators appear as necessary conditions to restore financial viability.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results and Stakeholder Workshop Report and
Results

DINEPA organized a workshop for professional operators and CAEPA members from both
World Bank and IDB project areas in late October 2013. The main recommendations and lessons
learned were as follows:
     More community participation in water scheme construction;
     Train young residents as plumbers;
     Provide more resources (transport, offices, etc.) to the CAEPAs;
     Install meters on all household connections in a future project;
     Construct kiosks in areas where household connections are not possible, and sell water at
        0.5 HTG per bokit (equivalent to 18.9 L);
     Better revenue management;
     Educate people about open defecation and building household latrines.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The main conclusions from the DINEPA ICR report (in French) are listed below.

Main difficulties encountered during implementation:
    Changing people’s attitude toward payment for water based on volume, especially when
       politicians continued to espouse idea that water should be free;
    The transition from SNEP and other local structures to DINEPA and the new institutional
       governance structure for the sector;
    Hurricanes and 2010 earthquake.

Challenges
    The Project schemes that require payment are near other schemes that continue to use the
       traditional free and minimal payment systems;
    The rural departmental units (URDs) that are supposed to provide support to the
       professional operators after project completion are not large enough to cover all 37
       operators (from World Bank and IDB projects) in 3 departments.

Recommendations
    The CAEPAs and professional operators need technical assistance to continue to support
      them;
    All water schemes in a given area should be rehabilitated and placed under the same
      management system;
    The government should subsidize the routine operation costs of water schemes with
      pumped distribution;
    The professional operators should receive materials and other subsidies for the first three
      years, as the schemes are not immediately profitable.

Next Steps
    Apply the professional operator model at the national level;
    Replicate this project in other regions;
    Reinforce the CAEPAs and professional operators;
    Develop good indicators for the M&E system;
    Make the CAEPAs more dynamic;
    Encourage residents to protect the catchment areas;
    Provide water to neighboring villages using the same management model;
    Construct or rehabilitate an additional 20 schemes serving 500,000 consumers.
