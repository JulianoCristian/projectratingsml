                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Development Objective: Increase access to and use of water supply and sanitation services in participating rural communities.

                         Specific Objectives:

                         ?         Increase the sustained and effective use of safe drinking water in participating communities;
                         ?         Improve use of sanitation and hygiene practices in participating communities;
                         ?         Strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency, local water committees, and professional operators in cooperation with local government.

                          Given low capacity in the Haitian public sector and previous implementation experience with Bank projects in Haiti, (i) project design has been kept very simple,
                         (ii) substantial capacity building has been included, and (iii) objectives have been kept modest. At the same time, coordination with other stakeholders
                         (government agencies, donors, and NGOs) is being actively sought beyond the partnership with IDB, which is financing this project in parallel.

                         Key indicators will be: Number of beneficiaries gaining access to and using sustainable water systems in participating localities, and number of beneficiaries
                         gaining access to and using basic sanitation systems in participating localities
