The\n            objectives of the project are to: (1) increase the sustained\n            and effective use of safe drinking water in participating\n            communities; (2) improve use of sanitation and hygiene\n            practices in participating communities; and (3) strengthen\n            the capacity of Service National de 1'Eau Potable\n            (SNEP), local water committees, and professional operators\n            in cooperation with local government. There are two\n            components to the project. Component 1 is the capacity\n            building for rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS),\n            monitoring and evaluation and project management. This\n            component includes four main activities: firstly, it will\n            strengthen SNEP's regional office in Les Cayes through\n            the recruitment of two consultants who are expected to\n            become staff after project closure, as well as through the\n            provision of cars, office space and coverage of operating\n            expenses; secondly, it will finance services for capacity\n            building in project management, documentation, reporting,\n            information technology, and environmental management. This\n            activity is foreseen primarily during the first two years of\n            project implementation, with the aim of making the\n            assistance unnecessary during the remainder of the project.\n            This activity will also include the financial audits of the\n            project; thirdly, the Bank would finance services for\n            surveys to monitor the achievement of performance indicators\n            one year after the construction of water and sanitation\n            systems; and fourthly, it will assist SNEP in finalizing and\n            disseminating the national rural water supply and sanitation\n            strategy. Component 2 relates to water supply, basic\n            sanitation and hygiene promotion. This component will enable\n            participating communities to access and manage water supply\n            and basic sanitation services."}, "docdt": "2006-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
