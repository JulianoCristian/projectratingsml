Research, Extension,\n            and Training Project aims to initiate the development of an\n            efficient and cost-effective agricultural knowledge system\n            to demonstrate, disseminate, and promote the adoption of\n            appropriate technologies that increase sustainable\n            agricultural production and reduce pollution of natural\n            resources. There are three project components. The first\n            funds adaptive research and technology dissemination, and\n            supports agricultural practices to reduce environmental\n            pollution. The second component reforms the agricultural\n            research system. The third component finances a pilot\n            pollution control program that promotes efficient manure\n            management practices; adapts research, conducts on-farm\n            testing, and demonstrates the use of bio-gas digesters in\n            villages; and sets up a watershed-scale water quality\n            monitoring program."}, "docdt": "2000-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
