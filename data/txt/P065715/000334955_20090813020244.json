"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Agricultural Research,\n            Extension and Training Project for Georgia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderately, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the Government of Georgia, as one of the most liberal\n            economies in the region, has, over the past decade, reduced\n            trade barriers and eased red tape to attract foreign direct\n            investment. In 2006, Georgia was named the top reformer by\n            the World Bank's doing business report because of a\n            drastic reduction in business regulations. However, market\n            liberalizations, while beneficial for the country as a\n            whole, has had a more significant impact on rural\n            subsistence farmers who compete with relatively cheap\n            imports for basic foodstuffs. Given this environment, the\n            project's focus on extension services as a catalyst for\n            increasing production was hampered by weak supply chains and\n            relatively low producer prices. The broader social and\n            economic context presented a difficult environment for small\n            farmers to boost production significantly. The weak supply\n            chains and high margins at the retail level favor cheap\n            agricultural imports from more advanced neighboring\n            countries and result in low producer prices for small\n            farmers. In such an environment, yield and production\n            increases by small farmers do often not result in improved\n            incomes. The project could have benefited from a more clear\n            linkage between markets, supply chains, and the purported\n            increased production of the project areas. The competitive\n            grant scheme was designed to provide grants based on a\n            number of priority themes set forward by the Government of\n            Georgia. However, the list of priority themes remained\n            fairly long and comprehensive at the project start; nine\n            priority areas were identified as being of particular\n            importance to the agriculture sector, each with countless\n            sub-sectors. One lesson that can be derived is that this\n            list of priority areas remained too large, essentially\n            funding any activity within agriculture."}, "docdt": "2009-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
