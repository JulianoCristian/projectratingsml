                         The programmatic DPL is structured around three pillars with the following development objectives:
                         (i) consolidating public finances to ensure a steady decline of the fiscal deficit to stabilize and over the medium term reduce public debt;
                         (ii) strengthening fiscal institutions to ingrain a prudent fiscal stance (including at the sub-national level) over the medium term; and
                         (iii) advancing long-term fiscal reforms to secure the sustainability of social spending in view of Poland’s demographic challenge.
                         These policies aim to enhance Poland’s economic resilience in the face of adverse times and to protect fiscal space for key growth-enhancing investments.

                         The second (in the series of two) DPLs became effective in July 2013, achieving progress on the results and subsequently the PDO. After the loan closure (end-June 2014), the
                         Implementation Completion Report will be published to assess the acquirement of the development objective.

                         The results indicator status to date is:

                         1.       By the end of 2013, the public debt-to-GDP ratio (national definition) is stabilized at or below the 2011 level
                         Weak domestic demand led to a significant drop in revenues in 2013, partly reversing fiscal consolidation of the previous two years. Despite further consolidation measures in 2013 ,
                         the pro-cyclicality of CIT and weaker domestic demand, which lowered VAT revenues, resulted in a higher than expected fiscal deficit. The government allowed automatic stabilizers
                         to operate, in part, and the budget deficit increased to 4.3% of GDP, up from 3.9% in 2012, largely due to lower-than-expected government revenues. despite additional fiscal
                         measures being introduced mid-year to control expenditures (equivalent to about 0.5 percent of GDP). Recognizing the weak growth, the EU extended the deadline for correction
                         under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) by one additional year, to 2015, given that the structural deficit did improve, declining further to 3.8% of GDP. Higher fiscal deficit did

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                            Report No: ISR14821



                         lead to an increase in public-debt to GDP ratio in 2013 to 53.9% of GDP (national methodology), still staying below 55 percent of GDP threshold.

                         2.       By the end of 2013, the local governments’ debt-to-GDP ratio (ESA’95 definition) is stabilized at or below the 2011 level
                         In 2013, the local governments debt-to-GDP ratio decreased to 4.1 percent of GDP (below the 2011 level), thus achieving the set target.

                         3.      By the end of 2013, the social security funds’ deficit-to-GDP ratio (ESA’95 definition) is reduced compared to 2010
                         The social security funds’ deficit deteriorated further to -0.5 percent of GDP in 2013, not achieving the target set for 2013, given the deterioration of the economic situation.

                         4.       Hospital arrears are reduced by 8 percent by end-2013 compared to end-2011
                         The Government's health policy reforms, supported by the operation, were seen as the continuation of Government policies to improve service delivery, efficiency and financial
                         accountability. The DPL supported their efforts towards the hospital system accumulation of debt and debt arrears. Through the enactment of Law on Therapeutic Activity, the
                         Government aimed to further increase the accountability of hospital owners for the financial results and advance the hospital system restructuring. Furthermore, the DPL supported
                         the Government in introducing health insurance contributions for farmers. However, due to the still continued process of restructuring, the health arrears have remained at the
                         elevated level at PLN 2.5 billion (end-September 2013 last available data).

                         5.       The last-resort minimum income benefit for a “typical” poor family is increased in 2013 compared to 2011
                         The DPL supported the Government effort to strengthen the targeting of particular social assistance programs. The operation supported: (i) restricting the eligibility of the child-birth
                         allowance benefit, (ii) improving of the coverage of the last-resort minimum-income social assistance benefits for the poorest, and (iii) introducing partial income-testing for receiving
                         the benefit for care-givers of disabled dependents. As a result, the generosity of the minimum income benefit for a “typical” poor family, defined as a two-parent household with two
                         children with a benefit package comprised of minimum-income social assistance benefit plus family benefit and no other income sources, increased from 36.5% in 2011 to 46.4% in
                         2013 of the "At-risk-of-poverty" threshold (Eurostat definition).
