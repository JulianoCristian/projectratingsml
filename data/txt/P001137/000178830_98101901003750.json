About 60 percent of the new plantings,\n            mainly on very small holdings of less than 10 ha, will be by\n            outgrowers who will receive extension services, input\n            supplies and credit under the project. The project will\n            develop a new 2000 ha nucleus estate at Guiglo, together\n            with the first phase of an outgrowers program surrounding\n            it, and a new 1500 ha estate at Go, to be run by Rubber\n            Research Agency (RRA), of which 500 ha will be for\n            experimental research purposes. In addition to bringing to\n            the production stage the estates at Grand Bereby and Bettie,\n            and earlier developed outgrower schemes, the project will\n            develop a rubber processing factory at Bettie and extend the\n            processing plant at Grand Bereby. Social infrastructure and\n            worker's villages will be provided on the estates. The\n            project will also include studies on the further development\n            of the Ivorian rubber sub-sector."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
