I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01     Project Backgrcund.  The Gcvernnent cf Ivcry Coast has requested Bank
assistance in financing continued develcpment cf the rubber sub-sectcr. This
repcrt appraises a project to maintain and bring inte production approximately
12,500 ha cf estate and 3,500 ha cf outgrcwers' rubber, and tc establish an
additiînal 3,000 ha of estates, 500 ha of experimental plantings and 3,900 ha
cf small scale outgrowers. The project was designed by the three participa-
ting Government entities: Société des Caoutchcucs de Grand Bereby (SOGB),
Scciété Africaine de Plantaticns d'Hévéas (SAPH), and the Institut de
Recherches sur le Caoutchouc (IRCA), and was prepared by the Bank's Regicnal
Office in Abidjan (RMWA). It was jointly appraised with representatives cf
Caisse Centrale de Cecperation Eccnomique (CCCE), Ccmmonwealth Develepment
Corporation (CDC), and Fonds Eurcpéen de Développement (FED) in Aprîl/May
1982. This report is based on the findings of the Bank appraisal mission
which ccnsisted of Messrs. A. Berthier and D. Meadcws and Ms. R. Jaisaard.
1.02     The Ccuntry.  The Ivory Coast occupies 322,500 square km extending
from the Gulf cf Guinea at 5° N tc the Mali and Upper Volta berders arcund 100
N. Tc the West lie Guinea and Liberia, while Ghana fcrms the eastern
boundary. The population was estimated in 1981 to be 8.6 million with an
annual growth rate of 4.,5%. These figures include cver cne millicn immigrants
from neighbcring countries and also reflect the effect of continued immigra-
tien on the rate of growth. Both the indigenous population and the immigrants
comprise many tribal grcups. Per capita GNP was estimated tc be US$1,200 in
1981, having averaged 7% p.a. increase throughout the 1970s.
B. The Eccnomy
1.03     Since independence in 1960, the Government has persued strategies cf
economic growth threugh the efficient development cf agriculture and through
attracting fcreign factors of production. These entailed an active public
investment program, in infrastructure, and in Government enterprises. By
1970, public expenditure amounted to 25% of GDP and grew te 32% by the end of
the 1971-1975 Five-Year-Plan.
1.04     Initially, much of the public investment was for infrastructural
support of the large plantation sector preducing coffee, cecca and cther crops
for export, which is lecated in the extensive unexploited trepical rainforest
areas in the scuth. Strong world prices fer ccffee and cecca supperted this
rapid development. Fcod crops, cetten and livestock were also successfully
promcted, and feod output expanded to meet the needs of the growing popula-
tion. The favorable ratio of cultivable land to population enabled the
expansien cf beth, food and expert crops witheut the necessity cf cne
displacing the other. Public agencies supported smallholder development,
while state-owned industrial plantations were established and prospered under
sound management. Rubber has recently been introduced as part of a crop



diversification program that aims tc increase the stability cf export
earnings. The plantation estates such as Anguededcu and Grand Bereby, are
coming into full production and will substantially increase rubber expcrts.
Underpinning this growth performance, agricultural research institutes
developed new varieties cf coffee, cil palm, coccnut, cotton and rice which
were successfully introduced intc cultivation. The effective research done by
IRCA has substantially advanced the production technology cf the rubber sub-
sector, for instance. All cf these factors in combination caused the value
added in the agricultural sector tc grow by an average cf cver 5% per year.
1.05     Industrial development was alsc not neglected, particularly agro-
industrial development. Industrial output grew 12% p.a. during this period.
The strategy was largely one cf deepening the prccessing cf agricultural
exports and cf import substitution for the domestic market.
1.06     The tertiary sector grew rapidly during the 1960-1980 period and by
1980 provided approximately one-half cf the GDP. This in itself indicates the
extent cf the economic transformation cf the Ivory Coast in the last two
decades.
1.07     Economic Difficulties 1977-1982.  The present economic and financial
problems facing the Ivory Coast largely stem from the difficulties the country
is having in adapting itself to changes that have cccurred in the world econc-
my since 1977. Primarily because cf successive reductions in the prices cf
coffee and cccoa, the country's chief exports, the terms cf trade declined fcr
the fourth consecutive year in 1981 by 17%, and were about 40% lower than in
1977 when ccffee and cocca prices were at their peak. A further small
decrease (1.2%) is also expected for 1982. The decline in the terms cf trade
occured despite the implementation cf the international coffee agreement which
impcsed expcrt quctas. As a result cf this agreement, the Ivorian Government
has built a stock cf 325,000 tcns representing 14 mcnths cf exports and 7.6%
cf GDP.
1.08     The public investment prcgram, which rose very rapidly during the
1975-77 cocoa and ccffee boom and which reached 25.5% cf GDP in 1978, led tc
sericus internal and external imbalances by 1980. To finance its public
investment and then its public sector deficit, the Ivory Ccast became increa-
singly dependent on non-concessional lcans. The gross foreign borrowings
reached US$1.3 billion equivalent in 1980, hcwever this was not sufficient tc
cever the current acccunt deficit. The dependency on international loans,
together with the high international interest rates, substantially increased
the country's debt service burden in 1980 and in subsequent years. The pace
cf crude cil production has not been as rapid as expected, because of delays
in bringing the new fields into production.
1.09      Despite major factors beyond its contrcl, which have slowed the
recovery pace to less than previously expected, the Government had succeeded
in reducing the overall public sector deficit and the current account balance
cf payments deficit relative tc GDP. These achievements are the result cf the
Gcvernment's stabilization plan, which has been designed to forestall, in the
short term, the deterioration cf internal and external imbalances. It is
composed cf a set cf monetary and budgetary measures intended tc contain
monetary expansion, increase Government revenues and reduce current and
capital expenditures while improving their structure. The deficit is expected



tc decline frçm 13.8% of GDP in 1980 to 8.8% in 1982 and Gcvernment arrears
frem US$424 million to US$129 millicn over the same period. External finance
has been provided by the IMF and the Union Mçnetaire Ouest Africaine (UMOA)
overdraft facility.
1.10     Medium and Long-Term Economic Prospects.  The medium and lcng-term
economie grcwth prcspects rely mainly en four factors: the success cf the
present stabilization plan, the international envircnment, the pace cf cil
production and the structural adjustment process.
1.11     In the medium term, the financial constraints cf the stabilization
plan are likely to remain tight. The Government investment program has been
scaled back accerdingly. It is projected tc be cnly 13.6% cf GDP in 1982.
These financial constraints have their rcot in the expected continued low
coffee and cecca prices, the effective devaluation against the US dollar of
the CFAF, (pegged to the French franc), and the high debt service requirements
caused by the ambitieus public investment expenditures cf the 1970s.
1.12     The prospects for the longer term depend, in the first place, on the
impact cf the Structural Adjustment program, (SAL), which is designed tc
correct the imbalances in the economy produced by two decades cf rapid growth,
and to lay a firm foundation fer future growth. Secondly, the rate cf long-
term growth will depend on cil experts, which are difficult to predict.
C. The Agricultural Secter In The Econcmy
1.13     The impressive economic growth has been based to a great extent cn
the agricultural, including forestry, sector. Although the forestry produc-
tion, (hardwocd logs as well as sawn timber and plywood), will inevitably
decline, agriculturé in general will retain its impcrtance in economic deve-
lopment, even when the country's petroleum resources can be fully exploited.
1.14     About 70% cf the population depends directly on agriculture, which
has developed rapidly as a result of àbundant land, immigrant laber and a
pclicy cf large scale development and expansion.  However, the prosperity of
the sectcr is heavily dependent on the fortunes cf coffee, timber and cocea
which together accounted in the past for around 75 % cf the value of total
experts. Since the peak levels of 1977/78, prices cf ccffee and cocca have
fallen by cver 50 % and the timber market is very depressed. This has ob-
vicusly been detrimental to both the agricultural secter and the economy. In
spite cf its importance, agriculture receives only a modest share of public
investment and several cf the Gcvernment's agricultural development agencies
have beceme increasingly expensive and relatively ineffective. Consequently,
the Government has embarked upon a series of major new initiatives in the
fields of agricultural policies, institutional refcrm and investments te
imprcve the situation. Support for this pregram is being provided by Bank
assisted Structural Adjustment and Technical Assistance Loans.
1.15     An important element cf the Government's strategy involves diversifi-
cation within the tree crop sector tc diminish the country's dependence cn
coffee and cocca. Rubber has been identified as a crcp which should receive
increased emphasis in the investment program, for, despite low prices in 1981-



- 4-
82, the long term prospects are considered to be good. Furthermore, because
of climate, soils, selection of high yielding clones and gocd management,
Ivory Coast can expect average annual yields of 2,300 kg/ha so that natural
rubber production in this country appears to have some technical advantages
over that in Asia.
D. The Rubber Sub-Sector
1.16     Prospects.  Rubber planting is currently one of the most attractive
areas of growth in Ivorian agriculture. The medium and long term interna-
tional market prospects are good, because the demand for natural rubber is
èxpected to increase and stay high following recovery from the current world
recession.  At the national level, apart from its advantage in diversifica-
tion, rubber is an ecologically acceptable replacement for logged-over and/Cr
slash and burn afflicted forest, which can provide satisfactory returns to
investment and labor. Moreover,. any foreseeable level of national output will
not have a significant effect on world supply.
1.17     The Sub-Sector's Progress.  Commercial rubber planting commenced only
in 1955 with first production in 1962.  Since then, particularly during 1976-
1981, encouraging progress was achieved, and 40,000 ha had been planted by end
1981. Of this area, only about 10% has been established by outgrowers. In
its plans to expand rubber production, the Government intends to increase
their share to 26% cf the 78,500 ha which it envisages will be planted by
1990. Also, by that time, as a result of concentrating estate development in
the South West, that region will become the more important for the crop, with
55% of the planted area (vs. 45% in 1981). The ownership of rubber plantings
would evolve as follows:

through 1990 would almcst double the present planted area with Government and
outgrowers increasing their share, and would result in a producticn of 200,000
tons per annum by the end of the century. However, this would represent only
2.5% of estimated world production.
1.18     Cultural Standards.  Industrial plantations are technically well
advanced and outgrcwers are provided with intensive technical support through
the extension services furnished by SAPH. The level of technclogy reflects
both the experience gained frcm cther parts of the wcrld and the innovative
and effective research ccnducted in the Ivcry Coast.
1.19`    Rubber research is the responsibility of the Ministry cf Scientific
Research, and has been carried out competently by IRCA. The main fields of
activity have been: the testing of existing clones and the selection cr
breeding cf new cnes; increasing the efficiency cf tapping, particularly by
stimulation; contrcl of Fomes disease; and improved processing of latex and
field coagulum.
1.20     Bank Lending to the Sub-Sector.  The proposed project would be the
fcurth Bank cperation in the sub-sector. The first two covered the creation
cf the 13,500 ha estate at Grand-Bereby in the South West, and the third
invclved SAPH managed developments in the South East, comprising a 2,000 ha
nucleus estate at Bettie with a 500 ha outgrower program plus 3,000 ha Cf
outgrowers' rubber arcund existing estates at Toupah, Anguededcu and Bongo.
This pregram involved three Bank loans totalling US$36.0 million:

These projects were also supported by loans tctaling US$37 .9 million from
CCCE, FED and CDC.
1.21     Initial problems and delays in implementing the Grand-Bereby prcject
were satisfactcrily overcome during the periîd of the second project. The
varicus project compenents covered by the third loan (SAPH) generally prc-
gressed well and according te schedule.



E. The Institutions
1.22     National economie management and development planning are in the
hands of thc- Ministries of Planning and Finance. Agricultural planning is in
the responsibility cf the Ministry of Agriculture and technical and financial
supervision is carried out by the Direction of Programming, Budgeting and
Management Centrol cf the Ministry cf Agriculture, within which a "Rubber
Unit" was established in 1978 te be responsible for the contrcl cf the
country's major rubber develcpment prejects. This unit has been understaffed
and ineffective in the past, but with the establishment cf the new Directorate
fer Studies and Planning within the Ministry cf Agriculture, it is expected
that support and supervision will improve.
1.23     Unlike in cther crops, fer which regional development agencies have
been created under the contrcl cf the Ministry cf Agriculture, rubber develop-
ment will remain in the hands cf the organizations which are currently respen-
sible for rubber development, namely SOGB fcr the Grand Bereby Estate and SAPH
for Bettie and Guiglo estates and for the eutgrowers development program for
the South East and Guiglo. Mereever, RRA will be responsible for all rubber
research including all on going programs in the Ivory Coast and fer the
creation cf the complex at Go, which includes a 1,000 ha plantation and 500 ha
experimental zone.
Scciété des Cacutchoucs de Grand Bereby
1.24     SOGB was established in March 1979 as a mixed public/private ccmpany
with an intial capital cf CFAF 1,000 million held by Government (90%) and a
wholly-owned Michelin subsidîary (10%). SOGB has a staff cf about 3,050 cf
whom 45 are in management positions, including 15 expatriates, 13 of whcm are
seconded by Michelin. Under a contract with Government signed in 1979, SOGB
has the entire responsibility for managing the Grand Bereby estate owned by
Government and the rubber processing plant, in remuneration for which SOGB
receives a management fee. Te support SOGB, a pretocol was signed between
Gcvernment and Michelin in 1979, whereby Michelin, as private shareholder,
would prcvide its know-how. To this effect, twc ceuntracts have been signed
in 1979 between SOGB, acting as a management company, and Michelin: a
technical assistance contract by which Michelin's personnel is being seconded
to SOGB, and a marketing contract by which Michelin purchases the estate's
production at werld market prices. This latter contract replaces previcus
marketing proposals involving the Agricultural Price Stabilization Agency.
All these present arrangements wculd terminate before December 31, 1983 when
SOGB will acquire the Grànd Bereby estate's assets (para 4.01).
Société Africaine de Plantation d'Heaves
1.25     SAPH was the first rubber plantation company te be established in the
Ivory Ccast. It was formed in 1956 by a grcup cf foreign companies which
earlier operated in Vietnam and Cambodia. In 1964, it became a mixed
public/private entity and its present capital cf US$11.4 million equivalent is
shared between the Governnent-owned Société Nationale de Financement (60.4%),
the private foreign Company Société Internationale de Plantation d'Heveas
(SIPH) with 36.7% and varicus Ivorian investors (2.9%). SAPH owns four
plantations totalling 17,000 ha, and has a staff of cver 4,000 cf whom 90 are



- 7 -
in management pcsitions. These include 25 expatriates, mcst cf them seconded
by Scciété de Developpement des Cultures Industrielles (SODECI), a subsidiary
cf SIPH with whom SAPH has a technical assistance contract. Relations between
SAPH's General Management and SODECI's technical staff have been most
fruitful, which is one reason for the gcod performance cf SAPH.
1.26     Because cf its managerial skills and its high technical kncwledge,
SAPH has been entrusted by Government to create and manage first, the
Government plantation cf Anguededou (1,400 ha) and second, under the Bank
assisted SAPH rubber prcject, the Bettie nucleus estate (2,000 ha) and the
smallholders programs cf Bettie (600 and South-East No.1 (3,000 arcund
Anguededou, Toupah and Bongo nuclei). This management contract wculd be
extended tc the proposed Guiglic component involving a nucleus estate as well
as an outgrowers scheme and to the South-East No.2 outgrowers program (para
4.03).
1.27     Rubber Research Agency (RRA)  Until recently, rubber research in
Ivory Coast was performed by the French "Institut de Recherches sur le
Caoutchouc" (IRCA) under the joint auspices cf French and Ivorian Ministries
cf Scientific Research. The French Gcvernment is in the process cf
reorganizating its research institutions, including its ccoperation programs
with African countries, and this in turn has required that the Ivorian
Government adapt the institutional arrangements under which its own research
prcgrams are undertaken. As a consequence, the Ivorian Government will create
before June 30, 1983, a new entity (RRA) responsible for rubber research and
which will be responsible for executing the project's research component
comprising a 1,000 ha estate and a 500 ha experimental area (paras 3.17 and
4.04). Confirmation was obtained from Goverument that this new entity will be
created before June 30, 1983, and will possess assets, technical, managerial
financial and organizational capacity and management structure acceptable to
the Bank.
1.28     APROMAC.  The "Natural Rubber Producers and Manufacturers
Association" is a non-profit industry association representing estate owners,
outgrowers, processors and manufacturers cf the Ivorian rubber sector.
Presently chaired by the SAPH General Manager, this recently-created
association seeks to act as the advisory bcdy for matters related to
transactions between all parties invelved and would be consulted in the
setting cf producer prices for rubber outgrowers (para 6.08).
1.29     The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Agricole (BNDA).  The
principal source cf formal credit to outgrowers, it has been mainly involved
in short-term credit using rediscount facilities with the Central Bank of West
African Countries (BCEAO). In the rubber sector, BNDA is operating in close
cooperation with SAPH, the latter acting as development agency responsible for
the extension service and physical input distribution. BNDA is generally well
managed and its lcan recovery rates are satisfactory. However, its rubber
department is understaffed, and the outgrowers accounts are not always up-to-
date due tc bottlenecks in its computerized data processing system. Moreover,
lacking sufficient financial rescurces, BNDA has to await payments by Caisse
Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) befcre reimbursing SAPH for the inputs
distributed to farmers. Under the proposed project, these problems would be
addressed and action taken accordingly (para 4.11).

F. Performance Under The Ongoing Projects
Second Grand Bereby Rubber Project
1.30     The second Grand Bereby project included the maintenance of 7,000 ha
already planted, the planting and upkeep cf 6,500 additicnal hectares, the
purchase of vehicles and equipment, the construction of hcuses, social
buildings, and a first stage rubber processing factory, and the provision cf
lcans and extension services to farmers for a 500 ha pilct smallholders'
project. The investment period was to extend over a seven-year period (1977-
1984). External lcans being disbursed over the first five-year period, and
Government and SOGB financing the two last years. Costs for that five-year
disbursement pericd, during which new plantings would be completed, were
estimated at CFAF 11,000 million (US$44.9 million). Gcvernment was to finance
the tax component (US$6.6 million equivalent) while the project ccsts, net of
taxes, were tc be financed by external loans: IBRD US$20 million; CCCE US$8.3
million; FED US$5.5 million; and Banque Eurcpeenne d'Investissements (BEI)
US$4.5 million.
1.31     While the first Grand Bereby project was plagued by technical and
managerial problems (as well as unforeseen rates cf inflation), the second
Grand Bereby project has been successfully executed. The planting target cf
13,500 hectares was exceeded in Octcber 1981, cne year ahead cf schedule. The
high standard of planting has resulted in the immature period cf trees now
coming intc production being reduced from an appraisal estimate of 7 years tc
an average of 5.5 years. Present production is about 14% above appraisal
forecasts. Sufficient labour is now available and the training program for
tappers is mcst impressive and could serve as an example for cther rubber
estates in Ivory Ccast and Western Africa. However, no pilct smallholder
planting has taken place because of unresolved land tenure problems and
technical difficulties, in that the land carries dense fcrest, which could not
be cleared by individual small farmers. Also, the local population, who are
mainly fishermen and seafarers showed little interest in the project.
1.32     Estimated cost to complete the Second Project is summarized below in
Table 1.3.

Outgrowers           -           100      -                               -

Thus, tctal project costs were very close to the appraisal estimate, as were
the administrative costs, in spite cf a higher number in Michelin's expatriate
management team. This team is expected te be progressively reduced so that by
1986 local staffs will cecupy the majority cf these positions. Michelin, as
shareholder cf SOGB, would retain some key pcsitions.
SAPH Rubber Project
1.33     This third rubber project included the planting cf 5,500 hectares:
the fully Gevernnent-owned 2,000 ha Bettie nucleus estate, 500 ha on
smallholdings close to this estate, and 3,000 hectares cf outgrowers arcund
Toupah, Anguededou and Bongo (Smallholders South-East Ne. 1).  SAPH was chosen
as executing agency to manage, on behalf cf Goverument. The project included
the creation cf training and extension services to ensure proper guidance and
supervision cf participating farmers and a socio-economic study cf the
Bettie's locality. The project period was seven years, with external
financing being prcvided only for the first five-year phase, Government alone
financing years six and seven. Ccsts for this five-year period were estimated
at CFAF 3,512 million (US$14.3 million). Government was te provide CFAF 484
million (US$2.2 million) covering 16% cf the cost, the remainder being
financed by external sources: IBRD US$7.6 Million ; CCCE US$1.5 million; and
CDC US$3.0 million.
1.34     Physical progress has been good.  Except for the Bettie cutgrowers
scheme, the project will reach its planting target. The training and
extension service has visited participating farmers weekly. This intensive
supervision (para 4.09) has required one extension agent for every 30 farmers
(instead cf a 1/40 ratio at appraisal), and has been partly responsible for
the overall 19% cest overrun shown in Table 1.4. However, in US$ equivalents
these costs were only 95% cf appraisal estimates.

1.35     As discussed in para 1.30 and 1.33 above, external financing for
both, the Second Grand Bereby and SAPH Rubber projects had been planned for a
five-year time slice ending in 1982-83, with Governnent assuring financing cf
the continued investment program in PY6, PY7 and thereafter. Hcwever, in
spite cf the high standard of technical ability cf SOGB and SAPH, both
projects have been plagued by financial problems caused by abnormal delays in
providing funds channeled through CAA. These delays were partly due to
cumbersome disbursement procedure, a lack cf liquidity on the part of CAA, and
a continucus postponement by Government in paying its counterpart to preject
financing. This stems mainly from the difficult and tight financial situation
in which the ccuntry is, and will be facing during the next three or four
years (para 1.12). Measures will be taken in the proposed project to
alleviate such difficulties in the future (para 3.25).
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A.  Physical Characteristics and Climate
The Forest Zone
2.01     Ivery Ccast is divided broadly into twc ecological zones.  Tc the
south, bordering the Atlantic, is a tropical rain forest zone, while the drier
north cf the country lies in the savannah zone. The project components are



- il -
all located in the frrmer, which is particularly suited to tropîcal tree
creps.
2.02     The tcpography is generally regular, rising gradually frcm the sea
with few major structural features, although micro topcgraphy does influence
the suitability cf individual sites for rubber cultivation. There is little
variation in temperature which averages 25-26 C. Rainfall is concentrated in
two wet seasons - March tc June and August te October - and ranges from 1,700
mm in the Southeast to cver 3,000 mm in the extreme Scuthwest.  The central
part cf the ccastal area is drier, and thus the project components are sited
in the South East and South West regions cf the zone (Map Nc. 16743).
Sunshine varies from 1,700 tc 2,000 hours per year in the respective areas.
2.03     The South East Regien.  This is the drier cf the two regions with a
more proncunced dry season, but the rainfall is still satisfactcry for
commercial rubber production, provided that planting is timed tc take maximum
advantage cf the main wet season.
2.04     The Scuth-East cutgrowers' holdings arcund Toupah, Anguededou and
Bongo are on soils derived from tertiary sands, and most cf the land has
already been farmed. Rubber is planted in areas previcusly under bush fallow,
senile tree crops (coffee, cecca, cil palm) or, occasienally, focdcrops.
2.05     At Bettie, the soils are strongly leached schist-derived laterites,
with some areas cf quartz bculders, ccarse gravel and cemented hardpans.
However, the areas selected for planting are based on a pedological survey by
the Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO) and aveid
these problems. The original vegetation cf the estate was degraded tropical
forest, while the outgrowers are generally planting rubber after bush fallow.
2.06     The South West Region.  Development of this region is more recent and
has tended to feature tree crop estates which have benefitted from higher
rainfall conditions. The land is generally gently undulating with a few areas
eliminated on acceunt of steep slopes or swamps.
2.07     The seils are generally formed on ccluviums derived from metamorphic
gneises and schistes cr from granites. Pedolcgical surveys have been, or are
being, made by IRHO and/or the Bureau d'Etudes Techniques des Projets
Agricoles (BETPA) to delineate areas suitable for rubber. Excluded scils
either suffer from prclonged waterlogging, or contain excessive quantities cf
lateritic gravels or have shallow hardpans.
2.08     Estate development is entirely frcm degraded forest, while the
outgrowers at Guiglo are expected to clear some of their bush fallow fer
planting.
B. Environmental Considerations
The New Estates
2.09    Guiglo.  The project as appraised included the establishment cf a
2,000 ha nucleus estate and initiatien cf the first 400 ha phase cf a 1,000 ha



- 12 -
smallhclder program on degraded forest in the De La Goin Classified Forest
near Guiglo. The Ivorian Government has subsequently decided not to deciassi-
fy this forest area, and has proposed the contiguous declassified fcrest of
Cavally. Preliminary aerial surveys and field reconnaissance of the new site
were performed in January 1983, and detailed sociological and topographical
studies and soil tests carried cut by SAPH and BETPA in March `.pri1 1983
indicate that the new site is suitable for rubber planting. Detailed surveys
and financial and economie 9tudies will be completed by September 1983, and a
full appraisal undertaken by the CCCE in October 1983. Disbursement for this
component will be conditional upon (i) receipt by the Bank from the CCCE of
appraisal report satisfactory to the Bank, and (ii) confirmation that all
conditions for the disbursement cf funds for this component under the CCCE and
CDC lbans have been fulfilled (para 9.03(a)).
2.10     Control of game--particularly elephants and buffaloes -- poses a
problem.   The project costs include a provision for tbe purchase of properly
designed electric fences to protect the plantation and create escape corridors
permitting the wild animals to move away from the planted areas. The newly
created Environmental Ministry will assist with the environmental aspects cf
the project.
2.11     Research  The 1,500 ha development would be made on the most suitable
land ln a 5,500 ha concession at Go. The area has very degraded forest, with
numerous squatters. It is considered that well managed plantations will be
less detrimental te the environment than uncontrolled slash and burn farming.
No large game animals were reported tc be in the area. At negotiation
assurances concerning the squtters' proper relocatien and compensation were
obtained (para 9.01(a)). Adequate allowance for these actions has been made
in the Project costs.
The New Outgrowers Schemes
2.12     South East No. 2  Farmers would plant rubber on land which is either
under bush fallow, carrying senile tree crops (coffee, cacao, cil palm) or,
more rarely, being cultivated for vegetables or other cash crops. The
establishment cf a permanent tree crcp would eventually be beneficial te the
micro climate and in reducing soil erosion.
2.13     Guiglo.  The 400 ha of rubber to be planted by outgrowers will mainly
replace bush fallew, and ne adverse effect on the environment is foreseen.
C. Land Tenure
2.14     The new estates and research blccks will be established on Government
ewned land. Fcr Guiglo nucleus estate, the Ministry of Water and Forests has
assigned a concession of 15,000 ha from the'classified Cavally forest, whereas
for the research component, the Ministry of Scientific Research has been given
a concession cf 5,500 ha at Go.
2.15     Outgrowers.  Prior tc accepting farmers into the project and
extending credit to them, project management and BNDA would verify that the
participants have title te the land or certified permission from the tribal



- 13 -
authorities to plant rubber. The situation has been carefully assessed and
reported en by BETPA and no problems are foreseeû.
D. Human Resources
The Estate Sector.
2.16     Labour.  The plantations would rely heavily on immigrant workers from
neighboring countries - particularly Upper Volta, Mali and Ghana. This is
especially true in the Scuthwest, where the local population is sparce. This
lack of workers resident in the locality necessitates the provision on the
estates of villages with adequate housing, -utilities and social infrastructure
and of land for food crop cultivation. The timeliness cf their availability
and standard of the facilities largely governs the rate of turnover, and thus
the cost of recruitment, of the labour. This problem has been recognîzed by
the Ivorian authorities and installation of the facility would receive high
priority during project execution.
2.17     Staff and Management.  Internationally recruited specialists would be
required for a limited number of senior operational, financial and technical
positions. Schedules for these posts to be taken over by Ivorians have been
prepared, as have the necessary training arrangements. The speed and success
of this process would depend largely on the ability to recruit and retain
qualified Ivorians who wish to make a career of rubber planting. On average,
14 expatriate specialists would serve with the project. No difficulty is
anticipated in obtaining support and superviscry staff.
Outgrowers.
2.18     Planting and Maintenance.  While the type cf labour used during the
development period would vary from farm to farm, the overall composition will
include family members, permanently employed workers (frequently immigrants)
and casual labour for peak activities. Except in the case of certain areas,
when harvesting of coffee and cocoa requires a lot of workers, the availabi-
lity of labour would be adequate.
2.19     Tapping.  Present experience suggests that farmers will hire tappers
rather than undertake the task themselves; there may, therefore, occasionally
be a shortage of skilled men.  However, it is expected that a normal turnover
cf tappers frem the estates, should meet the requirements of private farms.
E. Communications
2.20     Industrial Plantation.  Good access by paved or unpaved rcads exists
to all estate elements of the project, although both Bettie and Guiglo are a
considerable distance from port facilities. However, the situation of the
former would improve when the completion of the rcad tc Adzope and the previ-
sion of the vehicle ferry on the Comoe river reduce the distance to Abidjan.
There is also an operational airs.trip at Bettie and one will be constructed at
Guiglo estate. Radio communications are, or will be, established at each



- 14 -
estate.
2.21     Outgrcwers.  Mcst outgrowers' holdings are lecated on or near
motorable feeder or farm roads. Accessibility to collecting vehicles wili be
one considfratÎen in the selection of prcject participants, and no road wcrks
are envisaged in the project.
F. Utilities and Social Services
2.22     Power and Water.  With the exception cf Go, which is on a public
electricity supply, the estates would generate their own power. They would
all provide their own water supply, beth for human consumption and for rubber
processing.
2.23     Sccial Infrastructure.  The industrial plantations provide their
workers with houses cf appropriate grades (which for the wcrkers are grouped
in villages), schools, dispensaries and hospitals, market places, and
entertain.ent facilities (television halls).  Medical services are made
available te employees and their families. The standard cf these facilities
are critical to the estates' ability te attract and retain labour and an
adequate level wculd be achieved.
2.24     Outgrowers frequently provide accommodations for their permanently
emplcyed labor. Depending on the contractual arrangements, food may alsc be
provided. Both outgrowers and their workers depend on public medical and
educational facilities.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Summary Description
3.01     The project, extended cver a five year period, would be implemented
by three different agencies:  SOGB, SAPH and RRA.  It weuld bring to maturity
16,000 ha of estate and outgrowers rubber planted under previcusly Bank
financed projects, and establish additional estate and outgrowers planting cf
7,400 ha. In addition tc these field investments, the necessary
infrastructure would be completed and processing facilities would be prcvided
te handle the additional crop when the trees come into bearing. The project
would comprise:
3.02     South East - SAPH
(a) Estâate Sector
Bettie: Maintain during immaturity 2,000 ha of young rubber,
including replacing 160 ha destrcyed by elephants; bring the area
progressively into production; construct the rubber factory; renew
vehicles and equipment related tc immature area; and complete the

housing and social building program.
(b) Outgrowers
Provide extension services and input supply and financial assistance
to farmers participating in three programs:
(i)    Bettie:  500 ha existing immature plantations;
(ii)    South-East No. 1:  3,000 ha existing immature plantations around the
Toupah, Anguededou and Bongo nuelei.
(iii)    South-East No. 2:  3,500 ha te be planted in the same lccations as
the South-East No. 1 program on small size faris.
3.03     South West
(a) Estate Sector
(i)    SOGB:  Maintain until entering into production the 10,500 ha cf still
immature rubber; extend the rubber factory; renew vehicles and
equipment related to immature area and complete the housing and
social infrastructure programs.
(ii)    Guiglo - SAPH:  Clear and plant a 2,000 ha fully Government cwned
nucleus estate; provide the necessary vehicles and equipment;
construct roads, buildings and houses; and install essential
utilities.
(iii)    Research:  Clear and plant 1,500 ha in the Go region tc create 1,000
ha, Gcvernnent owned industrial estate and a 500 ha experimental area
for trials on varietal improvement and cultural techniques; provide
contract services, vehicles and equipment; build roads, buildings and
housing; and install essential utilities.
(b) Outgrcwers
Guiglc-SAPH: Provide extension services and input and financial
assistance tc farmers participating in the first 400 ha of a 1,000 ha
sub-project to be associated with the new estate.
3.04     Rubber Master Plan Complementary Study.  Investigations cf potential
areas for future rubber development and technical studies needed to support a
detailed Master Plan.
B. Detailed Features
3.05     The project invclves in varicus ways a total of 23,400 ha of rubber,
of which 15,500 ha wculd belong to estates 7,400 ha to outgrowers and 500 ha
would be experimental.  Approximately 1,780 small farms would participate in
the cutgrower programs, benefiting both the farmers' families and their hired
labor. In addition, the estates would provide employment and housing for



- 16 -
about 6,500 workers. Peak rubber production from the assisted enterprises
would be about 58,900 tons per year in 2000.
3.06     Bettie Estate.  All land clearing and planting would be completed
under the ongoing SAPH Rubber Project. Thus, with the except;on of 160 ha to
be replanted as a result cf elephant damage, the agricultural activities would
be maintenance and upkeep of the immature stands and bringing the plantation
into production. The areas involved are summarized below, in ha:
PYl         PY2          PY3           PY4          PY5
Aeplanting             160            -           -             -            -

A total cf 2,500 tons of rubber is estimated to be produced during the
project.  Initial production would be transported as field coagulum to an
existing rubber factory.
3.07     The project would include construction of a factory tc process 70% of
the estate's output as latex and the remainder, together with the production
cf the Bettie outgrowers, as field coagulum. The end product would be
Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR) type block rubber, as is the case for all the
components.  The second phase of the housing and infrastructure program
including the construction of a second workers' village wculd also be
completed.  Provisions would be made for programmed augmentation and routine
replacement cf equipment, particularly vehicles.
3.08     Bettie and Scuth-East No. i Outgrowers' Programs.  With the exception
cf 80 ha at Bettie which remains tc be planted in PY1, the project would be
exclusively involved in assisting with the maintenance of the immature stands
and with bringing the plantings progressively intc production. The areas (ha)
in each category are summarized below:
PYl       PY2        py3       PY4        py5

Almost 2,000 tons of rubber wculd be produced during the project. Field
coagulum wculd be ccllected by SAPH and prccessed in existing factories.

3.09     Smallholders would benefit from the comprehensive and intensive SAPH
extension service. This provides for each participating farmer to be visited
by an extension agent at a fixed time every week and by a supervisor every
month. A mobile team undertakes special tasks such as phytosanitary contrcl
and also marks and opens the panels when tapping is commenced. Fertilizer,
agrc-chemicals and tapping equipment and tocls wculd also be provided. The
foregoing are made available to the farmer in the form of lcans in kind. Cash
loans would be made through BNDA towards the ccst of labour requirement fer
maintenance tasks, fertilizer application, etc.. Some 1,070 farmers from 103
villages are expected te benefit frem the project.
3.10     South-East No. 2. Outgrowers' Program.  An additional 3,500 ha of
rubber would be planted in blocks of 5 to 10 ha on small holdings. As for the
South-East Nc.1 Program, the planting material proposed wculd be GT 1.  The
schedule cf areas (ha) te be planted and maintained is as follows:
PY2        PY3        PY4        PY5        PY6
Planting                     850        850         900        900          -
Maintenance                     -       850       1,700      2,600      3,500
3.11     As in the previcus SAPH project, farmers would clear their land using
family and/or hired laber, and the services cf chain saw contractors when
large stems have te be felled or cut up. Project staff would supply pueraria
cover crop seed and 641 budded stumps per hectare produced in SAPH managed
nurseries. The lining of the areas te be planted would be dene by the SAPH
extension staff using a 4.75m triangular layout (513 points/ha). The surplus
128 plants are placed in pclybags by the farmer to serve as replacements It
is assumed that 400 trees- per hectare will eventually be tapped. Thrcughcut
the development period SAPH extension services and agricultural inputs would
be previded, as in the previcus project.
3.12     Cash Advances.  The outgrowers would receive, as before, cash
advances disbursed by BNDA. These are calculated on the basis cf the
estimated labour requirements for land preparation, planting and maintenance,
amounting te 244 man-days. The official agriculture wage of FCFA 354 (US$
1.0) is assumed, making a total cf CFAF 86,376 (US$243) advanced over 7 years
(para 4.12). Morecver, to ensure that proper technical inputs are utilized,
the full range of physical inputs would be provided on credit te all farmers.
3.13     SOGB.  The planting program of 13,513 ha has been completed under the
Grand Bereby Projects I and II and 3,015 ha will already be in production by
the commencement of the project. Consequently this component will invclve the
maintenance and bringing into production cf the remaining immature area, as
s-ummarized below in ha:

Nearly 66,600 tcns cf rubber will be produced during the life cf the project.
3.14     The factory, which is currently being extended by the addition cf a
large field coagulum processing section, wculd be further expanded under the
project to accommcdate the increasing production. As extensive new areas come
into tapping, additional workers' villages and plantation facilities wculd be
constructed and social infrastructure would be further enhanced. Also vehi-
cles and other equipment would be replaced as required. The SOGB Training
Divison would increase the output cf trained tappers and provide appropriate
management training to Ivorian staff.
3.15     Guiglo Estate.  This 2,000 ha nucleus estate would be established on
areas cf suitable land within a 15,000 ha block cf the Cavally declassified
forest (para 2.09). Land clearing for the plantation, village and infrastruc-
ture sites and road system would be undertaken by contractors using heavy
plant. Tc reduce the risk cf Fcmes infection, rocts in the planting lines
would be remcved by sub-soiling with a large ripper. Nost cf the debris would
be burned, but large stems would be windrowed in the interlines. A ccver crop
would be established immediately after clearing. The estate would use poly-
bagged planting material prcduced in its own nursery on the basis cf 547/ha.
Initially 476 plants per ha would be set at 6m x 3.5m spacing with the
objective cf tapping 400/ha. The planting material proposed is 60% GT1, 25%
PB235 and the remainder is yet to be determined. The planting and maintenance
program is shown below in ha:
PY2       PY3        PY4       PY5        PY6
Planting                    300        700     1 ,000         -          -
Maintenance                   -        300      1,000     2,000      2,000
3.16     Clearing, planting and initial maintenance cf the estate together
with the heusing, infrastructure, utilities, vehicles and equipment would be
financed. The lccatien cf villages, headquarters, facilites and the eventual
site cf the factory wculd be confined as far as possible tc land which is
unsuitable fer rubber. Similarly, the road system would be designed to
minimize the use cf the best land. Confining the crop to the mest suitable
land inevitably results in a "patch-work" layout and higher road/ha ratio



- 19 -
(about 361 meters cf track per ha). Tc minimize the cest cf the game fence,
the effective perimeter would be simplified as far as possible. Rubber
production wculd commence in PY8 and a factcry would be required by PY10.
3.17     RRA Industrial Estate and Experimental Area.  The most suitable 1,500
ha would be cleared by contractcr, particular care being taken in the
selection cf the 500 ha experimental area tc ensure uniformity cf soil type
and minimal tepegraphic variation. A similar technique cf windrewing the
stems and subsciling the planting lines would be utilized. Polybagged plants
for beth the industrial and experimental plantings wculd be produced in a
nursery established by the estate. The latter areas wculd comprise 250 ha
devoted to comparative trial cf varicus introduced and lecally developed
clones and a similar area for agronomy and harvesting experiments. The
development prcgram for the areas is shown below in ha:
PY2       PY3        PY4        PY5        PY6
Planting Industrial Area   200         400        400          -          -

3.18     The contract for land clearing, the establishment cf the plantations,
and the necessary buildings, houses, infrastructure, water supply, equipment,
and vehicles wculd be financed. The experimental component does not involve
the construction cf laboratories and similar facilities as most cf the
technical werk wculd continue to be done at the rubber research station near
Abidjan. There would, however, be training facilities tc allcw the estate te
be used as the national training center for the rubber industry. These
facilities would alsc be available to cther ccuntries in the region.
3.19     When the estate enters production in the post project pericd, a
rubber factory suitable for trials cf varieus processing techniques would be
constructed. It would be equipped with conventional machines but the design
would allow great flexibility in operation. The experimental areas would be
harvested by collecting latex in polybags as field ccaguluns as this technique
permits the most accurate yield recording for individual trees. The
industrial plantation would primarily produce latex.
3.20     Guiglo Outgrowers.  Small farmers close to the Guiglo nucleus estate
would be assisted under the project tc clear some cf their land and plant and
maintain 5 to 10 ha cf rubber. A total cf 400 ha, out cf an eventual target
of 1,000 ha will be developed as follows:
PY5             PY6

Maintenance               -              100



- 20-
3.21     As with the cther cutgrower prcgrams, SAPH would provide planting
material (GT1) from the estate nursery, inputs and intensive extension
coverage. In addition te the loans in kind, BNDA wculd make cash advances tc
finance the labeur required to establish the holdings.
Rubber Master Plan Complementary Studies
3.22     A Rubber Master Plan has been prepared by the Rubber Unit cf the
Ministry cf Agriculture. This plan, while satisfactory in explaining
Government's future intensions concerning the rubber sub-sector, needs to be
supplemented by additional studies covering specific items such as: identifi-
cation cf new sites for rubber development; optimum size for the rubber estate
nuclei (2000 ha versus 7000 ha or more); training needs; privatization cf the
rubber sector, etc. Once complemented by such studies, the rubber master plan
would become an important planning tccl for achieving the rubber sub-sector's
targets. Assurances were ¢btained during negotiation that a study on
identification cf new sîtes, a study on the size cf nucleus estates and a
study on extensive Outgrowers Schemes would be carried eut, and the Bank would
be consulted on the choice cf other studies and the selection of consultants
and that Gcvernnent and the Bank would, from time tc time, exchange views on
the strategy for the rubber sub-sector (para 9.01(b)).

C. Project Ccsts
3.23     The total cost of the proposed prcject during the five-year
investment period is estimated at CFAF 30,100 millicn (US$84.75 million)
inclusive of all identifiable taxes. The foreign exchange component wculd be
46% or CFAF 13,960 million (US$39.3 million). As no tax exemption exists cn
Bank-financed projects, the tax element acccunts for CFAF 4,970 million
(US$14.0 million) or 17% of total project costs, leaving a net of tax total of
CFAF 25,130 (US$70.7 million). Physical contingencies have been estimated at
10% on all costs except salaries, and price increases applied on baseline
costs plus physical contingencies compounded yearly as follows: for foreign
exchange costs: 1983: 8%; 1984: 7.5%; 1985: 7%; 1986 and 1987: 6% and for
local costs, 12% thrcughout. Ccst estimates were based on May 1983 prices.
Total contingencies amount to 34% of the base costs or 25% cf total project
cests (inclusive cf taxes). A summary cf project cost estimates is given in
Table 3.1 and a yearly breakdown by categories of expenditure is given in
Appendix Table III-1.
D. Proposed Financing
3.24     The prcject, which includes on-going cperations as well as new
components, would span over a five-year period, July 1983 till July 1988.
Since previous financing for cn-going operations were practically exhausted by
end 1982, and because the effectiveness of the varicus loans is nct foreseen
before the end cf 1983, the following measures were confirmed during negotia-
tions tc avoid any gap in the financing of the varicus project compcnents: (a)
project includes $5.0 million representing SOGB's expenditures from October 1,
1982 till June 30, 1983; this amount will be retroactively financed by
Gcvernnent and the Bank; (ii) for SAPH's cperations initiated under the Third
Rubber Project, (Bettie Estate, Bettie and South-East No. 1 cutgrowers
programs), expenditures for FY 1982-83 estimated at US$2.6 million, would be
financed by the remaining balance of external leans for the Third Rubber
Project (US$0.8 million), Gcvernment (tax component, US$0.4 million), and
abridging lcans by CDC (US$1.4 million). Project-financed expenditures for
the above components would span from October 1983 till March 1988; and (iii)
for all new components (Guiglc, South-East Nc. 2, Research) from January 1984
until June 1988.
3.25     During the execution of the Rubber II (SOGB) and Rubber III (SAPH)
prcjects, external funds channeled through CAA followed a complicated path
with varicus levels cf controls by the Ministry cf Agriculture's Directcrate
of control, the Ministry of Finance's Directorate of Investment, and CAA. Due
to this lengthy process cf administrative contrcls, disbursement claims were
prepared every two tc three months, and the executing agencies had to wait up
te six months between the cash expense and the actual reimbursement by
external cc-donors. However, given the Gcvernment's financial difficulties,
SOGB and SAPH as well as BNDA were left witheut sufficient cash in hand.  In
crder to avoid a repetition cf the liquidity difficulties faced by SOGB and
SAPH (para 1.35) external co-donors, together with Government, will establish
a revolving fund for each executing agency in proportion to their financing of

the project cost, equivalent to about six-month expenditure. Details of sums
by project components and by co-'enders are given in working files and are
summarized below:
Table 3.2 - Project Revo'ving Funds

c)  SAPH/Guigio                     1,900        350       410        500             640

The Bank's contribution to these revo'ving funds represents 'ess than 10% of
the proposed Bank 'oan.  The establishment of separate revo'ving fund accounts
in the CAA wil'  be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank 'oan (para
9.02(a)), while the establishment of each project account and the actual
deposit by Government of its contribution (as indicated in Table 3.2), wi'' be
a condition of disbursement for the respective component (para 9.03 (b)).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that these project accounts would
be expeditiously repienished at request of the executing agencies, with
adequate funds to cover estimated expenditures for six months (para
9.01(c)). Moreover, Government agreed to improve the disbursement process by
monitoring the claims disbursement after they have been prepared. This should
enab'e the executing agencies to send these cdaims on a monthly basis.
3.26     The proposed project would cover rubber investments over a five year
period (para 3.24). The proposed financing plan is given in Table 3.3. Three
foreign lenders together with Government would finance the project. A Bank
'oan of US$32.2 million is proposed. In addition, the Caisse Centrale de
Coopération Economique (CCCE) of France and the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom would participate in the financing
with the equivalent of US$21.2 million and US$14.0 million respectively.
Government would finance the balance estimated at US$17.6 million. Total
externa' financing would cover 79% of total project costs or 95% of costs
excluding taxes. Government participation takes into account its heavy
involvement in the three previous rubber projects (Grand Bereby I, Grand
Bereby II and SAPH), resu'ting in substantial debt repayments during the
proposed project when most of the past investments are not yet in production
and when the country wil" stil" be facing a tight financial situation.

3.27     The Bank loan of US$32.2 millicn (including the frent-end fee of
US$239,702) wculd be made tc Government fer a 17 year period including 4 years
grace pericd and at the standard variable interest rate. The Bank loan would
be deployed as follows:  US$15.45 millien wculd be passed on as a grant tc
SOGB, agent cf the Government for the development of the Govern=ent-owned
Grand Bereby estate, and would cover 70% cf the rubber factory and 64% of all
other costs (excluding light vehicles); US$10.5 million would be passed on as
a grant to SAPH, executing agent of the Gevernnent for the development of the
Government-owned estates of Bettie and Guiglo and fcr the cutgrowers programs,
or US$3.5 million each fer costs, excluding light vehicles,of Bettie Estate
(33% cf cests), Guiglo Estate (18% of costs) and outgrowers unit (46% of
costs); US$5.0 million would be passed cn as a grant te RRA tc cever 79% cf
the experimental zone; US$0.5 million would be on-lent to BNDA at the same
terms and conditions as the Bank lcan tc ccver 18% cf boans in kind disbribu-
ted to the project outgrowers (para 3.29); US$0.5 million would be applied te
cever 50% of the expenditure for complementary studies of the Rubber Master
Plan; and US$0.25 million represents the front-end fee.
3.28     CCCE with US$21.2 million equivalent (FF 150 million) would finance
27% of SOGB costs (US$5.85 million), 19% of Bettie nucleus estate (US$2.3
million), 21% of Guiglo estate (US$4.35 million), 19% cf the outgrowers units
(US$1.85 million), 47% of the Go plantation (US$4.6 million), 61% of loans in
kind (US$1.75 mîllicn) and 50% cf the Rubber Master Plan complementary studies
(US$0.5 million). CDC with a financing ef US$14.0 million equivalent (£8.2
million) would finance 27% of Bettie estate (US$2.9 million), 27% of Guiglo
estate (US$5.3 million), 27% of the outgrowers unit (US$2.0 million) 21% cf
the loans in kind (US$0.6 million) and 32% cf the Go plantation (US$3.2
million).
It is expected that the lcng term external financing would be made to
Government on the fcllowing conditions:

Effectiveness of the CCCE loan and the CDC loan for the Bettie and outgrowers
components of the project would be a condition cf effectiveness of the Bank
loan (para 9.02(b)).
3.29     Sub-lcans in cash to outgrowers (US$1.35 million) would be financed
by Government through a Iran to BNDA at 7.0%. Sub-lcans in kind (US$2.85



- 26 -
million) would be financed by the three external co-lenders. BNDA, the
executing agency for this component, wculd pay to Governnent 7% per annum
which is the weighted average cost. BNDA would add 1 percentage point for
life insurance, and 3 percentage points for its administrative ccsts, se that
outgrowers aould be charged 11% per annum.
E. Prccurement
3.30     The first phase cf the Grand Bereby processing factory was financed
by Michelin and built to its own engineering specifications and standards to
meet the processes it uses, as the second phase extension tc this factcry
would in part have to follow precisely the same standards and utilize
compatible processes, provision has been made for direct negotiated purchase
cf some factory equipment when appropriate. Civil werks for the factory would
be prceured through local competitive bidding. CCCE would finance under its
own procurement guidelines, light vehicles (US$1.3 million). Ail other goeds
and services would be procured under the Bank's procurement guidelines.
Contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more would be awarded through
international competitive bidding (ICB). Goods so procured are estimated to
cost US$20.1 million (Bank US$7.9 million) and would mainly consist of
fertilizers, chemicals, equipment for SOGB and Bettie rubber factories, cther
equipment and vehicles (except for 7 used Governnent-financed tractors which
wculd be sold by SAPH to the Guiglo nucleus estate). Contracts for gcods and
services worth less than US$100,000 but more than US$50,000 would be procured
en the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally, in accordance with
local procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Such contracts would not be
expected te exceed US$14.7 million (Bank US$5.6 million).  They would include
housing, social buildings and factory infrastructure scattered on varieus
distant estates unlikely to attract foreign bidders. Centracts for gocds and
services worth less than US$50,000 but more than US$10,000 would require
quotation from nct less than three suppliers and would not exceed US$6.7
million (Bank 2.6 million). All other purchases worth less than US$10,000
would be made by prudent shopping (US$3.8 million, Bank US$1.3 million).
Loans te farmers in cash financed entirely by Governiment would amount to
US$1.4 million. About 62 man-years cf technical assistance recruited under
methods acceptable to the Bank would be required during project implementation
(US$6.2 million, Bank 2.5 million), at an average cost of US$8,400 per man-
month. The remaining expenditure (US$30.6 million, Bank 12.1 million)
represents workers salaries and operating costs.
F. Disbursement
3.31     The Bank lean of US$32.2 million wnuld cover 38% of total project
costs including taxes and 45% of total costs net cf taxes. It would be
allocated as follows:

The Bank loan would be disbursed over about six years and a proposed schedule
of disbursement is in Appendix Table III.2 and quarterly disbursement shown in
this annex are in line with the Regional disbursement profile for tree crop
projects, but adjusted by a disbursement of US$3.2 million at effectiveness
(10% of the ioan) representing the initial deposit in the project accounts
(US$3.0 million) and the front end fee. Disbursements would be fully documen-
ted except those in respect of operating costs and workers salaries where
certified statements of expenditures would be used and the supporting
documentation would be retained by the project units concerned and made
available for inspection during the course of project supervision missions.
G. Accounts, Audit and Reporting Requirements
3.32     Of the three entities which would be responsible for project
execution, SOGB and SAPH have already been involved in past bank-financed
projects, and both companies have by now a sound and reliable accounting
system in financial and cost accounting . Detailed yearly budgets, quarterly
progress reports and audited annual balance sheets are prepared and current
conditions are satisfactory.



- 28 -
3.33     All entities concerned would appoint independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank fcr the annual auditing of their acccunts and this has been
confirmed during negotiations (para 9.01(d)). The audit reports would be
submitted tc the Bank within six months cf the close of each financial year,
that is not later than March 31 for SOGB and SAPH, and June 70 for RRA. The
auditor's opinion on project expenditures wculd include verification of
whether: (î) goods and services had been procured from member countries cf the
Bank, Switzerland or Taiwan; (ii) goods had been received or work performed;
(iii) payment had been made; and (iv) special attention would be paid te
disbursement made under statements cf expenditure.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Scciété des Caoutchoucs de Grand Bereby (SOGB)
4.01     SOGB's General Manager has the respcnsibility for managing the
Gcvernment-owned Grand Bereby Estate. Michelin has seconded a team of
technical assistants (para 1.24). All present arrangements (Gcvernnent/SOGB
management contract and Government/Michelin protccol) will terminate before
December 31, 1983, when, through a capital increase, SOGB is expected to
receive from Gcvernment the Grand Bereby estate's assets. Michelin is likely
to be cffered the option to keep its 10% share in the new SOGB company. New
legal documents would determine the future links between Gcvernment and the
recrganized SOGB. An auditor (commissaire aux apports) would be hired tc help
Government evaluate the assets. Assurances have been cbtained during
negotiations that the auditcr would be acceptable to the Bank, and the Bank
would be consulted prior tc the adeption cf SOGB's new articles cf association
(para 9.01(e)).
4.02     Under the Second Grand Bereby Rubber Project, management cf the
estate and the development program has improved considerably over time. The
reduction cf expatriate staff has been slcwer than anticipated due tc diffi-
culties in assigning qualified local staff willing tc fill field positions.
The transformation cf SOGB from a management ccmpany into cne which owns its
assets and is responsible for its liabilities, will be accompanied by a
further reduction of the Michelin technical assistance. Michelin, as
technical partner, will provide few key positions. SOGB will undertake to
train, in accordance with a training program acceptable tc the Bank, a
sufficient number of local staff for its middle and upper level management
positions, so that, by the end of 1986, local staff will occupy most of said
management positions. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that these
steps would be taken (para 9.01(f)).
B. Scciété Africaine de Plantations d'Hévéas (SAPH)
4.03     Apart from managing four existing estates totalling 17,000 ha, SAPH
would act as Government agent to establish and manage the proposed Government



- 29 -
nucleus estates and the cutgrcwers programs (para 1.26), The management
agreement between SAPH and Government signed under the SAPH Rubber Project
wculd be extended and mcdified tc include the proposed project's new compc-
nents of Guiglo nucleus estate and Guiglo outgrowers' scheme and South East
No. 2 outgrowers scheme. The signature of the modified contract would be a
condition of effectiveness cf the prcposed IBRD loan (para 9.02(c)). Morecver,
assurances were obtained at negotiation that the following pesitions would be
filled at all time by persons with qualifications and experience acceptable tc
the Bank: a Program Directer and a Nursery Superviscr; for the South-East No.
2 program and a Project Manager, a Field Manager, a Workshop Manager and a
Nursery Superviscr for the Guiglo component (para 9.01(g)).
4.04     SAPH would recover the full cost cf the individuals assigned tc
project execution.  In addition, SAPH weuld be remunerated for its management
services by a general fee which would be levied on the following basis: for
the cutgrowers scheme, 7% cf costs excluding loans in cash; fcr Bettie Estate,
8% on agricultural development costs and 2.5% on cther costs; and for Guiglo
estate, 8% of costs. The total fee during the development period is estimated
at CFAF 890 million (US$2.5 million) representing a yearly average of US$44
per hectare. The level of fees is below those charged in the Ivory Coast by
consulting firms offering similar types of technical assistance.
C. Rubber Research Agency (RRA)
4.05     Until 1982, rubber research in Ivory Ccast was performed by a non-
profit French crganization called "Institut de Recherches sur le Caoutchouc"
(IRCA). As other French research institutes, IRCA's activities were performed
under the auspices cf the French and Ivorian Ministries of Scientific Research
through a Franco-Ivorian Technical Assistance Protoccl. Financially indepen-
dent, IRCA owned a research center as well as an experimental 900 hectares
plantation lccated near Abidjan. Its expenditures were financed by earnings
derived from this plantation as well as by subsidies from France and Ivcry
Coast. Its management included a General Manager, an administrative and
accounting service, a department of technology (with 4 scientists) and a
department of agronomical experiments (with 6 scientists). IRCA was
criginally designated te create and manage the future research complex at Go
financed under the project.
4.06     In late 1982, the French Government decided to reform the adminis-
trative structure of its varicus research institutions which would lose their
financial autcnomy to become divisions cf a centralized public entity
("Etablissement Public à Caractère Industriel et Commercial", EPIC).
Moreover, French Government agreed te transfer to Ivory Coast the assets
previously owned by IRCA, and to delegate to the Ivorian Ministry of
Scientific Research a greater power of decision in the research activities
performed in Ivory Coast. As a consequence, the Ivorian Authorities decided
to establish under the authority of the Ministry of Scientific Research a new
entity responsible for rubber research in the Ivory Coast, as well as for the
execution and management of the Go research complex financed under the
project.  Confirmation was obtained from Government that this new entity will
be created before June 30, 1983 and will possess assets, technical, managerial
financial and organizatioual capacity and management structure acceptable to



- 30 -
the Bank. A condition of disbursement against expenditures for the Go
experimental zone (paras 3.27 and 3.31) would be that (i) Government has
established this new entity, in terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank;
(ii) a contractua' arrangement between Government and the new entity and
acceptab'e to the Bank has been duly concluded; (iii)  the new entity will
have hired rubber research experts whose qualifications, experience and terms
and conditions of employment shail be satisfactory to the Bank; and (iv) ai!
conditions for the disbursement of funds for the Go industrial plantation
under the CCCE and CDC 'oans have been fulfilled (para 9.03(c)>. Moreover,
assurances were obtained at negotiations that the new entity will employ at
ai! times during the project period suitably qua'ified and experienced
specialists for the posts of Project Manager (to supervise investments in the
Go complex) and chief of the experimental zone (para 9.01(h)).
D. Outgrowers Programs
4.07     A contract signed between Government and BNDA in May 1979 transfered
to BNDA the financial responsibility of supervising the outgrowers of Bettie
and South-East No. l programs initiated under the on-going SAPH rubber
project. This document specified the terms of the Government boan to BNDA and
regulated the credit to smal"holders.  Moreover, by a protocol, also signed in
May 1979 between BNDA and SAPH, SAPH was assigned the responsibility of the
technical implementation of these programs. A condition of effectiveness of
the boan would be that these two lega' documents be extended to include ail
outgrower programs implemented under the proposed project, and that a
subsidiary loan agreement between Government and BNDA has been signed (para
9.02(d)).
4.08     Because rubber is a new crop to project participants, intensive
supervision and guidance is required during the investment phase. The strong
organization set up by SAPH is arranged as fol'ows: a central unit, responsi-
ble for the implementation, trainig and monitoring; extension agents for
direct supervision; and mobile teams to cope with specific tasks. Because of
geographical constraints, the smaller programs of Bettie (500ha) and Guigio
(400 ha during the project's investment period) would be hierarchically linked
to the corresponding nucleus estate's managements whereas the central unit
located at Anguededou would be in charge of the South-East No. 1 (3,000 ha)
and No. 2 (3,500 ha) programs. This unit created under the SAPH Rubber
Project is performing satisfactorily. It is moreover expected that the
staffing of this unit would be reduced when the outgrowers area comes into
bearing.
4.09     The extension service provides weekly visits to each outgrower, with
one extension agent supervising 30. As the smailholders' plots average 2.8 ha
in the South-East No. 1 scheme and 1.6 ha in the Bettie program, one extension
agent covers only 83 ha. During the proposed project, this ratio should
improve to one extension agent for 120 ha for smallholdings of 4 ha. During
the production phase, the number of visits to smailholdings would be progres-
sively reduced to one monthly visit thus limiting the cost of extension
services paid by outgrowers.
4.10     The mobile teams have been introduced by SAPH to reinforce the



- 31 -
services rendered tc outgrowers. Each mobile team is composed cf a superviscr
and three skilled wcrkers and, with a van, covers 1,000 ha. They are called
in whenever a specific task such as Fcmes contrrl is required, they wculd alse
help outgrowers to open their areas to production and will train them in
tapping. The yearly cost of a mobile team would be less than US$24 per
hectare, which is lw ccmpared to the importance cf the work accomplished.
4.11     Though the payment cf loans to farmers wculd be the sole responsibi-
lity of BNDA, the distribution cf these credits is presently shared between
SAPH (and its smallholders' units), for the lcans in kind, and BNDA for the
loans in cash. As the distribution cf inputs represents the bulk cf the loan
actions, basic information given by the smallholders unit (lbans in kind as
well as loans in cash) would be processed under the prcposed project by a SAPH
computer on the basis of one acceunt per plot (Para 3.29). These data would
then be passed on te BNDA whose computer would only have te process the
interests and reimbursements. Such an arrangement would alleviate BNDA's
problems and increase the efficiency of the lcan process.
4.12     Loans granted to smallholders would be spread over a seven-year
period (E-O till E-6, E-O being the year cf planting). Farmers would receive
loans in cash as well as loans in kind amounting, in 1982 terms, to CFAF
344,500 (US$970) per/ha for the Scuth-East and Bettie Programs and CFAF
326,500 (US$920) per/ha for the Guiglo scheme. Loans would bear an interest
cf 11%, with a grace period on the principal of 8 years, during which
interest will be computed and debited in the farmers accounts. Reimburse-
ment of principal would run over a 9 year period from year E-8 till year E-16,
while interest repayment will commence in year E-7.
V. YIELDS AND PRODUCTION
5.01     Different yield profiles have been assumed for the various components
of the project. In the case cf the estates these reflect differences in
mangement practices and planting material, while cutgrower production is
estimated to be about 30% less than the associated nucleus estates at Bettie
and Guiglo. This reducticn reflects the less knowledgeable and less intensive
management and presumed irregularity of tapping.
5.02     Estate Yields.  The following assumptions have been used:
Table 5.1: Estimated Rubber Yields - Estates
(Tons/ha)
SOGB           RRA             RRA             SAPH

- 32 -
5.03     Outgrowers' Yields.  Taking into account the inevitable wide
variation in crcp husbandry standards, and particularly tapping frequency and
skill, the average peak yield has been predicted to be 1.6 tcns/year. Over
the 30 year production pericd a total yield of 43.4 tons/ha, or an average cf
1.45 tons/year has been estîmated.
5.04     Estate Production.  The combined output of the estates is expected to
peak at 44,680 tons in 1999. The estimated planting schedules would result in
production cver a 45 year period (1978-2022), totalling 1,244,790 tons or an
average cf 27,660 tons per year. Summary production data for the individual
estates is shown in Table 5.2 These also include an indication of the
sustained "full" production -- "Stable Output". This i3 taken tc be 95% cf
peak yield. The Stable (Production) Period is the time during which annual
production is expected to be within + or - 5% of Stable Output.

As sccn as output is sufficient tc justify the operation cf the estates' own
factories, they would produce block rubber. The primary product would be
latex crumb cf SMR-5L or SMR-5 standard amounting to about 75% of total
production. The remainder would be produced from cup lumps and scrap, te give
about 20 % SMR-10 and 5 % SMR-20 and SMR-50 The only exception would be the
RRA experimental zone where, for technical reasons, the entire production
would be field coagulum collected in polybags.
5.05     Outgrower's Production.  The overall annual production would peak in
2003 through 2006 at 12,800 tons. The phasing cf the four projects would
result in production over a period of 41 years, totalling 347,000 tons, or an
average cf 8,460 tons per year. Summary production data for the outgrower
schemes is shown in the following table.

The output would all be field coagulum, produced as cup lumps, and collected
weekly by SAPH. Processing to block rubber in the respective factcries is
expected to result in the following distribution of grades: SMR-10 - 60%, SMR-
20 - 35%, and SMR-50 - 5%.
5.06     Overall Project Output.  This is expected to reach a maximum of
57,300 tons per annum in 2000. Total production for the entire project is
estimated to be 1,592 million tons over 47 years, giving an average production
cf about 33,900 tons per year.
VI. MARKETS AND PRICES
A. -Markets
6.01     Responding to the demand in European Markets and using Michelin
technology, SOGB produces block rubber, a type of rubber that has an advantage
over sheet rubber in that its technical qualities can be specified accurately.
SAPH also has successful experience in producing block rubber and is expected
to continue to process rubber in this form. On a smaller scale, RRA produces
high quality block rubber.
6.02     Rubber production from these companies is expected tc be exported
mainly to European countries, especially France. SOGB has a contract to sell
directly to Michelin with an option to sell tc others if they cffer better
terms. SAPH production is sold through EURONAT, a SIPH subsidiary. EURONAT
charges SAPH a 2.5 percent commission in the CIF value, which includes
guaranteed recovery of proceeds. Both contracts specify that prices offered
are based on werld market prices.
B. World Rubber Price
6.03     The price of Natural Rubber (NR) has fluctuated markedly in recent
years. Thus, the average price (RSS-1 CIF London in constant dollars) for the
period 1975-80 was US$1.34/kg, even though in 1975 the price was depressed te



- 34 -
US$1.02/kg. That low level was due tc the economic recession in industrial
countries and its impact on automobile production. The subsequent general
manufacturing reccvery caused the price cf NR to rebound sharply and the
upward climb continued until 1980.
6.04     The large increase in the crude cil price in 1979 helped sustain the
NR price because it caused the synthetic rubber price te rise. This was in
spite cf the fact that wcrldwide automative demand for rubber was not particu-
larly strong since total world motor vehicle production was declining. The
tradtional price differential of NR cver synthetic rubber, tcgether with the
cest-induced increase in the synthetic rubber price, actually resulted in an
increase in NR price in 1979-1980. However, the prolonged wcrld recession has
resulted in another price decline so that the average wcrld market price for
NR in 1981 was US$1.25/kg, and US$1.02/kg in 1982.  Prices have risen sharply
in the first quarter cf 1983 reaching US$1.23/kg in March.
6.05     However, the price cf NR is prcjected tc return tc its 1977-1979
level in real terms by 1985. The projection takes intc account bath, produc-
tion/supply and industrial demand.  On the supply side7 world producticn cf NR
is projected to grow at an annual rate cf 3.8% between 1985-95 due tc yield
increasing as a result of better production technology. On the demand side
the projection takes into account bath, the level cf manufacturing activity
and the relative price cf synthetic rubber. The overall demand for NR is
usually dependent upon the price differential of NR over synthetic rubber.  NR
dres have a technical advantage over synthetic rubbers for such uses as heavy
duty and radial tires and would be used for these prrducts even if the price
differential over synthetic were large.
6.06     Taking incame elasticity and lcng-term wcrld economic growth into
consideration, wcrld rubber consumption is expected tc grow cver the next 15
years at about 4.1% p.a. As a consequence, it is expected that the constant
dollar price will increase by 20% between 1985 and 1995 from US$1.34 tc
US$1.65 per kg (in constant 1982 terms).
C. Outgrower Rubber Price
6.07     An adequate price is important ta the success cf the-outgrower
program. An attractive price would be an incentive ta proper maintenance and
regular tapping cf the trees, which, in turn, wculd give a better return tc
the farmers and thus increase total rubber production and gcverrment revenue.
It is also important that the smallholder price should leave a high encugh
margin to Government tc cover its investment in rubber develapment and
extension services and to the operating agency (SAPH) as compensaticn for its
management activity.
6.08     It is considered that, in view cf the volatile nature cf interna-
tional rubber prices, the outgrower price should be fixed quarterly on the
basis cf the averages paid for RSS-1 cif Londan as published by the Rubber
Trade Association. The costs deducted for marketing, transport, prccessing
and ccllection should be agreed annually between S3APH and APROMAC and subject
to Gcvernment approval.  In ccmputing the profit element cf the deducticns, a
formula should be derived which shares the effect cf wcrld price fluctuations



- 35 -
equitably between SAPH and the outgrowers, whc sheuld nct be mere residuary
beneficiaries.
6.09     SAPH has propcsed a formula for computing outgrower prices which was
discussed and modified during appraisal. In March 1983, Government has
approved the formula tc be applied tc all rubber outgrcwers. The
implementation cf this pricing system would be a condition cf loan effecti-
veness (para 9.02(e)).
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01     Fcr the financial analysis, the following assumptions have been made:
(i) Investment and production coats were determined for each component
acecrding tc their specific cest structures which differ according te their
size, location and pattern cf upkeep cr processing. As analyses were made
thrcughout the bearing life (i.e. until year 2025), 1982 base costs were taken
with an averaged inflation rate cf 12% p.a. until 1990. Beyond that date,
costs are expressed in 1990 term (or 1982 x 2.21). (ii) For the sales, the
RSSI current prices of the Bank's Economic analysis Department have been used,
and, taking into account the quality factor, the follcwing differentials have
been chosen: Fer estate production (para 5.04): RSSI x 0.96; for outgrowers
production (para 5.05): RSSI x 0.92. Three sets cf analyses were made:
Large scale estate (SOGB: 13,500 ha); small sized nucleus estate (Guiglc:
2,000 ha); and outgrowers (fcr 1 ha).
SOGB
7.02     As it is assumed that the Grand Bereby Estate will not phase eult at
the end cf the first production cycle, SOGB financial analysis has been
extended till year 2025, when the initial plantation wculd be fully repLaced
by a second generation cf trees. The estimated cash flow statement, income
statement and balance sheets from year 1982 till year 2025 are in Appendix
Tables VII.1, VII.2 and VII.3, and SOGB's financial analysis can be divided in
three phases: (i) completion of investment related to the initial 13,500 ha
plantation (1982-1987); (ii) full production (1988-2009); and (iii)
replanting and upkeep till production of the second generation cf trees (2010-
2025).
7.03     From 1982 till 1987, self-generated funds will remain at a low yearly
level of approximately US$3.7 million, as production at this early stage of
maturity will still be small. The proposed loan would help te finance the
completion of SOGB's investment program including the bringing to maturity of
the remaining immature areas, the completion of housing, social infrastructure
and processing facilties. From 1988 till 2009, during the 22 years cf full
production, self-generated funds, bcosted by a high productivity would average
US$37.0 million p.a. Investments would be limited te renewal of fixed assets
at a yearly average of US$5.0 million. Debt service and working capital would
require an additional US$2.0 million p.a. leaving a net yearly cash surplus of
US$30.0 million cf which US$13.0 million would be paid as company tax, US$13.0
million distributed to shareholders as dividend, and US$4.0 million would be



- 36-
kept in bank deposit, bearing interest, in reserve for future investments.
7.04     The third phase (2010 to 2025) includes the tctal replanting of old
areas by a second generation of rubber trees. Nature area (and thus
production) will gradually phase out until 2017, to recover its full capacity
in 2025. Self-generated funds would then be limited tc US$16.0 million p.a.,
enough to cover investment renewals (US$11.0 million p.a.) and taxes (US$5.0
millicn p.a.). But the pattern of production indicates that it would be best
to envisage to increase the plantation area in year 2000, when self-generated
funds derived from initial plantings would be at their highest level. These
new areas, arriving at full production, would at their turn, finance the
renewal of the initial plantation.
G-uiglo Estate
7.05     Like the previcusly established Bettie Estate, Guiglo is a small (by
plantation standards) 2,000 ha pilct nucleus estate ("Centre Pilote de Déve-
loppement Hévicole").  Nevertheless the financial implication of this type of
rubber production unit has been examined in detail. Though 100% Government
cwned, it has been assumed that the Estate would perform as an independent
commercial entity reimbursîng its loans and paying company tax. Under these
assumptions, the main financial statements were established for the expected
life of the plantation, from 1984 until 2025: Guiglo income statement, Guiglo
cash-flow, and Governnent cash-flow statement are in project Appendix Tables
VII.4, VII.5 and VII.6.
7.06     GUIGLO initial investments would be financed by Government and
external co-donors. National and external funds would be passed on as equity,
with Governnent assuming the respcnsibility for the external loans debt
service.  As it is usual in tree crop estate development, the initial five-
year investment period financed under the project wculd be followed by further
investments (1989-1993) during which the rubber factory would be built, and
immature areas upkept until full maturity. Financing of this second tranche
(CFF 7,460 million, US$21 million) would be made through loan reimbursed by
Guiglo. Thereafter, expenditure on fixed assets would only involve renewal of
equipment and civil works, at an average yearly cost of CFAF 510 million (uS$
0.9 million).
7.07     Production wculd only start in 1990, reaching its full output around
year 2000. Ccnsequently, the Income Statement indicates that the first years
of activity wculd either be at a loss or a very small profit. However, from
1998 onward, self-generated funds would reach a yearly average of US$4.0
million leaving a cash surplus of US$2.0 million p.a. which could be distri-
buted to Government or reinvested in future expansion of the estate.
7.08     GUIGLO being a Government-owned production unit, the balance sheets
table was replaced by a Gcvernment cash-flow table (Appendix Table VII.6) more
appropriate tc analyze the financial implication of a small scale plantation.
This table shows that Government cash flow would remain negative during 21 of
the 40 years life of the plantation. Nevertheless, the net revenue for
Government during the life of the plantation would amount to CFAF 29,600
million (US$83.4 million), an acceptable average of US$1,040 per hectare per
year. A small 2,000 hectares production unit, thcugh viable, is marginally
profitable and should only be regarded as a nucleus for adjacent outgrcwers,



- 37 -
as each hectare cf outgrowers would increase Government revenues by an
additional US$315 per year. Under the Rubber Master Plan, a study will be
carried cut to determine whether larger nucleus estate wculd be financial:Ly
more profitable (para 7.10).
Outgrowers
7.09     The financial analysis cf outgrower perfcrmance has been based on
cost streams (expressed in current terms) related to one hectare cf the South-
East No. 2 Program (Appendix Table VII.8). It has been assumed that planting
would take place in 1983. The 36 years life of this hectare has been divided
in three periods: (i) From the year of planting (Year E-O) till Year E-5; 6
years of immaturity, where loans received (US$1,167)do nct cover the total
investment cost (US$1,335). Sub-loans in cash are based on man-day ccst (in
1982 terms) cf CFAF 400 (US$1.1) whereas the opportunity cost of labor is CFAF
600 (US$1.7). This period will end with a negative cash flow of US$163; (ii)
During the first year of tapping (Year E-6) and from Year E-7 till Year E-16
(debt reccvery period), production would increase slowly. After deducting the
production ccst (which includes the opportunity ccst of labor) and the debt
service, the yearly average net income would be US$600; and (iii) Thereafter,
the net yearly income would be US$1,200 per ha and per year.
Comparison of Performances
7.10     Based on the assumptions made in para 7.01, the following table
compares the performances, on a per hectare basis, of both types of estate
(13,500 ha SOGB, and 2,000 ha Guiglc) during their 25 years bearing life, and
of a smallholding during and after the 9 years debt service pericd.

b)No Self-Generated Funds if:
Sales                        -49%        -41%              -30%         -32%
or Costs                    +97%         +69%              +43%         +46%
Differences in yield. per hectare and variation in grades explain the differ-
ences in sales. Production costs are lower in SOGB than in Guiglo as fixed
administrative costs are lower, per unit area on a bigger estate. A large
estate would have a higher net income (+35%) per hectare than a 2,000 ha
estate, whereas for a smallholding, the net income during the debt service,
though still acceptable, would nevertheless only be half of that after loan
reibabursement. The two break-even points indicate a higher sensitivity for
Guiglo than for SOGB. As for the smallholding, during the debt service
coverage, a modest shift in both sales (-18%) or costs (+26%) could eliminate
the smallholder's net income (but the value of his labour is included in the
production costs), while a greater change (sales -31% or costs +45%) would
jeopardize the loan reimbursement. In fact, during this debt service period,
smaller shifts than those indicated could result in the cutgrower ceasing
production in response to net income being below expectations.  Nevertheless,
after the loan reimbursement, sensitivity to a decrease in sales (or increase
in costs) is comparable to that of a small size plantation, and this should be
a sufficient incentîve for carrying on the rubber outgrowers schemes.
7.11     Though SAPH is not directly involved in the project's investment
program, its financial performances have been analyzed (in project files). In
1980-81, SAPH had a turnover cf US$13.5 million and a self-generated funds cf



- 39 -
US$4 million sufficient tc cover its debt service and allow for fixed assets
renewals. The ccrporation is well managed and its performance in the Third
Rubber Project has been very satisfactory. SAPH is a good example of an
effective mixed enterprise.
VIII BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
8.01     Rubber has received a high priority in the agricultural development
of the Ivcry Coast. Increased rubber production would help to reduce the
domination of a few traditional export commodities, such as coffee and cocca,
which have lost some cf their competitiveness. The proposed prcject would
serve the Government's program of agricultural diversification cf rural
development in the Scuth East and the South West, and covers 23,400 ha of
rubber including 7,400 ha operated by smallholders.
8.02     The areas to be planted under the project would have an average
annual yield of 56,000 tons of rubber during 18 years of stable production,
which at projected world market prices, would generate at least US$65.4
million cf foreign exchange (in 1982 dollars) per year. The project would
also benefit the 1,780 families in the outgrcwer prcgrams. The farm budgets
indicate that the revenue per man-day devoted tc rubber (80 days/ha/yr)
expressed in constant 1982 terms would be CFAF 4,400 (US$12) for South West
and CFAF 4,900 (US$13.8) for South East during the period of lcan repayment.
Subsequently, the revenues would be CFAF 6,200 (US$17) for outgrowers in bcth
regions. These levels of return would place the rubber growers in better
positions than those growing cther crops.
8.03     The project, by strengthening rubber research through the RRA
component, would benefit the industry in Ivory Coast.
B. Eccnomic Analysis
8.04     Econcmic rates cf return have been calculated for each project
compenent separately and for the project as a whole. Econemic costs and
benefits are shown in the project file. All costs were taken from the start
cf the project fer each component net-cf-tax.  They include an allowance for
physical contingencies. The cpportunity cest of labor is used for all compo-
nents. Fer the estates, labor ccst is the net-cf-tax wage. For smallholders,
labor is costed at an estimated valuation of foregone cutput from other rural
activities. This shadow wage fer smallholder is estimated te be CFAF 600 per
day. Each component is assumed to have a life cf 40 years. Rubber production
has been valued at the following FOB Abidjan prices:



- 40 -
Estate Production          Outgrowers Production
CFAF       US$                 CFAF        US$
1983              406         1.14                392         1.11
1985              456         1.29                441         1.24
1995              524         1.49                506         1.43
These are based on the Jul'y 1982 projection of the world market price,
adjusted for freight, insurance and marketing charge and a'so discounted by 5%
for estate rubber and 8% for smailholder rubber to reflect the average grades
produced in the two production contexts. Transfer paynents, such as credit
advances and the associated interest payments are not included.

TOTAL PROJECT                     14.8           -19.1        +23.5
For the project as a whole, the rate of return is estimated at 14.8% on the
assumption that the return.for the Guigio component is the same as the rate of



- 41 -
return from the original site. This has been calculated inclusive cf sunk
costs incurred prior tc the project period on those estates (SOGB and Bettie)
where the project is supporting planting through only the last years cf the
investment period. The rates obtained on estates (13% tc 15.2%) are lower
than those cf the outgrowers (18.4% to 20.4%). This is because the estates
were created on dense fcrest invclving heavy land clearing and this "first
generation" estates also require the establishment cf a rcad network,
importnat social infrastructure (villages, hospital, wells) and land
preparation for the construction of the factory. After their first bearing
life when trees become unproductive, a "second generation" planting takes
place and as the road network and social infrastructure exist, and cnly light
felling would be required, the rates of return of the second generation
planting would be much higher (18 to 19%). On the other hand, outgrower
plantings can be assimilated to second generation estates as they are created
on land already cleared and dc nct require heavy social investments.
Sensitivity Analysis
8.06     Rates cf return are only slightly sensitive to changes in costs or
benefits. On the estates, which have a lower rate of return, a 10 percent
increase in ccst (or a 10% reduction of benefits), would reduce rates of
return te about 12%; a 20% variation in beth cest or benefit would reduce the
rate of return tc 11%. Guiglo estate, which has the lowest rate cf return cf
all the project's components, is nevertheless justified for the important role
cf nucleus it will play for the surrounding outgrowers, and for that reason,
the global rate, nucleus plus outgrowers, should be considered.  Moreover,
after the first bearing life, the Guiglo "second generation" plantings will
present a much mcre attractive rate cf return. Alternatively, the sensitivlty
analysis of the ERR to changes in costs and benefits, expressed in terms of
switching values at the estimated oppertunity cost cf capital (12%) shows that
a shortfall in benefits cf 19.1% and a rise in costs of 23.5% would be
required to reduce the total project ERR te 12%. For the Guiglo component it
would require a reduction in benefît of 13.4% or a rising cost of 19.5% to
bring the ERR to 12%. A lag of one year in the realization of benefits would
reduce the project ERR to 13.1%. The decreases in prices of rubber by 10 tc
15% would slightly reduce the project rate cf return to 13.1% and 12.3%,
respectively. The increase in price cf rubber by 10 te 15 percent would
increase the project rate cf return to 15.6% and 16.0%, respectively.
C. Risks
8.07     The availability of labor fer tapping can be a risk associated with
the estates. However, the imprevements in recruitment training and provision
of housing and social infrastructure and a more favorable wage rate are
incentives which attract and retain workers..
8.08     The werld market price of rubber is another risk associated with both
estate and outgrcwer programs. Since the majority of the production is
exported to Europe, a depressed world market price would make the estate
production less eccnomic and cculd cause saallholders to cease their produc-
tien as a reaction te lower than expected income. However, the long-term
price prospect cf rubber is forecast to be good due te the expected economic



- 42 -
recevery cf the auto industries in major rubber importing countries.
8.09     Further risks that could affect the smallholder program concern the
problems associated with the introduction cf a new crcp intc the existing
farming system. This crep husbandry risk would be alleviated by the
experienced efficient extension service cf SAPH involving the timely provision
cf production inputs, and consistent provision cf technical supervision.
