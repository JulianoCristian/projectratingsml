The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, at the planning and appraisal stage of\n            project preparation, greater attention should have been\n            given to emerging land constraints and agricultural\n            encroachment. Second, the financial and economic viability\n            of smallholder plantations depends heavily on the quality of\n            plantation establishment and maintenance/tapping. Third, the\n            profitability of rubber plantations, industrial and\n            smallholder, also critically depends on the efficiency of\n            downstream processing and marketing operations. Finally,\n            with the withdrawal of Government from directly productive\n            activities in the rubber sector, future development will be\n            entirely based on private sector initiative and private\n            operators' satisfactory access to long-term credit for\n            financing the necessary investments."}, "docdt": "1993-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
