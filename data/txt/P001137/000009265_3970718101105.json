16,000 ha of rubber planted under\n            earlier Bank assisted projects and establishing 7,400 ha of\n            new planting. About 60% of the new plantings, mainly on very\n            small holdings of less than 10 ha, will be by outgrowers who\n            will receive extension services, input supplies and credit\n            under the project.  The project will develop a new 2000 ha\n            nucleus estate at Guiglo, together with the first phase of\n            an outgrowers program surrounding it, and a new 1500 ha\n            estate at Go, to be run by RRA, of which 500 ha will be for\n            experimental research purposes.  In addition to bringing to\n            the production stage the estates at Grand Bereby and Bettie,\n            and earlier developed outgrower schemes, the project will\n            develop a rubber processing factory at Bettie and extend the\n            processing plant at Grand Bereby.  Social infrastructure and\n            worker's villages will be provided on the estates.  The\n            project will also include studies on the further development\n            of the Ivorian rubber sub-sector."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
