Some lessons learned included: in\n            a fragile state like Guinea-Bissau, where teachers'\n            unions are strong and wages are tied very closely to\n            poverty, it is not acceptable to unions to pay one group and\n            not another. Differentiating wage payments on the basis of\n            school level can create social division and conflict.\n            Additionally, \"solidarity\" is a key principle of\n            unions; it should be expected that they would go on strike\n            if all teachers belonging to the union are not paid. There\n            are additional reasons to include high-school teachers in\n            the payment of salaries. The opportunity cost of not\n            calculating the primary education wage bill correctly may\n            have been dropping health sector wages from the Project.\n            Health is arguably an equally essential service, and its\n            workers face the same needs as teachers, except that they\n            are historically less likely to go on strike. Given\n            uncertain information, preparation teams should not rely on\n            only a single source of information but validate it by cross\n            referencing with other stakeholders and sectoral colleagues."}, "docdt": "2009-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
