1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. Guinea-Bissau is a small country on the West African coast s ituated b etween
Senegal and Guinea-Conakry. It has an estimated 1.6 million inhabitants and a per capita
Gross National Income (GNI) of US$200 (2007). Although endowed with good soil, high
rainfall, an d s ignificant m ineral r esources, i ts g overnance s tructures ar e w eak,
agricultural and other production is underdeveloped, and poverty is widespread. Guinea-
Bissau r anked 171 out of 179 c ountries i n t he 2008 U nited N ations D evelopment
Programme (UNDP) Human Development Index, with two-thirds of the population living
in pove rty, of w hich 22 pe rcent l ive i n e xtreme pove rty (2006 P RSP/DENARP).
Incidence of poverty is uneven across age groups, gender, and regions. Guinea-Bissau is
not likely to reach any of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, and is
likely to fall dramatically short of achieving them without a substantial infusion of donor
support and significant investment in key sectors.

2. Guinea-Bissau's history and current political situation are characterized by
political instability. G uinea-Bissau a chieved i ndependence i n 1974 after a l ong and
fierce g uerilla s truggle. Then, in 1980, t he military l eader J oão B ernard V ieira s eized
power and ruled until he was ousted in 1999 after a two-year conflict. While free and fair
legislative a nd p residential e lections w ere he ld i n 2004 a nd 2005--t he l atter r eturning
President V ieira to p ower--continued p olitical in stability, w ith r epeated c hanges in
Prime Minister and other cabinet positions as a result of fractious coalition government,
provided the back-drop for the appraisal of this operation.1 . The influence of the military,
which has been persistent since Guinea-Bissau gained independence from colonial rule,
has resulted in countless interventions into civilian government affairs. A Security Sector
Reform (SSR) process had just begun at the time of project appraisal. Meanwhile, reports
began to emerge in the year or so before appraisal that Guinea-Bissau was being used as a
trafficking point for drugs coming from South America to Europe, undermining already
weak governance.

3. At the time of project appraisal, Guinea-Bissau's economy was facing
prolonged economic stagnation and macroeconomic fragility. Since 2000, s everal
efforts h ad b een m ade to r estore m acroeconomic s tability and i mplement s tructural
reforms, with mixed results. Guinea-Bissau reached the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) D ecision P oint i n D ecember 2000, a fter which i t ne gotiated pr ograms w ith t he
International M onetary Fund ( IMF) t o t ry t o m aintain e conomic s tability, i ncluding a
three year P overty R eduction a nd G rowth F acility ( PRGF) i n 2000, a nd t wo S taff
Monitored P rograms ( SMPs) i n 2005- 2006, w ith onl y pa rtial s uccess. 2 004 l egislative
elections r esulted i n t he a ppointment of a more r eform-minded government t hat
attempted to strengthen fiscal management and launch important reforms, and when the
1
  Legislative elections were held in 2004 and 2008 (the latter during the Project implementation period);
Presidential elections were held in 2005 and 2009. The last Presidential election, of June 2009, just before
the Project closed, followed the assassination of President Vieira in March 2009, which occurred on the
same night that the Army Chief of Staff was assassinated.


                                                      1
Government was replaced 18 m onths later, a P overty R eduction S trategy Paper (PRSP)
and S ecurity S ection R eform (SSR) proposal were finalized, based on w ork undertaken
earlier. Yet, in s pite o f r eform p lans, th e f iscal s ituation d eteriorated, e videnced b y
mounting arrears; less transparency in public expenditure reporting; a significant drop in
revenues l argely ow ing t o a dr op i n c ashew-nut e xports f ollowing government
intervention; a nd emergent governance pr oblems i n t he e nergy s ector. At t he t ime of
appraisal, t he e xternal d eficit w as 323 pe rcent o f G DP ( 2006), a nd t he primary bud get
deficit was j ust under 10 percent o f GDP. Overall, i n t he period following t he 1998-99
conflict to 2006, G DP fell by about 25 pe rcent from pre-conflict levels, and there was a
sense of increasing crisis.

4. The period 2000-2006 was also characterized by a lack of control over the wage
bill. Between 2001 a nd 2003 the civil service had grown be yond the number needed to
deliver s ocial s ervices, t he pa yroll i ncluded "ghost w orkers," and c ivil service w ages
were al most t ripled. A s a r esult, wages i n 2 004 exceeded t ax r evenues b y 3 p ercent o f
GDP, m aking i t i mpossible for t he Government to pa y civil s ervant wages on t ime and
deliver ba sic s ocial s ervices, i ncluding pr imary e ducation a nd h ealth s ervices. W hile
subsequent governments ha d t aken s teps t o reduce w ages and i ncrease r evenues, t he
wage problems remained severe at appraisal. The situation was potentially destabilizing
with significant risks to social peace deriving from the threat of civil servant strikes and
possible military action if the military were not paid. Wage reforms were planned, and it
was hope d t hat t hrough a combination of hi gher economic growth, c ivil s ervice
retrenchment, and demobilization as part of the Security Sector Reform (SSR), the wage
bill could be brought into balance.

5. In response to the growing crisis, a national unity government, appointed in
April 2007, found itself unable to fulfill its wage commitments to civil servants and the
military. By the end of December 2007, ha ving not been paid for three months, military
personnel had openly gone on national public radio and threatened action if they were not
paid. T eacher's s alaries were al so i n a rrears, and t he s chool year t hat h ad b een d ue t o

6. The need for external assistance was clear, and the Bank responded by
designing a budget support operation that intended to shore up the budget as part
of a multi-donor approach, including especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the EU. With such a severe debt and fiscal position, the Bank's top priority was to
support G uinea-Bissau, in pa rtnership w ith t he IMF, t o a chieve H IPC c ompletion a nd
therefore a r eduction i n t he c ountry's de bt bur den. T his w ould r equire i nterim budg et

was r ejected i n J anuary 2008, s ince G uinea-Bissau w as una ble t o f ulfill e ligibility
requirements related to a track record of sound macroeconomic management. The Bank
therefore t ook t wo ke y s teps e arly i n 2008. First, on January 29, 2 008, t he B oard
approved exceptional H IPC r elief t o G uinea-Bissau a t 50 p ercent of N et Present V alue



                                                2
(NPV), and second, the Bank team began to re-design the budget support operation as an
Emergency SIL to finance salaries in the education sector--following on the example of
a similar w age f inancing ope ration i n t he D emocratic R epublic of t he C ongo. T he
Bank's H IPC r elief a nd e mergency ope ration c omplemented t he IMF's a pproval on
January 28, 2008, of an Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) package of US$2.8
million. This program was expected to leverage budget support planned by the Bank and
other donor s i n 2008 and 2009. A ke y performance t arget of t he E PCA w as t hat t he
Government did not run into any new arrears in 2008, and that it repay part of the arrears
accrued i n 2 007. B y f inancing s alaries i n t he ed ucation s ector, t he E mergency P roject
would provide critical support for attaining that goal.

7. At time of appraisal, the education sector in Guinea-Bissau represented a
relative success story t hat w as t hought t o w arrant r enewed B ank and donor s upport,
according t o a s ocial s ector r eview be ing pr epared b y the W orld Bank i n c ollaboration
with t he A frican D evelopment B ank ( AfDB), the U nited N ations C hildren's F und
(UNICEF), a nd U NDP. T he m ost vi sible s ign of pr ogress ha d b een a n e xpansion of
primary e ducation c overage, w ith G ross E nrollment R ates doubl ing be tween 1995 and
2005, and the narrowing of the gender gap at the primary level. Despite these successes,
many children who complete primary education remain functionally illiterate due to the
poor qua lity o f publ ic e ducation. A l ack of l earning m aterials, t eacher s trikes, poor -
quality t eaching, and l imited a ccessibility t o s chools--due t o t he ons et of t he r ainy
season--contributed t o poor l earning a ttainments a nd de creased m orale. S till, i t w as
believed t hat G uinea-Bissau c ould, w ith e nough s upport, a chieve t he M DG e ducation
goals. To do so, the substantial donor funding of the multi-donor Education for All­Fast-
Track Initiative ( EFA-FTI) ne eded t o be come a vailable i n 2009. It w as i n t his c ontext
that t he P roject a lso a imed t o c ontribute t o br idging t he f unding gap, specifically f or
education sector salaries for the 2007/08 and 2008/09 school years.

8. The relationship between the teachers' unions and the MoF had not been
harmonious in recent times, with u nions u sing th eir p olitical clout to th e f ullest b y
regularly striking at the start of each school year to press for payment of their wages and
other claims... Consequently, the Guinea-Bissau school year (SY) had not begun on time
(usually s tarting i n D ecember or J anuary rather t han O ctober) f or t he last ten ye ars.
Moreover at a ppraisal, t he M inister of F inance and M inister of E ducation w ere f rom
different political parties, which complicated project preparation and implementation.

9. Each year, and even month-to-month, it was reportedly a struggle for the MoE
to receive funding from the MoF to pay teachers and for other costs, in a context
where s carcity o f r esources m eant t hat execution of t he e ducation budge t w as l ow. In
particular, at t ime o f appraisal m acroeconomic d ata i ndicated a recurrent ed ucation
budget of 9.4 percent for 2003, 9.9 pe rcent for 2004, and 13 percent for 2005, but with a
budget execution rate of only 62 percent. Friction between the Ministers was heightened
by this general scarcity and budget uncertainty for the MoE.


1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement



                                                3
10. The Project was consistent with the objectives of the emergency facility
Operational Policy (OP) 8.00 in addressing a critical need to contribute to both fiscal
stability and public service delivery. The focus of the Project on pr imary education was
seen a s a c onstructive s tep t oward h elping t he c ountry reach M DG 2 --achieving
universal pr imary e ducation--although i t w ould a lso c ontribute t o M DG 1--pove rty
alleviation--for t eachers a nd t heir de pendents. Without e xternal f inancial s upport t here
was a t hreat t hat t he e ducation s ector w ould collapse, t eaching not b e d elivered, and a
generation o f c hildren l eft w ithout e ducation, with i rreversible c onsequences for t he
country. The grant would help to fill the budget shortfall such that other wages could be
paid and priorities met, helping to avoid state collapse. It was also hoped that the Project
would have the benefit of building a bridge to a broader program: the EFA-FTI in 2009.
The rationale for supporting the education sector rather than other sectors such as health,
was that an important Global Fund financing (of US$50 million) was in the pipeline for
health, whereas there was no such funding for education at that time.

11. The Project contributed to other higher-level objectives through its a lignment
with Pillar 1 (macroeconomic stability) and Pillar 3 (access to basic social services) of the
Guinea-Bissau P overty Reduction S trategy P aper/National P overty R eduction S trategy
Paper (PRSP/DENARP) of September 2006, b y contributing directly to the provision of
wages in the key social sector of education. Further, the Project would help pave the way
toward r eaching t he H ighly Indebted P oor C ountry (HIPC) C ompletion Point a nd t he
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2010, particularly as one of the Completion
Point triggers refers to an increase in the school Gross Enrollment Ratio.

1.3 Original Project Development Objective & Key Indicators (as approved)
12. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to contribute to the uninterrupted
delivery o f c ritical pub lic s ervices. T his w as to be a chieved t hrough pr ovision of
International Development Association (IDA) resources to sustain the education sector.

13. Key Indicators:
PDO Indicator 1: 2007/08 primary school year is completed satisfactorily (measured b y
number of da ys pr imary s chools w ere ope n). P DO Indicator 2: T he 20 08/09 pr imary

Intermediate O utcome 1 : T imely p ayment o f te achers' s alaries in 2 008 ( measured b y
payment of teachers' salaries and no new primary teachers' salary arrears accumulated in
2008).

1.4 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification (as approved)
14. The PDO and Key Indicators were not revised during project implementation.

1.5 Main Beneficiaries
15. The "primary target group" for the grant was primary school teachers, wh o
were ex pected t o b enefit f rom t he t imely p ayment o f w ages. Important s econdary
beneficiaries w ere pr imary school s tudents, w ho s hould r eceive primary s chool

activity. T he s upport was a lso i ntended, m ore generally, t o r elieve s train on t he
government budget.

1.6 Original Components (as approved)
16. The operation was focused on a single component: delivery of primary education
services. T he grant w ould f inance t he s alary of primary ed ucation t eachers ( both ci vil
servants a nd c ontractors), t he c ost of m anaging such pa yments, a nd the e nd-of-project
audit. The full US$10 million grant was to be disbursed against this component.

1.7 Revised Components
17. The component was not formally revised.

1.8 Other significant changes
18. No other significant changes were made to the Project's design, scope, scale, or to
implementation arrangements. The Project was extended, however (see below).

19. The funding allocation was designed for maximum flexibility. To this end, up t o
40 percent (US$4 million) equivalent was allowed to be used for retroactive financing of
primary teachers' salaries paid from October 2007 until project effectiveness (May 2008).
However, the GoGB did not in fact pay any teachers' salaries in the period from January
through M ay 2008, s o w as a ble t o s how onl y US$1.7 m illion e quivalent of pr imary
teachers' s alaries as h aving b een p aid b efore p roject ef fectiveness - i n t he t hree-month
period f rom O ctober t o December 2 007 ( i.e. ar rears were accumulated). A t t hat p oint,
after r eceiving th e first receipts, it w as r ealized th at th e p rimary e ducation w age b ill
information pr ovided t o t he Bank dur ing p reparation/appraisal h ad be en grossly
overestimated (at US$2 million equivalent per month, when in fact the figure was closer
to US$500,000). Once this became clear, the decision was made to extend the Project by
three m onths t o a llow s ufficient t ime for t he full f unds t o be di sbursed, r ather t han
restructure it to broaden eligibility. As a result, US$8.3 million equivalent was disbursed
for current primary teachers' salary payments, and to clear the early 2008 arrears for the
same group of teachers, in addition to the $1.7million in retroactive financing. No other
design or implementation changes were made.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
20. The Project used the Emergency Loan instrument in an innovative way to
address the pressing budget challenges in Guinea-Bissau (see OP/BP 8.00). Th e
Project was innovative in that, once it became clear that Guinea-Bissau would not qualify


                                                5
for a bud get s upport op eration, t he P roject us ed t he E mergency f acility f or t he di rect
payment of p rimary s ector w ages t o a lleviate f iscal pr essures, s upport t he c ountry i n
working towards HIPC completion, alleviate instability in a fragile post-conflict context,
and ke ep t he country on t rack w ith r egard t o t he e ducation M DG. G iven t he pr essing
macroeconomic need for budget support, the Project was rapidly redesigned from budget
support t o E mergency SIL, but w ith l imited e ducation-specific s ectoral i nputs f rom
stakeholders at both the Bank and country level. This context helps explain certain issues
that affected results during implementation.

21. Project preparation was based on a clear general understanding and
explanation of the political fragility in Guinea-Bissau, particularly the macroeconomic
situation. However, the Project failed to adequately seek and use validated baseline data
and i ncorporate s ectoral k nowledge i n at l east t wo c rucial ar eas. First, t he p rimary
education wage bill estimate provided by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of US$2 million
during preparation and ratified by the Ministry at the time of negotiations, was accepted
by the Project team without documentary evidence or cross-verification with the Ministry
of Education (MoE). In not doing due diligence, the Bank did not know that the Project's
estimate of the wage bill was four times higher than it should have been--this led to an
overestimation of the speed of disbursement and a more limited scope of public services
to be covered. In particular, the early decision not to include the salaries of health sector
workers w as a lso a pparently ba sed on t he w age bi ll e stimate, e ven t hough t he O ffice
Memorandum s ent b y t he C ountry D irector t o t he R egional V ice P resident i n J anuary
2008 clearly states that the original intention of the Project was to pay the salaries of both
(paragraph 6). Second, project indicators are intuitive but were not informed by realities
on t he ground ( e.g. t he persistent l ate s tart t o t he s chool year a nd uni ons' i nterests i n
recovering many years of wage arrears). Thus, there was never any real chance of project
indicators achieving results in the Satisfactory range. There was also no evident appraisal
of t he pr oblem of ghost w orkers, or t he s pecific a bility o f government t o pr oduce t hat
required receipts t he s how t he p ayment o f t eachers. P roject p reparation that w as m ore
inclusive of Education S ector S pecialists and t hat was based on c onsultation with M oE
officials would have improved design.

of design runs counter to the design of some other projects, which reject a focus on onl y
basic education.2 Drawing on established implementation capacity from a private sector
project, a well-tested, pre-existing PIU was chosen to implement the Project to mitigate
the foreseeable fiduciary risk. The use of this PIU was critical to project success given the
weak i mplementation c apacity o f government and pa rticularly t he ne ed f or e ffective

anticipated to b e q uite lig ht ( in lin e w ith t he o verestimation o f th e w age b ill),
concentrating on f inancial m anagement and r apid di sbursement pr ocessing, a nd no
additional compensation was agreed or given to PIU staff for the work.

23.     Several questions remain with respect to clarity and quality of
documentation. F or ex ample, t he P roject w as n amed "Emergency P ublic S ervices
Delivery P roject," h owever, t he P roject P aper d id n ot ex plain w hy t he P roject f ocused
specifically on primary education rather than on other critical public services (especially
health), a nd w hy i t focused onl y on primary e ducation. I n addition, " critical public
service" is not defined. While the focus on pr imary education clearly could help to help
achieve M DG 2 of uni versal pr imary education, ot her s ections not e t he l ink be tween
poverty (MDG 1) and wages, and the fact that teachers' salaries are already low. Given
the role of unions and the risk they could pose, and the fact that solidarity is a principle of
unions, why would unions be expected to accept payment of one level of teachers and not
another? F urther, t here i s a s light d isconnect b etween t he m acroeconomic co ntextual
sections, which built a case for broad economic support, and the education-sector-specific
sections. T his i s l ikely t he r esult of h aving h ad t o qui ckly r ewrite t he Project f or t he
specific s ector. W hile th is w riting p robably d id n ot u ltimately imp act p roject
implementation, th e o verall in tention o f th e P roject is u nclear; e specially w hy the
particular indicators chosen would be appropriate (see section 2.3).

24. Risks are discussed in the Project Paper and some major controllable risks are
mitigated through the design. For example, the design used the capacity of an already
established P IU t o r educe t he s ignificant f iduciary risk, a nd a n e xternal a uditor w as
contracted to conduct the final audit. O n the other hand, the risks section is not specific
enough about several key risks that could have adversely affected project outcomes, and
in s ome cas es t he r isks ar e n ot m ade ex plicit at al l, an d t herefore t here i s n o
corresponding di scussion of r isk m itigation. T hese r isks i nclude: ( a) t he pos sibility t hat
counterpart funds would not be available to fund other critical elements of the sector, (b)
the pos sible non- cooperation of t eachers uni ons,3 and ( c) t he r isk of t eacher s trikes,
absenteeism, o r r efusal to t each cl asses f or r easons o ther t han s alary. M oreover, a
payment agency was foreseen to mitigate a risk (of ghost workers) but not discussed in
any detail, w hich i s not eworthy be cause dur ing implementation t he de cision w as t aken
not to use such a payment agency.

25. The overall risk rating was rated as Medium, but some baseline information
would have been useful here to help ground the analysis. For example, how often had
teachers gone on strike in the past and for what reasons? Why would unions agree to have
some of their members paid and not others? This point is not given due consideration in

  Experience with education uni ons i n Guinea-Bissau a nd elsewhere s uggests t hat i t would n ot be
acceptable to unions for a government to pay primary school teachers and not teachers at other levels. The
project design team reportedly defined the target group narrowly because they believed that it would reduce
the risk of being rejected by internal Bank reviewers and the Board. It is possible that the GoGB may have
noticed this but not wanted to jeopardize project approval. However, in hindsight the narrow approach is
now known to have increased political risks and the risk of implementation difficulties.

and being paid. Without a specific attendance incentive mechanism, the Project accepted
the risk that teachers would be paid even though they might not attend school and teach.
Toward the end of 2008 a nd early 2009, de spite funds being available from the Project,
payments t o pr imary s chool t eachers w ere de layed be cause f unds f or t he pa yment of
secondary a nd ot her t eachers w ere not on t he l ist of pr iorities of t he M oF, w hich
struggled with multiple demands on t he government budget. This increased pressure on
the Government and provided a further reason for unions to strike.

26. The choice of instrument, in this case, had considerable impact on the
outcomes of the Project. T he s pecificity of t he P roject w as i mportant f or ensuring
accountability by defining a specific set of beneficiaries who then held the Government
accountable f or d elivery. B ecause o f t he E mergency S pecific Investment L oan ( SIL)

2008, t hat t hey w ould be pa id, l eading t o t heir be ginning c lasses on J anuary 15th a nd
completing t he s chool year, e ven t hough t his s pecificity l ater ba ckfired (for t he M oF)
when project funds were held up and teachers' unions were immediately aware of it.

27. One question to consider is: why were materials not allowed as an eligible
expense? There are provisions within OP 8.00 (7e.) to provide quick-disbursing funds for
a positive l ist of g oods, a nd i t w as know n t hat t here w as a s hortage of books a nd
materials. It is not explicitly discussed in the P roject P aper, however the answer is that
this would have added to project implementation complexity in the area of procurement,
taking away from t he d irectness a nd s implicity of t he ope ration. T he P roject w as not
meant to address the issue of quality of education but provide an emergency stop-gap to
ensure continuation of classes by mitigating the fiscal constraints. In practice, the initial
cause o f de lay t o t he s tart of S Y 2008/ 09 was r eported i n t he m edia a s b eing "lack of
chalk, desks and chairs" (IRIN news 12/16/08), so that consideration should be given to
these expenditures in future operations..

28. Government ownership of the Project was mixed. While the GoGB was entirely
committed to o verall p roject o utcomes, th ere w ere c ompeting o bjectives in th e P roject
that b ecame ma nifest d uring p roject imp lementation. F or e xample, th e h igher-level
objective of maintaining political stability (social peace) is determined not only by paying
teachers' s alaries, but b y m anaging a c omplex a nd f ragile pol itical and budge tary
situation of w hich t he e ducation s ector i s one pa rt. D uring t he i nitial s tages of pr oject

introduction of s pecific project r equirements. A t no poi nt dur ing pr oject pr eparation or

overestimated th e w age bill, w hile a t th e s ame ti me s ystematically u nderestimating th e
number of civil servants by not including contract teachers or new teachers who have not
been validated, and taking considerable time to validate them. The inconsistency could
have b een di scovered a nd e asily r emediated i f a ppropriate doc umentation ha d be en
obtained at the Project preparation stage and if MoE had been consulted. Moreover, had
unions a nd t he P arents' and T utors' A ssociations4 been br ought t ogether and i nformed
about t he P roject, a s s takeholders f rom t he out set, i t i s doubt ful t hat t he t eacher s trikes
would ha ve be en a s f orceful or pr olonged, s ince a t rack r ecord of t rust bui lding m ight
have been initiated. In summary, although the Project addressed highly relevant project
needs, the Project's Quality at Entry suffered from significant short-comings in terms of
design, consultations, basic data gathering and risk assessment.

2.2 Implementation

29. There were three main factors that gave rise to problems during
implementation: ( a i nsufficient government f unds t o pa y t he ov erall w age bi ll t oward
the end of 2007, leading to MoF actions resulting in the Designated Account being frozen
(see below); (b) insufficient communication between the MoF and the main stakeholders
(MoE a nd uni ons) pr ior t o pr oject e ffectiveness, l eading t o a n a tmosphere of m istrust;
and (c) problems resulting from not including the payment of secondary school teachers
in th e P roject d esign. A dditional f actors th at p layed in to p roject imp lementation w ere
that: ( a) t he m anager o f t he pr evious pr oject w as not a vailable t o a ssist i n pr oject
implementation, a s s tated in th e P roject P aper; (b) th e T ask T eam Leader ( TTL) w as
changed a fter Board a pproval, s o t he pe rson w ho de signed t he P roject d id not ove rsee
implementation; and (c) a payment agency was not used to pay salaries, as outlined in the
Project P aper, w hich i ntroduced a dditional r isks not out lined i n de tail i n t he P roject
Paper, and which therefore were not mitigated during implementation.

30. Challenges that arose during implementation were: (a) strikes called by teachers
unions w hen di sbursements w ere s talled a s t he World B ank ( mid-2008), a nd t hen l ater
the newly-appointed Minister of Finance (who assumed office early in 2009), saw a need
to review the wage bill, and primary teachers were not paid on t ime as promised by the
Project, a nd ( b) c ontinuing s trikes a nd d elayed p ayments t o t eachers even w hen f unds
were available for primary teachers because not enough counterpart funds were available
to pay secondary school teachers.

31. The major issue faced early in implementation was the handling of monies
deposited by the World Bank into the Designated Account opened at ECOBANK, a
regional c ommercial ba nk. T he s ituation a rose w hen, i n l ate 2007, t he t hen M inister of
Finance, finding his government to be in a difficult fiscal situation, sought a commercial
loan a dvance of a bout U S$3 m illion f rom ECOBANK, upon p resentation of a
confirmation f rom t he World B ank t o t he M inistry of F inance t hat a n ew pr oject w as
under p reparation ( which t he M inister r eferred t o as a s o-called "co mfort l etter"). A fter
the P roject w as a pproved a nd t he i nitial de posit of U S$3 million t ransferred t o t he

ECOBANK Designated Account, this deposit was withdrawn by ECOBANK for claimed
repayment of E COBANK's a dvance t o t he G overnment, a lthough t he D esignated
Account could onl y be u sed for Eligible Expenditures under t he P roject, i .e. t he a greed
purpose of pa ying pr imary s chool t eachers' s alaries, a s pe r t he Financing A greement
between t he W orld Bank and t he GoGB. ECOBANK poi nted t o t he s o-called "comfort
letter" in taking this action, which is incongruous given that ECOBANK conducts regular
business with the World Bank in several other countries and is aware of its obligations in
handling D esignated A ccounts, i ncluding not of f-setting s ums he ld on de posit i n
satisfaction of sums owing by the depositor. ECOBANK eventually returned the funds to
the D esignated Account in O ctober 2008, and t he G overnment s ubsequently c losed t he
Designated A ccount and ope ned a ne w D esignated A ccount i n a different ba nk
satisfactory to the Association.

32. With disbursements delayed, teachers went on strike. Thus, S Y 2008/ 09,
although of ficially l aunched on O ctober 1 st, did not be gin on t ime. In addition t o t he
disbursement delay, the main teachers union (Sinaprof) used the beginning of the school
year, and parliamentary elections scheduled for November 2008, as the primary leverage
for having their claims heard; widening their claims and asking for the payment of arrears
back to 2007 a nd before, and also allegedly pursued other claims in relation to dues that
could not be accommodated, according to the MoF.

33. Once agreements were finally reached between the World Bank and the GoGB
that the situation had been resolved, some disruptions to disbursements occurred as
the result of the Government not having enough funds to pay all teachers. Thus, despite
funds being available for primary teachers, these were held until counterpart funds were
available t o co ver s econdary t eacher's s alaries a s w ell. R estructuring co uld h ave b een
undertaken to allow for the payment of other teachers in the sector, as was recommended
by the pre-audit evaluation in S eptember. A level-two restructuring with R egional Vice
President a pproval w ould ha ve ne eded t o be i mplemented t o change be neficiaries ( and
Country Director approval to change indicator levels) and include an amendment to the
Financing A greement a nd a P roject P aper C orrigendum. H owever, t he r estructuring
request arrived late from the GoGB (in early January 2009, despite the task team having
encouraged the MoF to submit one since September 2008). At that stage, and with a new
government a ssuming p ower a nd di sbursements e xpected t o be c ompleted b y M arch, i t
was f elt th at r estructuring w ould h ave c reated s ignificant d elays with limite d b enefits,
relative to simply extending the closing date by three months to make full use of the IDA
funds for primary teachers' salaries.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

34. The results chain is largely consistent and relates and links identified problems
with objectives, but is hampered by insufficient realism in implementation, and an overly
narrow be neficiary group. T he f ollowing three sets o f p roblems a re id entified in th e
Project P aper p roblem d escription: ( a) government in stability - p olitical and f iscal, (b)
generalized poverty (especially for non-wage earners), and (c) low educational attainment
for students. Addressing these problems, the intended outcomes were to: (a) maintain the



                                               10
stability of t he c ountry a nd pr oviding r esources t o s ustain t he e ducation s ubsector
(higher-level outcome goals); (b) pay teachers in a timely fashion (intermediate outcome
goal); a nd ( c) ha ve c hildren r eceive pr imary s chool e ducation, w ith t he t wo pr oxy
indicators of opportunity to learn given as satisfactory completion of SY 2007/08 and the
timely commencement of SY 2008/09. Given the broadly defined PDO ­ to sustain the
education s ector as a whole - t he ch oice o f p rimary s chool t eachers as t he o nly
beneficiary is one main inconsistency.

35. The three indicators set out in the Project design are only partially adequate.
The m ain i ndicator i s t hat t imely p ayment o f t eachers i s ach ieved an d n o s alary a rrears
for primary teachers are accumulated in 2008. These are strong, clear-cut, intuitive, and
robust i ndicators f or w hich da ta c an be c ollected; out put-based i ndicators t hat c an be
monitored f airly e asily e ven i n a pos t-conflict s etting. H owever, after c onsidering
baseline in formation w e s ee th at th ey tw o o f th e o ther th ree in dicators ( satisfactory
completion of SY07/08 and timely start of SY08/09) are either not possible or extremely
unlikely t o b e s uccessful. T hey are t herefore an unreasonable m easure o f t he P rojects'
contribution t o hi gher-level out comes and, i n t his s ense, t herefore misleading. They ar e
not sufficient because: (i) they do not cover the actual time frame of the Project, and (ii)
they are not grounded in what the Bank can reasonably be held accountable for. This is
especially the case for the indicator aiming at satisfactory completion of SY 2007/08. By
the t ime of pr oject di scussion b y r eviewers i n F ebruary 2008, t here h ad a lready be en
strikes f rom O ctober t hrough D ecember. S econd, t eachers uni ons a re know n t o c all a
strike before the start of every year, since this is their best leverage point for having their
claims addressed. Importantly, there is also no nu meric baseline in the Project Paper on
what constitutes "satisfactory completion" of the school year.

36. When asked, stakeholders had different views on the realism and
appropriateness of the indicators. F or a s chool year t o be c ompleted s atisfactorily i t
really ne eds t o be gin i n O ctober be cause of t he J une be ginning of t he r ainy s eason;
otherwise, many schools become inaccessible. From that standpoint, several stakeholders
agreed t hat i t i s a g ood i ndicator of t he l ikely success of a s chool year. H owever,
indicators (a) and (b) do not l eave any room for gradations i n assessment, and i t i s not
clear how some indicators would be used in guiding implementation. Similarly, there is
no va riance given t hat would guide pr oject i mplementers t o a djust be haviors or i nform
the ne ed f or r estructuring. A n i mproved i ndicator c ould pe rhaps ha ve been: m inimal
interruptions during project effectiveness, with gradations; for example, less than 5 da ys
as highly satisfactory, less than 10 days as satisfactory, and so on; and that the beginning
point be t aken a t t he t ime a t w hich t he M oF/MoE w ere a ssured t hat t he P roject w ould
happen (in this case when the "letter of comfort" was provided, December 27, 2007).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
37. There were no Safeguard issues identified during preparation, n or w ere an y
safeguard i ssues t riggered dur ing i mplementation. G iven t he ope ration's pur pose of
paying education wages, no safeguards issues arose.




                                                11
38. However, there was one major fiduciary issue e arly in imp lementation w ith
regard t o t he h andling of m onies de posited b y t he W orld B ank i nto t he D esignated
Account opened at ECOBANK. This issue was eventually resolved (see discussion under
implementation section, paragraph 31, above), but suggests that even when dealing with a
well-established p rivate institution, in a f ragile s tate c ontext th ings c an g o w rong a nd
special diligence is needed to ensure that project funds are channeled as intended.

39. During implementation, the PIU team was responsible for ensuring fiduciary
compliance at the project level. T he P IU e nsured t hat onl y t hose ( primary s chool)
teachers on t he c ivil s ervice r oll, t eachers w ho he ld c ontracts w ith t he M oE, a nd ne w
teachers validated b y t he M oE who had not yet been added t o t he M oF list, were paid.
This w as a pa instaking pr ocess t hat i nvolved checking e ach na me a gainst t he va lid
signature and discounting any entry not validated by the list. One problem was that the
MoF-validated c ivil s ervants l ist c ontained bot h primary and s econdary school t eacher
names. Another issue that needed to be addressed during the Project was the loss of an
entire R egion's t hree m onths' wages. The B ank did not pa y for t his l oss with i ts funds
and r esponsibility for t hese f unds w as a ssumed b y the Government, including t he
disciplining of t he M oE " payer" w ho l ost t he f unds. It i s not c lear w hat, i f a ny,

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
40.     The Project was meant to be a "bridge" t o a br oader, m ore r eform-oriented
project i ntervention t o s upport t he G uinea-Bissau e ducation s ector, t o be s ubmitted f or

that some of the lessons learned from this project can feed into the EFA-FTI operation,
which is s till u nder p reparation a s o f th e w riting o f th is Implementation C ompletion

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

41.    The objectives of the Project were highly relevant t o t he c ontext of Guinea-
Bissau, given the broader need to prevent state failure and the crucial need to sustain the
education s ector. S tate f ragility an d i nsecurity h ave m any k inds o f ad verse af fects o n
individuals, f amilies, a nd s ocieties, a nd ove rcoming t hese i s a ke y objective of


                                               12
development a ssistance. Countries s hould not no rmally have t o bor row t o pa y s alaries.
However, owing to the extremely poor post-conflict context, with high national debts and
an i mpending c ollapse of t he s ector due t o a n a ccumulation of a rrears, t he P roject's
simple a im o f p aying s alaries d irectly a ddressed a k ey w eakness in th e s ystem. In a
situation where many priorities compete for a constrained pool of government resources,
it is highly appropriate for the Bank to focus upon sectors where insufficient investment
might l ead t o i rreversible da mage. If p rimary s chool e ducation i s not pr ovided t o
children, a n e ntire generation w ill be i rreversibly di sadvantaged. H owever, w hile t he
broad obj ectives o f a ddressing t he s ector a nd t he r ationale for f ocusing on p rimary
education are clear, limiting eligible beneficiaries to primary school teachers proved too
narrow, w as not f ully aligned w ith t he P DO, and di d not d irectly encourage pe ace
amongst stakeholders, as was intended.

42. Given the resource envelope and the time frame, the general design was
appropriate and appropriately simple, ex cept t hat s econdary s chool t eachers (and
possibly ot her t eachers) s hould a lso ha ve be en i ncluded a s be neficiaries a nd pr oject
indicators s hould ha ve been m ore r ealistic. G iven c onstraints of t ime a nd f unding
amounts, t he P roject w as a ppropriately t argeted as be ing a br idge t o a broader, m ore
comprehensive education sector reform project scheduled for 2009. Given the emergency
nature of the situation, the Project designs' emphasis on f ast disbursement of funds was
also appropriate, even though quality issues could not be addressed properly. Moreover,
implementation a rrangements w ere appropriately straightforward, with di sbursements
made t o r eimburse government pa yment of t eacher s alaries, va lidated b y signatures of
receipts, an d w ith al l f iduciary aspects m anaged b y an ex isting co mpetent an d ef ficient

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

43. Despite important shortcomings in the achievement of project objectives, there
were also important positive outcomes to this Project. Despite enormous set-backs, by
the e nd of pr oject i mplementation a ll pr imary s chool t eachers' w ages w ere pa id ( from
October 2007 t o March 2009), as was intended by the Project, and no ne w arrears were
accumulated. These wage payments contributed to teacher's conducting classes, such that
the GoGB was able to declare valid both SY2007/08 and SY2008/09, the latter with an
extension to make up for time lost during strikes. If we adhere strictly to the inaccurate
baseline, that assumes that the school year usually starts on time, then rated strictly this
Project w ould b e r ated Unsatisfactory. H owever, a M oderately Unsatisfactory rating i s

fragility n eed t o b e given d ue w eight i n as sessing t he achievements an d deficiencies o f

3.3 Efficiency

44. A formal analysis of efficiency was not undertaken. As an Emergency Operation
and a b ridge t o a br oader pr oject i n 2009, t he mechanism of s alary payments t o t he
exclusion of other inputs such as educational materials was chosen because it would be
the most efficient method to address a government funding gap for the education sector.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

45. The contribution that project funds made to fill the budget shortfall to pay
wages, and the overall outcomes, are rated as having had significant shortcomings,
despite strong relevance to country needs. The Project was and remains highly relevant to
country needs. The Project's intention, rationale, and instrument were highly appropriate,
and Bank funds were ultimately fully disbursed to pay primary school teachers, and were
thereby us ed t o s upport a c rucial s ocial s ector, w hich, be cause of t he P roject, h as
improved pr ospects f or t he f uture. A t t he s ame t ime, a s ignificant pa rt o f t he P roject's
objectives were not met: (a) primary education services were interrupted, with almost 33
percent of designated SY 2007/08 school days lost; and (b) SY 2008/09 did not begin on
time ( see Implementation S tatus Report # 4). D espite th at, th e G oGB d eclared S Y
2007/08 valid, even though it is questionable whether the school year could be considered
to ha ve b een "completed s atisfactorily" w hen measured against obj ective s tandards.
Because t he P roject P aper d id n ot s pecify a t arget v alue f or j udging t his i ndicator as

closing.

3.5 Overarching Themes, other Outcomes and Impacts (not previously covered)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
46. Overarching themes to uched o n b y th is P roject in clude n ational s tability, th e
proper functioning of Guinea-Bissau's public wage system, poverty, basic education, the
role of civil society in monitoring projects' and government activities in general, and the
importance of t hinking broadly i n or der t o a chieve s pecific goals. T he Bank doe s not
have data on t he gender i mpact of t his P roject; t his would require knowing t he r elative
proportion of f emale-to-male t eachers, a s w ell a s g ender-disaggregated i nformation on
indirect beneficiaries. We can say with confidence, however, that the poverty impacts of
the Project were positive, especially in the medium term, by preventing an interruption of
primary schoolchildren's education.



                                                 14
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
47.      As an Emergency Operation, there were no institutional goals for this
Project. T he d ecision n ot t o us e a pa yment a gency m ay, ne vertheless, i n r etrospect be
seen to have strengthened the use of country systems indirectly by obliging the GoGB to
examine the issue of its civil servant lists more c losely, because of the diligence of the
PIU i n pa ying onl y t hose t eachers w hose s ignatures c ould be va lidated. D epending on
follow-up, t his m ay ho wever be a nother e xample of " muddling t hrough" rather t han
strengthening. A bi ometric c ivil s ervant s urvey i s unde rway t o c reate a m onitorable
database of civil servants, and the MoF is seeking an appropriate software system and a
sponsor t o i mprove t he c oordination of l ists be tween t he M oF a nd MoE ( and ot her
sectoral m inistries). An E xcel d atabase w as d eveloped d uring t he l ast W orld B ank
education project, which is the basis of MoE staff updating, whereas the MoF apparently
still uses a custom-made, outdated software program that is difficult and time-consuming
to upda te. G iven c ompeting pr iorities a nd t he c onstant pr essure of a pr ecarious budge t,
support to the GoGB in consolidating these systems is warranted in follow-up projects. A
follow-up pr oject s hould a ddress s ystemic challenges i ncluding da tabase m anagement,
which this Project drew attention to but was unable to address..

48.     The cooperation exhibited between the Bank and GoGB during the Project,
including during the preparation of this ICR, was very positive. D espite d ifficult
country conditions, there is a great deal of goodwill and an apparent willingness within
the M oE a nd M oF t o a ddress c ore i ssues. H owever, t his P roject pe rhaps m issed a n
opportunity to engage stakeholders in finding solutions for certain known issues such as
the relationships between ministries and unions, and the problems faced by the ministries
in c oordinating th eir employee lis ts. P erhaps what is n eeded mo re in a c ountry like
Guinea-Bissau is "implementation support" rather than "supervision," since capacity is a
big i ssue, bot h i n t erms of c oordinated, i ntegrated s ystems, a nd pe ople w ho ha ve
knowledge and experience to manage these effectively.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
49.     There is a potential, but not confirmed, unintended project impact on
incentives in the de-linking of payments and performance. A possible ne gative
unintended consequence of the Project is that in paying teachers retroactively for October
to December 2007, t he Bank appears to be condoning pa ying people for work not done
(since teachers were on strike during all of that period). This might create an expectation
that B ank p rojects w ill p ay w ages i rrespective o f d elivery of s ervices, an ad verse
incentive th at milita tes against th e goal o f a chieving r esults f or a c rucial group o f
beneficiaries (that is, students). This possible incentive effect has not been confirmed but
warrants consideration in the design of future operations.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
50. No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were held.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High (H)

51.      The likelihood that strikes will again interrupt the provision of primary
school education in the future is high. R isks t o de velopment out comes ( provision of
education) would be reduced if: (a) public sector reform measures, including cleaning the
wage bill (confirming the list of teachers employed) , and decreasing the overall number
of c ivil s ervants, a re s uccessful i n t he m edium t erm; ( b) be tter relations a re de veloped
with teachers unions and their members (to improve communication and reduce conflict);
(c) working conditions for teachers are improved and a formal understanding reached on
the question of arrears clearance (to reduce incentives for strikes); (d) Parents' & Tutors'
Associations are supported to maintain pressure on teachers unions to provide education
services; a nd ( e) dono r s upport t hrough t he E FA-FTI i s f orthcoming t o s upport
improvements in qualitative aspects of teaching as well.

52.    The risk of fiscal or political instability, leading to interruption to primary
education, is also high. W hile th ere is c urrently relative p olitical s tability in G uinea-
Bissau, w ith s uccessful e lections ha ving b een he ld i n N ovember 20 08, a nd a ne w
President e lected i n J une 2009, t he unde rlying causes o f pov erty and l atent c onflict

government finances and risks to social peace. So long as wages do not get paid on time,
we c an also expect t hat relationship between t eachers' uni ons and t he M oE will not be
good, and without recourse to other means, strikes will reoccur.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)

53.     Despite its strengths, there were major shortcomings Bank Performance at
ensuring the Project's Quality at Entry. Particular strengths of the Project include the
innovative us e of t he e mergency f acility ( OP/BP 8.00) t o pa y wages, t he di rect a nd
straightforward project design, and the use of a pre-existing PIU to implement the Project
­ crucial to project success. As described in detail above in section 2.1, while the Project
exhibited very high relevance to country development needs, the Bank preparation team
did not do e nough, ho wever, t o: ( i) ensure t hat a ccurate ba seline i nformation on t he
primary school wage bill was obtained from the client and validated; (ii) ensure that other
stakeholders w ere i ncluded i n consultations during p reparation and/or ne gotiations; (iii)

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)

54.     Quality of Supervision is rated as having had moderate shortcomings. During
implementation, Bank staff were largely e ffective in identifying issues w hen they a rose
and a ppear t o h ave w orked qui ckly, pr oactively, a nd e ffectively as a t eam t o r esolve
them. From emails exchanged between team members, relevant team members are shown
to have been quickly involved, with management consulted and acting quickly to address
issues brought to them. The two main issues that arose during implementation were: (i)
the temporary seizure of project funds in the Designated Account by ECOBANK, and (ii)
delays i n t he P roject a pparently caused b y t he MoF not ha ving s ufficient f unds t o pa y
secondary school teachers. These issues took time to unearth, however in both instances,
once t he i ssue w as i dentified, t he P roject s upervision t eam f ollowed up w ith t he C lient

55.      One benefit was that the task team included members who were very
familiar with stakeholders in Guinea-Bissau and could engage in dialogue with them
which c ontributed s ignificantly t o s upervision e ffectiveness. T he t eam a lso s ought

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

56.     The Bank found a way to give much-needed support to Guinea-Bissau at a
time of great need and under tight constraints, ba sing d esign l argely on l essons
learned f rom previous e xperience. However, i n l ight of project out comes, s hortcomings
in overall Bank performance were significant. The Bank should have designed the Project
to b e mo re in clusive, with g reater in puts f rom s ectoral s pecialists a nd f rom M oE, a nd
with a broader range of teacher beneficiaries. More attention should have been paid to the
PDO a nd i ndicators c hosen b y t he t eam t o e valuate pr oject s uccess. D uring de sign, t he
Bank should have done better due diligence to ensure accurate wage bill information, and
sought t o ensure t hat t he Government was i nclusive of k ey s takeholders. MoE officials
should ha ve be en i nvited t o a ttend ne gotiations. D uring i mplementation, t he B ank w as

payments were late and school days were lost, so that results fell short of PDO indicators.
The situation had the Project not been undertaken in the way that it was however, could
have been very much worse.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory (U)

57.      Even acknowledging difficult circumstances, there were major shortcomings
in government performance i n ensuring t he qua lity of p roject p reparation a nd
implementation, and compliance with covenants and agreements toward the achievement
of t he P roject's de velopment out comes. T hese s hortcomings s hould be d ifferentiated i n

for the GoGB, and for the MoF, in particular, which sought creative ways to overcome a

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)

59.     Despite exhibiting significant shortcomings, there were also important
positive aspects to the Borrower performance in working towards achieving the
outcomes of the Project. While the Borrower (MoF) did not initially provide an accurate
primary education wage bi ll and relationships between M oE and M oF were poor at t he
outset of the Project (due to frictions in the ruling coalition), during implementation the
GoGB, i ncluding t he M oE a nd t he i mplementing P IU, m ade a f orthright a ttempt t o

6. Lessons Learned

6.1 Project-Specific Lessons

60.     Where the payment of salaries is a major area of concern, all teachers'
groups need to be covered, even if the focus is on primary education. In a fragile state
like Guinea-Bissau, where teachers' unions are strong and wages are tied very closely to
poverty, it is not acceptable to unions to pay one group and not another. Differentiating
wage pa yments on t he basis of s chool l evel c an c reate s ocial di vision a nd c onflict.
Additionally, " solidarity" i s a ke y principle of unions; i t s hould be expected th at th ey
would go on strike if all teachers belonging to the union are not paid. There are additional
reasons to include high-school teachers in the payment of salaries. If we consider the aim
of p rimary e ducation a s th e a ttainment o f a t le ast f unctional lite racy and n umeracy,
projects s hould f ocus on a br oader not ion of b asic e ducation a nd not onl y on pr imary
education. Given that many students do not attain literacy even after a full primary school
course, quality of e ducation ne eds t o be come of i ncreased f ocus i f pr imary and ot her
education i s t o be m eaningful i n G uinea-Bissau. This a lso ne cessitates t hat t here be a n
option t o c ontinue s tudy beyond pr imary s chool, t o s upport hum an d evelopment i n
learning be yond l iteracy. T herefore, e ven t hough t he P roject c ontributed t o a voiding

balance s trengthened s ocial p eace b y financing primary t eacher s alaries, i t w ould h ave
been much more effective if the beneficiaries had also included secondary teachers.

61.     The Bank must do its due diligence to ensure accurate baseline data. Th e
opportunity c ost o f not calculating t he p rimary education w age bi ll c orrectly m ay ha ve
been dr opping he alth s ector w ages f rom t he P roject. H ealth i s a rguably a n e qually

historically l ess lik ely t o g o o n s trike. G iven u ncertain in formation, p reparation te ams
should not rely on only a single source of information but validate it by cross referencing
with other stakeholders and sectoral colleagues. Where, in an emergency operation, it is
not pos sible t o e nsure t hat c omplete a nd c orrect ba seline va lues a re ob tained be fore
project implementation, baselines should be obtained as quickly as possible, and project

restructuring be considered immediately to ensure that indicators can be properly targeted
so that the Project can be monitored, adjusted as needed, and evaluated effectively.

62.      Indicators need to be realistic, useful, and owned by government officials. By
the time the Project was approved, Key Performance Indicator 1 w as already impossible
to achieve, since the school year had been officially launched but teaching did not begin
until a fter a t hree-month de lay. T his i ndicator needed to be m odified t o a dd " during
project e ffectiveness," w ith t he da te be ginning at t he poi nt w here t he G oGB w as i n a
position t o ne gotiate with t eachers uni ons t o continue w ith c lasses (as h appened). Had
this been the nuanced indicator, it would have been rated Satisfactory. Key Performance
Indicator 2 was always highly unlikely to be achieved, since historically the school year
does not s tart on t ime. T hese obs ervations a gain poi nt t o t he ne ed f or a t horough
grounding in baseline data and information on the contextual realities of the sector. Also,
project indicators should be simple and flexible to allow for project- and context-specific
risks to play out, since in a fragile state environment they are likely. For example, in this
case, t he M oE extended t he s chool year t o a llow f or t he pos sibility o f an S Y 2008/ 09
with enough days taught to be considered complete. Alternate measurement in terms of
days or even hours taught could add an alternative method for schools to "catch up."

6.2 Lessons for Fragile and Conflict-Affected State Projects

63. It is better that the designing Task Team Leader (TTL) remain the
implementing TTL for short-term Emergency Operations. F irst, th e designing T TL
has a f ull unde rstanding of t he r easons for t he d esign; s econd, t he de signing T TL w ill

that t hey will pe rsonally need t o address t he c onsequences of d esign i ssues t hat m ay
arise.

64.     Operations that seem simple may be complicated in a fragile state context.
This P roject s eemed, a t t he de sign s tage, t o be s traightforward. C omplicating factors
included the incorrect estimation of the wage bill and the fact that two significant risks
came t o p ass: a cr isis o f i nadequate f iscal r esources f aced b y t he G overnment i n ear ly
2008, and t eacher s trikes. W hile t he first w as u navoidable, t he s econd c ould have b een

that is more difficult once implementation begins. This role is especially crucial in fragile
