Emergency Public\n            Service Delivery Project in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is\n            to contribute to uninterrupted delivery of critical public\n            services through the provision of resources for payment of\n            teachers' salaries. The Bank support for this project\n            is part of a multi-faceted effort by the international\n            community to help reduce the fragility of the economy and\n            the state. The approach aims to develop a strategic platform\n            based on three pillars: (i) satisfactory macroeconomic\n            program and improved fiscal stability; (ii) stimulating\n            growth; and (iii) alleviating poverty. The project aims to\n            ensure that educational services are maintained in 2008,\n            paving the way for more substantial support in 2009, beyond\n            that to be provided under the Education for All-Fast Track\n            Initiative (EFA-FTI)."}, "docdt": "2008-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
