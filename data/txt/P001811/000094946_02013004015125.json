Project sustainability is assessed as\n            likely, but the report cautions it would be prudent to wait\n            another eighteen months before an impact evaluation can be\n            carried out since a number of project activities suffered\n            implementation delays and the impact of their implementation\n            is yet to register. Overall world Bank performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory, although this is on the thin borderline\n            between \"marginally satisfactory\" and\n            \"unsatisfactory.\" Overall borrower performance is\n            unsatisfactory: while the borrower remained committed to the\n            project's objectives and was engaged in continuous\n            dialogue with the Bank on policy issues, there were\n            instances where information affecting the financial sector\n            reform program was not freely shared with the Bank. The\n            Borrower also did little to solve the problems causing\n            delays in implementation progress. The implementation agency\n            's performance was largely responsible for the delays\n            in some components. Som of the lessons learned from this\n            project include: More attention should be paid to the\n            quality of privatizations of state-owned banks. The removal\n            of political influence in the bank's day-to-day\n            operations should be a top priority during privatization."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
