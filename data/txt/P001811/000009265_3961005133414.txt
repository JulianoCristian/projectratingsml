MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO MOZAMBIQUE
FOR A FINANCIAL SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING CREDIT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
development credit to the Government of Mozambique for SDR 6.6 million, the equivalent of US$9.0
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project of Financial
Sector Capacity Building. In addition to providing support for human resource development in the
financial sector, the project also supports the Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC) and the
policies and activities that the Government has pledged to undertake, in its Letter of Development
Policy to the Bank of December 1, 1993 (Annex VIII). The SERC is being processed concurrently
with this operation.
2.        BACKGROUND. With a per capita national income of US$80 (1991), Mozambique is one
of the poorest countries in the world. The post independence period has largely been one of
stagnation and decline resulting from the migration of most of the country's skilled workforce at
independence, the institution of bad economic policies, and an on-going civil war. Over this period,
national income declined significantly. Escalating warfare reduced the attractiveness of Mozambique
ports for the land locked countries to the west, and trade was re-routed through alternative ports in
South Africa and Tanzania. Tourism, also a major income earner in the pre-independence period,
fell dramatically with the escalation of the war. Civil disturbances in rural areas also meant that
agricultural activities declined, as large numbers of the rural population either fled to neighboring
countries or migrated to the cities in search of safety. Migrant mine workers remittances, from the
mines in South Africa, also declined over this period, as recruitment by the Republic of South Africa
declined.
3.        These developments led to declining levels of industrial and agricultural production and
declining levels of national income growth. Consequently, in 1987, the Government embarked upon
an Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) which sought to reverse the economic trends of the past
decade by instituting a series of reforms which liberalized and deregulatcd the economy away from
a rigidly planned system of socialism. This was followed in 1989-90 by the Economic and Social
Rehabilitation Program (ESRP) which continued to pursue the economic aims and policies of the ERP
but with a greater emphasis on poverty alleviation.
4.        This led to strong economic growth in the years immediately following 1987. However,
in the early 1990's several developments took place which adversely impacted growth. First, markets
in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc countries were lost as political reform took hold in those
countries; second, migrant workers in East Germany were repatriated, as political change led to
German unification; third, the Southern African region entered a period of prolonged drought; last,
world wide economic recession had an adverse impact on growth throughout the entire Sub-Saharan
region. These developments resulted in growth in real GDP falling from 5.4 percent in 1989 to 1.3,
2.7, and -2.4 percent in 1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively. However, in 1993 real GDP growth is
estimated to have recovered to 5.6 percent.
5.        Several recent developments, however, have greatly enhanced Mozambique's prospects
for growth during the remainder of the 1990s. The signing of a peace accord between the
Government and Renamo in 1992, has placed the Mozambique economy in a good position to achieve
substantial growth throughout the remainder of the decade. Lasting peace, followed by democratic
change, will permit the re-establishment of many of Mozambique's traditional sources of economic



-2-
activity - the development of agriculture, the growth of activity through the transport corridors, re-
development of tourism -- as well as encouraging foreign investment (South African and Portuguese
investors appear to be potentially large sources of foreign investment for the Mozambican economy).
6.        THE FINANCIAL SECToR. Macroeconomic control in Mozambique has been hampered
by the amalgamation, until early 1992, of the central bank (Banco de Mocambique) and the largest
commercial bank (Banco Comercial de Mogambique). Prior to 1987, this combined institution largely
operated as an arm of the Government budget, allocating credit based upon the Government plan.
The separation of fiscal from banking activities is an important objective of the overall adjustment
program, and the development of audited, timely accounts from all banks, and the strengthening of
these institutions is an important objective of both the Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC) and
this proposed Financial Sector Capacity Building (FS CB) Project. With no history of proper central
banking, and a certain amount of confusion between central and commercial banking functions, it is
vitally necessary to train competent central banking staff to operate in key central banking areas.
Specifica'ly this will mean a development of skills in the three key areas of macro-monetary
management, supervision of the banking system, and foreign exchange management. These skills
will need to be developed within the context of a market based and liberalized econouic setting.
7.       In addition, the financial sector has been identified as a key constraint to further growth
in the economy. Payment systems have largely broken down, banking services are limited and
inefficiently provided, and financial innovation in terms of institutions and instruments has been
virtually non-existent. In addition, the majority of the staff working in the financial sector have a
very limited formal education, and their training has mainly been acquired in a period when the
banking system operated under the Government plan rather than in a free market environment. There
is therefore, a need to train banking staff to adapt so that they can undertake banking business in a
deregulated environment.
8.       In 1992, Banco de Mopambique embarked upon a program of financial sector reform,
which is being supported by the World Bank under the SERC and this proposed credit. The central
bank and the largest commercial bank have now been split; the central bank has deregulated entry,
allowing two Portuguese banks to conmence operations as fully licensed commercial banks; other
foreign banks are known to be interested in entering the market; insurance activities have been
deregulated and two new insurance companies have commenLed operations; accounts for all
institutions are being developed to an auditable standard; and regulations are being drafted on bank
licensing, capital adequacy, provisioning policy, and exposure limits. These developments will help
provide the legal and regulatory basis for the development of a competitive and well diversified
financial sector, capable of servicing the needs of the real sectors of the economy. However,
weakness in the human resource base remains a key major constraint to the development of the sector
which needs to be addressed through a comprehensive program of reform.
9.        PREviOUS AND CuR T SUPPORT iN TIEI AREA OF BANIG TRAING. Training for
banking sector staff has been provided in the past by the Swiss Development Cooperation and the
Governments of France and Portugal. All three have a continuing interest in providing on-going
support for training in this sector. The proposed project has been developed in full cooperation and
collaboration with the Governments of Switzerland, France and Portugal. Co-financing support for
the program will be provided by the Governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Parallel
financing of training programs and facilities will be provided by the Governments of France and
Portugal.



10.       PROJECT OBJECTIVES. The Financial Sector Capacity Building (FS CB) project will
develop and strengthen the institutions charged with implementing the policy and institutional reforms
agreed under the Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC). The main objectives of the project are
to: (a) train central bank staff so that they can undertake -- better macro-monetary management,
prudential supervision of the financial sector, and manage a more effective system of foreign
exchange allocation; (b) train staff in the comnercial banks so that they can more effectively provide
trade finance to importers, appraise credit applications and, for higher level staff in the banks,
provide more effective overall management; (c) train a core of legal professionals in the central bank
and the Ministry of Finance to review and re-draft financial and other related legislation for its
applicability in a deregulated financial environment -- and to also strengthen legal systems which may
beneficially impact upon the overall operation of the financial system; (d) support institution building
within the financial sector, through the recruitment of technical assistance experts who can, in large
part, train local staff and help develop local competencies; (e) study certain aspects of the financial
sector in greater depth, to provide a better understanding of possible policy alternatives. The credit
will be supporting the Government's initiatives in these areas, as enunciated in the attached letter
from the Governor of the central bank to the World Bank, of December 1, entitled "Letter Describing
the Government's Capacity Building Program in the Financial Sector" (Annex VIII).
it.       PROJECT DESCRuPTION. The toa project of US$10.5 million will be divided into five
major components (the project is describedl in greater detail in Annex I);
(a)    Central Bank Training. The first component will consist of US$1.92 million to be used
for central bank training. This component includes training staff in key areas of central
bank activity -- specifically in macroeconomic policy analysis and policy making, banking
regulation and supervision, foreign exchange control and foreign exchange management,
and accounting strengthening. The development and strengthening of management
information system (MIS) procedures will also be an important element of this sub-
component. This program will include a series of short courses, over a period of four
to five years, in key central banking activities (these are outlined in Annex III). The
project will also support a very limited amount of postgraduate study abroad, attachments
to other central banking institutions, and attendance at seminars, conferences and other
courses. The training of local trainers is an important component of all the training
programs under this credit -- such that the use of external trainers can be phased out over
the program period as they are replaced by Mozambican trainers.
(b)    Commercial Bank Training. The second component, comprising US$1.44 million, will
support commercial bank training -- both through identified short term courses to meet
specific skills, as well as providing a limited amount of institutional support for the
Banker's Institute being developed in conjunction with the local banks and the
Government of France. Whereas the emphasis of the French Government program is on
the development of longer term banking courses, the IDA program will focus on meeting
immediate commercial bank training needs. Specifically, the credit will support training
programs in bank credit analysis, project appraisal techniques, documentary credits, trade
finance, and management training for commercial bank staff. Achlieving full cost
recovery on these commercial banking courses by the end of the program period, in
1999, is an important feature of this component of the credit.
(c)    Strengthening Legal Financial Capacities. Given the importance of an appropriate
legal environment to the operation of the banking system - as well as requirements under



the SERC program to revise, inter alia, supplemental legislation with regard to Foreign
Exchange Control, Insurance, Pension and Provident Funds, and Money and Capital
Markets, the project will support a strong program of legal sector training. This training
will not only focus on training central banking staff and staff from the Ministry of
Finance, to develop the approp:iate legislative environment for the conduct of financial
activities, but will also extend further to other aspects of institutional development as well
as the dissemination of the law. Without such a strengthening of the overall legal
financial environment, financial sector reform  will remain un-enforceable.  This
component of the project represents US$2.72 million of the total.
(d)   Institutional Development. A fourth component of US$4.02 million will be used to
assist institutional development through the funding of technical advisors to support the
SERC program -- including advisors in the research, banking supervision and foreign
exchange control departments of Banco de Mocambique. These funds will also be used
to finance the development of Strategic Plans and subsequent restructuring work in the
two State owned commercial banks. In line with moves within the Africa region,
external technical assistance programs will be designed in a manner which will have the
largest possible impact upon developing local African capacity. Use of long term
external consultants will be maintained at the minimum required, and the transfer of skills
to local counterpart staff will figure prominently in the terms of reference of all such
staff. Innovative arrangements, such as twinning arrangements, with institutions such as
Banco de Portugal and the Bank of England -- on an "in-out" basis -- will also be
utilized, to help ensure the development of local competencies. Classification of technical
assistance (based on outcome) is provided in Annex 1, Table 3.
(e)    Studies/Project Support. A small component of around US$410,000 will be used to
fund studies to underpin the on-going program of financial sector reform. These funds
will be used to finance both internal and external consultants, however, emphasis will be
placed on utilizing local consultancy capacity as much as possible.
12.       A detailed description of the project components is provided in Annex I. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Due to serious domestic resource
constraints, the Government contribution will be limited to around 5 percent (mainly for the local cost
contributions required to drive this program within Mo7ambique), with IDA and the Governments
of Switzerland and the United Kingdom financing 95 percent of total project costs. Amounts and the
method of procurement, and the categories and schedule of disbursement are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mozambique are
given in Schedules C and D respectively.
13.       PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. Banco de Mo9ambique, will have the overall responsibility
for administering the Credit and coordinating activities supported by it and the SERC operation.
Specifically the Human Resources Department within BM will have overall coordinating responsibility
-- and a project coordinator working within this department has been assigned overall responsibility
for the program. Five coordinators for the above five sub-components have also been identified, and
will have responsibility for implementing their particular component of the program. These
arrangements were confirmed at appraisal. In addition, a Training Coordinating Committee, with
representatives from Banco de Moqambique, the two state banks, and representatives of the private
sector banks, has been formed to oversee coordination of the overall training pregram within the
Banker's Institute. Over time, the Banker's Institute will develop overall responsibility for the



- 5 -
commercial bank training components of the program -- although this will depend on how quickly
the Institute can be established and become operational. Although it is preferable that the Banker's
Institute be established as quickly as possible -- as a vehicle for providing bank training - the
implementation of this project is not contingent upon its operationalization.
14.       The project will be reviewed on an annual basis, based upon agreed Performance
Indicators and an Implementation Plan -- contained in this Memorandum as Annex VI. Annual
reviews will commence at twelve monthly intervals after the credit becomes effective. There will also
be a mid-term review of the program during 1996. Due to the supervision intensive nature of this
operation, efforts are being made to strengthen the Resident Mission in Maputo, through the
recruitment of appropriately qualified local Mozambican staff to help supervise this, and other,
projects. This should greatly enhance the effectiveness and timeliness of implementation capabilities.
15.       PROJECT SUsTAINABILITY.  The availability of adequately skilled personnel is a
particularly pressing problem in Mozambique. Projects have often been adversely impacted by
trained staff moving on to higher payihg positions in the private sector -- or to work as staff of the
international aid agencies. The current project attempts to address these issues by (a) working mainly
with an institution, the central bank, where the turn over of staff has been low (around half the
professional staff of BM have been employed by the bank for over 15 years), and (b) supporting the
establishment of commercial bank training programs -- which can be given through a Banker's
Institute -- so as to help develop a critical mass of trained personnel to carry out commercial banking
functions. The training facilities will be available to the commercial banks on a fee paying basis -
and this may induce the commercial banks to bond staff that they pay to have trained, thereby
addressing the problems caused by staffing movements. Given the poor performance of technical
assistance in many African countries, the recruitment of external technical assistance will have an
important focus on training of local staff. Innovative methods 3f utilizing technical assistance will
also be adopted to ensure, to the extent possible, the development of local capacities. In addition,
the strengthening of existing protocol arrangements with the Bank of Portugal -- for both training and
technical assistance requirements -- will help in establishing a longer term relationship within which
it will be possible to develop sustainable local capacity.
16.       LESSONS LEAND FROM PREVIOUS BANK/IDA INvOLvEmENT. The experience gained
from the Economic and Financial Management Technical Assistance Project (EFMTA) has shown that
there are long lead times between the development of a project concept and its operationalization -
especially with respect to training and technical assistance. Fortunately, this project will be following
on from the EFMTA project and will thereby be able to utilize systems which have already been
deveioped under the auspices of that project. Experience from that project has also demonstrated that
long lags can arise when the project is involved in the purchase of large pieces of capital equipment
(in the case of the EFMTA -- this was a large computer system for BM/13CM). Consequently, capital
goods purchases under the FS CB project are strictly limited to a small number of personal
computers, associated software, and books and publications. Long lags also arose under the EFMTA
project in the recruitment of technical advisors -- which further served to slow disbursement under
this operation. Consequently, the FS CB program places much more emphasis on training, rather
than technical assistance, and where TA is a requirement, the project has ensured that key steps in
the recruitment process are well in train (for example, many key TA positions have already been
advertised -- and some financed through the PPF). Lastly, commitment by the Government is a key
ingredient of success for projects in Mozambique. The proposed program is supported by a dynamic
Governor of the central bank who is determined to see the financial sector strengthened and made
capable of serving the needs of a growing economy.

17.       RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT. The development of a strong central bank and a
ound commercial banking system is necessary to conduct appropriate macro-monetary policy and
to ensure efficient and appropriate financial flows within the economy. In the absence of a strong,
3ndependent central bank, monetary control and overall .nacro economic control cannot be ensured.
The absence of a strong central banking supervisory authority will also increase the potential for
future systemic distress within the commercial banking system. Commercially sound banking
institutions are required to service the financing needs of all sectors of the economy. A recently
completed Mozambique Financial Sector Report, undertaken by the World Bank in conjunction with
SIDA, identified constraints which are being addressed in the context of the proposed SERC operation
-- the strengthening of the banking system is considered a key element for success of the overall
adjustment effort. Given the low implementation capacity within Mozambique, there is an associated
need to support the training requirements of this vital sector, as well as provide technical assistance
in key areas.
18.       RELATIONSHIP TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY. A Country Assistance Strategy is
being prepared and will be presented to the Board in conjunction with the next adjustment operation,
scheduled for Board presentation in the fourth quarter FY94. This project is fully in line with the
CAS currently unde, preparation (and the previous Bank Country Assistance Strategy for
Mozambique presented in November 1992), which notes the especially acute shortage of skilled
manpower in Mozambique, and recognizes that capacity creation through education and training is
an essential element of the Bank's overall strategy. The Country Assistance Strategy also stresses
the importance of strengthening the financial sector -- for Mozambique's development -- both in terms
of achieving macro-monetary stability, and as a vehicle for supporting private sector led growth.
19.       ACTIONS AGREED. By Negotiations the following conditions were met: (a) request for
funding, under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), to develop a Strategic Plan for BCM; (b)
selection of the firm which will provide the swat team for banking supervision; (c) approval of the
contract with the legal firm which is providing support to the Legal Department of the central bank;
(d) identification of the local counterpart trainers under the proposed program; (e) provision of a
letter describing the Government's Capacity Building Program within the financial sector to IDA.
Conditions of Board By Board presentation, the following two conditions had been met: (a) BM has
prepared a satisfactory action plan to (i) reverse the dormant status of special accounts by submitting
replenishment requests, and (ii) refund all outstanding amounts on closed credits, (b) selected an
auditor for the project. Dated Covenants (a) the submissicn to IDA of a draft Strategic Plan for Banco
Comercial de Mogambique, by October 1, 1994; (b) commencement of the implementation of BCM's
Strategic Plan, by January 1, 1995; and (c) if required by the Strategic Plan, the selection and
employment of management consultants to assist BCM management implement an agreed program
as identified by the Strategic Plan, by July 1, 1995.
20.       ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS. The Project will have no environmental impact.
21.       PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES.  The program will support the Government's
program to improve public sector management (through enhanced macro-monetary control) and to
create an enabling environment for private sector development. Although tht project will not have
a direct poverty alleviation impact, it should indirectly assist this key objective through the
development of a more stable macro economic environment and the development of a well
functioning banking system which more appropriately and efficiently meets the financing needs of the
real sectors of the economy.



- 7 -
22.       JUSTIFICATIONS AND RISKS. A risk of the program is that trained staff will move on to
other banks or into other private sector institutions once they have been trained. Inasmuch as staff
move into other banks, this will not be a particular problem, as the project aims to train staff for the
financial sector -- and not for a specific financial institution. Making commercial banks pay for
training on a graduated basis (up to full cost recovery by the fifth year of the program) will also make
bank management focus on ways of retaining staff that they have incurred a cost in training -- either
through bonding practices or other arrangements. Importantly, staff at the central bank are less
mobile than other staff in quasi public institutions because of the relatively better salaries and other
conditions provided by Banco de Mogambique. The Mozambique Government and Banco de
Moqambique place a high priority on training Mozambican staff -- and hence there is strong support
for the overall program. Another risk is that it may prove difficult and time consuming to recruit
adequately qualified, Portuguese speaking technical experts in key fields. To address this issue, work
on recruiting key individuals has already commenced.
23.       An important justification is that, with the adve,,+ of the peace accord, Mozambique is
well placed to re-develop economic activity and launch into a period of strong growth. Reform of
the financial sector is extremely important to service the needs of the sectors which will now be able
to perform productively in a peaceful environment. A further important justification is that with
reform in the banking sector, and movement to a liberalized and deregulated banking environment,
banking staff will need to develop skills hitherto not required in Mozambique. Central bankers will
need to develop bank supervisory skills and monetary policy management skills in a deregulated
environment; commercial bankers will need to develop a capacity to assess and price risks on lending
activities -- as well as provide trade finance on an effective and efficient basis; and the legal
environment will need to be rapidly upgraded to provide an appropriate legal framework for existing
and newly envisaged financial activities. This will require a major effort in developing human
resource capacities in the financial sector -- which this credit aims to address.
24.       RCOMmENDATION. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

REMARKS ON IMPLEiMTATION ISSUES
Mozambique's portfolio of IDA-supported projects is relatively new, with the first operation dating to FY87. Although progress in
implementation has generally been satisfactory, the perfomnance of disbursements has been less so. For example, the first mid-terrn review
for an investment project recently showed that while civil works were about 2/3 complete, disbursements were only 35 percent of the
project estimates. A large part of the problem has to do with the fact that while the Government has moved quickly toward a market-based
economy, Government agencies and administrative procedures remain largely unchanged. Thus, all IDA-supported projects were managed
financially by the central bank, Bank of Mozambique (BM), which needs to be strengthened. The CIR last year determined that this was
the main bottleneck to improving disbursements. The Bank has taken steps to decentralize the financial management of projects to the
implementing agencies through discussions with BM and conditions of the ongoing Economic Recovery Credit. Four operations are moving
slower than the average due to specific problems.
ECONOmC AND FINANCAL MANAGEMENT (FY90). Delays in disbursements resulted from unfamiliarity of the implementing unit with
procurementprocedures necessary for fairly large consultant contracts and lots of equipment. A recent supervision mission has addressed
this problem and disbursements are expected to improve soon.
INDUSTRIa  ENTER    RESTRucrNG (FY90). Delays in this project, the objective of which was to restructure large public
enterprises, are due primarily to the Government's decision to privatize rather than restructure these enterprises. Recent project
restructuring will broaden access to the credit conponent by privaBm fimns, resulting in speedier disbursement.
HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROIECT (FY89). Disbursement will increase in the near future as the project has been restructured extensively
a year ago, making funds available for recurreMnt costs of the MOH. Training of the senior staff of the Project Unit in the Ministry of
Health (GACOPI) in procurement and the preparation of standard bid documents has greatly facilitated the process. Currently, mnajor
quantities of pharmaccutical and medical supplies, as well as civil works, are being procured.
SALL AND MEDIUM SCALE ENM PRISES (FY90). Again, the delays in this case are connected to up front processing of on-lending
applications for small scale enterprises. About fourteen credit applications have been approved for about US$5 million equivalent, and
another 70 applications are in the pipeline. Disbursements will show a significam increase in the near term.

ANNEX I
TECHNICAL ANNEXES TO THE MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT FOR A
FINANCIAL SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A.        INTRODUCTION
1.        The credit will support training requirements in the financial sector, the provision of
necessary technical assistance to support the overall program of financial and enterprise sector
reform, and supporting studies required by the Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC). Although
the SERC focuses on a broad range of macroeconomic adjustment issues including the budget, the
development of a salary incentive fund for civil servants, expenditures in the social sectors, support
for a program of enterprise sector reform, and the integration of the national investment plan with
the national reconstruction plan -- it also has an important focus on strengthening the financial system
(the central bank, the commercial banks, and non-bank financial institutions). In addition, the
development of capacity in the financial sector, through appropriately designed training programs,
is considered a priority by the Government -- as enunciated in the attached letter from the Governor
of the central bank to the World Bank, of December 1, entitled "Letter Describing the Government's
Capacity Building Program in the Financial Sector" (Annex VIII).
2.        The focus of the training program to be financed by the Financial Sector Capacity
Building Credit is on the immediate training needs in the financial sector that arise from the
implementation of the SERC Program. The program consists of courses and seminars that address
the needs of staff of the central bank and commercial banks. Given the crucial role of Banco de
Mocambique for a functioning financial system in Mozambique, special emphasis is given to the
training of the staff of Banco de Mocambique under this Capacity Building Credit.
B.        PREVIOUS AND CURRENT SUPPORT IN THE AREA OF BANKING TRAINING
3.        The SWISS DEVELOMENT COOPERATION supported a program of bank training -
primarily staff in commercial banks -- in the early 1990s. This program emphasized the training of
trainers in teaching methodology. It started before the central bank and commercial bank functions
of Banco de Mogambique were separated and lasted from mid-1990 to the end of 1992. Under the
program the following staff were trained (i) eight methodological instructors (trainers of trainers);
(ii) 38 specialized trainers who were trained to give courses in the areas of banking operations, credit,
foreign exchange operations, and accounting; (iii) 36 training agents who are in charge of identifying
the training needs in the divisions in which they work; and (iv) 90 supervisors for monitoring training
and organizing on the job training. Currently, four methodological instructors and 28 specialized
trainers are employed by BCM and four methodological instructors by Banco de Mocambique.
4.        BANCO DE PORTUGAL. Staff of Banco de Mogambique have also attended courses at the
training institute of Banco de Portugal. These courses covered, among other topics, monetary policy,
macroeconomic policies, foreign exchange operations, bank supervision, and accounting systems in
a central bank. Only a small number of staff members -- twenty one individuals - participated in
these courses in 1993. Banco de Portugal has a protocol arrangement with Banco de Mocambique -
- as it has with other Lusophone countries in Africa - which provide a useful source of central
banking talent and training facilities which the Mozambicans can access. Although very little use has



- 17 -
been made of this protocol in the post-independence period, attempts are being made under the
auspices of this project to strengthen these ties -- with several successes to date. Recently, Banco de
Portugal sent a mission to Banco de Mogambique to review human resource needs of the bank, and
BP also recently agreed to provide a bank supervisor to work in BM for a six month period.
5.        THE WORLD BANK has financed banking sector training over recent years through the
Economic and Financial Management Technical Assistance Project   ' the Small and Medium
Enterprise Project. These projects include mainly computer training, aining of staff in the Legal
and Economic Studies Department, and training in project analysis. In 1994, the Economic and
Financial Technical Assistance Project will provide preparatorv courses in economics -- to upgrade
staff background in micro and macroeconomics.
6.        THE GOVERNMENT OF FRANCE. A request to support the financial sector in Mozambique,
by identifying training needs in this sector and by proposing measures, was also made to the
Coop6ration Francaise during a seminar of the Governors of the Central Banks in Portuguese-
speaking Africa (PALOP) in Maputo, in November 1992. In response to this request a study was
prepared by a French consultant in March 1993 proposing a comprehensive training program for
commercial bank staff which would be organized and provided by an institute for bank training
(Instituto De Formacao Bancaria de Mogambique, IFBM). The IFBM is to be jointly established by
Banco de Mosambique and interested Mozambican banks. It will be located in Matola on the
premises of the present training college of Banco de Mocambique. The statutes of the IFBM were
approved in November, 1993. In addition, as a longer term aim, the banks in Mozambique intend
to create a Banker's Association.
7.        The training program at the IFBM has been discussed with officials of Banco de
Mogambique and the Cooperation Francaise and will consist of eight main components: (i) a Bankers'
Development Program to familiarize a relatively large number of senior staff rapidly with the
functioning of a competitive banking system and the skills required; (ii) a Basic Certification Course
in Banking which would last three years and terminate with an officially recognized degree; (iii)
specialized and advanced professional training; (iv) basic skill training; (v) courses which prepare
banking staff for the Basic Certification Program that do not have not the background for passing the
entry exam required for the Certification Program; (vi) language courses; and (vii) training of
trainers. While financial support for launching the IFBM will be provided by the French Government
(and possibly the Swiss Government), additional funding will be required for initially financing
current expenses. Progressively, training will be fully paid for by banks whose staff members attend
courses at the IFBM. While staff of Banco de Mocambique will attend courses at the IFBM, more
specialized courses -- that address the specific needs of staff of a central bank -- will also be provided
under the proposed IDA supported program. These courses and seminars will be directly organized
by Banco de Mocambique.
8.        The main donors involved in the area of bank training -- namely the Governments of
Switzerland, France, Portugal and the International Development Association -- have been working
in close cooperation to prepare the existing program. Every effort has been made to ensure that
future work in this area is fully coordinated. Further support may also be forthcoming from other
donors -- such as the Government of the United Kingdom.

C.         LEVEL OF STAFF EDUCATION IN THE BANKING SYSTEM  IN
MOZAMBIQUE
9.         Education levels of staff in the banking system in Mozambique are extremely low -- a
heritage of low levels of education achieved during the pre-Independence period. Education levels
are shown in Table 1 and Chart 1 -- by bank, and for the system as a whole. These data clearly
indicate that the majority of staff in the banking system in Mozambique have only a primary
education or a small amount of secondary school education (38 percent and 37 percent respectively).
Only 3.6 percent of staff have any form of tertiary education -- and within the commercial banking
system (i.e. excluding Banco de Mogambique -- the central bank), this proportion is even lower at
less than 3 percent.
10.        It should be noted that these staffing numbers do not include staff involved in security,
cleaning, gardening, and chauffeuring duties - hence, the staff numbers recorded here reflect the
actual totals of staff involved in the day to day banking work of the institutions in which they are
employed.
11.        As the numbers are for the end of December 1992, they do not include staffing details
for the two new Portuguese banks which commenced operations in Maputo in March and September,
1993, respectively. However, as neither of these banks has recruited large numbers of staff, to date,
their inclusion is unlikely to alter the position indicated by this end-1992 data.

D.        DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
13.       CENTRAL BANK TRAINING COMPONENT. A major focus of the Capacity Building Credit
is strengthening Banco de Mogambique. Hence, a key supporting element of the proposed program
will be providing training support for crucial central bank functions. Staff at the central bank require
training in areas related to the conduct of monetary policy in a liberalized financial environment, bank
supervision, management and control of foreign exchange, accounting, legal issues, and human
resource management. An important component of this training will come from on-the-job training
from long and short term technical experts in the Research Department, the Banking Supervision
Department, the Exchange Control Departments, the Human Resource, and Accounting Departments.
Where there are areas of overlap between the training needs of the central bank staff and the Ministry
of Finance, the training needs of the latter will also be addressed under this credit.
14.      In addition to on-the-job training it will be necessary to provide training, through short
term courses, seminars, attachments, and courses held overseas. These courses and seminars will
provide a deeper understanding of macroeconomics, monetary policy, the economics of financial
markets, and quantitative methods -- that is essential for effectively implementing indirect macro-
monetary management in Mozambique. The seven main components of a training program for Banco
de Mocambique staff will include: (i) a basic level training program for entry level staff; (ii) an
intermediate level -- core level - training program for mid-level officers with university education
or extensive practical experience; (iii) a superior level -- senior management -- development program;
(iv) specialized internal seminars and courses; (v) overseas seminars; (vi) attachmnents to regional and
other central banks; and (vii) a limited amount of post graduate study. Where relevant, this training
will also be available to the staff of the Ministry of Finance. A detailed matrix of the training
involved in (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above -- are listed in Annex III. The phasing of the training
programs is given in Annex V.
15.       Basic Level Training. This sub-component provides basic training in key areas that are
required by Banco de Mogambique staff for day-to-day operations. This includes accounting,
intensive courses in banking and legal English, and some computer training. This program supports
existing entry level training courses already provided by the Human Resource Department of Banco
de Mocambique.
16.       Intermediate Level - Core Program. The courses of the core program provide the
basic conceptual framework that underlies monetary policy and it is an essential component of a
training program for mid-level officers at a central bank. The core program would consist of courses
of about two weeks in macroeconomics, monetary policy, the economics of money and finance, and
commercial banking. A good understanding of these subjects is crucial for effective management of
monetary policy. Mid-level officers of all departments, especially the departments that are involved
in monetary policy, should participate in the core program. A broad participation of officers would
be critical to foster the usage of a common terminology across departments, which in turn would
facilitate communication between departments and help to create a corporate culture within Banco de
Mocambique. Officers that participate in the core program would generally follow all courses of the
program. Initially, the core courses would be held by foreign lecturers with the participation of local
lecturers. A core program consists of four courses which last for about two weeks each. It is
anticipated that 25 staff would take this set of courses and that they would be repeated in 1994, 1995
and 1997 of the program period.



- 21 -
17.      Superior Level -- Senior Management Development. The principal objective of the
senior management development program is to support senior management in the implementation of
the financial sector reform program. Seminars, which last about one week, would be organized on
strategies of monetary policy, on the management and organization of a central bank, on the function
of bank supervision, and on the development of financial markets. Special emphasis will be given
in these seminars to issues such as the design and implementation of indirect monetary policy and the
organizational implications for Banco de Mogambique of monetary reform. During the period of the
program two sets of four seminars each are proposed. The seminars would be held by foreign
experts -- in the areas of monetary policy, central bank organization and management, development
of financial markets, and bank supervision. Between 10 and 15 staff from Banco de MoNambique
would participate in these courses which would be held every second year over the program period.
18.      Specialized Internal Courses. Apart from the core program, training in a range of
E ecialized subjects is required. Specialized training would be especially required for staff in the
Bank Supervision Department, Foreign Exchange Management Department, the Economic Studies
Department, and the Legal Department. Training would be provided in seminars on subjects such
as the Fundamentals of Bank Supervision, Topics in Monetary Policy, and Treasury Bills. Seminars
would be given by foreign experts and locally available staff -- and would last one to two weeks.
They would be practice-oriented and take full account of the specific needs in the departments
concerned. Staff members of the Foreign Exchange Management Department and in other related
departments would attend courses in foreign exchange operations and trade finance that are be
organized at the IFBM.
19.      Overseas Seminars. The provision of specialized training may not be economical in
cases where only a small number of staff members have to be trained and well-established training
programs are available abroad. Banco de Mocambique staff have already participated in courses
organized by the IMF Institute in Washington, as well as courses sponsored by EDI. Given the on-
going need to strengthen the capacity to collect and prepare statistics at Banco de Mocambique, the
attendance of several Banco de Mocambique staff members at courses on monetary statistics, balance-
of-payments statistics and financial programming at the IMF Institute will be supported. At a later
stage a staff member of the Bank Supervision Departnent could also attend advanced courses on bank
supervision offered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the World Bank. Advanced
seminars in Monetary Policy will also be offered for staff at the International Monetary Fund and at
the training center of the Swiss National Bank in Gerzensee, Switzerland.
20.       Attachments to Other Central Banks. Training courses will be complemented by short
attachments of Banco de Mocambique senior staff at other central banks. Such attachments will give
management an opportunity to review the experience and practices in other central banks. It is
specifically desirable for staff members of Banco de Mo9ambique to visit other central banks in the
Southern African region since these central banks are experiencing similar reforms of monetary
policy. It would also permit the establishment of closer working contacts with colleagues of central
banks in neighboring countries. Central banks to be visited could include those in Botswana, Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and South Africa. During these visits staff members would discuss these
countries' experiences in key areas such as foreign exchange operations including experience with
foreign exchange bureaus, bank supervision, organization and management of a central bank, and
human resource management in a central bank. On an even more selective basis, attachments will
be made available to other non-African central banks under a program being developed with EDI.



22 -
21.       Postgraduate Studies. The number of staff in the financial sector with postgraduate
qualifications is very limited. Currently, only a very small number of staff in banks, and lecturers
at the university, have a postgraduate degree in economics, banking and finance, or accounting. The
lack of personnel with a higher university degree is an important constraint on the availability of
qualified Mozambican consultancy staff -- and the capacity of the education system to provide more
advanced training. While the program's focus is on immediate training needs at the central bank and
the commercial banks -- it also addresses the lack of personnel with postgraduate training since this
is a crucial constraint to the provision of more advanced training in Mozambique over the medium
term. To increase the number of staff with an advanced university degree it is proposed that nine
fellowships be provided in the areas of accounting, banking and finance, and macroeconomics -- at
an MBA level. Selection of staff to attend these courses would be extremely rigorous, would be from
the brightest staff available in the central bank, and would generally require that staff chosen had
completed some of the above training courses at a very high level of achievement.
22.       Training of Trainers. A principal objective of the overall program is also to strengthen
training capacities at Banco de Mocambique. Two approaches are employed to reach this objective.
Although many of the courses taught under the above programs are initially taught by foreign experts
- local scholars will actively be involved in these programs to enable them to conduct these courses
themselves in the near future. In addition, funds will be allocated to finance postgraduate studies
abroad of highly qualified Mozambican students (see above). This strategy has been chosen to
improve the local teaching capacity in areas such as macroeconomics, banking and finance, and
accounting.
23.       COMMERCIAL BANK TRAIG COMPONENT. Training for staff of commercial banks will
be primarily provided in Mozambique by the IFBM whose creation is planned for the first half of
1994.  Given the urgent need for training in key areas such as trade finance and credit
appraisal/project analysis, the FS CB credit will specifically support training in these key areas.
Courses in these areas will be no substitute for a more structured course program to be offered by
the IFBM, but would address the very immediate training needs in commercial banks and the central
bank. At the same time, however, efforts will be made to ensure accreditation of short term courses
into the longer cycle IFBM courses -- to ensure complimentarily and proper coordination between
these two sets of training. Staff at commercial banks require rapid training in the following areas (i)
fundamentals of bank credit analysis; (ii) project appraisal techniques; (iii) fundamentals of
documentary credits; (iv) trade finance; and (v) management training. Courses in these subjects
would last one to two weeks and would be organized and provided at the IFBM. They would be
offered at several levels with a strong emphasis given to practice-oriented basic level courses. The
first two sessions of each course would be taught by a foreign expert with the active participation of
a local trainer. The foreign lecturer would establish a course outline jointly with the local counterpart
that corresponds to the needs of the financial sector in Mozambique. The local trainer would teach
courses alone starting with the third session. Preference would be given to local trainers who passed
the training program for trainers to be organized at the IFBM. At a later stage in the program the
foreign expert may return to review the training. The numbers of staff to be taught in these courses
is shown in Table 2.
24.       General Training.  The two state-owned conmnercial banks in Mozambique have
developed a series of in-house training programs which appear to address most areas of basic training
for their employees. These training classes emphasize basic banking theory, entry level accounting,
and on-the-job technical trainingg. Additionally, the banks have conducted, on a sporadic basis, a
series of seminars for more senior staff with outside consultants in more advanced and technical



- 23 -
subjects and have sent selected senior managers to short term foreign-based training programs. At
the initial stage of the Capacity Building Project, these internal training programs, particularly the
more basic level classes, will be continued in their present format, but in cooperation with the IFBM.
The commercial banks will be encouraged to transfer most of the operational aspects of these training
programs to the IFBM where this project will provide direct support for three years.
25.       Funds for this sub-component are not specifically linked to any one class or program
(although some emphasis will be placed on the structure and course content for the basic accounting
classes) -- but consist of a pool of funds available to cover a variety of expenses such as selected
external teachers and seminar leaders, acquisition and translation of correspondence course materials,
textbooks, and a number of personal computers. The only access the commercial banks will have
to this financial support is through the banking institute. They will have to conduct these courses at
the institute and subject the course content to review by the institute management and the coordination
committee.
26.       Fundamentals of Credit Analysis. Development of credit analysis skills among the loan
officers of the commercial banks is considered essential to the overall improvement in the loan
portfolios of the banks. This component is scheduled to consist of two 10 day seminar sessions for
20 students each in 1994, increasing to three seminars during 1995. By mid-1995 it is anticipated
that this subject will be one of the core courses taught be the banking institute and the number of
annual classes directly sponsored by the project will be limited to two per year thereafter.
27.       Project Appraisal Techniques.   Training in project appraisal techniques and
methodologies is fundamental to proper loan structuring and credit quality. This course will be a
follow-on program to the credit analysis class and successful completion of this first course would
be a prerequisite for participation in this program. Due to the complex nature of this subject, the
seminar program is scheduled for 15 days. One session is scheduled for 1994 and three sessions are
scheduled for 1995. Thereafter, it is anticipated that this subject will be covered in the banking
institute - and only one session is scheduled for direct sponsorship by this project during the final
three years.
28.       Fundamentals of Documentary Credits. This is an essential training session that will
emphasize the operational and administrative aspects of documentary credit activities. The course
will be presented to bankers who work in the trade finance departments and who deal with letters of
credit and other trade financing techniques. The class is scheduled for 10 days with only two sessions
scheduled annually (mainly because of the limited universe of bankers who are actually involved in
this type of activity).
29.       Trade Finance. This will be a more detailed course on the credit aspects of trade finance
and trade financing techniques (including an introduction to foreign exchange risks), and will be an
optional follow-on course to the documentary credits class. Lending officers, as well as operational
personnel dealing with letters of credit, would be the attendees. In 1994 one 10 day session is
scheduled, increasing to three in 1995 before scaling back in subsequent years as the banking institute
expands its curriculum and because the universe of bank employees directly involved in this credit
area and who have not attended this course is reduced.
30.       Management Training.  It is recognized that the lack of general and specific
management skills within the commercial banks is the single greatest impediment to their ability to
improve their efficiency, profitability, product development, and customer relationships. There is



- 24 -
a strong need to improve management techniques within the banks in all areas -- from internal
organization and administration to bank strategies and customer services. An overall change in
attitudes regarding business philosophy, operating style, and efficiency needs to be created. This
component includes two separate 10 day seminars, divided into separate classes for mid-level
managers and senior managers/directors. Course curriculum will be specifically designed for the
individual seminars based on the make up of the attendees. For mid-level managers, one session is
scheduled for 1994, and two sessions in 1995; for senior managers one session is scheduled annually.
31.        Cost Recovery. While initially participating banks are only charged a minimal amount
to cover the costs of the courses, by the end of the project period, the participants would bear the full
cost of the training program. It is therefore imperative that the training program remain relevant to
the training needs of the commercial banks. With this in mind, under the auspices of the credit, a
training needs assessment questionnaire has been developed, which will be refined and filled out on
an annual (or semi-annual basis), to assess the evolving training needs of the commercial banks -- and
adjust courses accordingly, to ensure their relevance.

32.        STRENGTHENING LEGAL FINANCIAL CAPATI. The Government of Mozambique has
enacted a package of laws regulating the financial sector and providing for the separation of the
commercial and central banking functions of Banco de Mogambique. The main laws are: (a) the
Financial Institutions Law; (b) the Central Banking Law; and (c) the Statutes of Banco Comercial de
Mocambique. Other regulations have been recently issued -- such as the foreign exchange decrees -
- and there is further draft legislation under consideration. However, there are key aspects which
have not been included in the above-mentioned laws or which need further revision in order to build
a modem and efficient financial legal framework. Furthermore, the laws in force in Mozambique
are scarcely known, not only by the public at large, but also by the legal staff responsible for their
application and enforcement.
33.        The legal profession and institutions in Mozambique are weak and lack the technical skills
to undertake the massive task of overhauling the legal system under the current period of economic



- 25 -
and political reform. There are approximately 100 fully qualified lawyers in the country which are
expected to provide, simultaneously, government advisory services, legal assistance to the emerging
private sector, run the judiciary, and teach law to new generations of students. The legal staff
working for the financial and banking institutions are scarce and particularly overburdened with the
conflicting responsibilities of drafting and implementing the financial legislation and developing
banking practices and contract documentation. Most Mozambican lawyers lack formal training in
banking and financial matters, as the curriculum of the Law School of Eduardo Mondlane University
does not include banking law.
34.       Aware of the magnitude of the structural weaknesses affecting the legal sector the
Government requested Bank assistance under the Capacity Building: Public Sector and Legal
Institutions Project (Cr. 2437-MOZ) which aims at providing basic local training for judges and legal
staff. With regard to financial institutions, the ongoing Economic and Financial Management
Technical Assistance Project (Cr.2066-MOZ) includes, a modest legal assistance component aimed
at strengthening the Legal Department of Banco de Mocambique. Advanced legal training,
professional internships and a limited number of legal publications were financed. As funds near
exhaustion, the authorities of Banco de Mogambique have expressed their satisfaction with the overall
improvement of the Legal Department and requested that further capacity building activities be
identified for financing under the proposed FS CB Project. The Ministry of Finance shares this
concern, and wishes to extend to its staff, the benefits which will derive from a Project component
designed to strengthen legal financial capabilities.
35.       The Strengthening of Legal Financial Capabilities Component of the proposed FS CB
Project will assist the Government to: (a) create a group of well-trained lawyers (within the central
bank and the Ministry of Finance); (b) review the existing financial legal and regulatory framework
and make amendments where required; (c) assist with institutional development within the legal
financial environment; and (d) facilitate the dissemination of laws and regulations related to the
financial sector.
36.       Training Component. This component would seek to improve the quality and efficiency
of legal and banking staff through the provision of short-term practical training in Mozambique,
through institutional arrangements with international academic and professional institutions (for
example, through ILI, IDLI, Harvard International Studies Institute, Institute of Graduate Studies,
Geneva, and others); practical internships abroad, combined with specialized training seminars, as
a follow-up of ongoing training under existing IDA credits; a limited amount of long-term graduate
training in banking and financial law would be financed, in order to fill the technical gap and to
attract new graduates to join Banco de Mocambique's Legal Department; formal training in banking
law would be carried out at the Law School, starting with specialized graduate seminars and moving
gradually towards the inclusion of Banking Law in the present curriculum. Where appropriate, this
training would also be available to the staff of the Ministry of Finance.
37.       Review of Financial Legal and Regulatory Framework.  This Component would
support the ongoing financial legal reform program through the provision of specialized legal advisory
services. Sophisticated financial legal services presently not available in Mozambique would be
employed. Special attention would be paid, through the selection stages, to qualifications such as:
civil law proficiency, exposure to common law, fluency in Portuguese, practical professional
experience in developing countries and availability to provide on-the-job training to Mozambican
lawyers while performing their consultancy. The foreign lawyers would work closely with local
counterparts to maximize the results of the assignment. It is envisaged that a contract on a retainer



- 26 -
basis could be negotiated with a reputable international law-firm or legal institution to provide
services, as and when required, to avoid contracting delays and obtain beneficial contractual
conditions. Besides this type of assistance, Barnco de Mocambique would have access to Credit funds
to contract individual legal experts to assist the Legal Department in dealing with new and complex
legal issues.
38.       Institutional Development. This component would support institutional development
through the acquisition of basic office equiprrent, including legal software, photocopier and basic
materials to support the legal department of Banco de Mocambique and the Legal Studies
Departments of the Ministry of Finance. It would also support the acquisition, printing and
translation of legal materials related to the training programs mentioned above. Lastly, it would
support the establishment and operation of the Cartorio Notarial at Banco de Mocambique, through
the employment of local professionals and assistants, the acquisition of essential materials and
equipment and training of the staff assigned to the Cartorio.
39.       Dissemination of the Law. This fourth component would facilitate the dissemination of
the law through the acquisition of legal materials, publication of laws and financial regulations, design
of standard legal documentation and contracts; the publication of a Tax Legal Journal (under the
Ministry of Finance), including the strengthening of the Ministry of Finance's National Directorate
of Taxation to undertake this task; and possibly supporting the official gazette (Boletim da Republica)
- although this will need to be discussed and further analyzed throughout the implementation of the
project.
40.       INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. Technical assistance support for the overall SERC
program will generally be of a short term nature (only the management support team for BCM is long
term) and will have an important training component so that local staff can develop skills under the
guidance of an expert in the relevant field. As much as possible the following elements of the
program will be integrated into the training program described above - so as to yield long term
benefits in terms of capacity building in the financial sector -- so that local skills are developed, and
reliance on external assistance in key areas can be reduced over time.  Other innovative
arrangements, such as "in-out" and/or regular short term consultancy arrangements, as well as the
enhancement of twinning arrangements (notably with Banco de Portugal), will also be developed to
ensure that this element of the program is fully in line with IDA's, African regional policy with
respect to technical assistance. Terms of Reference, for all the technical assistance discussed herein,
are provided as Annex IV.
41.       Banking Supervision Swat Team. As part of the SERC program, bank supervisory
skills will be developed within Banco de Mocambique. This will be supported by the recruitment of
a swat team of experienced bank supervisors, for a six month period, who will train a cadre of local
Mozambican staff while simultaneously undertaking a loan portfolio review of the commercial banks.
42.       Banking Supervision Advisor. Banco de Mocambique has requested the assistance of
an experienced bank supervisor to work in the new!y created department of bank supervision to assist
in its establishment, drafting of relevant regulations, and assisting in developing a system of off-site
reporting for the commercial banks. Banco de Mogamnbique has approached Banco de Portugal
concerning assistance with staff in this area and negotiations were successfully concluded during
1993. Terns of reference for this position are included as an annex to this Aide Memoire. Under
an agreed arrangement with the central bank of Portugal, the selected individual will come initially
for six months, after which he will return to Banco de Portugal. Further support will be assessed



- 27 -
thereafter -- on the understanding that this individual could be made available, for additional short
term assignments, as required.
43.       Developing a Strategic Plan for Banco Comercial de Moqambique. As part of the
SERC program, the Govermnent is expected to develop a Strategic Plan for Banco Comercial de
Mocambique - the largest (Government owned), commercial bank - by the time of tranche release.
Representing between 60 to 70 percent of the banking system, this bank represents the majority of
Mozambique's banking system, but is in particularly poor financial health. Reviewing BCM's options
for the future is a crucial step in addressing the problems of the entire commercial banking system.
This represents less than six months work, which will need to commence immediately, by an
experienced commercial banker working in close cooperation with the existing management of the
bank.
44.       Management Support Team for Banco Comerdal de Mofambique. Once the Strategic
Plan has been developed for BCM, it will be necessary to support the implementation of the agreed
plan -- probably by the recruitment of a management support team for the bank. The Strategic Plan
will contain clear, monitorable, time-bound benchmarks, which the management of the bank will be
expected to meet. Both the central bank and the board of BCM have requested assistance from IDA
in helping management implement this plan and address the difficult problems faced by this
institution. Any required management assistance for BCM will be clearly defined in the Strategic
Plan.
45.       This sub-component constitutes the only long term technical assistance in the project. It
also represents a large component of the total project (20 percent). However, given the importance
of BCM to the entire banking system (around 70 percent of total banking system assets), and to the
economy, it is vitally important that its problems are addressed in a decisive manner. Longer term
external support has been requested, and is considered the only way in which the medium term
objectives of downsizing and preparation for privatization can be achieved satisfactorily. Important
initial steps have already been taken to address the problems of BCM - particularly with respect to
stemming on-going losses in the bank. Providing external management support for the bank is not
designed to confer an unfair advantage on BCM, but rather to deal decisively with the problems in
the bank, stem further losses, and steer the institution towards profitable operations. It is also not
designed to prop up an ailing Government institution, but rather to downsize the institution as rapidly
as possible and prepare it for privatization over the medium term.
46.      Insurance, Pension and Provident Fund Expert. Under the SERC program, it is
intended that the insurance legislation will be extensively reviewed, and a proper legal framework
established for the development of a financially strong and competitive insurance sector. The legal
staff of Banco de Mocambique will be provided with support to undertake this work - under the
provisions of the legal component of this project. However, it will also require the input of an
experienced individual with a good knowledge of the workings of insurance activities in settings
similar to Mocambique. This individual would therefore work with the lawyers, and the staffs of the
Ministry of Finance and Banco de Mocambique in developing an appropriate legislative framework
for insurance, pension and provident fund activities. Terms of reference for this piece of short term
(six months) work are attached.
47.       Money and Capital Market Expert. Expert support for developing an appropriate legal
framework for money and capital market activities is also a requirement of the SERC program.
Again, legal support will be provided to the legal department of Banco de Moqambique, but this work



- 28 -
will also require the input of an experienced individual with a sound knowledge of the development
of money and capital markets in developing countries. Terms of reference are attached.
48.       Payment Systems Advisor. Banco de Mocambique has requested support from the
IMF/IDA for the development of a better operating payment and clearing systems in the central bank
and between the commercial banks. Long lags in clearing items in transit are clearly a major
problem for the banking system which will need to be addressed in the near term.
49.       Accounting and Auditing Technical Assistance. Accounting and auditing issues have
been of particular concern to IDA -- in respect to its relationship with Mo9ambique. Strengthening
accounting and auditing capabilities is a very important part of the training component of this
proposed credit. There is also a strong emphasis on accounting and auditing in the SERC program -
- tranche release conditions require the provision of audited financial statements from the three state
banks (Banco de Mocambique, Banco Comercial de Mocambique, and Banco Popular de
Desenvolvimento). The World Bank's relationship with Mocambique also requires the provision of
audited project accounts. Previous World Bank project accounts have been qualified by the auditors.
This led to problems with the release of the second tranche of the Fourth Rehabilitation Credit. To
help address this issue, the Financial Sector Capacity Building Credit will provide support for the
development of accounting and auditing capacities in the central bank. It will also support the
auditing of the central bank's accounts -- for the first time - for 1993.
50.       Human Resource Development. The development and implementation of appropriate
training programs for the staff of the banks requires a strong emphasis by the departments dealing
with human resource issues in the two commercial banks (Banco Comercial de Mocambique and
Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento). To ensure the development of appropriate training programs
into the future, these departments should undertake full manpower audits of their staff, the
development of job descriptions, and the ultimate drafting of a manpower development plan. Some
short term assistance in these areas is therefore required if appropriate training programs are to be
developed to meet the needs of the fast evolving banking sector. Similar assistance in the area of
human resource development has been particularly beneficial in some of the Government Ministries.
This work, in the Government owned banking institutions, would be undertaken jointly with a local
counterpart.
51.       Table 3 provides a summary of the technical assistance being provided under this sub-
component of the project. This table breaks the technical assistance down by duration (long term and
short term) -- as well as by potential outcome. As indicated in the table, the majority of the TA is
for Institutional Development (US$2,855,000 or 71 percent of the component); followed by Project
Preparation and Implementation Support (US$1,000,000 or 25 percent of the component); and Policy
Support (US$160,000 or 4 percent of the component).
52.       Other Technical Assistance. Additional technical assistance may be required to support
elements of the overall financial sector reform program which will only be identified during the
implementation of the project. For example, Banco de Mocambique may wish to engage an expert
to assist in developing the Treasury Bill market -- advising on the practicalities of establishing such
a market. In time, it may also be necessary to provide statistical assistance -- to help develop further
the statistical data base for monetary policy decision making. Other, as yet unforeseen needs, are
certainly likely to arise. Therefore, to permit some flexibility in meeting the needs of policy makers
in Mocambique, a small contingency has been built into the program to meet short term technical
assistance needs as they arise.



- 29 -
53.             STUDIES AND PROJECT SUPPORT. Under the Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC),
a series of studies have been identified as forming an important part of the program. Some of these
studies will be undertaken 'in-house' and will not require external funding. Others will require
partial external assistance -- while yet others will be undertaken completely with external resources.
Some of the studies will require survey work (particularly studies related to informal sector finance,
credit unions, housing finance, and so on) -- and these will consequently require more time and
additional resources to undertake.

54.             The studies identified under SERC include:
(a)        A review of interest rate developments;



- 30 -
(b)    Review of ways to change the structure of deposits in the banking system;
(c)    Study of deposit mobilization;
(d)    Review of the National Social Security Scheme;
(e)    Evaluation of the impact of existing schemes to provide more long term credit - and the
possible introduction of other alternative mechanisms;
(f)    Study on the issuance of Treasury Bills;
(g)    Study of ways in which banking competition can be enhanced;
(h)    The viability of credit unions in Mogambique;
(i)    Studies of housing finance mechanisms;
(j)    Studies on the development of leasing activities;
(k)    Agricultural credit;
(1)    Study of inter-enterprise debt.
55.      It will also be necessary to review the financial position of some of the large enterprises
which are borrowing from the banking system and which are distressed. Some of these have been
commenced under other auspices, but additional enterprise review - which is an important component
of the SERC program -- will be required during the course of this operation. The credit will need
to be responsive to meet the need for any additional study and review which becomes evident during
the subsequent preparation, and the implementation, of the overall financial and enterprise reform
program.
56.       Last, the credit also contains a very small component of project support, consisting of
support to the coordinating departments within the central bank -- through the possible provision of
a small amount of computing equipment; funding for project auditing; and other sundry expenses.
E.        BENEFICIARY ASSESSMENT/SYSTEMATIC CLIENT CONSULTATION
57.       The project will also make serious efforts to listen to the beneficiaries of the credit and
to adjust project components based upon feed back received. The proposed Financial Sector Capacity
Building Credit has basically two types of beneficiaries. The first group is the banks and their staff -
- while the second includes the clients of the banks.
58.       Monitoring and consultation of banks and bank staff has already commenced during the
pre-appraisal and appraisal missions of the credit. Discussions have taken place with bank
management, personnel divisions, and with staff, on the types of training which are required in the
banks. A questionnaire of bank training needs has been provided to the banks - and responses have
been reviewed as an input into project preparation. This questionnaire will now need to be revised
and regularly filled in by the personnel departments of the various banks. Course evaluations will
also form an important input into adjusting training programs. These will form an integral



- 31 -
component of the training program. However, the ultimate success of the training programs will be
shown by the enthusiasm of the banks, and their willingness to send their staff to training courses
provided by the IFBM. Should there be any flagging of support for training provided by the IFBM,
it will become important to undertake a re-evaluation of the training programs provided.
Questionnaire responses and course evaluations will provide an important input into the annual
evaluation of the project.
59.       More difficult will be the assessment of banking clientele for the benefits which have
accrued as a result of this project. For example, other forces will impact upon the quality of banking
services and the efficiency with which they are provided -- most importantly, the entry of new banks,
and a concomitant increase in banking sector competition. Nonetheless, in an effort to monitor the
impact of the program upon this group of clients, a base line survey will be established on the level
and quality of banking services, at the beginning of the project period. Monitorable indicators will
be established, as will "performance standards", to assist in making this review process more
systematic. These indicators could include measures such as: the number of days to open a letter
of credit; amount of time required to deposit funds; time required to have a loan approved; and so
on. These base line indicators will be determined by the consultants working on the Strategic Plans
in the two state owned commercial banks. In addition, on-going discussions will continue, with
groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, to obtain a more subjective feel for developments in the
quality of banking services provided. Review of this client group would be incorporated into the
mid-term review of the project.
F.        PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
60.       ADmINiSTRATION.  Responsibility for project coordination will fall to Banco de
Mogambique.  Coordinating departments, and sub-component coordinators, within Banco de
Mocambique have been selected for each of the five sub-components -- and an overall Project
Coordinator has been selected from the Human Resources Department of the bank. Coordination
with the IFBM (Banker's Institute) will be provided by a commercial banking coordinating committee
which will oversee the operations of the Institute. The central bank representative on the IFBM
coordinating committee is also the coordinator for the commercial bank training sub-component of
the project -- thereby ensuring full coordination between the project and the work of the IFBM.
61.       The five year project will be subject to annual reviews which will commence no later than
twelve months after the project becomes effective. In addition, the project will have a mid-term
review (no later than by the end of the second year of the project), during which performance will
be assessed, changing circumstances taken into account, and the project modified and/or redesigned
as necessary -- to take into account evolving training requirements. A Schedule of Performance
Indicators and an Implementation Schedule are attached to this MOP as Annex VI. During the annual
and mid-term review process, the project will be assessed against these agreed performance and
implementation schedules. A supervision schedule/plan is attached to this MOP as Annex VII.
62.       PROCUREMENT. Consultants and consulting firms will be recruited both internationally
and nationally (where appropriate) on the basis of competitive selection, except for two consultancies:
the consultancy to develop the Strategic Plan for BCM, where a well qualified individual has already
been selected on the basis of his commercial banking background, his knowledge of BCM, and his
knowledge of the Mozambique working environment (approximately US$85,000), and; the legal
training consultancy, where a contract has been negotiated with a Brazilian legal firm, to provide the
first year of legal training and legal support to the central bank (US$116,000). This firm was



- 32 -
selected on the basis of its high professional standing and its excellent understanding of Portuguese
and Portuguese legal systems. Consultant selection, qualifications, experience, and terms of
employment will be subject to standard IDA review procedures as set out in World Bank Guidelines.
All terms of reference, short-lists, selections, and consultant contracts, for contracts greater than
US$40,000 for firms, and US$20,000 for individuals, will be subject to prior IDA review. All other
consultancy contracts will be subject to post review. Initial work (for the first year of the program)
in the area of central bank training -- for the core course and the senior management course -- could
be organized by the Institute of Graduate Studies based in Geneva. This institute has been selected
on the basis of the wishes of the Mozambicans, the relatively small size of the contract (between
US$100,000 and US$150,000 in the first year), and previous experience in teaching similar courses
in neighboring African countries. Selection of the bank supervision swat team is currently on-going,
based upon competitive selection procedures.
63.       Funding is also available for training of central bank staff through overseas postgraduate
courses, seminars, and so on, which will not involve the hiring of consultants. This will take place
at local, regional and international institutions. This training will all be undertaken by central bank
staff and will be based upon six monthly training programs, drawn up by Banco de Mocambique, and
approved by IDA. The six month training programs will provide a schedule of training over the
ensuing six months covering, inter alia, the names and qualifications of the individuals to be trained,
over which period the training will take place, estimated cost of training, what courses will be
undertaken, which institutions will be providing the training, and the usefulness and appropriateness
of the training within the context of the capacity building operation. This schedule will be cleared
by IDA at six monthly intervals and expenses will be reimbursed against actual expenditures made.
64.       Equipment and other goods are expected to cost, in the aggregate, about US$420,000.
As this is essentially a training/technical assistance project, with only minor equipment purchases of
text books, a small number of personal computers, and other sundry equipment to facilitate training,
the project will not require any international competitive bidding. The purchase of this equipment
will be in small packages and will be spread over several years during project implementation --
individual contracts will be below US$100,000. A total of US$200,000 worth of computers and
books will be financed to support the various training programs in the central bank. These purchases
will be made through the Inter-Agency Procurement Service Office (IAPSO)', International
Shopping, or direct contracting. Due to the technical nature, and the language requirements, of some
of the legal and economic text books, a small amount of direct contracting (US$25,000) from
Portuguese publishers will be provided for under the credit. The remaining US$220,000 of goods
is for the IFBM and will be purchased under LCB. The method of procurement is shown in Schedule
B. Contracts estimated to cost US$100,00 or more would be subject to IDA's prior review.
Contracts below the above threshold will be subject to IDA post review on a selective basis.
Documentation on procurement, not subject to IDA prior review, will be forwarded to IDA for all
contracts, as set out in the Guidelines, prior to disbursement.
65.       Procurement and disbursement performance in Mozambique is generally poor. Delays
are mainly related to weak procurement capacity in the implementing agencies, slow contract
IAUSO has responsibility for procurement support to agencies and international aid organizations for which
it has negotiated special prices. As a result of the volume of its purchases, IAPSO negotiated prices are economic
compared to the price obtained by direct solicitation from local agents by Bank borrowers. It has been agreed,
between the World Bank and WSO, that Bank borrowers are permitted to use IAPSO's services for the
procurement of items which would otherwise have been procured through international shopping.



- 33 -
clearance by the Ministry of Finance, inadequate counterpart funding, and the lack of adequate
utilization of the Special Account Procedures. Actions to improve procurement and disbursements
include: (a) utilizing personnel currently available within the Government of Mozambique who are
familiar with World Bank procurement rules and procedures; (b) the delegation of contract approval,
for the FS CB credit, to the Governor of the central bank; and (c) assurances that local counterpart
funding will be made available to meet the project objectives throughout the life of the project.
Delegating some supervisory authority to the Resident Mission staff in Maputo will also help to
streamline procedures and facilitate faster procurement and disbursement.
66.       Some activities have already commenced and are being funded under the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF). These activities include, some legal training and the contracting of a legal
firm on a retainer basis to assist the legal staff of the central bank and the Ministry of Finance in the
re-drafting of certain financial sector legislation. Requests have also been made for funding of some
bank supervision work (the bank supervisor from Banco de Portugal and the bank supervision swat
team), and the commencement of work on the strategic plan for Banco Comercial de Moacambique.
Further requests for funding from the PPF are anticipated prior to the project becoming effective.
Should it be necessary, and in the interests of ensuring that the project proceeds smoothly as planned,
a second PPF could be established.
67.       DISBURSEmENTS. Disbursements will be made against standard Bank documentation.
The proceeds of the Credit will be disbursed against 100 percent of total expenditures for consultant
services, training, equipment, materials and supplies. In order to ensure the timely provision of funds
available to finance the cost of services and goods to be procured under the project, Banco de
Mogambique will open a Special Account in a banking institution acceptable to IDA in the amount
of US$500,000. Funds in the Special Account will be available to finance only eligible expenditures
under the project. The Special Account would be replenished regularly on the basis of documentary
evidence as to payments made from the account for goods and services required for the proposed
project. Expenditures for less than US$25,000 would be based on statements of expenditure. These
arrangements were confirmed at Negotiations. The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in
Schedule B. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1999. The closing date is
set for June 30, 2000.
68.       ADVANCE CONTRACTING AND RETROACTIVE F1NANCING. Initial costs, for preparation
of the capacity building program have been funded out of a PPF advance, approved in 1993. These
costs will be reimbursed out of the proceeds of the proposed Credit. Retroactive financing is not
included under this Credit.
69.       ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING. Auditing will be required, on a yearly basis,
for expenditures related to the Project with particular attention to expenditures reimbursed against
statements of expenditures. Audits would be performed by qualified auditors acceptable to IDA and
would be sent to IDA within nine months of the end of each financial year. Furthermore, Banco de
Mogambique will submit quarterly reports on project implementation progress, and a final evaluation
report on implementation experience and project results, within six months of the Credit closing.
These arrangements were confinned at Negotiations. Auditors for the project were selected prior to
Board presentation.
70.      IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL. An Implementation Manual is under preparation and an
outline was discussed with the Mozambicans at negotiations. The manual will be finalized by the
time of effectiveness.

71.       ACTIONS AGREED. By Negodatim the following conditions were met: (a) request for
funding, under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), to develop a Strategic Plan for BCM; (b)
selection of the firm which will provide the swat team for banking supervision; (c) approval of the
contract with the legal firm which is providing support to the Legal Department of the central bank;
(d) identification of the local counterpart trainers under the proposed program; (e) provision of a
letter describing the Government's Capacity Building Program within the financial sector to IDA.
Co.dltm of Bord  By Board presentation, the following two conditions had been met: (a) BM has
prepared a satisfactory action plan to (i) reverse the dormant status of special accounts by submitting
replenishment requests, and (ii) refund all outstanding amounts on closed credits, (b) selected an
auditor for the project. Daed coveam (a) the submission to IDA of a draft Strategic Plan for Banco
Comercial de Mogambique, by October 1, 1994; (b) commencement of the implementation of BCM's
Strategic Plan, by January 1, 1995; and (c) if required by the Strategic Plan, the selection and
employment of management consultants to assist BCM management implement an agreed program
as identified by the Strategic Plan, by July 1, 1995.

ANNEX IV
TERMS OF REFERENCE
ADVISOR - DEPARTMENT OF BANK SUPERVISION
BANK OF MOZAMBIQUE
INTRODUCTION
1.1             The Banco de Moqambique, Mozambique's central bank, estahlished the
Department of Bank Supervision in June of 1992 in order to carry out the supervisor) functions
elaborated in Lei no. 1/92 (Lei Organica). Until January of 1992, the nation's largest conmlercial
bank (now Banco Comercial de Mo,ambique) was part of the central bank, which would have made
unbiased surveillance of the institution difficult, if not impossible. With the separation of the Banco
de Mocambique from the Banco Comercial de Mocambique and the establishment within the central
bank of a Department of Bank Supervision, a supervisory function capable of promoting an efficient
banking system has become a real possibility.
1.2             The Director of Bank Supervision, who reports to one of the five General
Managers of the central bank, currently has a staff of one economist to aid in the development of the
function. Not only is there a lack of manpower within the division, there is a complete lack of
supervisory experience. As a result, the rapid development of relevant regulatory policies and
procedures designed to secure a safe and sound banking system is not possible. Furthermore, an
analysis of the loan portfolios of the three currently existing commercial banks (a fourth bank began
operation mid-March 1993), a task essential to determining their capital adequacy, cannot be
performed without experienced examiners and appropriate examination tools.
SCOPE OF WORK TO BE UNDERTAKEN
1.3             In order to develop the supervisory function, it has become important to obtain
the assistance of a long term advisor to the Department of Supervision, along with a short term swat
team of examiners from a foreign supervisory agency. This long term advisor will stay for a period
not less than one year and assist the Banco de Mocambique to: (a) develop banking regulations, (b)
revise the bank licensing application, (c) format off-site reporting forms and determine the most
appropriate off-site surveillance system, (d) elaborate a Report of Examination format, examiner
worksheets and a manual to be used by examiners, (e) design appropriate examiner training classes
and materials, and (f) promote the structuring and expansion of the Department of Bank Supervision,
as well as facilitate the work carried out by the swat team.
1.4             Initially, the long term advisor should review existing legislation, statutes and
regulations pertaining to the central bank and the financial institutions it supervises. The advisor
should also review draft regulations and guidelines on capital adequacy, asset classification and
provisioning, asset concentration, as well as revisions to the bank licensing application. By so doing,
the long term advisor will become acquainted with the work that has been initiated by the central
bank on regulations crucial to surveillance and will be able to contribute to the enhancement of these
draft regulations. Also, the advisor should aid in the development of policies and procedures as they
pertain to on-site surveillance, with special attention given to areas which, unlike asset quality and
capital adequacy, have received less focus, such as earnings, liquidity, bank management and internal
control procedures.



- 47 -
1.5              The advisor should work closely with the General Manager in charge of
supervision, as well as the Director of the Department of Supervision on the structuring of the
division and the contracting of new staff. Also, the advisor should be available to the swat team of
examiners, helping them with any difficulties they might encounter within the central bank or the
commercial banks.
1.6              The long term advisor should help the Department of Bank Supervision with the
development of the draft off-site reporting forms intended to indicate the financial condition and
performance of each bank. These forms, to be further designed and subsequently sent out to the field
for testing, should include monthly data on assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items, end-of-
quarter data on earnings, a quarterly maturity/repricing profile of assets and liabilities, as well as
information on asset concentrations and the quality of risk assets. The advisor should aid in the
development of ratios and growth rates to be estimated on the basis of the data requested. These
ratios and growth rates would serve as a tool for the Department of Bank Supervision to better
understand each bank's true financial condition and as a supplement to insights gained from on-site
bank examinations. The advisor should consider and make suggestions on the appropriate penalties
to be put into effect, in cases where the off-site reports are late or incomplete.
1.7              The set of off-site reporting forms should be accompanied by instructions
developed by the long-term advisor which includes clear definitions of all data items requested, plus
an explanation of the rationale for each ratio and growth rate requested. In this way, the banks will
understand better how to monitor themselves and will be encouraged to institute their own internal
program of surveillance.
1.8              Once the user requirements have been defined, appropriate software must be
selected to compile and analyze the data. The advisor should be prepared to communicate these
requirements to technical advisors on computer software, so that the resulting off-site surveillance
database will represent the system as it has been designed and intended.
1.9              The advisor should play a major role in the design of the Report of Examination
reporting forms and the writing of an examiner instruction manual for completing the Report of
Examination, as well as the formatting of on-site examination worksheets to be used by examiners.
These should be developed so as to indicate the overall condition of the commercial banks under
inspection and should follow internationally accepted norms.
1.10             The advisor should provide input into the development of training materials and
a set of classes for examiners (i.e., courses in portfolio review and bank examination techniques at
different levels of expertise). Also, working with the swat team of external examiners, who will
provide on-the-job training to the examination staff of the Department of Bank Supervision, the
advisor should design an on-the-job training program (accompanied by learning materials) for junior
examiners working in the field (on-site examinations of commercial banks) which complements and
enhances the formal classroom training given.
TIMING OF THE WORK
1.11             You arrive in Maputo and stay for a period of one year (52 weeks). Your time
should be allocated in the following manner:



- 48 -
(a)    During the initial two-week period within the Banco de Mocambique you should review
existing legislation, draft regulations, and proposed draft off-site reporting forms, as well
as become acquainted with the supervisory staff.
(b)    The following 10 weeks should be devoted to providing suggestions that would enhance
the draft regulations and the draft off-site reporting forms. You will be expected to write
instructions to accompany the off-site reporting forms. Also, suggestions should be made
on possible further revisions to the bank licensing application and procedures for
investigating and evaluating completed applications. During this period you should work
with the Director on structuring the department, contracting additional staff, and
developing an orientation program for incoming junior examiners.
(c)    At the beginning of the following 12 week period, you should help the General Manager
and the Director by meeting with the appropriate parties within the conmmercial banks to
discuss the contents and focus of the off-site reporting forms that the banks will receive
periodically. These meetings should be arranged to apprise the banks' management of
the significance of these forms for purposes of internal surveillance and to ask for their
full cooperation. Following these contacts, the off-site reporting forms should be sent
to the banks for field testing. Supervisory staff should be made available to handle
questions from the banks about the forms and you should be available to guide the staff
in this process. Work should commence on the selection of appropriate software to be
used to compile and analyze the data gathered off-site and you should do everything to
facilitate this process by working with the technical advisors assigned to advise on
computer software.
(d)    The following 12 weeks should be a period in which you devote time to the design of the
Report of Examination reporting forms and the on-site examination work sheets, as well
as to writing an examiner instruction manual. Work should also be initiated on the
development of training materials for novice examiners and on classes designed to teach
proper examinations techniques. The setting up of a formal teaching program should be
implemented by you along with the design of an on-the-job traiiing program (with
learning materials) for junior examiners working on an actual examination.
(e)    The final 12 weeks will be a time for you to press forward on all the projects that you
facilitated and/or initiated, so that you will leave the Department of Bank Supervision
with appropriate regulations and guidelines in place, with off-site reporting forms which
have been tested and approved, with a bank licensing application and evaluation
procedure which is judged to be an effective screen, with a Report of Examnination and
Examination Manual which are effective supervisory tools, and with a bank supervisor
training program which meets the needs of the department.

BANK EXAMINATION TEAM
ON-THE-JOB TRAINING OF BANK OF MOZAMBIQUE SUPERVISORS AND
COMMERCIAL BANK CREDIT REVIEW
INTRODUCTION
2.1              Financial sector reform in Mozambique is proceeding at a rapid pace. New
banking legislation has been enacted and the Government is keen to develop new banking competition
within the sector which, since independence, has been dominated by a single banking institution.
During 1991, the Government embarked upon a review of the financial sector in conjunction with
the World Bank and A.S.D.I. (SIDA) which enunciated a plan of continuing reform for the sector.
The World Bank will be supporting financial sector reform efforts in Mozamnbique, through a
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit during 1993.
2.2              An important component of financial sector reform will be the financial
restructuring of the two state owned commercial banking institutions -- Banco Comercial de
Mocambique and Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento. The determination of the capital required in
these two institutions will be dependent upon on-going accounting work within these banks as well
a loan portfolio review undertaken by the bank supervision department of Banco de Mocambique.
2.3             Prior to 1992, Banco de MoQambique (Mozamnbique's central bank) did not have
a banking supervision department. Had it existed before 1992, its ability to function effectively
would have been hampered by the fact that Mozambique's largest conmmercial bank (now Banco
Comercial de Mozambique) was, at that stage, part of the central bank. Conflict of interest issues
would inevitably have arisen, as the central bank would have effectively been supervising itself.
However, with the separation of Banco de Mogambique from Banco Comercial de Mocambique --
and the establishment within the central bank of a Department of Bank Supervision -- a properly
functioning bank supervisory capacity has become a real possibility.
2.4             The functions and objectives of the central bank were defined by law (Lei No.
1/92) in January 1992, which states that all financial institutions (except insurance companies) are
subject to central bank supervision. This law also confirms the central bank's (and the bank
supervision departnent's) responsibility to assess bank license applications, carry out off-site
inspections, as well as on-site examinations. In an effort to carry out the supervisory functions
elaborated in Lei No. 1/92, Banco de Mogambique established the Department of Bank Supervision
in June, 1992.
2.5             The new Department of Bank Supervision is in a very seminal stage. The
Director of Bank Supervision, who reports' to one of the three General Managers of the Central Bank,
currently has a staff of one economist to aid in the development of the function. Not only is there
a lack of manpower within the division, but there is also a lack of supervisory experience. It will
be necessary to develop this important central banking function and to establish regulations governing
the examination and supervision of financial institutions in Mozambique. To this end, Banco de
Mocambique is seeking external assistance in the form of a long term advisor to the department. This
will be important in developing a capacity to oversee the banking system to ensure that prudent
banking practices evolve. However, in addition to establishing governing regulations, it will also



- 50 -
be necessary to analyze the loan portfolios of the three currently existing commercial banks2 (so as
to determining the, as yet, undefined capital adequacy of these institutions) as well as train local staff
in portfolio review and bank examination techniques.
WORK TO BE UNDERTAKEN
2.6              The comprehensive supervision of the three commercial banks in existence would
benefit from outside assistance in the form of a team of four experienced examiners from a foreign
supervisory agency. Given the current lack of detailed knowledge of the banks' loan portfolios, a
team of four examiners with expertise in credit review is needed to work for a period of six months
each (a total of 24 man months) within the Department of Bank Supervision of Banco de
Mocambique. Analysis of troubled loan portfolios requires experienced hands-on review of a type
as yet unknown in Mozambique. Without such review, not only will the performing and non-
performing assets remain in question, but appropriate provisioning and the banks' capital adequacy
cannot be determined.
2.7             Initially, the examination team should review existing legislation, statutes and
regulations pertaining to the central bank and the financial institutions it supervises. By so doing,
the team of visiting examiners should become aware of and provide guidance on specific policies and
procedures which are lacking and should be specifically defined by the nascent Department of Bank
Supervision in order to pursue on-site examination.
2.8              During the examination team's six-month stay, it should carry out a targeted
examination focusing on the asset quality and performance of each of the three commercial banks.
The review of the loan portfolios should be carried out by the four examiners, accompanied and
assisted by a team of trainee examiners from the Department of Bank Supervision of Banco de
Mo9ambique. Each member of the visiting examination team has a responsibility to provide essential
on-the-job training to the team of trainee examiners, so as to leave the Banco de Mozambique's
supervisory staff self-sustaining as possible, able to review troubled loan portfolios without on-going
external assistance.
2.9              Banco de Mocambique regulations are quite non-specific at this point in time.
Therefore, the examination team should enter each of the three commercial banks utilizing its
knowledge of standard international procedures when addressing: (a) classification of loans, (b)
provisioning according to asset classification, (c) exposure limits reflecting credit concentrations (by
borrower and industry), (d) identification of contingent liabilities arising from off-balance sheet
lending, and (e) capital adequacy (taking the Bank of International Settlements' risk-based capital
approach). These issues should be considered within the context of the information existing within
each of the commercial banks - Banco Commercial de Mozambique (BCM), which represents
approximately 95 percent of Mozambique's commercial banking assets, Banco Popular de
Desenvolvimento (BPD), a smaller state-owned bank, and Banco de Standard Totta (BST), a small
privately-owned bank (with Portuguese and British ownership). It should be noted that historical
information on the credits which encompass the loan portfolios may well be limited and in a state of
disarray.
2  In addition, the central bank has licensed two new foreign banb to commence cmmercial banking operations in
Mozambique and they are expected to statu operations in early 1993.



- 51 -
2.10            The international procedures used should be applied in a flexible manner allowing
for Mozambique's changed political and economic philosophy. That is, taking into consideration the
fact that, until the beginning of 1992, Banco de Moqambique had been used to fund state-run
enterprises in a planned economy. Only recently, its role has been modified to include the realization
of a safe and sound banking system geared to promoting private enterprise (both rural and urban)
within a market economy.
2.11            Reconunendations should also be made with respect to the development of, as yet,
non-existent supervisory tools, such as an examination manual and examination forms, to be filled
out by the examiner showing the overall condition of the commercial bank under inspection.
2.12            An examination team would be expected to work closely with any external long
term advisor that Banco de Mogambique may place to work in the Bank Supervision Department.
The two most important outputs of the work would be the development of bank supervisory skills
within the central bank's bank supervision department, as well as calculations of the provisioning
requirements for the three existing conmmercial banks -- to assist in determining their overall levels
of required capital.
TIMING OF TARGET EXAMINATIONS AND TRAINING
2.13            The team should remain in Maputo for a period of six months (24 weeks) each.
The team's time should be allocated in the following manner:
(a)   Initial two-week period within Banco de Mo%ambique to review existing legislation and
regulations, to prepare material to be used to record examination findings, to prepare a
plan of action which can be used as a simple guide for the trainee examiners, and to
become acquainted with the supervisory staff and the team of trainees.
(b)    A three-month target examination within Mozambique's largest commercial bank, Banco
Comercial de Movambique, focusing on asset classification, appropriate provi.Aoning,
credit concentrations, contingent liabilities, and capital adequacy. This examination
should also focus on providing intensive on-the-job training for the trainees.
(c)    A one-month target examination in Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento, along with on-
the-job training for the trainees.
(d)    A one-month target examination in Banco de Standard Totta, along with on-the-job
training for the trainees.
(e)    A two week wrap-up period in which to write up an evaluation of findings with respect
to the three on-site target examinations undertaken, to make written recommendations for
further training of the bank supervision staff, as well as written recommendations with
respect to other information and reforms which would aid in the effectiveness of the
Department of Bank Supervision.

FINANCIAL MARKETS (MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS)
INTRODUCTION
4.1              1he legal framework for the financial markets in Mocambique needs strengthening
and consolidating. The reievant legislation is that governing the different types of market-participants
including issuers, financial intermediaries, providers of market facilities and investors. In addition,
the statutory basis for the powers and responsibilities of the relevant market regulators -- in
particular, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank -- needs review.
NATURE OF THE WORK
4.2              The consultant should familiarize himself with the reports on capital market
development, and on contractual savings institutions, recently undertaken for the World Bank.
4.3             In close coordination with duly appointed Mogambican lawyers, the consultant
should identify what the relevant laws are for the financial markets, and the various types of market
participants. There are at least three sets of legal instruments which need examination:
(a)   those which are directly relevant to the financial markets, including the Diploma
Ministerial No. 162/88 concerning the issuance of debt of 7/12/1988, the Diploma
Ministerial No. 163/88 creating the official secondary market of 7/12/1988, Decree No.

company law such as the duties of directors, bankruptcy provisions, accounting
procedures and taxation issues.
4.4              The consultant should review these laws, and assess the extent to which they need
modification in order to further the development of capital markets. Short- medium- and long-term
priorities should be identified, The recommendations made in the recent World Bank report
concerning the legal framework governing issuers, financial intermediaries, and the providers of
market facilities, should be assessed.
4.5              The consultant should assess whether the regulatory duties of the Ministry of
Finance and the Central Bank need legal clarification, and if so, how. This will require an
assessment of the capabilities and preferences of both institutions. Again, the recommendations made
in the recent World Bank report should be assessed.



- 54 -
4.6              The consultant should advise on how best to implement his recommendations.
This will require an assessment both of the case with which consolidation of the laws may be
achieved, and of the extent to which the recommendations may be achieved by non-statutory
modifications.

SHORT-TERM ADVISOR TO HELP BANCO COMERCIAL DE MOI~AMBIQUE
CLASSIFY ITS ASSETS AND DEVELOP AN INFORMATION (DATA) BASE
COMPATIBLE WITH CENTRAL BANK REPORTING STANDARDS
INTRODUCTION
8.1       A prerequisite to the reform of the Banco Comercial de Mogambique (BCM) is that this
government-owned bank be restructured so as to allow it to commence operations with sound assets
and a clear idea of its net equity value. Aside from the classification of assets in the loan portfolio,
"Contingent Liabilities under Guarantees" and "Letters of Credit" should also be carefully scrutinized
in order to determine items of a doubtful character. With respect to assets and liabilities reflecting
inter-branch transit accounts, many of these balances do not match and may never match, even after
a full reconciliation. Therefore, once the size of the mismatch is identified, this net amount will need
to be written off or otherwise cleared from the accounts.
8.2       After restructuring, periodic (monthly/quarterly) internal monitoring of the BCM's
balance sheets and income statements should be carried out as an integral part of the institution's on-
going financial management, as well as part of its efforts to comply with the central bank's (Banco
de Mogambique - BM) off-site supervisory system. In order for this to be done regularly and
systematically, an appropriate data base must be developed to provide necessary balance sheet, off-
balance sheet, and earnings information.
SCOPE OF WORK TO BE UNDERTAKEN
8.3       Restructuring BCM's portfolio and the development of an in-bank data base will require
the technical assistance of an experienced commercial banker. This short-term consultant will stay
for a period not less than three months and assist BCM to: (a) analyze the bank's credits, as well as
any contingent liabilities arising from off-balance sheet lending, and (b) develop internal reporting
forms which are compatible with the reporting standards required by the bank supervisors in BM and
useful to the financial management of BCM.
8.4      Initially, the consultant should review existing legislation, statutes and regulations as they
pertain to commercial banks in the system. The consultant should also review draft regulations and
guidelines on capital adequacy, asset classification and provisioning, as well as asset concentration
in order to become better acquainted with the work initiated by the central bank on regulations crucial
to commercial bank surveillance. Another important aspect of the process will be to contact the long-
term advisor to the Department of Banking Supervision who will be involved in the central bank's
development of off-site reporting forms which are being designed to show the financial condition and
performance of each bank. These forms will include monthly data on assets, liabilities, and off-
balance sheet items, end-of-quarter data on earnings, a quarterly maturity/repricing profile of assets
and liabilities, as well as information on asset concentrations and the quality of risk assets.
8.5       When considering the development of an in-house data base, the consultant should think
of ratios and growth rates which would serve as tools for BCM to better understand its true financial
condition and performance. The set of reporting forms should be accompanied by instructions
developed by the consultant which includes clear definitions of all data items requested, plus an
explanation of the rationale for each ratio and growth rate requested. In this way, BCM management
will learn how to better monitor itself.



- 65 -
8.6       Once the user requirements have been defined, appropriate software must be selected to
compile and analyze the data. The consultant should be prepared to commnunicate these user
requirements to technical advisors on computer software, so that the resulting database will represent
the system as it has been designed and intended.
TIMING OF THE WORK
8.7       You will arrive in Maputo and stay for a period of three months. Your time should be
allocated in the following manner:
(a)    During the initial two-week period you should contact the long-term advisor and members
of the swat team of examiners with the Department of Supervision of the BM, so as to
initiate an ongoing cooperation and interaction with them. Also, you should review
existing legislation, draft regulations, and proposed draft off-site reporting forms prepared
within the Department of Supervision at the BM.
(b)    The following four weeks should be devoted to an analysis and classification of BCM
loans and any contingent liabilities arising from off-balance sheet lending.
(c)    During the subsequent four weeks, the consultant should focus on the development of:
an internal surveillance system, its design, a written description of the data base, with
definitions and interpretations (from a financial management perspective). Also, you
should work with technical advisors, assigned to advise on computer software, in order
to facilitate the selection of appropriate software to be used to compile and analyze the
data.
(d)    The final two weeks will be a time for you to press forward on all the work you initiated
and/or facilitated, so that you will leave BCM with a fully analyzed and classified loan
portfolio, as well as a data base which will allow BCM to easily comply with central
bank reporting requirements and to provide its own efficient financial management.

TERMS OF REFERENCE TO DEVELOP A
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR
BANCO COMERCIAL DE MOCAMBIQUE
A. INTRODUCTION
10.1            Banco Comercial de Mocambique was formed at the time of independence from
the amalgamation of a number of commercial banking institutions of Portuguese origin. It was also
combined with the Portuguese bank which, prior to independence, was undertaking central banking
functions in Mozambique. Therefore, the combined institution (Banco de Mocambique) took over
both central and commercial banking functions within newly independent Mozambique
10.2            In the early 1990s, the Government commenced a financial sector reform
program, the first step of which, was to split the central and commercial banking functions of Banco
de Mocambique. The first step in this process was to provide a separate legal status for the two
independent institutions, and this occurred in late 1991/early 1992 with the enactment of a new
central banking act, a credit institutions act, and a decree covering the operations of the newly formed
Banco Comercial de Mocambique (which assumed the commercial banking functions of Banco de
Mogambique).
10.3            The splitting of the managements of the two institutions also took place at this
stage, and the process of accounting separation was commenced. By mid-1992, the accountancy team
working on separating the accounts, produced the first (preliminary) set of accounts for Banco
Comercial de MoQambique. Final accounts will be produced towards the end of 1993, and these will
subsequently be audited for the fist time, during 1994. Physical separation of the bank will take place
in early 1994 with the movement of Banco Comercial de Mocambique from its present headquarters
in the central bank's main building in Maputo - to a new headquarters building in a nearby building.
B. FINANCIAL REFORM OF BANCO DE MOCAMBIQUE
10.4            Although the data provided by the accountants is only preliminary, it indicates
several serious financial problems with the bank. The current balance sheets appears to indicate that
the bank will only continue to generate losses, unless important action is taken to stem the main
sources of loss in the bank. Of particular concern are the following:
(a)    A loss difference between total assets and total liabilities in the order of US$120 million
(Mt360 billion);
(b)    Although the reported capital account balance is Mt3O billion -- this has yet to be paid-in
by the Government. In addition, if the bank is to meet internationally accepted norms
of capital adequacy (as is currently being suggested by the central bank and supported by
the World Bank), its capital injection will probably need to be around three times this
level;
(c)    A substantial mismatch exists between foreign liabilities and foreign assets at BCM.
Foreign currency deposit liabilities exceed foreign based assets by more than Mt261
billion. Meanwhile, the currency has been depreciating throughout 1993, generating
substantial losses;



- 69 -
(d)    A growing, and disproportionately high level of other assets -- which, it is understood,
represents various transitory accounts within the bank. This growth has occurred despite
the fact that the KPMG accounting team reconciled the majority of these accounts less
than twelve months earlier;
(e)    The fact that Banco Comercial de Mogambique does not appear to hold the minimum
statutory reserves as required by law. Holding such a non-remunerative asset, will mean,
an even less financially viable position;
(f)    The fact that the Government may have to make good on a substantial amount of
Government guaranteed debt in the banking system which has currently not been
provisioned (in the recent set of accounts) and therefore has not been costed as part of
the reform (recapitalization) of the bank;
(g)    The structure and concentration of BCM's loan portfolio to a number of financially weak
state-owned enterprises;
(h)    The fact that BCM appears to rely heavily upon the central bank for liquidity.
10.5            Although the data is only preliminary, it is indicative of a serious problem in the
bank. As this information is audited, the exact magnitude of the problem will become clearer.
Therefore it is important that the consultant should work closely, and in cooperation with the KPMG
Peat Marwick team which is currently developing the accounts of BCM. Nonetheless, the
information that is already available is indicative of what must be done. These problems must be
addressed urgently.
10.6            The strategic plan would be expected to indicate how the above issues should be
addressed - plus identify any further problems, not herein identified. It should indicate priorities in
dealing with these problems and make suggestions for change.
10.7            The Strategic Plan will provide clear monitorable benchmarks for dealing with
the financial problems in the bank in a clear, precise manner.
10.8            In developing the Strategic Plan, it is important that the consultant consult fully
with the management of Banco Comercial de Monambique, and the staff of the central bank -- so as
to develop a common approach to dealing with the financial problems that have been identified.
C. OTHER ISSUES FOR REVIEW
10.9            In addition to addressing financial issues within BCM, the consultant will also be
expected to work with the management to help develop a long term vision for Banco Comercial de
MoNambique - indicating where the bank is headed in Mozambique's changing financial environment.
Given the recent moves to encourage greater competition in the banking sector, the impact of the
reform process which is increasingly treating all commercial banks in non-differentiated manner, and
the increasing financial deregulation in the sector, the plan should address how the bank should be
expected to operate in this changing environment. The plan should therefore also address the
following;



- 70 -
(a)    Branch reform and rationalization. The consultant will be expected to help develop, in
conjunction with the management, a view of what BCM's future branch net work should
be like. The Plan should address the rationalization that should take place (if any) and
should comment on branch expansion. It will be necessary for the plan to develop
systems for assessing the cost effectiveness of BCM's branch structure and make
recommendations accordingly.
(b)    Management reform. The plan should assess the capabilities of current management to
implement a program of substantial reform and should recommend how management can
be strengthened and how management information systems can be improved to deal with
the problems in BCM.
(c)    Equity participation. The consultant should review the equity participations of BCM and
recommend on the future direction of policy with respect to equity participation in both
public and private companies.
(d)    Staffing reform. The Strategic Plan should review current staffing levels in the Banco
Comercial de Mogambique and make recommendations for change, as appropriate. The
report should provide options for dealing with any staffing changes which it recommends.
The report should also focus on human resource development within the bank and
recommend on the types of training programs which will need to be put in place to
support the bank's activities.
(e)    Recapitalization. The plan will need to suggest options for recapitalizing the bank. The
consultant will be expected to work closely with the staff of the central bank and the
Ministry of Finance, on helping to develop possible methods of recapitalization --
including assessing plans which are currently under consideration by the Government.
(f)    The Consultant will be expected to review the current level of banking services in Banco
Comercial de Mocambique and make suggestions for how services can be both improved
and expanded. The consultant will be expected to make recommendations on the
introduction of "corporate" branches, the introduction of new services and activities, and
so on.
(g)    Privatization. The consultant will be expected to develop a plan which will help
"commercialize". This plan should clearly indicate how the bank could become a
"privatizable" candidate over the medium term.
(h)    The consultant will also be expected to identify the additional expert skills that will be
required to work within the bank and draft terms of reference for a management
consulting team to work in Banco Comercial de Moqambique on a longer term basis.
10.10           To undertake this work, the bank should "cost" its activities -- by breaking the
bank down into cost centers. Activities should be costed and recommendations made on whether
those making losses should be stopped or modified so as to make them profitable.



- 71 -
D. TIMING OF THE WORK
10.11           It is expected that this work will take three months -- and should be commenced
as soon as possible. The consultant will be expected to involve the managements of both Banco
Comercial de Mocambique and Banco de Mogambique in developing the action plan -- developing
consensus and understanding on the issues and how they should be addressed.
10.12           The consultant will also be expected to work closely with KPMG Peat Marwick,
the accounting firm currently working with the bank to help develop its accounts. Over the period
of the assignment, the final accounts for the bank will be made available from the accountants, and
the Consultant will be expected to understand fully the accounts, as developed by the accountants,
and any differences which may arise from the accounts provided in mid-1993.
10.13           The Strategic Plan must contain "clear monitorable, time bound bench marks"
by which its success can be measured.
10.14           The consultant would be expected to discuss a draft of the Strategic Plan with the
Government, the management of BCM, and the World Bank during an appraisal mission of the
Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC) in February 1994 and help to finalize an agreed plan
shortly thereafter.

TERMS OF REFERENCE TO DEVELOP A
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR
BANCO POPULAR DE DESENVOLVIMENTO
A. INTRODUCTION
11.1            Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento (BPD) formed at independence from the
amalgamation of several commercial/development banking institutions of Portuguese origin. It was
established as a development finance institution. It also took over the savings collection role of the
post office savings system.
11.2            Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento has a wide reach throughout the Mozambican
economy, through its wide range of savings collection posts and its wide branch net work. It has
traditionally been a major source of credit to the agricultural sector in Mozambique -- although this
has been changing over the 1990s. Agricultural lending now represents around a third of the bank's
total loan portfolio. Lending to commerce and industry has correspondingly increased over this
period. As a result of these developments, BPD has increasingly assumed the status of a commercial
banking entity rather than a development banking institution.
11.3            In the early 1990, the central bank -- Banco de Mocambique -- commnenced a
vigorous program of financial sector reform. As part of this exercise, the commercial banking
functions of BM were split from its central banking functions; Banco Comercial de Mocambique was
established as a separate entity; and new banks were pennitted to enter the market for the first time.
At the same time, accountants were retained to help develop the accounts of Banco Popular de
Desenvolvimento, so that they could be audited for the first time in 1993. New regulations are also
being drafted on provisioning policy, capital adequacy of banks, and exposure limits to single
customers (or groups of related customers).
11.4            Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento faces many challenges in the immediate
future. It will need to adjust to a fast changing and increasingly deregulated financial environment,
within which greater competition will increase the need for cost effective and efficient banking
operation. It is therefore essential that BPD develop a longer term vision for its overall development.
Such a Strategic Plan will provide the basis for future operations in the bank.
B. AREAS OF FOCUS FOR THE STRATEGIC PLAN
11.5            Financial Restructuring. The team of accountants currently working in BPD -
- KPMG Peat Marwick - have produced a preliminary balance sheet for the bank. The balance sheet
information indicates a difficult financial position for the bank which will require immediate attention
and ultimate resolution. Of particular concern, are the following:
(a)    A loss difference between total assets and total liabilities in the order of US$20-30
million;
(b)    A high level of non-performing loans in the bank's lending portfolio;



- 73 -
(c)    The bank is currently insufficiently capitalized. If the bank is to meet internationally
accepted norms of capital adequacy (as is currently being suggested by the central bank
and supported by the World Pank), its capital injection will need to be substantial.
(d)    A high level of "other assets" which requires resolution;
11.6            Although the data is only preliminary, it is indicative of financial problems within
the bank. As this information is audited, the exact magnitude of the problem will become clearer.
Therefore it is important that the consultant should work closely, and in cooperation with the KPMG
Peat Marwick team which is currently developing the accounts of BPD. Nonetheless, the information
that is already available is indicative of what must be done. These problems must be addressed
urgently.
11.7            The strategic plan would be expect to indicate how the above issues should be
addressed -- plus identify any further problems, not herein identified. It should indicate priorities in
dealing with these problems and make suggestions for change.
11.8            The Strategic Plan will provide clear monitorable benchmarks for dealing with
the financial problems in the bank in a clear, precise manner.
11.9            In developing the Strategic Plan, it is important that the consultant consult fully
with the management of Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento, and the staff of the central bank and
the Ministry of Finance -- so as to develop a common approach to dealing with the financial problems
that have been identified.
11.10           In addition to addressing financial issues within BPD, the consultant will also be
expected to work with the management to help develop a long term vision for Banco Popular de
Desenvolvimento -- indicating where the bank is headed in Mozambique's changing financial
environment. Given the recent moves to encourage greater competition in the banking sector, the
impact of the reform process which is increasingly treating all commercial banks in non-differentiated
manner, and the increasing financial deregulation in the sector, the plan should address how the bank
should be expected to operate in this changing environment. The plan should therefore also address
the following issues.
11.11           Branch reform and rationalization. The consultant will be expected to help
develop, in conjunction with the management, a view of what BPD's future branch net work should
be like. The Plan should address any rationalization that should take place and should comment on
branch expansion. It will be necessary for the plan to develop systems for assessing the cost
effectiveness of BPD's branch structure and make recommendations accordingly.  It will be
important, however, to also take into consideration the important social economic role that BPD's
wide branch net work plays in providing even limited banking services to a wide segment of
Mozambique's rural population. An appropriate balance will need to be achieved between these two
competing objectives.
11.12           Management Review.  The plan should assess the capabilities of current
management to implement a program of substantial reform and should recommend how management
can be strengthened and how management information systems can be improved to deal with the
problems in BPD.



- 74 -
11.13           Involvement in Foreip Exchange Activities. Although BPD has not had an
historical involvement in foreign exchange dealing, it was recently granted a foreign exchange license
by the central bank. The consultant will be expected to help develop a plan for how the bank should
develop its foreign exchange dealing capabilities -- while not exposing itself to potential exchange
fluctuation losses as has been evidenced in other banks operating in Mozainbique.
11.14           Equity participation. The consultant should review the equity participations of
BPD and recommend on the future direction of policy with respect to equity participation in both
public and private companies. In the past, equity involvement by BPD has resulted, in some
instances, from the conversion of bank debt into bank equity. This policy should be reviewed and
clear guidelines established for entering into future equity participations. Policy for dealing with
existing participations should further be assessed. The role of BPD in developing capital markets in
this regard should also be reviewed in the light of its recent underwriting activity.
11.15           Staffing reform. The Strategic Plan should review current staffing levels in
Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento and make recommendations for change, as appropriate. The
report should provide options for dealing with any staffing changes which it recommends. The report
should also focus on human resource development within the bank and recommend on the types of
training programs which will need to be put in place to support the bank's activities.
11.16           Recapitaliaon. The plan will need to suggest options for recapitalizing the
bank. The consultant will be expected to work closely with the staff of the central bank and the
Ministry of Finance, on helping to develop possible methods of recapitalization -- including assessing
plans which are currently under consideration by the Government.
11.17           Banklng Services. The Consultant will be expected to review the current level
of banking services in Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento and make suggestions for how services
can be both improved and expanded. The consultant will be expected to make recommendations on
the introduction of "corporate" branches, the introduction of new services and activities, and so on.
11.18           Legal Status. The consultant will be expected to review the legal status of Banco
Popular de Desenvolvimento and comment on its appropriateness. Currently the bank is a legally
a development banking institution. Its activities, however, reflect a more commercial banking
orientation. Recommendations on reform - including legal reform - in this area, will be an integral
part of the Strategic Plan.
11.19           Development Banking vs Commercial Banking. Related to its legal status, the
consultant should address the issue of what BPD can most effectively undertake within the
Mozambique economy. Should it be a commercial bank or a development banking institiution -- or
some combination of the two. Options should be provided and recommendations made for achieving
the most desirable outcomes.
11.20           Tax Status of BPD. Currently Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento is not taxed
by the State - given its different legal status.  Within an increasingly liberalized banking
environment, in which banks are increasingly being expected to compete with one another on a level
playing field, the consultant should assess the important (or otherwise) of BPD paying tax -- in
common with other banking institutions in Mozambique.



- 75 .
11.21           Commercialization. The consultant will be expected to develop a plan which
will help "commercialize" the activities of BPD. Within this plan, the consultant should assess the
potential for medium term privatization options for the bank. To undertake this work, the bank
should "cost" its activities -- by breaking the bank down into cost centers. Activities should be costed
and recommendations made on whether those making losses should be stopped or modified so as to
make them profitable.
D. TIMING OF TEE WORK
11.22           It is expected that this work will take three months - and should be commenced
as soon as possible. The consultant will be expected to involve the managements of Banco Popular
de Desenvolvimento, Banco de Mocambique, and the Ministry of Finance in developing the action
plan - developing consensus and understanding on the issues and how they should be addressed.
11.23           The consultant will also be expected to work closely with KPMG Peat Marwick,
the accounting firm currently working with the bank to help develop its accounts. Over the period
of the assignment, the final accounts for the bank will be made available from the accountants, and
the Consultant will be expected to understand fully the accounts, as developed by the accountants,
and any differences which may arise from the accounts provided during 1993.
11.24           The Strategic Plan must contain "clear monitorable, time bound bench marks"
by which its success can be measured.
11.25           The consultant would be expected to discuss a draft of the Strategic Plan with the
Government, the management of BPD, and the World Bank during an appraisal mission of the Second
Economic Recovery Credit (SERC) in February 1994 and help to finalize an agreed plan shortly
thereafter.

Financial Sector Capacity Building Credit
Supervision Plan
IDA Supervision Input
1.       It is envisaged that about 20 staff weeks, per year, will be required for supervision
of the Financial Sector Capacity Building (FS CB) credit. Supervision will involve, inter alia,
review of training programs, procurement and disbursement actions, correspondence, donor
coordinaiion, annual reviews and mid-term reviews of the program.
2.        The annual reviews and the mid-term review will form an important formal
component of the supervision of the credit. These reviews will assess program performance
against agreed bench marks and will adjust the program where necessary. Project modification
and redesign will be possible at the time of the mid-term review.
3.        Supervision of the credit is most likely to be undertaken in conjunction with the
supervision of the Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC) given the synergies between the
two projects.
Supwvion fm the Resdet Misson
4.        Given the highly supervision intensive nature of the Financial Sector Capacity
Building credit, emphasis will be given to supervising some aspects of the program from the
Resident Mission in Maputo. Consequently, efforts are currently in train to recruit a local staff
member to work in the Residt Mission to work on the supervision of this, and the adjustment
(te Second Economic Recovery Credit), credit.
S.        This decentralized supervision will make it possible to have a quick turn around on
contract approval, no-objection, procurement and disbursement issues. As implementation
capacities are known to be limited in Mozambique, it will be particularly important to have such
a capacity based locally, to assist in speeding up project implementation.
Borrowees Contibution to SupevWion
6.        The central bank will take a lead role in supervising the implementation of this
program. The members of the Board of the Bank of Mozambique, chaired by the Governor of
the cemral bank (Mr. A. Maleiane), are all coordinators for the sub-components of the Capacity
Building credit. The Director of the Human Resources department is the overall project
coordinator.
7.        The central bank will also be responsible for supervising and incorporating the
Ministry of Finance in those aspects of the program with direct relevance to Ministry staff --
particularly legal training for Ministry of Finance persomel. The central bank will also be
responsibl for coordinating tde commercial bank training elements of the program through its
mmbership of the taining coordinang committee for the Banker's Training Institute (the IFB).

Organization and Timing of Supervision Missions
8.        Review missions will be led by the FS CB Task Manager (Senior Financial
Economist) and will include staff and/or consultants who are specialists in areas of finance,
training, procurement and disbursement. Due to the complimentary nature of this credit with the
Economic and Financial Management Technical Assistance credit, close cooperation will be
maintained with the task manager for that project within the Country Operations Division of the
Southern Africa Department. Given the relevance of trained commercial banking staff to the
implementation of other projects with on-lending components, currently in effect, or under
preparation by World Bank staff in Mozambique, close cooperation and coordination will also
be maintained with relevant task managers to ensure the appropriateness of training under the FS
CB in meeting specific project needs.
9.        Given the close coincidence of interest in central banking and monetary policy
matters, close cooperation will also be maintained with the International Monetary Fund with
respect to technical assistance and training related to the central bank. Where appropriate,
coordination will also be undertaken with relevant donors (the Govermnents of France, Portugal,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom - in particular).
10.      In addition to regular monitoring of the program by World Bank staff based in
Maputo, two to three supervision missions per year are anticipated - with supervision heavier
in the earlier years of the project. The initial two missions will take place in May and October
1994. An important task of the initial mission will be the development of an Implementation
Manual for the project in conjunction with the Mozambican authorities. This mission will also
follow up with the coordinator of the project to ensure that the central bank training programs,
and the commercial banking training programs are in place and ready to commence by the second
half of the year. Training of legal staff has commenced with funding under the Project
Preparation Facility, and it will be neces-ary to ensure that this is proceeding as planned.
11.      It will also be necessary during this first supervision mission to ensure that as much
of the technical assistance, as is possible, is in place. In particular, work on the two strategic
plans for Banco Comercial de Mosambique and Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento should either
be completed, or close to completion. Work should also have commenced on going to tender on
the management consultancy assistance to help implement the Strategic Plan within Banco
Comercial de Mogambique. Outstanding technical assistance requirements within Banco de
Mo;ambique should also be in place by this stage.
12.       The second supervision mission in 1994 will thereafter be able to focus more on
initial reactions to the training undertaken within both the central and the commercial banks.
Staff will be surveyed for the appropriateness of courses taught, duration of courses,
appropriateness of course material, and provide suggestions as to how course work can be
improved. This mission will also focus on the development of a cadre of local trainers, who will
be gradually trained to take over from foreign trainers in the implementation of the program.
A more complete rc /iew of the first year of operation, measured against agreed performance
benchmarks will then be possible in the first part of 1995 - as part of the Annual Review
process.

BANCO DE MOCAMBIOUE
GOVERNADOR
Of. ng 354/G/CA/93
Maputo, 01-12-93
Lewis Preston,
President,
World Bank
18X8 x Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 24033,
UNITED STATE8 OF AKERICA
Dear Mr. Preston,
Letter describing the Government's Capacity Building
Program in the Financial Sector
The Government of Mozambique, through its central bank
(Banco de Mo9ambique) has embarked upon a program of substantial
reform within the financial sector. Support for this program will
be requested by the Government of Mozambique, from the
International Development Association (IDA), within the context
of the Second Economic Recovery Credit (SERC).
An important component of financial reform is the
development of human resource capabilities operating within the
sector. The central bank places important emphasis on developing
the capacity of this sector, so that financial services can be
provided in an efficient and effective manner, such that the
neods of the real sectors of our economy can be met. This is
particularly important for Mozambique as we steer through a
transition to peace.
Two specific areas are of particular importance with
respect to capacity building within the sector - central bank
training and commercial bank training.
Central banking activities in Mozambique have long been
compromised by the combination of both commercial and central
banking functions within Banco de Mo9ambique. Since 1987,
however, substantial progress has been made on splitting central
and commercial banking functions within this institution.
Legislation was enacted in early 1992 which created Banco
Comercial de Mocambique. Progress is being achieved on the
process of cleaning up the BCM accounts and the separation will
be completed in early 1994 with the physical separation of the
banks.

BANCO DE MOIAMBIQUE
GOVERNADOR
Within this new environment, and within an economy
which has been substantially deregulated and liberalized since
the reform process commenced in 1987, the staff of the central
bank are having to undertake new activities and learn new skills.
The development of central banking capacity is crucial to the
overall macroeconomic reform program which Mozambique is
undertaking.   Banco de Mogambique will be required to apply
indirect tools of monetary management; exchange control
activities have been substantially deregulated and new methods
of operating in this liberalized environment will have to be
developed by central bank staff; and lastly, banking supervision
skills will need to be developed as a matter of urgency - to
ensure appropriate review of both the existing banks operating
in Mozambique and the new foreign banks which have started
operations in our country as a consequence of our new policies
which encourage banking sector competition.
The development of central banking skills is therefore
fundamental to overall macroeconomic management and prudential
development of a banking sector which can meet the financing
needs of the real sectors of our economy in this new era of
peace. It is antecipated that actions to support the development
of central banking skills will take place under the proposed
Financial Sector Capacity Building credit which has been
appraised by the World Bank, and which is likely to be supported
by the Governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
In addition, it is important that the staff of the
commercial banks can perform banking functions for their clients
in a timely and effective manner. Skill development in the banks
is also very important for the financing of economic activities
and growth within our economy.
In recognition of the importance of the development of
skills in the commercial banks, the central bank has been working
closely with the commercial banks resident in M6zambique to help
develop both a Banker's Training Institute and a Banker's
Association. Significant support has been provided to us in these
efforts by the Government of France.
As a consequence of this work, it is antecipated that
a Banker's Training Institute will be operational by early 1994
with all the banks (including the central bank) operating as
joint and equal partners in an effort to better train the staff
of our commercial banks - in areas of pertinence to their work.
Support for this Institute is also anticipated from the
Government of Switzerland, and indirectly by the World Bank -
through the Financial Sector Capacity Building Credit - through
the provision of short term courses to meet specific skill needs
in the banks, which will be run within the Institute.

GOVERNADOR
Development of both central and commercial banking
skills is accorded the highest priority by the central bank and
the Government. Training of staff through formal courses (both
short and long) and on-the job training, is an important
component of this development of skills.
In addition, the transfer of some skills will require
the utilization of foreign technical expertise, especially in
areas which are new to the banking sector. Consequently, external
technical assistance for support of banking supervision
activities will be required - as this is a function which has
hitherto not existed in Mozambique since independence. However,
our policy with respect to such recruitment is that it should
contain an important element of training for our local staff -
such that skills are properly transferred and local capacity is
developed. Terms of reference for any external expertise will
place an important emphasis on this issue.
Lastly, it will also be important to both deepen
broaden the range of financial services and instruments which are
available in Mozambique. New institutions will need to be
developed and new skills will necessarily have to be acquired.
As control within the financial sector increasingly transfers
from the public to the private sectors, the development of human
resourse capabilities will also increasingly become the
responsability of the private sector. Nonetheless, in this
transitional phase, strong central bank support and emphasis on
skills development and capacity building is considered essential.
The proposed World Bank Financial Sector Capacity
Building credit is an important component of the overall
development of capacity within this sector, and in conjuction
with assistance from the Governments of France, Switzerland,
Britain, and others, will go a long way to financing real growth
potential in our economy as we move towards a new era of peace.
Yours sincerely,
,riano vllaians
