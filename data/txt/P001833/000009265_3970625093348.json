Second Livestock Project for\n            Mauritania seeks to slow the deterioration of the grazing\n            areas and to boost productivity by:  (i) making groups of\n            pastoralists responsible for allocated grazing areas, (ii)\n            providing better services and production inputs, and (iii)\n            increasing the knowledge of livestock production systems\n            essential to the formulation of a development policy and to\n            the planning of future interventions. Main project\n            components are: (a) a pilot component for the establishment\n            of pastoral cooperative associations; (b) the study of\n            livestock production systems, project monitoring and the\n            preparation of projects; (c) distribution of production\n            inputs for sale to livestock owners; (d) strengthening of\n            livestock services; (e) establishment of a Livestock Fund\n            and a production improvement fund; and (f) construction of a\n            small abattoir in Nouakchott."}, "docdt": "1986-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
