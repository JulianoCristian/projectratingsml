Project in Mauritania.\n            The main project objectives were to slow the deterioration\n            of grazing areas and boost livestock productivity by the\n            following means: (i) making groups of pastoralists\n            responsible for allocated grazing areas; (ii) providing\n            better extension services and production inputs; and (iii)\n            contributing to the store of knowledge of livestock\n            production systems in order to help formulate a development\n            policy and plan future interventions in the sector.\n            Bank's performance was not satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was not satisfactory. The main\n            lessons learned from the project are the following: (i)\n            tapping a community's organizational capacity and\n            commitment to decision-making has proven extremely\n            effective, and hilds promise for the future; (ii) project\n            design should always be kept simple, and when problems are\n            encountered during implementation, restructuring should aim\n            to simplify even more; and (iii) no project of this sort\n            should be attempted unless a comprehensive government\n            implementation plan has been drawn up and relevant\n            monitoring indicators have been identified."}, "docdt": "1996-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
