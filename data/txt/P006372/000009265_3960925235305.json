It will furthermore involve\n            (d) strengthening of farmer/extension research linkages; (e)\n            provision of training, technical assistance and studies; and\n            (f) expansion of social extension and community development\n            programs.  The project is expected to improve the incomes\n            and living standards of Brazilian farmers and their families\n            by increasing their productivity and supporting the greater\n            participation of women in agricultural production and\n            related homecraft activities."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
