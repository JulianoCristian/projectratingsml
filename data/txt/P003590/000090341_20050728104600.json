Lessons\n            learned: Strong support and a high degree of commitment from\n            government at all levels is a precondition of the\n            project's successful implementation. A strong and\n            adequately supported central Project Management Office (PMO)\n            is essential for the success of the project. Active\n            participation of beneficiaries throughout the project life\n            is essential for effective implementation and a better sense\n            of ownership. Effective institution building, including an\n            emphasis on PMO's stability and continuity, is the\n            foundation for successfully implementing a highly complex\n            project. Putting rural infrastructure first will ensure that\n            benefits of activities under other components can be\n            maximized. Building flexibility into the project design will\n            empower the project to accommodate a changing environment.\n            Promoting farmers' human capital development will\n            strengthen the project's sustainability. Ensuring the\n            independence of micro-finance institutions in its business\n            operation is one of key conditions for achieving its\n            financial sustainability."}, "docdt": "2005-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
