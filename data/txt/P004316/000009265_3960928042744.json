supporting the Rubber Industry Smallholders\n            Development Authority's (RISDA) development program,\n            which centers on replanting of smallholder rubber, and\n            RISDA's institutional strengthening. The project will\n            have two main components. The first, agricultural\n            development, will include: (a) replanting of smallholder\n            rubber, early maintenance of planted crops, crops\n            rehabilitation, agricultural inputs for crops in production,\n            and supplemental support for mini-estates; (b) construction\n            and maintenance of agricultural access roads; and (c)\n            improved agricultural extension services and smallholder\n            training. The second component, institutional development,\n            will include: (a) the provision of management facilities and\n            vehicles, including office technology equipment to help\n            computerize RISDA's management information system\n            (MIS); (b) expanded staff training; and (c) studies."}, "docdt": "1989-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
