The first, agricultural\n            development, will include: (a) replanting of smallholder\n            rubber, early maintenance of planted crops, crops\n            rehabilitation, agricultural inputs for crops in production,\n            and supplemental support for mini-estates; (b) construction\n            and maintenance of agricultural access roads; and (c)\n            improved agricultural extension services and smallholder\n            training. The second component, institutional development,\n            will include: (a) the provision of management facilities and\n            vehicles, including office technology equipment to help\n            computerize RISDA's management information system\n            (MIS); (b) expanded staff training; and (c) studies."}, "docdt": "1989-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
