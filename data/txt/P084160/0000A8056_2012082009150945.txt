                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective (PDO) is to contribute (i) to enhance transparency and efficiency in public financial management, and (ii) to strengthen accountability
                         in the use of public resource. The project will play a key role in Cameroon in accelerating the pace toward a more orderly and open PFM and thus more efficient service
                         delivery.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Project implementation and disbursements have been slow since the Board approval in 2008. The project only became effective one year after Board approval. As of June 30, 2012,
                         the disbursement rate of the project only reaches 18%.

                         Given the limited level of implementation to date and the need to reallocate resources to other activities, the Government, through the Ministry of Planning, and the Bank have
                         reached an agreement to reallocate undisbursed project funds in order to optimize portfolio performance.
