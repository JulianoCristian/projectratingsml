Transparency and\n            Accountability Capacity Building Project for Cameroon were\n            as follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was low or

Some lessons learned includes: the\n            implications of effectiveness conditions need to be\n            carefully assessed at the project design stage. The range of\n            operational alternatives needs to be thoroughly discussed at\n            the project design stage. Project implementation would\n            benefit from early and more comprehensive training of\n            implementation units, particularly in project management.\n            Implementation unit coordinators tend to be recruited from\n            among the administration and are often either retired\n            high-ranking public officials or officials of embedded\n            agencies. The project shows that Public Financial Management\n            (PFM) reforms and projects are highly dependent on context\n            and operating environment.
