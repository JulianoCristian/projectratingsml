                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective (PDO) is to contribute (i) to enhance transparency and efficiency in public financial management, and (ii) to strengthen accountability
                         in the use of public resource. The project will play a key role in Cameroon in accelerating the pace toward a more orderly and open PFM and thus more efficient service
                         delivery.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Project implementation and disbursements have been slow since the Board approval in 2008. The project only became effective one year after Board approval. As of December
                         2012, the disbursement rate of the project reached only 24.27% (prior to fund cancellation).

                         Given the limited level of implementation as of March 2012 and the need to reallocate resources to other activities, the Government, through the Ministry of Planning, and the Bank
                         reached an agreement to cancel part of the allocation to be able to reallocate undisbursed funds to other performing projects in Cameroon, in order to optimize portfolio performance.
