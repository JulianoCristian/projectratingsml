                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective (PDO) is to contribute (i) to enhance transparency and efficiency in public financial management, and (ii) to strengthen
                         accountability in the use of public resource. The project will play a key role in Cameroon in accelerating the pace toward a more orderly and open PFM and thus
                         more efficient service delivery.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was coping with many difficulties since its inception in 2009. After two years of implementation, only 10% of the total budget was disbursed and the February 2011
                         mission to Yaounde conveyed the Bank's concerns with the status quo regarding the project as well as the risk of project anticipated closure. A Road map was adopted by the

                         The Mid-Term Review carried out in August 2011 found that the project has been partially rectified with the satisfactory implementation of the Road map. Significant progress has
                         been made particularly in (i) HR and Payroll activity; (ii) IT strategy and plan activity; (iii) Reorganization of the Treasury and preparation of the capacity building plan for its Internal

                         Audit; and (iv) Recruitment of consultants for various activities.

                         According to estimates by the MTR the Road map was carried out at 70%. The completion of ongoing activities should achieve a level of 40% on budget commitments in late
                         December 2011, an increase of 30% in one year. The Mid-Term Review also concluded that to consolidate the progress noted in recent implementation, the project should be
                         restructured in order to allow for achievement of its objectives. To this end, the mission discussed with the authorities and prioritize reform activities that could be completed before
