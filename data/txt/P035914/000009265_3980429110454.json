Some lessons\n            learned included: successful implementation hinges on\n            responsiveness of project design to Government's\n            expectations and the needs of the population. By giving\n            priority to actions which ensure quick restoration of\n            economic activity and benefit the segments of the population\n            most affected by the cyclones, an emergency rehabilitation\n            operation is bound to arouse strong support from all key\n            actors. Successful program implementation, and prompt\n            reconstruction in the context of an emergency operation,\n            hinge on the existence of a strong coordination unit (CNC),\n            as well as up-front commitment to rapid procurement\n            arrangements and timely provision of counterpart funds and\n            taxes. Continued improvements in procurement processing will\n            permit timely and effective response to road improvement\n            needs and reduce the cost of works. Close monitoring is\n            instrumental in focusing assistance on key activities for\n            the success of the program and in enhancing flexibility in\n            project implementation. A high level of responsiveness to\n            the Borrower's needs, and maintenance of a good working\n            relationship with the authorities, is crucial to arousing\n            Government commitment and ownership of the program."}, "docdt": "1998-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
