Lessons\n            reinforce the success of close working relationships among\n            counterparts, beneficial in terms of additional financial\n            resources, and of exposure to other technical, and\n            managerial methods. But regardless of success, lessons also\n            suggest best practices in road administration, namely, that\n            economic analysis should identify optimal choices in the\n            selection of road sections, and in the type of pavements to\n            be improved, using adequate computer programs in resource\n            planning. Furthermore, contractor competitiveness improves\n            efficiency, particularly for periodic road maintenance,\n            provided adequate supervision of the contractor performance\n            is implemented, and that payments are tied to the\n            fulfillment of quality requirements. Although the Lithuanian\n            Road Fund created the incentive for political\n            representatives to support it, questions have been raised as\n            to its validity, and whether regular budgetary procedures\n            should not replace it, since resources available through the\n            Fund are not sufficient to cover maintenance of the national\n            road network. Co-financing is of limited value for projects\n            with incremental work programs, as in this case, though it\n            is worth considering in projects with a single large\n            component, to reduce costs."}, "docdt": "2000-09-12T00:00:00Z"}
