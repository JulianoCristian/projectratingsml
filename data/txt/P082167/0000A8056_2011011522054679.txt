                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the National Agricultural Science and Technology and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Systems by supporting
                         the joint participation of both the public and private sectors, through the mechanism of production chains, thereby contributing to the competitiveness of
                         Colombian agriculture and improving the accessibility of export-potential products to international markets.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been progressing as expected in mainstreaming it's activities into the Ministry's workplan, with the exception of the certification of the biosafety laboratory (la burbuja)
                         which has encountered additional delays. The timeline of activities for La Burbuja has been updated and the work plan for achieving certification has been reviewed. The closing date
                         for the project has been extended until December 2011 to allow additional time to execute all project activities and the final project impact evaluation.
