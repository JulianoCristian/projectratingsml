                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the National Agricultural Science and Technology and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Systems by supporting
                         the joint participation of both the public and private sectors, through the mechanism of production chains, thereby contributing to the competitiveness of
                         Colombian agriculture and improving the accessibility of export-potential products to international markets.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been progressing as expected and has been fully mainstreamed into the activities into the Ministry's workplan. There is still one exception which is the large delay in
                         the certification of the biosafety laboratory (LNSB3A). The timeline of activities for LNSB3A has been updated and the work plan for achieving certification has been reviewed. The
                         additional works and activities in concluding the LNSB3A are still programmed to be over by the closing date for the project (December 2011).
