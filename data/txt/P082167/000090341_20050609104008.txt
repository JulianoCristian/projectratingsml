A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. CountryandSector Issues

Generalbackground

The Colombian National Development Plan (2002-2006) has five pillars: (i) sustainable economic
                                                                               foster
growth and employment generation by implementing labor and pension reform, promoting
competitiveness, innovation and technology, fostering trade integration and increasing private
participation in the delivery of public services and infrastructure; (ii)bring about security by seeking a
negotiated solution, fighting narcotics through eradication, alternative development and prevention of
drugconsumption, controlling arms traffic and money laundering, strengthening the army, and improving
the judicial system; (iii)
                         buildinga more equitable society through broadeningthe quality and coverage of
education, widening and improving social protection, strengthening small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) and cooperatives, implementinga social and development strategy for rural areas - Manejo Social
del Campo- and improving the quality of life in urban areas; (iv) increasing the efficiency of the State
through implementing political and public administration reform, furthering decentralization and
territorial development, and strengthening local democracies and civil society participation in public
administration; and (v) reduce the fiscal deficit by implementing a program that includes expenditure
reductions anda comprehensive overhaul of the public sector andof the taxation system.
The Government of Colombia (GOC) is currently developing several strategies to attain the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) by introducing a package of macro- and micro-economic reforms aimed at
promoting sustainable economic growth, supplementedby specific measures aimed at reducingpoverty.

Agricultural and Rural Sector

The Colombian agricultural and agro-entrepreneurial sector, which accounts for 21percent of aggregate
GDP, 25 percent of export revenues, and 30 percent of job creation in the country, where more than 4.5
million people have a job, continues to play a vital role in the national economy. However, when
compared with countries at a similar level of development, the sector's competitiveness still ranks below
internationalpatterns, a fact not inkeeping with both the comparative advantagesthe country has, and its
potentialfor development.
Colombian agricultural activities are carried out in a rural setting where high poverty levels, unequal
income distribution, illiteracy, violence, and unequal land ownership prevail. Rural unemployment has
been associated with a reduction over the last 10 years in cultivated land, triggering a decrease in work
opportunities, and driving rural people to migrate to the cities. The forced displacement of the rural
population has also been prompted by violence in the rural areas, which has had a negative impact on the
investment climate and, thus, on the creation of productivejobs. According to a 2001 IGAC-CORPOICA
study on land property, 61.2 percent of rural real estate registered in the country was held by 0.4 percent
of landowners, creating estates of, on average, more than 500 hectares each. By contrast, 24.2 percent of
rural real estate area was held by 97 percent of owners registered with the Land Registry, creating plots,
on average, of less than 3 hectares each. According to estimates, while only less than 50 percent of the
2.5 million families living in rural areas are small landowners, a large percentage of households are
landless.
Like many countries in Latin America Colombia historically pursued economic policies that favoured
import substitution and regulated the domestic market. A significant part of agricultural trade was
controlled by the State. In 1990 Colombia policymakers took the decision to break with that tradition and
deregulate domestic markets and liberalize international trade for all sectors of the economy. However
later on, price bands were introduced for a number of crops, in order to smooth international price
fluctuations before they were transmitted to the domestic market, and then the system was extended to

additional agricultural commodities.      In November 1994 (through Decree 2439) the government
reintroduced a requirement that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) approve
imports, in this case for 68 agricultural products, and for each product approval was made conditional on
the domestic agro-industry absorbing the country's own production. In2003 (Decree 047), the number of
commodities covered by this mechanism was reduced to 35, to comply with the World Trade
Organization (WTO) requirements (World Bank 2003).
Despite the setbacksto the initiative for a more open agricultural sector as envisioned inthe early 90s, the
present Government has embarked along with its partner countries in the Andean Region on the
negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States. This will lead to a more open
sector with the need to be more competitive. In this context, improving agricultural competitiveness,
developing the rural areas, and improving the living standards of the rural population, is a key to
Colombia becominga peaceful and productive country. Achieving these objectives will enable Colombia
to consolidate the competitive advantages of the rural sector, and to take advantage of the opportunities
brought about by the commercial opening envisioned inthe FTA.
Competitivenessof the Agricultural Sector
Inthe World Bank study (2003) on agricultural and rural competitiveness in Colombia, comparative
advantage was assessedfor different groups of products.
Inoverallterms, it was foundthat Colombiahascomparative advantage, oftenstrong, inexport products
as opposed to import substitutes, in perennial crops as opposed to annual crops; and in the more labor-
intensive crops. All regions have a comparative advantage in some lines of production. Inmany cases
realizing this comparative advantage will require concerted efforts in areas such as agricultural
technology development, marketing programs, and food safety programs. It can also be promoted by
modifications in priorities in incentives policies and by changes in the way in which some programs are
carried out, including researchandextension and imgation management.
Referring to specific groups of products it was that grains and soybeans exhibit a comparative
disadvantage.
Fruit and vegetable crops were found to have considerable comparative advantage, without exception.
They already occupy an important position in national agricultural production, accounting for 23 percent
of the value of non-coffee production, a figure which rises to 40 percent when plantains and bananas are
included. Their role in generating employment i s proportionately greater, and hence they are valuable
crops for a poverty alleviation strategy. They also enjoy the advantage of continuously increasing world
demand. The acreage planted in fruit other than bananas and plantains more than doubled from 1991to
2001. An integrated agro-export strategy for fruit and vegetables would include as main pillars the
following elements: i)a more concerted effort to obtain phytosanitary approvals in major export markets,
ii)ahigherpriorityinprogramsof technology developmentandtransfer, iii)amorecompletemarket
intelligence system, iv) a campaign to promote producer awareness of the importance of product quality,
v) support for stronger producer organization, and vi) a higher priority in international trade negotiations
for opening markets to Colombian fruit and vegetable exports.
Another group of products including two of the four largest agricultural exports, coffee and sugar, and
one of the fastest growing exports, palmoil, plus cacao were found to have a comparative advantage, with
the possible exception of cacao in part of the country. These crops are highly intensive in labor use and
therefore have considerable capacity for creating employment.         More than 30 percent of costs are
accounted for in the employment of skilled and unskilled labor. In addition, employment i s relatively
stable and well remuneratedin most of these crops over the medium term and therefore it is employment
of highquality.




                                                      2

Another group of crops covers cassava, potatoes, tobacco, and cotton. In the case of all of them,
processed forms of the products have been increasing in importance in Colombia, relative to the raw
forms. Potatoesand tobacco have a markedcomparative advantage at the farm level.
Colombia has a comparative advantagein all livestock products. It i s strongestfor poultry, eggs and milk
and least evident for extensive livestock production. In terms of its comparative advantage beef fattening
operations and pork production fall in between the above mentioned sub-sectors. Both poultry and milk
production have grown rapidly in the last twenty years. Milk i s competitive in the Andean regional
context but, in the presenceof subsidies on dairy products in other countries, it could not compete in the
wider international market. When the calculations are made with current rates of protection on feed-
grains, pork loses its competitiveness andpoultry's becomesmarginal.
Structural and sanitary barriers in world markets, for poultry, beef and milk, inhibit the possibilities for
expansion of Colombia's exports of these products, but were world conditions to improve these
possibilities would increase. There is an expectation of achieving certification for some regions of the
country as free of hoof-and-mouth disease, and that alone would provide an incentive for greater exports,
although not inColombia's most competitive livestock product.
Agricultural research is a key to improving productivity and it generally has shown very high returns.
Estimates of the rate of return to agricultural researchby region of the world, in many studies, have been
consistently high: 41 percent in Africa (10 studies), 46 percent in Latin America (36 studies), and 35
percent in Asia (35 studies). However, productivity increases are sometimes difficult to achieve on a
sector-wide basis, especially when the use of all factors of production is taken into account. Changing the
sector's product composition toward higher-value products i s fundamental for increasing productivity at
the sector-wide level. This i s an area inwhich policy can play an important role.
Production Chains: A CompetitivenessPolicy Instrument
Over the last few decades there has been a reduced global market share of commodities (raw materials
and primary agricultural products) vis-&vis that of value-added products. In other words, the growers'
share in the agriculture-derived product chains value-adding process has steadily decreased while the
transformation and marketingprocesses share has increased (Trigo, 2004).
This evidence shows that it is increasingly important to recognize the changing relationship between the
different stages of the processes, from primary production to retail marketing. Hence, as the basis of
investment used in this project the relevance that i s being attached to the production chain approach.
Such an approach allows for "a system to be depicted in which materials, capital and information flows
link agents," which, integrated into a production chain seek to supply an end market. Understanding of
production processes is thus enhanced because an analysis of the systems' performance, bottlenecks,
untappedopportunities and agents' managerial skills i s made possible.
Productive processes nowadays tend to be focused in a few regions, because innovation activities,
resources accrual (human, institutional, infrastructure, technological, scientific and financial) and social
capital formation -all of them processes conducive to the development of competitiveness- are really
taking place inthose regions. Along these lines, because development of productive chains andterritorial
development are closely linked, the productive chain approach has been widely taken on as the organising
principle of agriculturalpolicy.
Fromthe mid-90s onwards, a productionchain approach has been embraced by the national Government
in the design and implementation of agricultural public policy and in supporting the national
competitiveness strategy.
The impetus given to competitiveness agreements within the context of production chains over the last
few years has been used to strengthen and plan agro-productive, fishery, forestry, livestock activities vis-
&vis the economic opening and to support increasing trade integration of the country with the rest of the



                                                      3

world. These agreements are being entered into between the various private agents involved in the
production, transformation and marketing chain and the national Government. The goal of this policy is
to establish commitments and an action plan that improve the overall competitive position of agribusiness
while increasing exports, adding value to goods, and creating jobs. Technological innovation and an
improved organizational environment are key drivers of this policy. The role of government in this
initiative i s to facilitate interaction between different members of each industry and coordinate policy so
that government incentives and infrastructure investment support private initiatives that generate
competitive advantage.
Within the framework of the competitiveness strategy, Law 811of 2003 was enacted stipulating the role
the Government and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) should play with
respect to chain organizations in the agricultural, forestry, aquatic, and fishery sector. Conceming these
production chains, the mission of the MARD i s to design policy to deliver agro-production chain
development-related public goods. Inorder for agents participating in a production chain to have access
to these public goods, a national and/or regional agreement should be entered into, and the MARDshould
be duly advised, accordingly.
The MARD's organizational scheme includes a Production Chain Directorate in charge of fostering the
development of this policy. The Directorate's main goals are: (a) achieving chain competitiveness; (b)
creating conditions conducive to the generation of strategic alliances among chain agents; (c) lowering
transaction costs; (d) ensuring the timely and ongoing availability of products; (e) building social capital;
and (f)creating the conditions to strengthening chain development.
Economic Integration, Knowledge Generation and Innovation
The international integration process of the Colombian economy and of the agricultural sector in
particular, i s taking place in a global setting in which knowledge and technological development and
innovation are becoming increasingly important factors in global market differentiation. There are
increasing demands in particular for "quality, healthy, environment-friendly and safe food products
showing new packaging and presentation and addressing environmental requirements and health safety."
In short, the evolution of agriculturalproduction structures around the world hasbeendeterminedby both
the increasing significance of knowledge in terms of economic development, and consumption pattem
changes.
According to the MARD, the agricultural sector share of GDP ranks below the "international agricultural
participation pattem,"' despite the fact that "natural resources available to the country have a clear
agricultural vocation."       This means that Colombia does not fully take advantage of its huge natural
resources and the vast biodiversity provided to agricultural production. Comparatively disadvantaged
products have benefited from production incentives (pricing and trade policies, exchange rate policies,
and fiscal incentives) over products showing comparative advantages. As a result, Colombian agriculture
has not been able to contribute its maximum benefits in terms of job creation and growth (World Bank
2003).
Colombia has given priority to the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity. In fact
the GOC has prioritized within the GEF pipeline "Conservation and sustainable use of the Colombian
Agricultural Biodiversity Project      ".  The general objective of this proposed operation shares a similar
approach with this project and will complement its objectives.
The new development model therefore requires strengthening of scientific, technological, and innovation
capacities, and technology and technological services transfer capacities. The conditions would thus be
created for increasing productivity, harnessing the sustainable use of natural resources, taking advantage
of opportunities offered by biotechnology and by the country's biological diversity, and fulfilling


  Presidency of the RepublicandMinistry of AgricultureandRuralDevelopment(2001).


                                                          4

standards required by domestic and international markets (quality, food safety, and environmental
conservation). The above conditions should contribute to improving agricultural sector competitiveness
and addressingsocial problems inthe rural areas.
The development of production chains i s closely linked with science and technology capacity building.
This process in Colombia is still posing significant challenges. In fact, a weak articulation between the
productive sector and the scientific sector i s apparent in most agricultural production chains. The above
i s reflected, for example, in the rather low co-financing level of technological research and development
activities in most chains and in the fact that most para-fiscal funds show a trend to allocate most of their
resourcesto technology transfer activities.
The private sector provides significant financing of science and technology to only a few chains. These
chains show strong institutional development and a capacity to design their own R&D agendas, setting
priorities and leveraging resources to fund science, technology, and innovation activities. Most of these
chains have their own research centers Centros Nucionales de Znvestigucidn (CENIs), and record the
highestcompetitiveness levels.
Several constraints need to be overcome before the country's capacities can be strengthened.
Government financing of agricultural, scientific, and technological research i s low and decreasing; the
number of researchers, research groups, and scientific and technological production working in sector-
related issues has plummeted inrecent years, while the researchbeing done lacks relevance and long-term
planning and therefore it shows low economic and social impact (Amaya and Rueda 2004). Contributing
to this situation i s the fact that public science and technology activities financing mechanismshave shown
a bias toward short-term research initiatives, mainly designed in line with scientific sector concerns,
rather than that of chain agents, and focused mostly on issues dealing with the chain's primary production
stages, rather than on the industrial and marketing stages.             In addition, incentives to encourage
cooperation between the productive sector and the scientific and technological sector, particularly in
providingincentives to private investment are lacking.
Policies are needed to ease the way for those productive sectors showing clear comparative and
competitive advantages, and export potential. To achieve this goal, priority identificationmechanismsare
needed, and resource allocation should be optimized, coordination with the private sector improved and
financial sources increasedand diversified.
The Study of Colombia's agricultural and rural competitiveness (World Bank, 2003) recommends as one
of the elements within a strategy to increase agricultural competitiveness inthe framework of a transition
towards a more open sector, an important increase in funding for agricultural research along with the
definition of mechanismsto establish regional agendas. Infact, the GOC is designing and implementing
the InternalAgenda as an initiative to strengthenboth the productive sector to face the challenges derived
from the opening of the markets and profit from the benefits generatedby this process. As far as the rural
sector i s concerned, this Agenda, currently under discussion with the private sector and the regions, has
given particular priority to investments in Science and Technology and agricultural health and food
safety. .
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Systems
Given the increasing globalization of markets over the last decade the country must be prepared to open
its economy to an exchange of agricultural products. Overcoming sanitary, phytosanitary, and food safety
barriers to national products (fruit, vegetables, and meat and milk products, for example) in end markets
 i s the key to facilitating market access. Strengthening the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
 System(SPS) i s a sine qua non requisite to achieving this goal.
The Free Trade Agreement (=A)              with the United States currently under negotiation presents an
opportunity for Colombia to increase trade access for its products. However, the impact of this higher
trade access could be reduced if non-tariff barriers, such as the application of sanitary and phytosanitary



                                                          5

measures, are not simultaneously overcome. Only strengthening the SPS system and firm-level quality
management can help ensure access to markets ruled by stringent standards.
The streamlining and full operation of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System
currently made up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the Colombian
Agricultural Institute (ICA), the Ministry of Social Welfare (MPS), the National Institute for Drug and
Food Surveillance (INVIMA), Territorial Health Agencies (ETS), the Ministry of Commerce, Industry
and Tourism (MCIT), the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (SIC) involves a comprehensive
operation along the various agri-food chains and calls for investments to be made in some areas already
identified within several System-attachedinstitutions.
The SPS systems has two main functions: one related to protection of domestic production which
expresses itself through its capacity to perform accurate diagnosis; and the other oriented to fulfilling
requirements to access international markets, which is based on its capacity to certify, authorize and
provide information regarding traceability. To properly execute these functions it i s necessary to have
clear rules reflected in the national public policy for food safety, its corresponding legal framework, the
procedures and instruments to put it in place, and private and public institutional settings duly financed,
with the appropriate infrastructure and skilled human resources and supportedby relevant R&D programs
which provideknowledge and innovationinterms of sanitary, phytosanitary and food safety issues.
A key component within the SPS systems is production, dissemination and access to strategic information
that allows responding adequately to sanitary emergencies, receiving and circulating information
regarding requirements to access international markets and keeping a fluent communication with end
users and consumers, among others.
The team made up by the Colombian Government to negotiate the SPS Chapter of the FTA with the
United States has conducted a Gap Analysis in which all System organizations have taken part, the
private sector included, with a view to identify the key issues on which strategic activities and
investments must be carried out to improve access to the United States market with specific chain
products. The outcomes of this exerciseare compiled on chain-based standardformats that were the basis
for the component to be financed in this operation and are part of the documentation for preparation of the
component.
Loan Objective
The objective of the Sector Investment Loan (SIL) i s to strengthen both national Agricultural Science and
Technology and the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Systems.
2. Rationalefor BankInvolvement
The lessons learned from the long-term involvement of the Bank in the rural sector of Colombia,
especially in decentralized projects, and the Bank's internationalexperience in implementing a diverse set
of rural development projects, give the Bank an advantage in the provision of higher value-added to the
Colombianprogram.
While there are other financiers, for example, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), and International Fund for Agricultural
Development (FAD) of rural development projects, the Bank i s the principal player in the rural sector of
Colombia.
The Bank has a long history of support to the rural sector in Colombia, and Bank-assisted projects have
managed to execute decentralized projects very effectively (for example, the Agriculture Technology
Development Project (Proyecto de Desarrollo Tecnolo'gico Agropecuario (Programa Nacional de
Transferencia de TecnologiaAgropecuaria) (PRONATTA); Support to Productive Partnerships (Apoyoa
alianzas productivas); Magdalena Medio I& 11; Zonas de Reserva Campesina and Earthquake




                                                      6

Recovery). This investment will buildupon the experiences of these projects, particularly on the lessons
learned from the previously funded agricultural project PRONATTA.
Moreover, in the past couple of years the Bank has led and completed sector studies on competitiveness
(Colombia - Agricultural and Rural Competitiveness - Report No. 27523), land (Land Policy in
Transition - Report No. 27942), and rural finance (Rural Finance - access issues, challenges, and
opportunities -Report No. 27269) inColombia.
Finally, the Bank has experience dealing with other institutions in Colombia's rural sector, and this
experience will be drawn uponto implement the activities that needto be carried out in this SIL.
3. Higher-Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes
The Bank's Colombia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) approved by the Board on January 16, 2003,
identified three priorities: (1) achieving rapid and sustainable growth; (2) ensuring that all Colombians
benefit from growth, particularly those living in poverty; and (3) building an efficient, accountable, and
transparent government administration. The proposed SIL will support the first CAS objective of GOC
and contribute to the second by improving the provision of scientific and technological goods and
services to rural producersof selectedproductionchains.
A Rural Diversification Loan for US$200m was proposed in the CAS (January 16, 2003). However,
during the preparation process, the GOC considered that the operation should be focused on the
adjustments needed in the transition to face the outcomes of the current FTA with the USA. The size of
the loan was also reducedto US$30m due to the limits imposedby the debt ceiling for the sector.
The GOC has indicated its support for a Sector Investment Loan (SIL) as a contribution to a transitional
strategy to orient the sector over the long term, where the Bank would be a strategic partner in this
transition. However, it is worth noting that this project would contribute partially to a more
comprehensive structural competitiveness strategy.        As mentioned in the Study on Agricultural
Competitiveness (World Bank, 2003) such strategy should consider investing in infrastructure,
strengthening land markets, improving competitiveness of campesino sector, developing entrepreneurial
skills in agricultural producers and emphasizing institutional decentralization, among others.
Therefore, the proposed SIL will contribute to increasing the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in
a context of a more opened economy by improving the performance of selectedproduction chains. This
S I L will focus on strengthening the Agricultural Science and Technology System to improve
competitiveness as well as improving access to markets by strengthening the National Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures System. There is a wide consensus in the Colombian government and the
agricultural sector for support of these priorities.

Project Development Objective (PDO) and Target Population
The project aims to strengthen the National Agricultural Science and Technology and Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Systems by supporting thejoint participation of both the public and private sectors, through
the mechanism of production chains, thereby contributing to the competitiveness of Colombian
agriculture and improvingthe accessibility of export-potential products to international markets.
This Project will have national coverage and benefit those agents linked to the production chains on
which public policy will focus the instruments financed through this operation. Specific provisions will
be adopted to make sure that small producers involved in those chains will not be excluded from the

benefits derived from the project, particularly by putting in place dissemination mechanisms that assure
their proper participation inthe relevant activities proposed (see Annex 10).

2.      Key Performance Indicators
The main project indicators are:
Component 1: Results will be evaluated usingthe following key performance indicators (see Annex 3
and the Operational Manual): (i) of R&D agendas developed and financed in a participatory and
                                    no.

3.      Project Components
Component1: Knowledge Generationand Znnovation (US $22.1 million)
The aim of this Component i s to support the provision of technology and innovation through the
strengthening of agricultural production chain actors in the definition, co- financing and implementation
of R&D, as well as the preparation of participatory and demand driven R&D agendas around certain
production chains and the implementation and co-financingof these agendas through a Competitive Fund.
To achieve this objective the component will finance: (i) development of R&D agendas for twenty
                                                              the
production chains, which will entail the carrying out of the prospective studies for these agendas as well
as the evaluation and strengthening of the capacity of chains to develop, co-finance and implement these
agendas;    (ii) operation of a Competitive Fundthat will co-finance productionchains' R&D
                the
subprojects which are consistent with the prospective agendas; (iii) buildingwithin the Ministry
                                                                      capacity
of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) to manage the allocation of public resources to the
agendas already defined and to the development and implementation of new production chains' R&D
agendas.
The activities to be financed in each of the chains will reflect its expressed demand and capacity to
implement and co-finance its own prospective R&D agenda. The result will be to optimize the allocation
of resources for technology and innovation, and through co-financing mechanisms to foster increased
private sector investment as well as increased participation of para-fiscal funds and territorial
governments to support scientific and technological innovation inthe agricultural sector.
Chain research agendas will be complemented with an agenda that, at the national level will deal with
cross-sectoral issues, to be jointly defined with the Agricultural Sector-related National Science and
Technology System actors, under the leadership of the MARD and the National Agricultural Science and
Technology Program Council (CPNCTA) attached to COLCIENCIAS, which will provide financial
support.
The resulting agendas will be the basis for the implementation of the Competitive Fund which will be
focused on those production chains prioritized by the GOC. Among the criteria used for allocating
resources to the various subprojects in the Competitive Fund will be projected economic and social


                                                       8

benefits, environmentalsustainability, complementarities with other ongoing initiatives, and the impact in
terms o f scientific and technological capacity building. The Operational Manual for the project will
specify indetail the implementation of the Fund.
Since research subprojects to be financed through this component will take up to three years to be carried
out, financing o f subprojects chosen through years 3 and 4 calls should be extended to years 5 and 6; that
is, they will go beyond the deadline set for implementation of this operation with World Bank loan
resources. Additionally, once the project finishes an evaluation study will be carried out and on this basis
the GOC will decide on the financing paradigm to be adopted in the allocation of public resources to
agricultural R&D in the future.


Component 2: Strengthening of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System (US $ 7.8
million)
The aim o f Component 2 is to strengthen the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System, enabling it to
respond to the sanitary standards o f international markets and thereby enhance the admissibility o f
agricultural products to these markets.
To achieve this objective the component will finance the following activities: (i)      training professionals
and technicians attached to the SPS systems; (ii)     capacity strengthening (i.e. training, development o f
procedures, equipment, infrastructure) to mitigate the chains-specific sanitary barriers to beef products;
(iii)capacity strengthening (i.e. training, development of procedures, equipment, infrastructure) to
mitigate the chains-specific sanitary barriers to fruits and vegetables; (iv) designing and implementing a
national SPS information network; (v) designing and implementing an authorization system allowing for
Audit and/or Test and Diagnosis Laboratory activities to be delegated to a third party; (vi) technology
transfer on best practices to improve the sanitary and phytosanitary conditions of agriculturalproduction.

To improve the impact of this project, needs identified in the SPS system were prioritized vis-i-vis
requirements of two production chains (beef, and uchuva-Physalis) showing a competitive potential
particularly in the US market and which would have a spill-over effect to other chains. The beef chain
was chosen within the livestock sector because its products are highly complex in sanitary terms, not only
because they face zoo-sanitary barriers but also other food safety-related barriers.            Although the
 investment plan may have been designed on the basis of overcoming barriers for a particular fruit
 (uchuva) [Physalispevuviana or Andean berry], its range covers the needs being faced by a large share of
 the fruit and vegetables chain to successfully access internationalmarkets.

 This component will have the following products: (i)    staff of institutions attachedto the SPS duly trained
 inthe different subcomponent areas; (ii) phase of the SPS nationalinformation network inoperation;
                                          first
 (iii)authorization system in operation; (iv) achievement of conditions required for international
 recognition of beef product admissibility; (v) fulfilment of conditions required for international
 recognition of fruit and vegetable specific product chain admissibility (uchuva);and (vi) officials and
 extensionists trained in Good Agricultural Practices (GAPS)and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs)
 techniques.

 The implementation o f this component will take advantage o f the achievements provided by other
 initiatives. Such is the case for the Support to Productive Partnership project, currently under operation,
 whose producer organizations will be targeted as potential beneficiaries o f technology transfer on Good
 Agricultural Practices.

Component3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US $2.1 million)
The aim of this component is to ensure proper project management and execution and will finance a
Project Coordination Unit which will be attached to the MARD's Technology Development and Sanitary
Protection Directorate (DDTPS) and be responsible for the general management of the project. A Project
Coordinator will be appointed who would be reporting to the DDTPS Director on matters related to
Project implementation. The PCU will be composed of a Project Coordinator, a Financial Specialist, a
Procurement Specialist, an M&E Specialist, two Knowledge and Innovation Specialists (one responsible
for coordinating Subcomponent 1 activities and other responsible for coordinating Subcomponent 2
activities of Component 1of the Project), a SPS Specialist and a Secretary. In addition, MARD will
assign at least two counterpart officers to work in close relationship with PCU's M&E and Financial
Specialists, as a mean to strengthen MARD's institutionalfiduciary capacity.
The PCU will be responsible of the general coordination o f the Project's implementation. T o carry out
this task, the PCU will have the following responsibilities among others:        (i)implementationand
monitoring of the Project at the national level; (ii)
                                                    to be the principal contact with the World Bank in
Project supervision; (iii) coordinate the monitoring and evaluation system and Project audit; (iv)
                           to
maintain the Project's Operational Manual up-to-date; (v) supervision of the Funds Administrator that
will be contracted for Project resource management; (vi) to consolidate and update the Project annual
operative plans; (vii) to periodically update the Procurement Plan; (viii) to consolidate physical and
financial progress reports to the Bank and other institutions; and (ix) to prepare credit disbursement
requirements and ensure on the time flow o f funds.
The MARD, through a public bidding, will hire a Funds Administrator for the Project funds
administration. The main responsibilities of this entity will be: (i)   to sign contracts and requests to
acquire goods and services, based on the terms o f reference (TOR), technical specifications and
requirements made by MARD through the PCU; (ii)       to make the payments of each one of the contracts
and acquisitions according to MARDrequest; (iii)   to carry out Project accountancy; (iv) to update Project
income and expenditures and (v) to prepare and submit on the time and format-based reports as requested
by PCU.
The Minister of Agriculture will appoint a Project Board of Directors to provide strategic guidance on
 Project implementation, and to ensure it conforms to national policies. The Board will be chaired by the
 Deputy Minister o f Agriculture and Rural Development. It will be composed o f the Deputy Director of
 the National Department o f Planning or its delegate; the Director of the Colombian Institute for the
 Development of Science and Technology (COLCIENCLAS); the Director of the ICA, the Chairman of the
 National Council of Agriculture Secretaries on behalf of the regions (CONSA); and four private sector
 representatives. For details see Annex 6.

4.       Lessons Learned and Reflectedinthe Project Design
The project design integrates several important elements based on Bank experience and lessons learned
from relatedprojects. These include:
The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of PRONATTA indicated several lessons from
agriculturalresearch andtechnology competitive Co-financing:
(a) a competitive Co-financing i s an effective way to leverage idle resources for the science and
technology sector; (b) competitively funded, demand-driven research must have a strategic vision and
objectives to avoid the risk of solving only short-term problems; equally, institutional change in the
agricultural science and technology sector i s a long-term process; (c) in the selection and approval of
projects, care must be taken that certain strategic areas are covered with a "critical mass" of subprojects,
otherwise the overall effect of the fund may be too dispersed to have a strategic impact; (d) funds must be
built on the principles of transparency, inclusion, quality, and efficiency, and these principles must be
implemented from the beginning, and maintained throughout the life of the project to maintain legitimacy
with both the financing agencies and the beneficiaries; (e) processes must be public, transparent, and
consistent throughout the life of the project, and are the only way of ensuring credibility; (f) resources
must be allocated to ensure adequate monitoring and evaluation, involving beneficiaries and other
stakeholders; (g) decentralization of implementation must always be accompanied by a strong component
of institutional development to facilitate the strengthening of capacity in the less competitive regions, in
order to ensure the quality of proposals; and (h) alliances among the different actors in the system allow
social and discipline interaction in the preparation, presentation, and implementation of projects, leading
to stronger and more demand-driven proposals.
Productive Partnerships Support Project i s another World Bank-funded project whose outcomes have
beentaken into account to design this operation. It has contributed to consolidate productionchain policy
with a particular emphasis being put on linking small growers with markets by means of alliances being
entered into by these growers with traders, input suppliers, entrepreneurs, etc. The government plays a
facilitating role in these alliances by reducing negotiation capacity asymmetries and fostering agreements
that are beneficial to all parties involved. Lessons are derived from the Productive Alliance Project to
carry out this work: (i)  the incorporation of small growers into production chains through a dialogue and



                                                     11

an agreement with other actors, adds to their involvement in other initiatives, such as those envisaged
through demand capture andthe construction of prospective agendas eventually, and (ii)     the strengthening
of links with regional institutions so as to increase their involvement in activities envisaged by the new
project. This project will take advantage of current networking of small producer organizations as
implementedby the Productive Partnership Project. This arrangement will provide a suitable platform to
disseminate the proposed project's objectives, components and activities, and facilitate the proper
participation of these organizations in the investments proposed that are relevant to their interests.
Additionally, institutional arrangements, that both the Productive Partnerships Project and PRONATTA
have developed, have beentaken into account inthe preparatory phase inan effort to getting the most out
of the involvement of MARD directorate offices, and to ensure both the latter's appropriation by the
Government and the sustainability of project's activities and relevance when the project finishes.
As mentioned, this project will be executed using the production chain as a key institutional setting to
focus all the activities and investments. This decision capitalizes on the lessons learned through more
than a decade of experienceinwhich the GOC has privilegedthis setting as a means to strengthenpublic
policy making by improving dialogue with the private sector and the regions, priority setting throughout
the chain, and therefore, public resourceallocation (see Annex 6).
Regarding SPS, several lessons have been obtained from past experiences. During more than fifteen
years ICA has been working on eradication of foot and mouth disease (FMD) with the close cooperation
from the USDA and the private sector and following the regionalization scheme proposed by the WTO-
SPS agreement. In this process, ICA has built capacities to issue regulations and procedures required to
support technical activities such as permanent vigilance, monitoring and diagnosis of the livestock. As
result, some regions in the country have been declared as free FMD zones by the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE).
Four years ago, and with the support of USAID-APHIS, the Centro de Excelencia Fitosanitario was
created to perform the Pest Risk Analyses PRA, which allow the access of fruits to the US market. As of
today, PRAs have been carried out for fourteen agricultural products. Inaddition, ICA and USAID are
currently working on the implementation of the CMIP-Centro de Mitigacidn de Plagas, which will
contributeto complete the admissibility protocols of Colombian fruits to the US market.

5.       Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection
The project design i s based on an intense internal discussion within Colombia (see Annex 12 for the list
of various studies conducted during project preparation) and lessons learned from Bank-financed projects
andother donor-financed, andon various studies2produced over the pastfew years.
Short-term versus long-term interventions in the agricultural sector were weighed during the preparation
of the project. Initially, a proposal for a long-term program (Adaptable program loan - APL) to support
the transition to a more competitive sector was considered by the GOC as a means to support incremental
but consistent efforts to strengthen sectoral and rural institutions. This initial proposal included four
technical components to be implemented in two phases over a period of six years. However, during the
preparation process, the GOC considered that key results could be obtained more rapidly, if the operation
focused on those strategic components needed to face the outcomes of the current FTA negotiations. In
consequence, it was decided to design a SIL, with two technical components to be carried out over a
period of four years.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1.       InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) will be the agency responsible for project
implementation. The MARDhas broad experience with Bank-financed projects. It currently implements
the Productive Partnerships Support Project Apoyo a Alianzas Productivas (BIRF 7097-CO).                 The
previously implemented projects are PRONATTA (BIW 3871-CO) closed in December 2003 and the
Peasant Enterprise Zone Development Project -Zonas de Resewas Campesinas (BIRF 4367-CO) closed
in December 2003. The MARD also has experience in implementing projects financed by other
international donors such as IFAD(Pademer) and IADB.

Project Oversight. The Minister of Agriculture will appoint a Project Board of Directors to provide
strategic guidance on Project implementation, and to ensure it conforms to national policies. The Board
will be chaired by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. It will be composed of the
Deputy Director of the National Department of Planning or its delegate; the Director of the Colombian
Institute for the Development of Science and Technology (COLCIENCIAS); the Director of the ICA; the
Chairman of the National Council of Agriculture Secretaries on behalf of the regions (CONSA); and 4
private sector representatives. This Board will be responsible for ensuring the coherence between Project
activities and public policy, as well as obtaining the appropriate support from the institutions of the
National S&T and SPS Systems. It will approve the Project's Annual Operational Plans and review the
Project's progress Implementation Reports prepared by the PCU as well as approving the portfolio of
subprojects selected and presentedto it, by the Peer Review Panel. The Board should meet at least twice
a year with the option of meeting when deemednecessary by the PCU coordinator. The PCU coordinator
will be the technical secretary of the Board.
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU). A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be created with the
responsibility of implementing the Agricultural Transition Project. This Unit will report directly to the
Director of Technological Development and Sanitary Protection Directorate(DDTPS) within the MARD;
in turn, the Director of DDTPS would report directly to the Vice Minister of Agriculture. A Project
Coordinator will be appointed who would be reporting to the DDTPS Director on matters related to
Project implementation.     The Project Coordinator will be supported by six staff (see PCU's staff
composition below).
The PCU will be structured as a technological-administrative unit closely linked with the three technical
groups within the MARD's DDTPS (the Technological Development Group, the Sanitary Protection
Group, and the Genetic Resources, Biosafety and Intellectual Property Group). The participation of
technical groups and or professionals from MARD's Directorates will be facilitated by the Project's
Operational Committee.
Staff Compositionofthe PCU. As mentioned above the PCUwill be composed of a Project Coordinator,
a Financial Specialist, a Procurement Specialist, an M&E Specialist, two Knowledge and Innovation
Specialists (one responsible for coordinating Subcomponent 1 activities and other responsible for
coordinating Subcomponent 2 activities of Component 1of the Project), a SPS Specialist and a Secretary.
Inaddition, MARD will assign at least two counterpart officers to work in close relationship with PCU's
M&Eand Financial Specialists, as a mean to strengthenMARD's institutionalfiduciary capacity. These
officers would be also part of the team responsible for closing of the activities of the Project at the end of
the operation period, thus contributing to assure continuity within the MARD. Staff from the MARD or
ICA could be engagedas a member of the PCU only when selected on a competitive basis, and fulfilling
the requirements established for the corresponding position as stated in the Operational Manual (OM),
and with the previous no-objection from the Bank. In addition, these professionals must be assigned on a
full-time basis to the activities of the PCU, and as a result, he or she will report directly to the PCU
Coordinator.


                                                    13

Responsibilities of the PCU. The PCU will be responsible of the general coordination of the Project's
implementation, coordinating the activities of all the entities involved inthe execution of the Project both
inside and outside the MARD. To carry out this task, the PCU will have the following responsibilities
among others: (i)    implementation and monitoring of the Project at the national level; (ii)to be the
principal contact with the World Bank in Project supervision; (iii)       to coordinate the monitoring and
evaluation system and Project audit; (iv) maintain the Project's Operational Manual up-to-date; (v)
supervision of the Funds Administrator that will be contracted for Project resource management; (vi) to
consolidate and update the Project annual operative plans; (vii) to periodically update the Procurement
Plan; (viii) to consolidate physical and financial progress reports to the Bank and other institutions; and
(ix) to prepare credit disbursementrequirements and ensure on the time flow of funds.
The MARD, through a public bidding, will hire a Funds Administrator for the Project funds
administration. The main responsibilities of this entity will be: (i)to sign contracts and requests to
acquire goods and services, based on the terms of reference (TOR), technical specifications and
requirements made by MARD through the PCU; (ii)        to make the payments of each one of the contracts
and acquisitions according to MARD request; (iii)   to carry out Project accountancy; (iv) to update Project
income and expenditures and (v) to prepare and submit on the time and format-based reports as requested
by PCU.
Project Operational Committee. Currently, a Technical Directorates Committee, chaired by the Deputy
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and with the participation of all MARD's Technical
Directorates operates through weekly meetings. The Project will make use of this Committee of
Directorates converting one of its weekly sessions, in a monthly session of what i s called the Project's
Operational Committee. In this session, the PCU Coordinator will act as the technical secretariat of the
Operative Committee, will propose the meeting agenda and, when deemed necessary, will suggest the
participationof other external agencies involved inthe implementationof Project.
Expert Panel (Peer Reviewers). The Expert Panel will review and evaluate subproject proposals for the
Competitive Fund, and recommend through the MARD selected proposals for financing to the Board of
Directors. Taking advantage of valuable lessons learned from PRONATTA, these panels will include at
least two experts on Safeguards as related to the sections in Annex 10. The essential safeguard experts
would be an environmental expert and a social expert, who will review the overall projects' potential
environmental and social risks and also the specific selection criteria for the screening of subproject
proposals, selection of subprojects and risk mitigation of each selected subproject. Evaluations and
recommendations from these experts will be considered in defining the terms for contracts signed
between the MARD and the subprojects' executors and will also be taken into account as an indicator to
perform monitoring and evaluation that will be implemented by the PCU.

OperationalManual. Administrative proceduresto be followed for project implementationpurposeswill
be defined in the Operation Manual (OM), to be deemed as the working document guiding the project
implementing activities. This Manual will be adopted by the MARD and provide detailed information
regarding PCU and Funds Administrator functions, TORSfor PCU, subprojects eligibility criteria for
Component 1 Competitive Co-financing, financial and administrative procedures, auditing, procurement
procedures, monitoring and evaluation activities, as well as the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and the
Pest Management Framework (PMF).           This Manual will also contain a summary of the objective,
activities and costs of the components and illustrate the administrative structure, the roles and functions of
the Boardof Directors andthe FundsAdministrator.
2.       Accountingand FinancialManagementSystem.

The financial management assessment concluded that MARD lacks sufficient capacity to manage project
financial matters and administer loan funds due to insufficient financial staff, duplication resulting from
manual systems for operational processes, and weak accounting software, an Administrative and


                                                      14

Financial Officer needs to be hired as member of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).              Hidher
responsibilities will include the coordination of financial and administrative issues related to project
budgeting and general accounting with MARD, project payments, project accounting and financial
reporting to MARD and the Bank with support of a Funds Administrator that will be contracted for
accounting and payments. As part of the FM assessment, the Bank will review the accounting and
information systems to be used for the project by the Funds Administrator before it is finally accepted.
For consolidation of general project financial information with MARD the systems will be the ones
already implemented inMARD.

Auditing arrangements. The financial audit for the project expenditures will be carriedout in accordance
with Terms of Reference prepared according to the audit policy of the Bank effective July 1, 2003. The
Terms of Reference and the appointment of the auditors are a responsibility of MARD. It i s required for
the project that a separatefinancial audit report be submitted for every year of project implementation.

Disbursement arrangements. While it is contemplated that disbursements will be made on the basis
of the traditional transaction-based mechanism, given the nature of this project and that the bulk of
disbursements for the subprojects (which represents approximately 70% of total project) are processedin
trunches in accordance with the financing agreements with beneficiaries resulting from the competitive
funds, and to facilitate alignment of the project request for disbursements with the financial reports and
allocated budget, the Bank team deems appropriate to evaluate in the near future the possibility of
transitioningthis project from traditional disbursementsto report-baseddisbursements.
Irrespective of the disbursement mechanism to be implemented for this project and to facilitate project
implementation, the project will have access to funds advancedby the Bank to a Special Account in US
dollars for processing disbursements for eligible expenditures under project activities. Funds deposited
into the Special Account as advances (depending on the disbursement mechanism) will follow the Bank's
disbursement operating policies and procedures established for each mechanism as described inthe Loan
Agreement and inthe disbursementLetter as the case may be.
The Bank would disburse the proceeds of the loan into a Special Account opened in US dollars by the
National Treasury and Credit in the Central Bank in the name of the project. The Director of DDTPS
within MARD will then requestto the National Treasury and Credit to convert the necessaryamounts into
Colombian pesos and transfer them to the selectedFunds Administrator for payments of project activities
and contracts.


3.       Monitoringand Evaluation of Outcomes/Results
The M&E system housed within the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) will be under the direct
responsibility of the Head, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of PCU, who will ensure follow-up of both
compliance with component goals and budgetary performance. The initial key performance indicators
have been established for the project and its components. Indicators for the PDO and each of the
components of the project are presented in the Results Framework of the Annex 3. The system for
determining the project baselines and the performance against indicators was designed using a more-
detailed logical framework approach that was combined to produce the results framework. The overall
M&E system will include: (a) PCUbased internal planning and monitoring and evaluation activities as
well as (b) outsourced reviews and impact assessmentsthat were built into the project design.
The M&Esystemlays the foundation for the PCU team to collect, organize, and provide information duly
articulated with the needs of all Project-linked actors and instances. The M&E system described in the
Annex 3 i s basedon: (a) establishing the baseline for each component usingpre- and non-project survey
information; and (b) During the life of the project and dependent upon the monitoring and evaluation




                                                      15

requirements, the team will gather information using surveys and mid-project impact assessments linked
to:
  (i)the type of activities being implemented (number of activities, type of activities (backup or
  operational), activities under way, activities pending, as well as expected impact of these activities on:
  product and service quality control, etc., developed by the various components and adding value to the
  work carried out by them; and
  (ii)Instruments being developed that will facilitate increasing productivity of the different activities in
  each component, and drawing of project lessons from the application and analysis of these instruments.
With these two information inputs as the starting point, the Monitoring & Evaluation System (M&E) will
be used to follow up changes in the Project status and make relevant adjustments as and when these are
required. It will also be used to evaluate the impact of project interventions at subprojectlactivity level
during and after completion of the activitieshbprojects. The M&E system will also include an end of
project impact analysis.
The M&E system i s developed to ensure quick tracking of activities and i s embedded in the internal
monitoring process. The different elements of the system are: (i)         Software to handle both timely
information and project component-based integrated information; (ii)Financial issues (budget,
accounting, and payments).       The basic financial information will be derived from the financial
information system of the Fund Administrator; (iii)    Manpower-related (contracts and consultant TOR);
and (iv) Financial and technical reports as required. The details of the system and the corresponding
implementation plan will be described inthe Operational manual (OM).


The Budget for the field-based monitoring and evaluation activities of this project will be 1 percent (1%)
of all resources assigned to the Competitive Fund. To realize the field evaluation, PCU will contract
external evaluators.
The project will also prepare progress reports each semester for submission to the Bank as well as
carrying out an ExternalMid-Term and Endof Project Reviews.
4.       Sustainability
To address requirements and challenges posed by trade agreements, the GOC has initiated the so-called
Internal Agenda which i s a broad based strategy to strengthen productive sectors, regions and the public
sector. Priorities of this Agenda have been identified on the basis of work performedunder public sector
guidance, with involvement of both regions and the private sector. The proposed project is part of the
agriculturalsector InternalAgenda.
Activities to strengthen the SPS component are included in the strategy defined by the Free Trade
Agreement negotiating team. The institutional arrangements to implement this project will ensure the
close involvement of the MARD's Technological Development and Sanitary Protection Directorship,
allowing it to be appropriated by this Directorate. Moreover, the proposed project supports the sector
strategy for the competitive allocation of resource in the S&T subsector which i s already under
implementation. To ensure sustainability of the project work and its innovative elements, the capacity
will be created within the MARD for the continued implementationof a public agricultural R&D agenda
and co-financed with the private sector.
Bearing in mind that research subprojects to be financed through this component will take up to three
years to be carried out, implementation of subprojects chosen through years 3 and 4 calls to be financed
should be extended to years 5 and 6, i.e., they will go beyond the deadline set for implementation of this
operation with World Bank loan resources. Additionally, once the project finishes an evaluation study
will be carried out and on this basis the GOC will decide on the financing paradigmto be adopted in the
allocationof public resourcesto agricultural R&D inthe future.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.       Economic and FinancialAnalyses
Public resources allocation to generate public goods in agriculture will result in important social profits.
The investment of these resources in R&D will generate internal rates of return IRR for the society in the
range of 23 to 140 percent depending on the type of project and the conditions in which these resources
are applied. These results are in line with international evidence on this field3. Profits for private
agricultural projects also improve substantially, since in many cases the margin on direct costs is
duplicated.   Government's fiscal situation does not change because of both, low relative level of
investment, 30 million dollars in 4 years, and the low level of taxation of the agriculture, as reflected on
the National Accounts of Colombia.
Internal rates of return IRR estimatesfor public investmentin R&D and SPSprojects
The economic evaluation estimated economic returns derived from investments on R&D and technology
transfer in agriculture. This evaluation focused on the following 7 production chains: corn, cocoa, rubber,
sugar cane (panela), plantain, meat and tropical export fruits (uchuva). It was carried out usingthe model
DREAM, which allows measuring economic returns or IRR and the changes in producer, consumer and
government's surplusesgeneratedthrough the investment of public resources inR&D inagriculture.
Table 3 summarizes the main results of the analysis. In all the cases there i s an increase in productivity
resulted from the project. Inthe case of meat (beef) and uchuva, the assumption i s that productivity rise i s
the result of adopting sanitary standardsto comply with international markets.

IRR also varies significantly depending on producers' level of adoption of the new technologies.
One of the most critical parametersin the economic evaluation is the level of adoption of results of R&D
and SPS projects. This parameter i s rather important given the structural conditions of Colombian
agriculture, characterized by its environmental diversity and its social organization in which small
exploitations are common. The economic analysis illustrates the high sensibility of IRR to different levels
of adoption.
Fiscal impact of the project is measuredby the contributions to central and local governments as a result
of the increase of agricultural production promotedby the project. Another contribution i s derived from
the increase ofparafiscales payments.
If an annual increase in the value of production between 3 and 6 percent is induced by the project, it
would be equivalent to an increasebetween 400 and 800 million dollars, which would constitute the base
for new fiscal contributions.
However, and given the low contribution of agriculture to Colombian treasury, a marginal fiscal impact i s
expected. In fact, according to the National Department of Statistics (DANE) (Matriz de Utilizacidn de
Productos 2002), agricultural contribution by indirect taxes i s only 600 pesos for each million of gross
agricultural production value. Contribution by direct taxes i s also marginal; according to the same source,
gross agricultural surplus is barely a trillion pesos, equivalent to 4 percent of its aggregate value. And
DANE'Sestimatesthat the effectiverate of contribution on this surplusis also very low.
Since overall project investment (30 million dollars in four (4) years, or 7.5 million dollars per year)
equals 7.5 percent of MARD's annual budget, and given the low contributions from agricultural sector to
national treasury, fiscal impact is expected to be marginal.
2.        Technical
Project implementation will make use of the production chain as the institutional platform which will
permit it to respond to the demands of all the actors interrelated in specific productive contexts, and
generating benefits to the chain as a whole.
For instance, R&D agendas defined in a participatory manner within the production chains, not only will
be a key inputto reach cooperation agreements among different chain participants but will also contribute
to determining other agendas at both the regional and national levels. For this reason the activities of
Component 1 include the strengthening of production chain capacities to identify their own



                                                     19

competitiveness-related priorities, to provide incentives for co financing of R&D initiatives, and to secure
long-term financing required for these types of activities.

Likewise in order to strengthen the National Sanitary andPhytosanitary Measures Systemthe project will
work within the production chain framework. Bearing in mindresource constraints, the focus to be given
to the use of Project resources i s the admissibility to international markets of some products or specific
chains that will have a "spill-over" effect inother chains.
Inconsequence, this chain approach will constitute one of the most important institutionalinnovations
promotedby this project to the strengthening of the sector competitiveness inColombia.

While there have been no in-depth impact studies of the chain policy, there i s general consensus among
participants that it has improved coordination among different government agencies and between
government and the private sector, improved monitoring of public policy, and reduced distortions created
by individual negotiation by isolated sectors with the government. Businesses have benefited from the
sharing of information, which has allowed them to understand the competitiveness of various industries
and regions, encouraging productivity impr~vement.~
In line with this approach the Knowledge Generation and Innovation Component will advance the
integration and competitive development of production chains, and ensure that the country's scientific,
technological, and innovation capacity supports the environmental sustainability of the production base,
as well raising the competitiveness of the various agricultural production chains, in order for goods
produced to meet standards requiredby internationalmarkets. Inthis way, the knowledge and innovation
component will underpin the transformation process of the agricultural productive structure seeking to
develop competitiveadvantages.
The establishment of a Competitive Fund to foster increased demand as well as harnessing the scientific
and technological capacity available in the country will be the main mechanism used to implement this
policy.   In this sense, the financing instrument should create capacities resulting in the systematic
generation and adjustment of a priority agenda to address challenges for the sector's competitiveness in
terms of knowledge generation and innovation.           The Competitive Fund will also help to ensure
sustainability of investments likely to be made in the sector, by leveraging resources from territorial
sources, para-fiscal funds, and other public and private co-financing sources.
The PRONATTA experience shows that the competitive allocation of resources through a demand-driven
fund is feasible in the Colombian context, as evidenced by the amount and quality of subprojects that
were financed in that project. An open and transparent competitive fund breaks up supply monopolies in
the provision of public goods to the extent that they allow for civil society organizations to get involved.
New suppliers will have an opportunity to putforward their ideas and initiatives to tackle problems and/or
take advantage of opportunities in particular areas.
Moreover, these instruments increasethe effectiveness of researchby allocating resources to subprojects
on the basis of quality criteria and accountability, reducing costs through competition, increasing
flexibility, and encouraging greater diversification of financing resources and institutional change within
the innovation system, becausethey separate researchpolicy from finan~ing.~

Overcoming animal health, phytosanitary, and food safety barriers to national products (fruit, vegetables
and meat products, for example) inend markets i s the key to facilitating market access. Strengthening the
National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System (SPS) is a sine qua non requisite to achieving this
goal. Only to the extent that these barriers can be overcome will Colombia gain access to broader

markets, with all that implies for the future of the country, and for the possibilities of improvingthe living
standards of people living in the rural areas.

In order to allow for the System to comprehensively work along the various agri-food chains, the
modernization and full operation of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System calls for
investments to be made in various areas. Due to resource constraints, emphasis i s placed on supporting
selected production chains showing a competitive potential and where the activities financed will have a
"spillover" effect in other chains. Thus, the focus to be given to the use of these resources i s the
admissibility to international marketsof some products or specific chains.

Beef was chosen as a highly complex product with regard to sanitary issues, because it faces sanitary
barriers as well as other food safety-related barriers. In addition to its sanitary complexity, beef was
selected because of the importance of the cattle subsector in the agricultural setting, and the high
socioeconomic impact likely to be derived from the entry of this product into international markets.

Uchuva (Physalis peruviana) was chosen as a product representing the fruit and vegetables sub-sector in
which the country has comparative advantagesand the development of which i s currently facing sanitary
and phytosanitary constraints. The proposed investments covers the needs being faced by a large portion
of the fruit and vegetables produce chain to successfully access international markets.


3.       Fiduciary
Financial management


A Financial Management Assessment (FMA) of MARD was carried out during preappraisal and
conducted in accordance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Guidelines for the Assessment of Financial
Management Arrangements inthe World Bank Financed Projects. The assessment concluded that MARD
lacks sufficient capacity to manageproject financial matters and administer loan funds due to insufficient
financial staff, duplicity resulted from manual systems for operational processes, and weak accounting
software. Therefore, it is recommended that an Administrative and Financial officer be hired to support
the project coordinating group, and that hisher responsibilities will include the coordination of financial
and administrative issues related to project budgeting and general accounting with MARD, project
payments, project accounting and financial reporting to MARD and the Bank with support of a Funds
Administrator that will be contracted for accounting and payments. The FM risk in this project i s
considered to be moderate.            During appraisal, terms of reference for the hiring of the
administrative/financial offer; project account audits and the Funds Administrator were reviewed and
found acceptable. The draft operational manual was also reviewed.

Procurement
According to the recent update of the CPAR, it has been determined that the possibilities of usingcurrent
national systems in World Bank and IDB lending operations in Colombia are very limited, thus not
applicable to this project.
A Procurement Capacity Assessment of the implementation agency responsible for procurement was
carried out by Mr.Jose M.Martinez, Procurement Specialist duringpreappraisal in November 2004. The
assessment concluded that MARD lacks sufficient capacity to implement procurement actions. The
project risk i s considered high. In order to mitigate the risk, the following recommendations are made:
(i) procurement training must be provided to the staff expected to be involved in procurement of civil
works, goods and services before the project starts, thus reducing the risk of failure in procurement-
related activities; (ii)in order to facilitate a better understanding of procurement operations, an


                                                       21

Operational Manual with a procurement chapter must be prepared by MARD and reviewed and cleared
by the Bank; and (E)a procurement consultant with experience in Bank-funded procurement must be
hired as part of the PCUcore staff.

Duringappraisal the procurement planfor the first 18months of the project was reviewedandapproved.
The draft operational manual, particularly the procurement chapter, was reviewedand found acceptable.
The TORSfor the hiringfor the procurement officer and the FundsAdministrator were also reviewedand
commented.


4.       Social
Poverty indicators inthe rural setting in Colombia are rather critical. Nearly 83 percent of the 12 million
people living in the rural area are under the poverty line while 43 percent of them are living in extreme
poverty. Agriculture continues to be the main economic activity notwithstanding the share of non-
agricultural activities that is increasing the income generation sources of rural families. Violence and its
links with drug-trafficking, and the subsequent internaldisplacement of nearly 300,000 families over the
last few years in the country have had a significant bearing on the determinants of rural area poverty
(World Bank 2003).
InColombia's agricultural sector is characterized by a deep divergence between the traditional small
producer sector and the modern entrepreneurial sector, where poverty continues to be prevalent among
the small producers. Therefore special attention i s required to alleviate rural poverty by improving the
competitiveness of this smallproducers subsector.
Bearingin mindthat implementation of these two project components i s basedon the chain approach, the
wide range of grower associations (Gremios) involved in the chain i s obvious. The majority of Gremios
are associated with the 20 selected organizations of production chains at the national level and 76
organizations of the chains at the regional level. An estimation of IICA in 2005 i s that 120 organizations
and Gremios representing an estimated 80,000 small producers (excluding the cafeteros - coffee
producers) are representedin these chains. Among the 523,000 coffee producers about 73% have a farm
size of less than 5.0 hectares. Inaddition about 70% of the total number of producers i s representedby its
federation (Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros). Strong organizations exist in Colombia regarding access
to productive factors and a capacity for dialogue with policymakers and agencies in charge of policy
implementation, able to take increasing advantage of both chain-oriented activities and the likely benefits
this Project could eventually accrue. Moreover, a second set of organisations are also present in the
country who are highly vulnerable because of the weak or nonexistent organizational representation and
their rather scanty ability to access markets and scientific and technological developments in particular,
and to whom benefits are accrued in a more uncertain way. Often the indigenous populations and gender
groups fall into the latter category.
The SDF within the Project Design
The key objective of the Small producers Development Framework (SDF) proposed here i s to include
small producers in an integral development strategy of the country intending to unify export sector with
the competitiveness strategy. The proposed SDF may contain aspects to improve access to project
benefits. The aim of SDF i s to: (a) ensure that the small producers are not excluded from the benefits
derived from this project implementation and to actively look for opportunities for small producers to
benefit  from this investment; (b) design dissemination strategies to formulate prospective agendas
(subcomponent 1.1) that include small producers in the chain; (c) take into account the social
vulnerability of small producers in the prospective agendas; and (d) to include training activities within
the competitive fund for innovation and improved accessibility to the competitive fund of beef and
uchuva production chains. The details of the SDF are given in Annex 10.3.

5.       Environment
As indicatedby the "Analysis of the Agricultural Sector and the Environment" (Lebn andEspinosa 2004)
performed as a part of the project preparation, agricultural activities are currently entailing potentially
high risks to the environmental sustainability in Colombia. A study, performed by IGAC - ICA -
CORPOICA in 2002 and quoted by Lebn, showed that 32.7 percent of the transformed land in Colombia
i s being overexploited in terms of its natural resource use (68 percent of them to a severe and moderate
degree) while 29.7 percent i s being under-exploited. Natural resource overexploitation phenomena are
usually associated with the development of agricultural activities in sensitive ecosystems such as the
rainforest and mountain areas, natural forests, and wetlands.                 The overexploitation impacts of
environmental resourcesinclude soil erosion, desertification and soil compaction, as well as pollution and
salinization, both of soils and water resources.
An additional diagnostic component of the above mentioned environmental analysis (Lebn and Espinosa
2004) refers to the use of pesticides in the agricultural sector. The entire marketing process (registration,
sale, distribution, and use) involving pesticides in Colombia showed an upward trend that included the
use of fungicides and herbicides in particular. Notwithstanding the efforts being made by the health
authorities and the existing legislative framework of the country it was also observed that the use of
forbidden pesticides or high-toxicity pesticides in agriculture still exists. Therefore a pest management
framework was developed to address such issues and i s presentedbelow as the Annex 10.2.
An Environmental Action Plan (EAP) will be implemented to avoid potential adverse effects that would
play an important role in the agricultural transition process. The specific objectives of the EAP over and
above the PDO i s to: (a) incorporate environmental aspects in all relevant activities and technologies
proposed and financed by the project; (b) evaluate the potential effects on the environment during the
mid-term and final evaluation of subproject implementation; and (c) conduct post-project impact analysis
to delineate lessonsfrom this project.
The outcome of this project will be to contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally
safe technologies in a defined research agenda or in selected production chains in Colombia and to this
end, the actions proposed in the EAP are given in Annex 10.1. Among the action envisaged in this plan
are: (i) environmental expertise in the Peer Review Panel for subprojects; (ii)    environmental checklist for
subproject approval; (iii)      promotion of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPS);(iv) Mid-Term review of
subproject for environmental compliance; and (v) dissemination of environmental awareness in the
context of the project.
Inaddition, the twotechnicalcomponentsofthis project would includeecologicallysoundintegratedpest
management(IPM) strategies including best practices for the use of recommended pesticides. In addition
the project approach includes terms of developing the export capacity where there are certain specific
requirements within the trade agreement that i s beingnegotiated and the existing local legislature (such as
the environmental analysis, human health in terms of toxicology, and better agronomy).                   Most
importantly, the legislative framework of Colombia i s strong in terms of health aspects, environment, and
inrelation to trade. This framework includes multilateral agreements (COPS - Contaminantesorgknicos
persistentes; Convenio de Rotterdam), supra-national agreements (Decisidn Andina 436 - Registro de
plaguicidas), and other national legislation (decrees other than the above-mentioned agreements). The
project would also encourage the use of integrated pest management strategies and best agricultural
practices where possible.
The project environmental analysis prepared by the preparation team and safeguard evaluation done by
the Bank also identified the potential to trigger the Bank's Pest management policy6. The project
therefore would use both the national legislative framework and the World Bank listings and procedures
on "Integrated Pest Management" (IPM) including IPM components (biological control, cultural


  Pests include insect pests, diseases, nematodes and other vertebrate pests.

practices, and development of pest resistant or tolerant varieties). For the details of the Pest Management
Framework see Annex 10.2.

Two safeguard policies are deemed to be triggered by the project: OP/BP/GP 4.01 and OP4.09. The
Environmental Assessment (EA) also identified the need for an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) and a
Pest Management Framework (PMF). The Environmental Action Plan (EAP) prepared for this project
includes various environmental mitigation practices as well as oversight of the subprojects to be financed
through the Competitive Fund in the Component 1.2. The Pest Management Framework reflects the
strategy for safe pesticide use in the two technical components. The details of the Pest Management
Framework finalized at appraisal are given in Annex 10.2.                    The Small producers Development
Framework (SDF) reflects the social aspects raised by the social assessment of the project and this
strategy i s developed to give due diligence and informed watchfulness by having a contingency plan in
the unlikely event of negative impacts of the project activities. The details of EAP and PMF, with their
implementation details are given in the Annex 10 and are included in the Project Operational Manual
(OM). There is also a Small producers Development Framework included.

Introduction
The Colombian agricultural and agro-entrepreneurial sector, which accounts for 21percent of aggregate
GDP, 25 percent of export revenues, and 30 percent of job creation in the country, where more than 4.5
million people have a job, continues to play a vital role in the national economy. However, when
compared with countries at a similar level of development, the sector's competitiveness still ranks below
internationalpatterns, a fact not inkeeping with both the comparative advantages7the country has, and its
potential for development.
Colombian agricultural activities are carried out in a rural setting where high poverty levels, unequal
income distribution, illiteracy, violence, and highland ownership concentration prevail.
More than 82 percent of the 12 million people composing Colombia's rural population live below the
poverty line-seriously         above the poverty levels recorded 15 years ago. While the per capita income of
the rural population is 2.5 times lower than that of urban dwellers, their access to basic services is
significantly lower: 61 percent of rural households has access to an aqueduct, 37 percent has access to
sewer systems, and only 15 percent has access to telephone services. Child malnutrition i s around 19
percent, and average schooling i s 4.6 years-four             years less than inurban areas.
To some extent, an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 11.5 percent in 2002-high                                  above
levels recorded 10 years ago-accounts              for rural poverty. Rural unemployment has been associatedwith
a reduction over the last 10 years in cultivated land, triggering a decrease in work opportunities, and
driving rural people to migrate to the cities. The forced displacement of the rural population has also
been promptedby violence inthe ruralareas, which has had a negative impact on the investment climate
and, thus, on the creation of productivejobs.
Less than 4 million hectares of the 21.5 million hectares available for agricultural activities in the country
are used for that purpose. According to a 2001 IGAC-CORPOICA study on land property, 61.2 percent
of the 47,147,680 hectares of rural real estate area registered in the country was held by 0.4 percent of
landowners, creating estates of, on average, more than 500 hectares each. By contrast, 24.2 percent of the
18,646,473 hectares of rural real estate area was held by 97 percent of owners registered with the Land
Registry, creating plots, on average, of less than 3 hectares each. According to estimates, while only less
than 50 percent of the 2.5 million families living inrural areas are small landowners, a large percentageof
households are landless.
Like many countries in Latin America Colombia historically pursued economic policies that favoured
import substitution and regulated the domestic market. A significant part of agricultural trade was
controlled by the State. In 1990 Colombia policymakers took the decision to break with that tradition and
deregulate domestic markets and liberalize international trade for all sectors of the economy. For
agriculture this meant reducing crop support prices by replacing them with lower "floor" prices based on
international quotations, eliminating the State monopoly in agricultural marketing and changing financial
sector policies to encourage private banks to lend to farmers and for agricultural imports. The amounts of
government purchasesof crops were reduced substantially and finally eliminatedin 1996.*



'These   comparativeadvantagesinclude ahigh diversity of vegetable cover, climate, and types of soil. Le6n (2003) also mentions
the country's geographical location in the tropics, and its high biodiversity and biophysical expressions found in the various
regions, each providing as huge potentialities (and constraints, as well) as biodiversity reserves to carry out forestry or fishery
activities, to grow multiple strata-type crops in agro-forestry arrangements, to regulate hydrological flows (moors), mechanized
agriculture, and so forth.

Import quotas and licenses were practically eliminated in the early 1990s, and all tariffs were to be
reduced gradually, although at a slower pace in agriculture. Price bands were instituted for a number of
crops declared to be sensitive, in order to smooth international price fluctuations before they were
transmitted to the domestic market, and then the system was extended to additional agricultural
commodities. It i s a regional system shared with Ecuador and Venezuela. Inaddition to the price bands,
inNovember 1994(through Decree 2439) the government reintroduced a requirement that the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development approve imports, in this case for 68 agricultural products, and for
each product approval was made conditional on the domestic agro industry absorbing the country's own
production. In2003 (Decree 047), the number of commodities covered by this mechanism was reduced to
35, to comply with the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispositions (World Bank2003)
Despite the setbacks to the initiative to a more open agricultural sector as envisioned in the early 90s, the
present Government has embarked along with its partner countries in the Andean Region on the
negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States. This will lead to a more open
sector with the need to be more competitive. In this context, improving agricultural competitiveness,
developing the rural areas, and improving the living standards of the rural population, is the key to
Colombia becoming a peaceful and productivecountry. Achieving these objectives will enable Colombia
to consolidate the competitive advantages of the rural sector, and enable it to take advantage of the
opportunities brought about by the commercial opening envisioned inthe FTA.

Competitiveness of the Secto?

Profitability i s a basic indicator of competitiveness, but the most central requirement for maintaining
competitiveness over time i s increasing productivity. Productivity has both physical and economic sides.
In crop agriculture, the physical side means yields per unit of land. The economic side refers to cost
reductions per unit of output, in addition to those brought about by yield increases, but equally it refers to
increasesinthe unit value of the product.

Agricultural research i s a key to improving productivity and it generally has shown very high returns.
Estimates of the rate of return to agricultural researchby region of the world, in many studies, have been
consistently high: 41 percent in Africa (10 studies), 46 percent in Latin America (36 studies), and 35
percent in Asia (35 studies). However, productivity increases are sometimes difficult to achieve on a
sector-wide basis, especially when the use of all factors of productioni s taken into account. Changing the
sector's product composition toward higher-value products i s fundamental for increasing productivity at
the sector-wide level. This is an area in which policy can play an important role.

Competitiveness in an open economy means being able to export at a profit against the imports.
Comparative advantage implies being able to do it without any net policy support, that is, without
subsidies in net terms. As globalization advances, worldwide the reference point for competitiveness is
becoming the international market.        Also, economic theory teaches that competitiveness vis-&vis
international markets is a basic guideline for more efficient resource allocation and therefore for
achieving higher economic growth rates.

In the above referenced study for Colombia, comparative advantage was assessed for six groups of
products and comments were offeredfor additional products on the basis of other studies.

For the first group of products, grains and soybeans, they were found to exhibit a comparative
disadvantage. One indication of this situation i s that imports of these products have been rising in
relation to domestic production in the past decade, in spite of the high and increasing levels of border

protection enjoyed by most of them. On the other hand, a number of processed grain products have
demonstrated increasing international competitiveness, especially in the Andean regional context. These
products include flours, breakfast cereals, animal foods, and bakedproducts, and often their production i s
carried out with importedprimary products as inputs.

Fruit and vegetable crops are found to have considerable comparative advantage, without exception.
They already occupy an important position in national agricultural production, accounting for 23 percent
of the value of non-coffee production, a figure which rises to 40 percent when plantains and bananas are
included. Their role in generating employment i s proportionately greater, and hence they are valuable
crops for a poverty alleviation strategy. They also enjoy the advantage of continuously increasing world
demand. The acreage planted in fruit other than bananas and plantains more than doubled from 1991to
2001.

Hurdles to more rapid expansion of fruit and vegetable production for export include: i)low rates of use
of improved technologies, ii)a low priority for these crops in the national research system, iii)plant
disease risk faced by producers, iv) a consistent downward trend in world market prices for most fresh
fruit and vegetables, and v) lack of an integrated policy to stimulate and promote fruit and vegetable
exports. Nevertheless, a number of other Latin American countries, including Peru, Costa Rica, Mexico,
Argentina and Brazil, have beenmore successfulthan Colombia inovercoming these barriers.

An integrated agro export strategy for fruit and vegetables would include as main pillars the following
elements: i)a more concerted effort to obtain phytosanitary approvals in major export markets, ii)a
higher priority in programs of technology development and transfer, iii)a more complete market
intelligence system, iv) a campaign to promote producer awareness of the importance of product quality,
v) support for stronger producer organization, and vi) a higher priority in internationaltrade negotiations
for opening markets to Colombian fruit and vegetable exports.

The third group of products includes two of the four largest agricultural exports, coffee and sugar, and
one of the fastest growing exports, palm oil, plus cacao. Exports of raw cacao products have decreased
sharply since 1994 but exports of chocolates have increasedby a larger amount. Exports of sweets based
on sugar also have increased in importance. All four crops are linked to important agro-processing
industries in Colombia. The sugar and palm oil subsectors also have been leaders in technological and
institutional development in the last ten years, and coffee has long had a strong institutional base. Palm
oil productionhas been increasing while cottonseedoil and soybeanoil have beendeclining.

All four of these crops turn out to have a comparative advantage, with the possible exception of cacao in
part of the country. These crops are highly intensive in labor use and therefore have considerable
capacity for creating employment. More than 30 percent of costs are accounted for inthe employment of
skilled and unskilled labor. Inaddition, employment i s relatively stable and well remunerated in most of
these crops over the medium term and therefore it i s employment of high quality. The same is true of
bananas and plantains. In the cases of sugarcane, oil palm and coffee, producers also are well organized.
These are crops grown by large numbers of smallholders (especially coffee, cacao and oil palm). The
presence of smallholders, in combination with the economies of scale in processing and marketing,
provides strong incentives for social cooperation and organization in the rural areas where the crops are
dominant.

In spite of cacao's comparative advantage, its production and exports have declined abruptly in the last
three years from levels recorded in the early and mid-l990s, and now chocolate producers import a share
of their cacao requirements. Cacao in many cases i s the principal source of income of campesino families
who are its major producers. Perhaps in part because of the small scale of cacao farms and their
geographical dispersion, an effective phytosanitary campaign has not been mounted for this crop, and


                                                     28

plant diseases are a major reasonfor its lack of dynamism. Equally, it i s weak in the area of agricultural
research. In short, technical problems at the farm level need to be resolved before cacao can realize its
apparently high potential. The comparative advantage of cacao suggests a strengthened technology
development effort i s warranted for this crop.

A favorable circumstance for palm oil is that world demand is expected to grow at least in the range of
3.3 percent to 3.9 percent annually for the next twenty years, if not more when the possibilities of the
incipient vegetable oil industry are taken into account. Another advantage for the crop in Colombia i s
that, beyond areas presently planted in palm, there are literally millions of hectares of additional lands
with appropriate soils for the crop.

Sugar is strongly competitive becauseof the very high yields achieved incane in the Cuucu Valley. The
prevailing distortions in world sugar prices mean that it cannot be exported profitably on the free (non-
quota) market, but when the prices on all markets are averagedColombia i s seen to have a comparative
advantage in this crop and would be well positioned to increase its exports if world market distortions
were removed.

The fourth group of crops covers cassava, potatoes, tobacco, and cotton. In the case of all of them,
processed forms of the products have been increasing in importance in Colombia, relative to the raw
forms. Potatoes and tobacco have a marked comparative advantage at the farm level. Tobacco i s largely
a smallholder crop. Potatoesare grown on farms of all sizes, with a comparative advantage on all of them
even though smallholder yields are significantly lower. A major barrier to increased potato exports, and
to potato's position inthe domestic marketinthe longrun, is the excessive applicationof pesticides.

Colombia has a comparative advantage in all livestock products. It i s strongest for poultry, eggs and milk
and least evident for extensive livestock production. Beef fattening operations and pork production for
the complete cycle fall in between. Poultry's comparative holds when both the U. S. and Brazilian
markets are used as benchmarks, although is it somewhat weaker vis-&-vis Brazil. Both poultry and milk
production have grown rapidly in the last twenty years. Milk i s competitive in the Andean regional
context but, in the presenceof subsidies on dairy products in other countries, it could not compete in the
wider international market. When the calculations are made with current rates of protection on feed-
grains, pork loses its competitiveness and poultry's becomes marginal.

Structural and sanitary barriers in world markets, for poultry, beef and milk, inhibit the possibilities for
expansion of Colombia's exports of these products, but the potential for it exists were world conditions to
improve. There is an expectation of achieving certification for some regions of the country as free of
hoof-and-mouth disease, and that alone would provide an incentive for greater exports, although not in
Colombia's most competitive livestock product.

Inoverall terms, it has been found that Colombia has comparative advantage, often strong, in export
products as opposed to import substitutes, in perennial crops as opposed to annual crops; and inthe more
labor-intensive crops. All regions have a comparative advantage in some lines of production. In many
cases realizing this comparative advantage will require concerted efforts in areas such as agricultural
technology development, marketing programs, and food safety programs. It can also be promoted by
modifications in priorities in incentives policies and by changes in the way in which some programs are
carried out, includingresearchand extension and irrigation management.

ProductionChains: A CompetitivenessPolicyInstrument
From the mid-90s onwards, a production chain approach has accordingly been embraced by the national
Government to designing and setting in motion agricultural sector-driven public policy and launching the
national competitiveness strategy.
The fresh impetus given to competitiveness agreements within the context of production chains over the
last few years has been used both as a competitiveness analytical tool and as an engagement and action
instrument to strengthen and plan agro-productive, fishery, forestry, livestock activities vis-&vis the
economic opening and increasing trade integration of the country with the rest of the world. These
agreements are being entered into between the various private agents involved in the production,
transformation and marketing chain and the national Government. The goal of this policy i s to establish
commitments and an action plan that improve the overall competitive position of agribusiness while in
creasing exports, adding value to goods, and creating jobs. Technological innovation and an improved
organizational environment are key drivers of this policy. The role of government in this initiative i s to
facilitate interaction between different members of each industry and coordinate policy so that
government incentives and infrastructure investment support private initiatives that generate competitive
advantage. Viewing agricultural policy through the demands of the entire product chain has altered
negotiations between public and privates sectors, as policy i s no longer reduced to the lobbying power of
only once industry or producer organization. This approach has also expanded the scope of policy
instrument in research, environment, and commerce while increasing the planning horizon of
agribusiness. As this policy evolves, the government i s promoting regional competitiveness agreements
to strengthenthe competitive positionof clusters.
Within the framework of the competitiveness strategy, Law 811of 2003 was enacted stipulating the role
the Government and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) should play with
respect to chain organizations in the agricultural, forestry, aquatic, and fishery sector. Concerning these
production chains, the mission the MARD should pursue is to design policy to deliver agro-production
chain development-related public goods. In order for agents participating in a production chain to have
access to these public goods, a national and/or regionalagreement should be entered into, and the MARD
should be duly advised, accordingly.
To date, competitiveness agreements have been entered into in the following chains: potato, dairy
products, tuna fish, fisheries, rice, oleaginous fats and oils, culture shrimp, cotton-textiles, forestry-wood,
forestry-paper, plantain, cocoa, citrus fruit, tobacco, giant bamboo, and beef. National and Regional
Chain Councils are in place for all these chains, in which actions includedin competitiveness agreements
are agreedupon andundertaken.
In like manner, a strategy is beingimplemented to get competitiveness agreements under way in regions
and in firm clusters through regional cluster-and-chain-level agreements. The establishment of "regional
agro-entrepreneurial clusters" will thus be encouraged. Sixty of these groups are already in place in
several regions across the country. Coordination of national policy with departmental and local policy i s
enhancedthrough this instrument.
The MARD's organizational scheme includes a Production Chain Directorate in charge of fostering the
development of this institutionalization.       The Directorate's main goals are:          (a) achieving chain
competitiveness, (b) creating conditions conducive to the generation of strategic alliances among chain
agents, (c) lowering transaction costs, (d) ensuring the timely and ongoing availability of products, (e)
buildingsocial capital, and (0creating an institutionalization to strengtheningchain development.
While there have been no in-depth impact studies of the chain policy, there i s general consensus among
participants that it has improved coordination among different government agencies and between
government and the private sector, improved monitoring of public policy, and reduced distortions created
by individual negotiation by isolated sectors with the government. Businesses have benefited from the



                                                       30

sharing of information, which ahs allowed them to understand the competitiveness of various industries
and regions, encouraging productivity improvements. Further, the policy has improved access to
financing because members of the chain have entered into purchase contracts or entered into forward
contracts basedon commitments establishedinthe competitiveness arrangements.
Improving the competitiveness of agribusiness through the chain approach i s a learning process that
requires a cooperative environment that encourages innovation and competition. The process should be
open to all members of the chain including downstream industries, retailers, and campesinoorganizations.
It is the participation of smallholders that poses one of the most formidable challenges to an agricultural
policy basedon the chain approach. Campesinos could benefit by being integrated into the chain, because
the main obstacle to their productive growth i s access to productionfactors which competitiveagreements
can facilitate.
The government has a wide variety of incentives available to promote chains; however funding of each
item i s limited. Many are tied to formal financing where it i s not always clear what benefit i s perceived
by smallholders and or other members of the chain. Other areas of concern are researchand development
and technology transfer because the product chains are not yet fully integrated to the business decision-
makingprocess.
Economic Integration, Knowledge Generation and Innovation
The international integration process of the Colombian economy and of the agricultural sector in
particular, i s taking place in a global setting in which knowledge and technological development and
innovation are becoming increasingly important factors in global market differentiation. Indeed, "the
downwards trend of agricultural good prices will be overcome by increasing productivity; the
productivity ceiling will not be restricted by land availability but, rather, by how successful efforts being
made in the field of R&D are."        There are increasing demands in particular for "quality, healthy,
environment-friendly and safe food products showing new packaging and presentation and addressing
environmental requirements and health safety."         In short, the evolution of agricultural production
structures around the world has been determined by both the increasing significance of knowledge in
terms of economic development, and consumption pattern changes.
Knowledge and technological development and innovation are, today, increasingly key to social and
economic development. Worldwide trends toward private ownership of knowledge, and the ability to
take advantage of basic agricultural research "technological spillovers" are associatedwith the success of
such development. Therefore, an articulation of scientific and technological knowledge policies with
intellectual property rights policies i s required, as are the creation of capacities and incentives both to
integrate the national scientific community into international science and technology networks and flows,
and to generatepublic technological researchand development goods inthe sector.
Over the last few decades, technological development in agricultural activities is becoming increasingly
relevant in world markets through a reduced global market share of commodities (raw materials and
primary agricultural products) vis-84s that of value-added products. Inother words, the growers' share
in the agriculture-derived product chains value-adding process has steadily decreased while
transformation and marketingactivities participation has increased. The evidence shows not only the key
role technological development plays, but the increasing interrelation between the different stages an
agricultural sector productive process involves, from primary production to end consumer. Hence, the
relevance attachedto the productionchain approach used inthis investment project.
According to the MARD, the agricultural sector share of GDP ranks below the "international agricultural
participation pattern,""  despite the fact that "natural resources available to the country have a clear
agricultural vocation."   This means that Colombia does not fully take advantage of its huge natural

resources and the vast biodiversity provided to agricultural production. Comparatively disadvantaged
products have been benefited over products showing comparative advantages by agricultural production
incentives (pricing and trade- policies, exchange rate policies, and fiscal incentives).      As a result,
Colombian agriculture has not been able to contribute its maximum benefits interms of job creation and
growth (World Bank 2003).
The new development model therefore requires strengthening of scientific, technological, and innovation
capacities, and technology and technological services transfer capacities. The conditions would thus be
created for increasing productivity, harnessingthe sustainable use natural resources, taking advantage of
opportunities offered by biotechnology and by the country's biological diversity, and fulfilling standards
required by domestic and international markets (quality, food safety, and environmental preservation).
The above conditions should contribute to improving agricultural sector competitiveness and addressing
social problems inthe rural areas.
KnowledgeGeneration, InnovationandProduction Chains
The development of production chains is closely linked with science and technology capacity building.
This process in Colombia is still posing significant challenges. Infact, a weak articulation between the
productive sector and the scientific sector is apparent in most agricultural production chains. The above
i s reflected, for example, in the rather low co-financing level of technological research and development
activities in most chains and in the fact that most para-fiscal funds show a trend to allocate most of their
resources to technology transfer activities and other than R&D activities.
The private sector provides significant financing of science and technology to only a few chains. These
chains show strong institutional development and a capacity to design their own R&D agendas, setting
priorities and leveraging resources to fund science, technology, and innovation activities. Most of these
chains have their own research centers Centros Nacionales de Znvestigacio'n (CENIs), and record the
highest competitiveness levels. This sort of institutional development is weak or lacking in all other
production chains, which are usually devoid of a clear vision of their own R&D requirements, and their
contribution to science and technology activities i s limited or nonexistent. Public financing of science
and technology activities carried out by production chains has been low, and thus their impact interms of
competitiveness improvement has been weak.
Several constraints need to be overcome before the country's capacities can be strengthened. Indeed,
although there have been significant scientific, technological, and innovation achievements in the
agricultural sector, the impact these activities have on national-level production has not been enough to
address challenges faced by the sector with respect to competitiveness and rural poverty. Government
financing of agricultural, scientific, and technological research i s low and decreasing; the number of
researchers, researchgroups, and scientific and technological production working in sector-related issues
has plummetedin recent years, while the researchbeing done lacks relevance and long-term planning and
therefore it shows low economic and social impact (Amaya and Rueda 2004). To a large extent this i s
due to the diversity and spread of public policy sources and criteria, weakness of institutional
arrangements to finance sector-related science and technology activities, low demand by the productive
sector for scientific and technological services, and the low level of cooperation between the productive
sector and the scientific and technological sector.
Contributing to this situation i s the fact that public science and technology activities financing
mechanisms have shown a bias toward short-term research initiatives, mainly designed in line with
scientific sector concerns, rather than that of chain agents, and focused mostly on issues dealing with the
chain's primary production stages, rather than on the industrial and marketing stages. In addition,
incentives to encourage cooperation between the productive sector and the scientific and technological
sector, particularly in providing incentives to private investment and taking advantage of scientific,
technological, and innovation knowledge, have been ineffective.               Allocation of resources by
COLCENCIAS to finance projects through agricultural sector competitive funds shows that 73 percent


                                                     32

of projects supported during 1991-93 correspondedto so-called "contingent recovery" projects, that is,
basic and strategic researchprojects, pursuedby universities, researchcenters, and technological research
centers, with no participation by the productive sector. Nineteen percent of these projects were allocated
under the "co-financing" line, seeking to encourage associations among the productive sector and
universities, researchcenters, and technological development centers (COLCJENCIAS 2004).
Although significant achievements have been recorded in the agricultural sector by the country' s
development-related institutions involved in scientific and technological innovation, they have not been
adequate to address the challenges the sector faces with respect to rural poverty and competitiveness.
Policies are needed to ease the way for those productive sectors showing clear comparative and
competitive advantages, and export potential. To achievethis goal, priority identification mechanismsare
needed, and resource allocation should be optimized, coordination with the private sector improved and
financial sources increasedand diversified.
Animal Health, Phytosanitary Systems
Given the increasing globalization of markets over the last decade the country must be prepared to open
its economy to an exchange of agricultural products. Before doing that, however, Colombia must design
and implement public interventions to help remedy market failures, addressing the creation of public
goods, and encouraging the development of the competitive capacity of firms and regions.
Overcominganimal health, phytosanitary, and food safety barriers to national products (fruit, vegetables,
and meat and milk products, for example) in end markets i s the key to facilitating market access.
Strengthening the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System (SPS) i s a sine qua nonrequisite
to achieving this goal. Only to the extent that these barriers can be overcome will Colombia gain access
to broader markets, with all that implies for the future of the country, and for the possibilities of
improving the living standards of people living inthe rural areas.
The Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FI'AA), currently under negotiation, presentsan opportunity
for Colombia to increase trade access for its products; however, the impact of this higher trade access
could be reduced if non-tariff barriers, such as the application of animal health and phytosanitary
measures, are not simultaneously overcome. Of the more than 1,000 agricultural sector tariff sub-items
included in the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), less than 20 have taken
advantage of this tariff concession. To the extent that non-trade barriers are not fully overcome, benefits
likely arising from increased incorporation of Colombian agriculture into world markets will not be
realized.
Likewise, subscribing to a suitable SPS Charter as part of the FTA with the United States does not by
itself ensure that sanitary and phytosanitary constraints will be overcome. Only strengthening the SPS
systemand firm-level quality managementcan help ensure access to markets ruled by stringent standards.
The enforcement, on January 1, 1995, of the World Trade Organization (WTO) triggered changes in how
international trade of agricultural products would be ruled. Basically, the reason for this was new
legislation on the matter setting in motion the gradual removal of tariff liens, which, so far, have
accounted for the biggest trade constraint. Thus, when those barriers became an alternative to the
establishment of hiddentrade barriers, non-tariff barriers becameincreasingly relevant.
To prevent this type of barrier from becoming a trade constraint, the WTO Agreement on the Application
of Animal Health and Phytosanitary Measures sets forth international guidelines to minimize the impact
the use these kinds of measures could have on trade. The Agreement provides for principles ruling the
application of these measures, such as supporting them with a Risk Analysis providing scientific backup
for why these measures should be applied. In addition, the Agreement stipulates that each country should
exercise this right transparently, implying that previous notice should be given to all WTO members at
the inception of the new regulation, so that countries can submit their comments if they wish. In this

sense, Harmonization, Equivalence, Regionalization, Special, and Differentiated Treatment principles,
among others, were set forth.
Against this background, entry of new products into the international market, and the permanenceof other
products included, was conditioned on this operational framework. It became necessary to demonstrate
the existence, reliability, and suitability of national sanitary and phytosanitary systems.        Such a
requirement has meant that most exporting countries have had to change their procedures and strategies,
with a larger burden falling on emergingeconomiesthat might not have the resources neededto adjust to
new demands. Such an adjustment goes beyond technical procedures suitable to uphold the country's
sanitary situation, because it involves new working methods, implying the updating and training of
technicians dealing with the new requirements, supplying them with new equipment, adopting new
analyticaltechniques, and staying current date on changes in other countries.
Dealing with international negotiations thus makes a sound support to the sanitary and phytosanitary
measures working out and application systemnecessary, as well as an in-depth knowledge of the national
sanitary situation; an installed capacity to perform both import and export risk analyses; an updated and
highly sensitive diagnosis infrastructure; and an information network able to keep all technicians well
informed and able to report sanitary emergencies in a timely manner. Of course, incorporation of these
capacities makes the ongoing provision of budgetary resources necessary to carry themout.
Since Colombia enjoys comparative advantages in products such as fruit, vegetables, and meat and dairy
products-those    most prone to sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to accessing international markets-
strengthening sanitary and food safety conditions i s key to accessingexport markets. Thus, to the extent
that non-trade barriers are not fully overcome, benefits likely arising from increased incorporation of
Colombian agriculture inworld markets will not be secured.
Indeed, the negotiation of the FTA with the United States i s the right place to make this kind of barrier
disappears. However, by itself, the subscription of a SPS Chapter does not warrant that barriers will be
overcome. Inthis regard and as previously discussed, only the strengthening of the SPS system will help
ensure admissibility to markets ruled by stringent standards. To the extent that this public good,
representing a strengthenednational system, may be provided, conditions conducive to increasing private
investment levels in the Colombian agricultural sector will be enhanced. The return this effort may yield
will be beneficial to a paradigm change in the agro-exporting approach of the sector, with a positive
impact on this transition process.
In order to allow for the System to comprehensively work along the various agri-food chains, the
modernization and full operation of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System calls for
investments to be made in some issuesalready identified within some agencies attachedto it.
The streamlining and full operation of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System (see
Figure l),  currently made up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the
Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA), the Ministry of Social Welfare (MPS), the National Institute for
Drug and Food Surveillance (INVIMA), Territorial Health Agencies (ETS), the Ministry of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism (MCIT), the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (SIC) involves a
comprehensive operation along the various agro-alimentary chains and calls for investments to be made in
some areas already identifiedwithin several System-attached institutions.
The SPS systems has two main functions: one related to protection of domestic production which
expresses itself through its capacity to perform accurate diagnosis; and the other oriented to fulfilling
requirements to access international markets, which i s based on its capacity to certify, authorize and
provide information regarding traceability. To properly execute these functions it i s necessary to have
clear rules reflected in the national public policy for food safety, its corresponding legal framework, the
procedures and instruments to put it in place, and private and public institutional settings duly financed,




                                                     34

with the appropriate infrastructure and skilled human resourcesand supportedby relevant R&D programs
which provide knowledge and innovationinterms of sanitary, phytosanitary and food safety issues.
A key component within the SPS systems is production, dissemination and accessto strategic information
that allows responding adequately to sanitary emergencies, receiving and circulating information
regarding requirements to access international markets and keeping a fluent communication with end
users and consumers, amongothers.
Bearing in mind resource constraints, needs identified should be faced up vis-&vis requirements of some
production chains showing a competitive potentialand including basic components within their activities,
likely to be shared with other chains and required to access international markets in a free-trade setting,
U.S. markets, in particular. Thus, the focus to be given to the use of these resources i s the admissibility to
international markets with regard to the SPS of some products or specific chains. Therefore, the
institutional strengthening of the Colombian SPS will come by insofar it i s a specific condition to
overcomingbarriers as identified to products includedin the project.



                       Figure A.l.l. The InstitutionalSetting of the SPS System




With such an aim in mind, the team madeupby the Colombian Government to negotiate the SPS Chapter
of the FTA with the United States has been conducting some practical exercises in which all System
organizations have taken part, the private sector included, with a view to defining activities and
investments that must be carried out to succeed in accessingthe United States market with specific chain
products.
Mention should be made of the fact that, notwithstanding resource limitations available to this
Subcomponent, those resources play a strategic role in the so called Internal Agenda work the country
should carry out to tailor its SPS System to the needs entailed by the larger insertion of the agricultural

sector into the global economy. Additionally, the above representthe first source of resources to be used
for this particular purpose.
Finally, and in order to formulate this project, it is necessary to make it clear that beef was chosen within
the meat chain as a highly complex product with regard to sanitary issues, because it faces sanitary
barriers as well as other food safety-related barriers. In addition to its sanitary complexity, beef was
selected because of the importance of the cattle sub sector in the agricultural setting, and the high
socioeconomic impact likely to be derived from this product admissibility ininternational markets.
As far as the farming sector was concerned, uchuva (Physalis peruviana)" was chosen as a product
representinga sub sector inwhich the country has comparative advantagesand the development of which
i s currently facing sanitary and phytosanitary constraints. Although the investment plan may have been
designedon the basis of overcoming barriers this particular fruit faces, it covers the needs being faced by
a large portion of fruits and vegetableschainsto successfully access international markets.




    The variety of Uchuva currently traded in Colombia i s a bush originating from the Peruvian Andes inSouth America. It belongsto species
Physalisperuviana Land to the taxonomical family Solanaceae. It is characterizedby its high content of vitamin A and C, Iron and Phosphorus.
It is knownin Colombiaas acommercialcrop since the ~O'S,when it beganto haverecognition inintemational markets. Currently, Colombia is
the world largestproducer of uchuva, followed by South Africa. Uchrrvafruit i s a roundedberry with a diameter between 1.25 and 2.5 cms and a
weight of 4 to 10grams covered by a five-sepal calyx which provides protection against pests. Total nationalproduction is estimatedin7.500
tons in550 hectares,Interms of value and volume, Physalis is currently the thirdmost important export fruit inColombia after Banana and
plantain. In2003,2.700 tons were exported valued 8.9 million dollars. Physalis is mostly consumed in fresh but some processingis made to
producejam and caramelizedberries.

                           COLOMBIA: Agricultural TransitionProject

Project Description and Development Objective

The project of four years duration (2005-2009) with an expected overall cost of US$30m (Bank's share
US30m) aims to strengthen the National Agricultural Science and Technology and Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Systems by supporting thejoint participation of both the public and private sectors, through
the mechanism of production chains, thereby contributing to the competitiveness of Colombian
agriculture and improving the accessibility of export-potential products to internationalmarkets.

These two areas, even though they constitute a partial agenda as regards competitiveness of the sector,
neverthelesshave been assigned a priority status for further investment by the Government of Colombia
to support the transition of agriculture from a relatively protected sector to a more open competitive sector
due to the negotiations of a FreeTrade Agreement with the United States.

From the mid-1990s onward, a production-chain focus has been adopted by the national Government in
the design and implementation of public policy in the agricultural sector, as well as being the context for
the national competitiveness strategy. Competitiveness agreementshave been promotedover the last few
years within the framework of this strategy by the Government, and have been entered into between the
various private agents involved in the production-transformation-marketing chain and the national
Government.

Because of this policy focus, this Project with its aim of increasing Colombian agricultural
competitiveness by optimizing knowledge and technological innovation resource allocation, and
strengthening the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System, will be achieved by using
productionchains as the guiding principle.

Increasing investment in the science and technology system will focus on a number of production chains
that will meet certain criteria as described below, and the specific investments in each chain will be
determined by those criteria. Along the same lines, the need to strengthen the national MSP system will
focus on a number of production chains to which priority has been attached because of their export
potentialand their ability to generate positive externalities to boththe system and other promisingchains.

Description ofProject Components
The project will be comprised of three components to be implemented over four years: (i)        Knowledge
Generation andInnovation; (ii)   Strengthening of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary System; and (iii)
Project Management.       The components are described in detail below.           The technical details and
supporting study reports of each component are in the project file. Annex 12 gives a list of all working
papers, reports of commissioned studies, and other documents usedduringappraisal.

This Project will have national coverage and benefit those agents linked to the production chains on
which public policy will focus the instruments financed through this operation. The implementation of
the Project will take advantage of ongoing initiatives in the sector such as the Support to Productive
Partnership project, currently under operation, among others.

Component 1. Knowledge Generationand Innovation (US$22.1 m)
The aim of Component 1 i s to strengthen the provision of technology and innovation through the
strengthening of agricultural production chain actors in the definition, co- financing and implementation
of R&D, as well as the preparation of participatory and demand driven R&D agendas around certain


                                                      50

production chains and the implementation and co-financing of these agendas through a Competitive Fund.
The activities to be financed in each of the chains will reflect its expressed demand and capacity to
implement and co-finance its own R&D agenda. The result will be to optimize the allocation of resources
for technology and innovation, and through co-financing mechanisms to foster increased private sector
investment as well as increasedparticipation of para-fiscal funds and territorial governments to support
scientific and technological innovation, and technology transfer activities inthe agricultural sector.

To achieve this objective the component will finance: (i) development of R&D agendas for twenty
                                                               the
production chains, which will entail the carrying out of the prospective studies for these agendas as well
as the evaluation and strengthening of the capacity of chains to develop, co-finance and implement these
agendas; (ii)   the operation of a Competitive Fund that will co-finance production chains' R&D and
capacity building subprojects which are consistent with the prospective agendas; (iii)          capacity building
within the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) to manage the allocation of public
resources to the agendas already defined and to the development and implementation of new production
chains' R&D agendas.

The R&D agendas identified in this project will be complemented with an agenda that, at the national
level will deal with cross-sectoral issues, to be jointly defined with the Agricultural Sector-related
National Science and Technology System actors, under the leadership of the MARD and the National
Agricultural Science and Technology Program Council (CPNCTA) attached to COLCIENCIAS, which
will provide financial support. The resulting agenda will be the basis for the implementation of the
Competitive Fundwhich will be focused on those production chains prioritizedby the GOC. Among the
criteria used for allocating resources to the various subprojects in the Competitive Fund will be projected
economic and social benefits, target populations, environmental sustainability, complementarities with
other ongoing initiatives, and the impact in terms of scientific and technological capacity building. The
Operational Manualfor the project will specify indetail the implementationof the Fund.

Since research subprojects to be financed through this component will take up to three years to be carried
out, implementationof subprojects chosen through years 3 and 4 calls to be financed should be extended
to years 5 and 6; that is, they will go beyond the deadline set for implementation of this operation with
World Bank loan resources. Therefore, the GOC will be responsible for financing activities to be carried
out during the latter years. Additionally, once the World Bank loan resources have been fully executed,
the GOC will continue to provideresourcesfor the Fund.

Target Group. The allocation of resources within the framework of this component will be targeted by
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) to those chains likely to be most affectedby
the economic opening and integration process resulting from the Free Trade Agreement with the United
States, in particular with the view of increasing their competitiveness and based on a number of criteria
specified. Significant importance will be assigned to those programs and subprojects envisioning the
transfer of technology to small growers as one of the likely benefits expected. Such a transfer shouldtake
place within the framework of programs and should be focused on the incorporationof small growers into
productionchains12.



l2 Kayruz (2004:31) reviews the scope of the small grower notion, and the following definition is suggested: "Small
growers [are] those whose patrimony amounts up to 200 minimummonthly wages and two family agricultural units
(UAF). This definition includes the two categories established by the MARD for small growers: Small growers
showing an agricultural potential, and small peasant growers showing little productive potential and precarious
livelihood conditions. The former are "those whose agricultural output mainly goes to the market and whose
income is mainly derived from their own productive unit. Although they are usually landowners, they should both
address their technological and entrepreneurial management problems and strengthen their insertion in markets.
They lack the support to adapt to modern requirements and to have access to financial incentives, credit and

Insummary, the component's target group is the chain actors that show competitive potential. This group
therefore includes farmers, ago-entrepreneurs, and trader associations. Before the latter can have access
to resources, they should design and submit their preliminary study through alliances with institutions
providing scientific and technological services.

The MARD will also be responsible for the definition, on the basis of the criteria presented below, of
types and levels of support to be provided to each one of the chains included in this component. This
prioritization task will be performed on the basis of the prospective studies to be performed, and the
definition of research agendas, as described in the Activity 1.              The following criteria, which are
elaborated inthe Operational Manual, shall be taken into consideration by the MARD:

    Chains in which the primary production phase assumes greater importance in the chain from the
    viewpoint of public policy.
    The development level of the institutions within the production chain. The existence of sound
    producer organizations, grower, agro-entrepreneur, and trader associations will be taken into account,
    as will the execution of national and regional competitiveness agreements and the existence of
    technical coordination agencies for development of scientific and technological capacity building
    within the chain. Also, institutional developments will be considered for financing science and
    technology activities, suchas a para-fiscal fundor a voluntary contribution-raisinginstrument.
    The technological development level. That is, the development level of technologies the chain has
    access to, and to what extent its agents are involved ininternational technology flows.
    Competitive potential. That is, the potential to either harness opportunities being provided by
    internationalmarkets or to compete inthe domestic market.
    Research capacity. The presence of research centers committed to working on chain issues, such as
    the Centro Nacionales de Znvestigacidn (CENIs) of the different commodities are in place, such as
    national or international research and/or technological development groups and centers, with which
    links may have beencreatedby the chain, and firms engaged inthis line of work. Reference is also
    madeto medium- and long-termagendas followinga strategic chain competitiveness vision.

Institutions carrying out R&D activities, such as universities, research centers, and technological
development centers, will also participate in this component as partners with the chain actors as they will
compete for resourcesin the Competitive Fund. Inthis way they will be able to strengthen their capacity,
thus raisingthe quality of the researchwork they might pursue. Inthis sense, implementationof research
activities by research centers already existing in the National Science and Technology System will be
encouraged, as will the creation of links and the consolidationof cooperation schemes between chains and
national and international researchinstitutions.

Though R&D investments are not an instrument for directly reducing poverty, resource allocation to be
made through this particular component will assign due weight to subprojects being submitted by
production chains that contribute to this goal. Finally, because they will have access to better-quality


technological innovation, productive services and equipping of their productive and social infrastructure. They
should also be linked with retrofitting processes or productive restructuring, and should be included in rural
development strategies." Land access accounts regarding the latter, for their main constraint to access to production
factors. Growers settled in large unproductive landed property concentration regions where violence is rampant are
included in this category. Also, small growers settled in colonization areas or marginal areas, far away from
markets, showing a low physical and productive infrastructure, with little access to public services, living in poverty
conditions more acute than subsistence farmers. Some o f them have been forced to get involved in illegal crop
production."

arrangements  .
The KnowledgeGeneration and InnovationComponent will be comprised of two sets of activities:

0   The Preparation of Participatory and Demand Driven R&D Agendas and Capacity Strengthening of
    Agricultural ProductionChains inthe Definition, Co-Financing andImplementationof R&D.

0   The establishment and implementation of a Competitive Fund to co-finance R&D activities focused
     on productionchains.
Subcomponent 1: The Preparation of Participatoryand Demand Driven R&D Agendas and Capacity
Strengtheningof Agricultural Production Chainsin the Definition, Co-Financing and Implementation
of R&D
In2003, MARD conducted an exerciseto identify strategic lines for productionchains, with the aim that
these chains become a multi-annual research, transfer, training, and sanitary protection agenda. The
identification of strategic priorities at the national level and regionaldemands was the primary goal.

The MARD then used the result of this exercise as the basis for the August 2004 Call for Research
Proposals, which targeted three chains: cassava, cocoa, and rubber. These results were also used by
COLCIENCIAS as the basis for the National Agricultural Science and Technology Program Call (August
2004). The following chains were included in this Call: cassava, coconut, beef, cattle, fruit trees, oil
palm, rubber, and cotton. This exercise, besides the formulation of demand agendas, has entailed the
appropriation of a methodology and the development of capacities to determine specific needs by the
MARD and the production chain actors.              Likewise, it has allowed the gathering and analysis of
information that i s relevant for establishing priorities.

Yet, the results of this exercise point out that most needs identified correspond to the primary production
stage, while only a few of them relate to the industrial and marketing stages. As further suggested by this
analysis, most demands identified are related to short-term needs and not necessarily to a strategic vision
involving the competitive development of chains.              Also, as the PRONATTA experience shows,
corroborates this evidence. Thus the need arises for a long-term strategic research agenda to address
challenges being faced by chains. Therefore, prospective exercises for each productive chain must
comprise, at least, an analysis of the competitive environment; an inventory and an analysis of the
institutional, scientific and technological capacities and gaps within the productive chain; and the
formulation of a prospective agenda which will define the strategic competitive objectives of the chain
and a detailed prioritisation of the R&D needs that will contributeto achieve those objectives.

In line with the above the activities in this subcomponent will include the: i)promotion of the Fund; (ii)
and the carrying out of prospective studies in a group of production chains selected by the MARD
according to the Operational Manual, which will allow for long-term agricultural R&D priorities to be
defined; (iii) the evaluation and design, for some of chains prioritized by the MARD, of financing
mechanisms and institutional arrangements to implement such priorities. The prospective exercises will
be performed in coordination with the National Prospective Program being implemented by
COLCIENCIAS, will be performed in a decentralized manner and will involve regional-level and,
especially, productive chain actors.        The outcome of such a process will be a long-term strategic
agricultural sector research agenda of approximately 20 production chains, the assessment of about 12
chains, and the design, for around 8 chains, of institutional arrangements for financing the agendas. The
agendas will take into account not only the needs in terms of R&D but also the needfor capacity building
in science and technology managementinorder to ensure the diffusion, adoption and sustainability of the
R&D activities identified. Inparticular, the prospective agenda will make up the framework for approval
of R&D subprojects to be supported by the Fund.



                                                         53

It is expected that the R&D agendas resultingfrom the prospective studies formulated by the chains will
not be an exhaustive definition of their scientific and technological needs, particularly in terms of cross-
sectoral issues. Therefore, chain research agendas will be complemented with an agenda that, at the
national level will deal with those issues, to be jointly defined with the Agricultural Sector-related
National Science and Technology System actors, under the leadership of the MARD and the National
Agricultural Science and Technology Program Council (CPNCTA) attached to COLCIENCIAS, which
will provide financial support.

The following activities would be financed inthis subcomponent:

     The promotion and dissemination through workshops and events among agricultural sector
     production chain actors of opportunities being offeredby the Fundbeingproposed inthis component.
     The development of promotional material, publication of features in newspapers and magazines on
     the subject, and presentations to potential beneficiaries and agencies bringing them together within
     each production chain i s included. This activity should be instrumental in creating widespread
     awarenessof the Fundby all chains.
     The assessment of the institutional capacity of chains to develop and adopt a mechanism allowing for
     the co-financing of science, technology, and innovation activities required by chains. Studies will
     include both an analysis of the chains' institutional situation, and recommendations for the
     development and co-financing of an R&D programin chains that havethe capacity to do so.
     Those chains showing a potential for this particular purpose, would be supported through workshops,
     consultants and advice in the development of their own financing mechanismsfor the development of
     science, technology, and innovationactivities.
     Preparation of Prospective Studies for the development of             R&D Agendas:       These exercises
     performed in a decentralized manner, will involve both regional level and production chain actors as
     well as Ministry officials and will focus on the identification and prioritizing of the activities and
     capacities that should be implemented in order for the production chains to become innovation
     platforms.     Market and technology development-related opportunities for increasing the
     competitiveness of production chains will be identified by these studies in specific regions and
     sectors, and they will allow for technology development demands to be identified. Demands thus
     identified will not be confined to strictly technical areas (scientific andtechnological) but, rather, they
     should include analyses on the workings of the social, economic, and institutional systems in which a
     given technology i s expected to operate. Agendas will then include chain requirements in terms of
     R&D and technological innovation, and of institutional capacity in place for science and technology
     management purposes. Resources will be allocated competitively by the Fund to subprojects in the
     area of technology development. The specific sub-activities that will be financed as part of the
     prospective studies are the following
             o The design of a general methodology to be utilized for conducting the exercises, as well
                 as specific methodologies that will take into account the existing capacities within the
                 production chains and the information available. These methodologies will orient the
                 definition of the focus and scope of the exercises, as well as the process of gathering and
                 analysis of information for, firstly, assessingthe institutional, scientific and technological
                 capacities and gaps within the productive chain and, secondly, identifying technological
                 opportunities.
             o The training, on the methodology to be used, of MARD staff and key production chain
                 actors, in order to ensure both the transfer of capacities and the use of standard criteria
                 that will allow the comparison and the monitoring of the different exercises.
             o The workshops and consultations that, with the participation of key national and regional
                 level actors of the production chains and on the basis of the information gathered, will


                                                       54

                lead to the identification of the main trends, problems, and priorities in order that the
                R&D can contribute to the improvement of production chain competitiveness. As a
                result, a ProspectiveAgenda, clearly focused andprioritized, will be formulated.
            o The procurementof informationnecessary for the exercises.
            o The diffusion of results.


In order for chains to have access to financing of their own agendas, they should abide by minimum
conditions, which are elaboratedin the Operational Manual, would include the delivery of a preliminary
study on technological development and transfer requirements allowing the chains to develop their
competitive potential.
Subcomponent 2: TheEstablishment and Implementation of a Competitive Fund to Co-FinanceR&D
Activities Focused on Production Chain ProspectiveAgendas
The Colombian Institute for the Development of Science and Technology (COLCIENCIAS) has
experience in the establishment of competitive funds, and the experiences of PRONATTA and the
National Agricultural Science and Technology Council are relevant to the agricultural sector inparticular.
The two national Calls for Proposalsmade duringthe first half of 2004 by MARDand COLCIENCIAS as
well the ongoing call were based on ajoint research agenda resulting from a national-level consultation
and discussion process. These experiences are important inputs for implementation of the Competitive
Fund.

The following activities are required to establish the Fund. These are described in detail in the
Operational Manual:

0   Preparation of guidelines to implement the calls for proposals.

0   Preparation and dissemination of the operation, and rules governing the Competitive Fund so as to
    ensure transparency as to allocation of resources.

0   A standardmethodology will be developed for the ex ante assessmentof proposals andfor the ex post
    assessment of subprojects (bearing in mind that the instrument resource allocation priorities are
    focused on a wide range of production chains). This will allow for the creation of a baseline for
    subproject monitoringand evaluation.
Among basic working standards ruling the competitive instrument, the following should be included in
the Operational Manual:
    Only subprojects that are part of chain programs consistent with the R&D agenda and being an
    outcome of prospective studies or otherwise identified as critical in the national R&D agenda will be
    financed. With this criterion in mind, the Fund will help focus resources on priority production
    chains and ondemand-driven strategic requirements.
    Once prospective studies have been concluded and researchagendas have been defined, differentiated
    co-financing levels will be established inline with the capacity chains may have according to criteria
    establishedin detail inthe Operational Manual.
    The following three minimumconditions will be established for the screening of subproject proposals
    seeking financing: (i) They should be included in researchagendas defined in a participatory manner
    by the chain actors; (ii)proposals comply with: minimum rigor and technical and scientific quality
    standards, the provision of information required which regards with the ex ante economic evaluation,
    and the social and environmental impacts of the subprojects; (iii)  research implementing institutions
    should make acontribution interms of salaries and support systems Le. laboratory infrastructure etc.
    According to the core goal of supporting the development of chain competitiveness, selection of R&D
    subprojects to be financed should be mainly focused on their economic impact. Weights for each


                                                    55

     criterion will be included inthe Operational Manual. Additional to the economic return, evaluation of
     R&D subprojects to be financed will also be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: (i)           the
     social impact of subprojects; the specific goal this criterion seeks to achieve is that the scope of
     technology dissemination and adoption activities involved in the economic evaluation of subprojects
     i s widened to cover small growers to encourage their incorporation into chains. (ii)           Environmental
     sustainability: in order to ensure optimal management of natural resources and quality of life of the
     population, subprojects should ensure the environmental viability of their development and
     implementation.      Environmental criteria for subproject evaluation is outlined in Annex 10; (iii)
     synergy with other chain initiatives; this criterion seeks to identify how the other research activities
     within the same production chain complement the R&D subproject so that, together, they can help
     achieve the strategic objectives; and (iv) Capacity building; because the scope of the Fund does not
     cover the direct development of scientific and technological capacities (training of human resources
     and physical infrastructure), proposals making a contribution to consolidate these capacities will be
     given priority.

0    Provided that in the funding of R&D there exist market fail~res'~,and that one of the aims of this
     project i s to optimize the allocation of public and private resources for this sort of activities, efforts
     should be made for balancing two expected results: the leveraging of private resources in R&D
     subprojects to be financed through this instrument and the creation of public goods for technological
     development, that is, the likelihood for outcomes of subprojects to be given optimal social use.
     Therefore, rules regarding intellectual property of outcomes of research work co-financed are
     included in the Operational Manual so that there i s a trade off between, on one hand, the
     establishment of economic incentives for private sector investment by means of makingavailable the
     possibility for appropriation of outcomes of co-financed research and, on the other, the availability of
     these outcomes as public goods, that is, the possibility that they may be taken advantage of by other
     sector agents.
Once the first two years of the project life have elapsed, and on the basis of both experience gained by the
Fund and a review of the fiscal situation and budgetary regulations, a study will be performed to define
the design and implementation process of an institutional arrangement ensuring continuity of public
resource allocations to already defined agendas, as well as the design and implementation of R&D
agendas for new production chains. Therefore, priority should be given to the integration of potential
chains and to the creation of incentives to leverage resources from territorial sources, para-fiscal funds,
and other public and private co-financing sources. Thus, both continuity inthe generation of public goods
in the field of basic and strategic research, and capacity building toward the systematic generation and
adjustment of chains agendas should thus be ensured. Additionally, and on the basis of this study, the
MARD will take the measure to ensure the development of the administrative capacity required for a
sustainablefundingof the R&D agendas.




l3These failures are due to several reasons: (a) knowledge is a classic public good because, once disseminated, it is
difficult to prevent others from having access to it; (b) private firms, thus, could only partially appropriate
themselves of benefits accrued by R&D efforts made either by them or commissioned by them; (c) this situation is
difficult in fragmented sectors, such as the agricultural sector, and in the case of innovations not incorporated into
products; (d) uncertainty about researchcosts and benefits is usually high; and (e) because outside costs involved in
research processes are unknown, private investment tends to be below the social optimum."               (Drawn from
Roseboom [2004]).

Since research subprojectsto be financed through this component will take up to three years to be carried
out, implementationof subprojects chosen through years 3 and 4 calls to be financed should be extended
to years 5 and 6; that is, they will go beyond the deadline set for implementation of this operation with
World Bank loan resources. Therefore, the GOC will be responsible for financing activities to be carried
out duringthe latter years. Additionally, once the project finishes an evaluation study will be carried out
and on this basis the GOC will decide on the financing paradigmto be adopted in the allocation of public
resources to agricultural R&D inthe future.

The Fundwill co-finance about 225 subprojects. The assumptions are:

0    Duringthe Project, four Calls for Proposalswill be made (2006-2009).

0   Each proposal will be reviewed by a Peer Review passing through a series of three stages. Once the
    peer review panel has completed the evaluation and selects the portfolio to be financed, this will be
    presentedto the Board of Directors for approval.

0   All subproject will take three years to be implemented, therefore only subprojects co-financed
    through the first two Calls (2006 and 2007) are expected to be finished by the end o f the Project.
    Activities of subprojects selected through the two last Calls will be partially funded by the World
    Bankresources(2008-Call subprojects for the two years and 2009-Callsubprojects for one year).

0   Each subproject in average will cost US$200.000. 35% of this amount will be the Implementation
    Agencies contribution. The target i s that the remaining 65% will be cofinanced by the Chains and the

Component 2. Strengthening of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary System (US$7.8m)
Rationale
Given the increasing globalization of markets over the last decade, the fact i s that Colombia cannot
remain aloof from the intemational marketplace. The country must be prepared to open its economy to an
exchange of agricultural products.              Before doing that, however, Colombia must become more
competitive.         Designing and implementing public interventions to help remedy market failures,
addressingthe creation of public goods, and encouraging the development of the competitive capacity of
firms and regions are key to making Colombia's agricultural sector more competitive, making the
country's growth and development more dynamic, and thus creating a thriving rural sector.

To sanitary, phytosanitary, and food safety standards to national products (fruit, vegetable and meat
products, for example) in end markets i s key to facilitating market access. Strengthening the National
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System (SPS) i s a sine qua non requisite to achieving this goal.
Only to the extent that these standards can be met will Colombia gain access to broader markets, with all
that implies for the future of the country, and for the possibilities of improving the living standards of

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA), currently under negotiation, presents an opportunity for Colombia to
increasetrade access for its products. However, the impact of this higher trade access could be reduced if
non-tariff barriers, such as the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures, are not simultaneously
overcome. Of the more than 1,000 agricultural sector tariff sub-items included in the Andean Trade
Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), less than 20 have taken advantage of this tariff

concession. To the extent that non-trade barriers are not fully overcome, benefits likely arising from
increasedincorporation of Colombian agriculture into world markets will not be realized.

The enforcement, on January 1, 1995, of the World Trade Organization (WTO) triggered changes in how
international trade of agricultural products would be ruled. Basically, the reason for this was new
legislation on the matter setting in motion the gradual removal of tariff liens, which, so far, have
accounted for the biggest trade constraint. Thus, when those barriers became an alternative to the
establishment of hidden trade barriers, non-tariff barriers became increasingly relevant.         Non-tariff
barriers arisingfrom the implementation of sanitary and phytosanitary measures are outstanding.

Since Colombia enjoys comparative advantages in products such as fruit, vegetable and meat products,
strengthening sanitary and food safety conditions is key to accessingexport markets. Thus, to the extent
that non-trade barriers are not fully overcome, benefits likely arising from increased incorporation of
Colombian agriculture in world markets will not be secured.

The context of the negotiations of the FTA with the United States i s an appropriate place to discuss these
issues. The subscription of a SPS Chapter, by itself, does not guarantee that barriers will be overcome,
and only the strengthening of the SPS systemwill help ensure admissibility to markets ruled by stringent
standards. To the extent that this public good, representing a strengthened national system, may be
provided, conditions conducive to increasing private investment levels in the Colombian agricultural
sector will be enhanced. The return this effort may yield will be beneficial to a paradigm change in the
agro-exporting approach of the sector, with a positive impact on the transition process.

In order to allow for the System to comprehensively work along the various agri-food chains, the
modernization and full operation of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System calls for
investments to be made in some areas already identified. Bearing in mindresource constraints, the focus
to be given to the use of Project resources is the admissibility to international markets with regard to the
SPS of some products or specific chains.           Notwithstanding resource limitations available to this
Component, those resources play a strategic role in the domestic agenda work the country should carry
out to tailor its SPS System to the needs entailed by the larger insertion of the agricultural sector into the
global economy.
The team made up by the Colombian Government to negotiate the SPS Chapter of the FTA with the
United States has conducted a Gap Analysis in which all System organizations have taken part, the
private sector included, with a view to identify the key issues on which strategic activities and
investments must be carried out to improve access to the United States market with specific chain
products. The outcomes of this exercise are compiled on chain-based standardformats that were the basis
for the component to be financed inthis operation and are part of the documentation for preparation of the
component.

Each one of the activities involved considers the necessity of the country to accomplish the international
standards in force, regarding the guidelines of the WTO-SPS Agreements and their supporting
international organizations (OE, IPPC, and Codex).

Finally, and in order to formulate this project, it is necessary to make it clear that beef was chosen within
the meat chain as a highly complex product with regard to sanitary issues, because it faces sanitary
barriers as well as other food safety-related barriers. In addition to its sanitary complexity, beef was
selected because of the importance of the cattle sub-sector in the agricultural setting, and the high
socioeconomic impact likely to be derived from increased admissibility of this product in international
markets.




                                                       59

Likewise, uchuva (Physalis peru~iana)'~ chosen as a product representing the fruit and vegetable
                                                        was
subsector in which the country has comparative advantages and the development of which i s currently
facing sanitary and phytosanitary constraints. Although the investment plan may have been designed on
the basis of overcoming barriers this particular fruit faces, it also covers the needs being faced by a large
portion of the fruit and vegetablechain to successfully accessintemationalmarkets.
Additionally, it must be considered that the public sector plays a fundamental role in this project being
responsible for the design, evaluation, put in force, coordination, inspection and supervision of all the
activities, delegating some responsibilities to the private sector. The legal framework in Colombia has
established the functions that can be done by the private sector. This project will use this faculty to
implement the Authorization System. The main goal is to involve the private sector in the SPS System,
delegating responsibilities so as to increasecapacity.
Objective
The aim of Component 2 is to strengthenthe Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System, enabling it to
respond to the sanitary standards of intemational markets and thereby enhance the admissibility of
agricultural products to these markets.
To achieve this objective the component will finance the following activities: (i)                               training professionals
and technicians attached to the SPS system; (ii)                     capacity strengthening (i.e. training, development of
procedures, equipment, infrastructure) to mitigate the chains-specific sanitary barriers to beef products;
(iii) building(Le.training,developmentofprocedures,equipment,infrastructure)tomitigatethe
       capacity
chains-specific sanitary barriers to fruits and vegetables; (iv) designing and implementing a national SPS
information network; (v) designing and implementing an authorization system allowing for Audit andor
Test and Diagnosis Laboratory activities to be delegatedto a third party; (vi) technology transfer activities
on best practices to improve the sanitary and phytosanitary conditions of agricultural production; and (vii)
the corresponding administrative costs for this component.

To improve the impact of this project, needs identified in the SPS system were prioritized vis-a-vis
requirements of two production chains (beef, and uchuva-physalis) showing a competitive potential
particularly in the US market and which would have a spill-over effect to other chains. The beef chain
was chosen within the livestock sector because their products are highly complex in sanitary terms, not
only because they face not only zoo-sanitary barriers but also other food safety-related barriers. Although
the investment plan may have been designed on the basis of overcoming barriers for a particular fruit
(uchuva) [Physalisperuviana], its range to a great extent covers the needs being faced by a large share of
the fruit and vegetableschain to successfully access intemational markets.

This component will havethe following products: (i) of institutionsattachedto the SPS duly trained
                                                                         staff
in the different subcomponentareas; (ii) phaseof the SPS nationalinformation network in operation;
                                                      first
(iii)authorization system in operation; (iv) achievement of conditions required for international
recognition of meat chain-specific product admissibility (beef); (v) fulfilment of conditions required for
international recognition of fruit and vegetable specific product chain admissibility (uchuva); and (vi)
small farmers trained in Good Agricultural Practices (GAPS) and Good ManufacturingPractices (GMP)
techniques.

The implementation of this component will take advantage of the achievements provided by other
initiatives. Such i s the case for the Support to Productive Partnership project, currently under operation,
whose producer organizations will be targeted as potential beneficiaries of technology transfer on Good
Agricultural Practice.
Target Groups:

0    Institutionsresponsiblefor the implementation and monitoring of sanitary and phytosanitary
     measures: Strengthening of ICA and INVIMA through: staff training; investment in infrastructure;
     information and communication facilities; better norms, regulations and procedures: Regarding ICA,
     an authorization system will be implemented to delegated to a third party auditing and/or test and
     diagnosis laboratory activities.

0    Traditional Export Sector: Any effort made to help strengthen and improve a country's sanitary
     conditions and resulting in the SPS Monitoring and Application Official System being recognized,
     will benefit the traditional export sector, because they are the most able to take advantage of this
     institutional strengthening, despitethe fact they this sector may not be the target group.
Activities
Activities making up this component are divided into two categories. The first category includes
activities focused on overcoming meat chain-specific and fruit and vegetable-specific sanitary barriers to
gain admissibility into international marketsand which would generateexternalities to the benefit of other
production chains.      The second category includes cross-cutting activities that would have general
application and would be focused on four distinct areas: the information and connectivity system, the
establishment of an authorization system allowing for Audit and/or Test and Diagnosis Laboratory
activities to be delegatedto a thirdparty; training, and technology transfer.

Activity1: Training

This activity is aimed at professionals and technicians working in the SPS, to enable them to deal with
changes and developments involved in internationally defined processes or techniques. The training i s
linked to overcoming chain specific barriers and i s designed to allow ICA and INVIMA staff to update
their knowledge by attending academic centers, laboratories, and related agencies abroad. Training will
be replicated by this staff with national organizations and producers involved in selectedchains.

Training in the Beef Chain: Training activities in the following areas will be financed under this
component:
     Animal Health:      (i) Auditing of standards set forth by OIE: Staff from ICA responsible for
     carrying out the foot-and-mouth disease project at regional offices (36) will be trained to enable them
     to efficiently perform auditing of compliance of standards provided for in the Terrestrial Animal
     Health Code. Staff to be appointed to the new control stations (21), and those working in existing
     control posts required for status acceptance by the United States, will be trained to enable them to
     efficiently control animal mobilization both in the foot-and-mouth disease-freearea with vaccination,
     and in the buffer area; (ii)40 inspectors that work in the control stations established in the free zone
     of FMD with vaccination will be trained in inspection and control; (iii) analysis: ICA will
                                                                                     Risk
     provide training to five (5) officers through the United States Cochram Scholarship System, in Fort
     Collins, Colorado. This training i s neededto have a methodologicaltool to assess the managementof
     diseases and redesign the surveillance and control programs in order to fulfil the international
     requirements. Travel cost will be covered in this case; (iv) Sanitary and phytosanitary measures
     regarding international exchange: Becauseports and airports are the first sanitary barrier in a country,
     28 ICA officers will be trained inColombia inexport-import sanitary international regulations, and in
     exotic and prevalent diseases, so that they are able to apply this knowledge to import control and

    two-week training in the United States, based on inspection system for slaughterhouses; (ii)      One
    INVIMA's officer will be trained inRisk Analysis focus mainly in pathogens inorder to work inthe
    redefinition of requirements to be set up in the slaughterhousesand processing plants in the country;
    and (iii) Pathogen Diagnosis: Three (3) INVIMA and two (2) ICA officers will be trained in this area
    so that a technical-scientific capacity can be developed to control pathogens and heavy metals (in
    fresh and processed products) for both domestic consumption and export. This two-week training
    course will be provided inthe UnitedStates by the UnitedStates Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    and by the Food Safety and Inspection Services (FSIS).


    Food Safety Residues Control and Detection:              (i)Organization and management of residue
    programs: three ICA officers will be trained in this area. They will be trained in organization and
    management on the programs regarding chemical residues control with especial emphasis in the
    chemical and biological control in primary production. They will be responsible for verifying
    compliance with both domestic sanitary requirements and importing countries requirements; (ii)
    Animal Residues Analysis: four ICA officers (three chemists and one microbiologist) will be given
    one month's training in Europe, so that cutting edge technology capacity can be incorporated into the
    analysis of samples being processed at laboratories. Also, three INVIMA officers working at the
    reference laboratory will be trained in the areas of residues and pollutants; and (iii)
                                                                                          Farm Inspection:
    sixty veterinarians will be trained in Colombia to work as farm inspectors, so that they can take part
    in registration and follow-up of cattle herds supplying animals to be slaughtered at ICA-controlled
    slaughterhouses. Based on the knowledge acquired by the professionals formed in specialized centres
    and the national experience inthis sense, these veterinarians will be trained to establish and supervise
    the programs on sanitary, biological andchemical risks in the farms that have animals for export. This
    i s to be considered as Good Agricultural Practices with especial emphasis in the use of veterinary
    drugs and animal feed.

    Food Safety Quality Assurance System: (i)          inspection: 2 INVIMA and 3 ICA officers will be
    trained on slaughterhouse inspection duties. This training will be done in Chile for 15 days; (ii)

                                                                                            As
    European inspection system, their procedures in food safety and ruling, must be known and a visit
    with this objective will be done; and (iv) GoodPractices: Two INVIMA and three ICA will be trained
    in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP),
    official inspections, physical pollutants and internal audits. This two-week training will be provided
    inthe UnitedStatesthrough the CochramScholarship System.

    Food Safety Traceability: Twenty-five ICA and five INVIMA officers will be trained to be
    responsible for the certification and verification of origin inthe farms and procedures implemented in
    slaughterhouses class 1. ICA's officers will be trained in animal identification and traceability from
    the farm through the slaughterhouse, while INVIMA's officers will be trained beginning from
    processing plants through retailing.

Training in the Fruit and Vegetables (Uchuva-Physalis) Chain: In this area, the following activities
will be financed:



                                                     62

a  Plant Protection: (i) Quarantine: Five officers belonging to the ICA's central level will be
                          Plant

   phytosanitary inspection methodology in the field and in the border points and traceability for fruits
   and vegetables will be done in at least two different countries; (ii)     Inspection Techniques: 40
   officers working in terrestrial, port and aerial control points will be trained indiagnosis techniques,
   inspection methodology and national legislation; (iii)    Quarantine Treatments: Two ICA officers
   will be trained in quarantine treatments (one in Chile in 2006, and one in Mexico in 2007), so they
   become aware of, and increase technical capacity in the management of different treatments, such as
   hot steam, cold treatments, and ionising radiation; (iv)Diagnosis Techniques: Two officers will be
   trained, in serology techniques and one in mite identification. Additionally thirty ICA field-level
   officers will be trained in cutting edge technologies in Colombia. Ticket cost and per diem expenses
   have been allocated to a one-week course; and (v) Epidemiological Surveillance: Three ICA officers
   will be trained in diagnosis and detection strategies through the establishment of fruit fly (Ceratitis
   cupitutu) monitoring networks. This one-month training will be provided by MOSCAMED, in
   Mexico. Also, 20 section-level ICA officers will be trained inColombia in diagnosis, monitoring, and
   handlingof the national fruit fly information system.

   and vegetables; and (v) Good Agricultural Practices: Six officers will be trained in the
   implementation of GAPS.

Activity 2: Capacity Building to OvercomeSpecific Sanitary Barriers to the Beef Market
The following activities will be financed:
   Procedures to Ensure Recognition of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease-Free Area: (i)new
   prefabricated control posts (21) will be located in 2006 in the area habilitatedfor export purposes by
   the United States. The existing area will be strengthened with these posts, and the new area will be
   controlled; (ii)Communication Equipment (21 sets): Equipment required to enable round-the-clock
   communication among national offices, regional offices, and control posts, will be allocated to
   control posts, allowing their reaction capacity to be increased and the decision-making process to be
   benefited in any eventuality; and (iii)  Level 3 biosafety laboratory (NSB3A): investment required to
   enlarge and improve the capacity of an existing ICA laboratory to comply with internationalbiosafety
   standards regarding foot-and-mouth disease (isolation of current facilities, equipment for air
   recycling, water treatment, and filters).
   Implementation of the veterinary drug residue control plan. Procurement of Equipment and
   Standards: The purchase of a mass absorption kit and the adaptation of the microbiological section,
   which involves purchase of equipment for standardization of detection of chemical residues and
   microbiological pollutants.

Activity 3: CapaciQ Building to Overcome Barriers to the Fruit and Vegetables (Uchuva-Physalis)
Market
The following actions will be financed to facilitate the entry into the U.S. market of fruit and vegetables
usinguchuva-Physalisas a model:

    0   Surveillance: (i)developing procedures to gain recognition of a fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata)
        low-prevalence area. To facilitate U S market access for fruits and vegetables it i s necessaryto
        strengthen the capacity for control and surveillance in fruit fly low-prevalence areas. ICA will
        purchasetransport equipment (10 cars and 20 motorcycles); (ii)   Strengthening of surveillance in
        frontier transit posts. equipment for diagnosis laboratories located in ports, airports and frontier
        transit posts will be acquired (microscopes, stereoscopes, electric magnifier lenses); and (iii)
        Strengthening of Plant diagnosis laboratories: equipment for diagnosis laboratories located in
        BogotB, Medellin and Palmira (Type I1laminar flow chamber, ELISA reader, Thermo-cycler for
        molecular biology, Electrophoresis UV/DNAGel reader, micro-pipette, incubator, -75C freezer).


    0   Food Safety: (i)MLR's determination in pesticides. In order to support the tolerance and
        pesticide residues assessment processes for fruits and vegetables, replacement of the Laboratorio
        Nacional de Znsumos Agropecuarios(LANIA)both liquidand gas chromatographs i s required. In
        addition, acquisition of three homogenizers and a freezer i s also needed. INVIMA, needs
        equipment for the enhancement of the food microbiological laboratory as well as for the analysis
        of pesticide residues; (ii)  LANIA needs to have some infrastructure refurbished, in order to
        accomplish with the requirements in the export markets. Inthis sense, the Research Center of
        Tibaitathwill be refurbished; and (iii)
                                              Consultancies: consultancies will be conducted to design a
        technical and economically viable methodology to determine Maximum Residues Limits or
        Tolerance under national conditions, based on international legislation and successful
        experiences.

Activity 4: Design and Development of the First Phase of the National SPS Information Network
Phase
This activity is focused on supplying ongoing, timely, and reliable information to staff attached to
organizations linked to the SPS system, to users, and to the general public, adding to the maintenance of
sanitary and phytosanitary conditions in line with international standards. An up-to-date information
systemi s required to overcome barriers inboth meat and fruit and vegetablechains.
Following this line of thinking, and due to the fact that ICA and INVIMA show a technological
backwardness in terms of informatics, up-to-date tools, and staff conversant with this subject, should be
made available so that more dynamic interactionand more efficient service provision can be achieved.
Inorder to overcomethisbarriersoftware is neededthat allows the harmonizationinthe managementof
information, both in ICA and INVIMA. The network should cover all the country inorder to establish and
maintain procedures that support all the emergency decisions. Additionally software systems including
the quantitative Risk Analysis Process that supports decision-making with reliable statistical analysis
must be a complement of this system.
The following activities will be financed:

Informationsystemequipment regarding meat chain:
    0   21computers, software and printers for new control posts (ICA).

    0   23 computers, software and printers for existingcontrol posts (ICA).

Activity 5: Designing and Implementing theAuthorization Process
The following activities will be financed:
    Studies: Since an authorization system already exists for both ICA and INVIMA, but it is not fully
    operational, it i s necessary to carry out a diagnosis of adjustments required by this System. This
    diagnosis will be include: (i):  identification, access to, and analysis of regulations and institutional
    setting as regards issues related to standardization, certification, accreditation, conformity auditing,
    harmonization, and homologation of the quality system; (ii)a comparative analysis between
    Colombia and Chile, Brazil, the United States, and the European Union on these matters; (iii)       legal
    and economic viability to allow for ICA and INVIMA to put in place the authorization system; (iv)
    design of follow-up mechanisms; and (v) another consulting study will be carried out to perform an
    ex post evaluation of the system and determine legal, technical and economic adjustmentsthat should
    be made to improve system's efficiency.
    Internal Auditor and Chief Auditor Training: Two courses attended by ICA and INVIMA staff
    will be given in each case. Staff will be responsible for monitoring and follow-up of agencies and
    laboratories authorized. Nationally and internationally recognized auditor-training organizations,
    such as ICONTEC, Bureau Veritas, or SGS, will provide training. Staff to be in charge of laboratory
    auditing will be trained in the NTC IS0 17250 standard, while staff to be in charge of monitoring of
    inspection agencies will be trained in HACCP, BPM, and I S 0 9001 standards.
    Exchange with the Chilean Veterinarian Accreditation System: A 15-day visit to SAG-Chile will
    be scheduled for officers (2 from ICA and 1 from INVIMA) to get acquainted with the legal,
    institutional, and operational framework of veterinarian accreditation in Chile.        Training should
    include an analysis of documents governing the accreditation process, and field visits to accompany a
    SAGofficer to follow upon accredited veterinarians, and meetings will be heldwith systemusers.

Activity 6: Technology Transfer Activities
Technology Transfer     -Beef:
Because improving sanitary and phytosanitary conditions of Colombian agricultural production i s
dependent upon the use of good agricultural practices, technology transfer is envisioned with a focus on
changing small-farmer culture, towards the adoption of quality and food safety systems at farm level.
Particular emphasis will be made on good practices on animal drug use and animal feeding. This
technology transfer would be made possible by means of dissemination and training activities seeking to
implement these practices.

Investment, carried out by ICA, will include:

     e   4 dissemination campaignson GoodManufacturingPractices.

     e   4 information campaign on agricultural inputuse.

     e   4 information campaign on HACCP.


Technology Transfer    -Fruit    andvegetables:

Obstacles for the implementation of Good Agricultural Practices in Colombia relate to the low awareness
on this subject, the limited transfer of technology and the non-existence of incentives for the adoption of
these practices. Inconsequence, it is priority to establish a programto transfer GAP for extensionists and
facilitators. The program will include the preparation of training        materials and will be targeting
technicians from public, private or mixed Technical Assistance Providers Enterprises; technicians from
private and public institutions related to this field (ICA, Corpoica, others research centers, Universities
and sector enterprises), and producer organizations involved in production chains selected by fruits and
vegetables producingregions.

This program will be based on ongoing experiences such as GAP on Physalis (SENA - ANALDEX -
ASOHOFRUCOL - ICA Project) and EUREPGAP certification of fruits                          (Gobernacidn de
Cundinamarca-ANALDEX- Chamber of Commerce of Bogota-IICA).
Investment, carried out by ICA, will include:

     e   6 informationcampaign onpest prevention and surveillance

     e   2 dissemination campaign on GoodAgricultural Practices.

     e   4 dissemination campaign on the authorization system.

TheFrameworkfor Implementation:
Productionchains
Project implementation will make use of the production chain as the institutional platform which will
permit it to respond to the demands of all the actors interrelated in specific productive contexts, and
generating benefits to the chain as a whole. The origin of production chains can be traced to the
"Acuerdos De Competitividad" and "Acuerdos de Competitividad Exportadora". Backed by the National
Council for Competitiveness, these agreements allowed for enhanced cooperation between public and
private actors in different sectors. This positive impact led to the adoption of Law 811/2003 whereby
productionchains were formalized.
Chain organizations are formed by national and regional entrepreneurs, industries and representative
organizations of a wide array of agrarian subsectors. Their objectives include: a) improvingproductivity
and competitiveness; b) developing markets for chain goods and factors of production; c) reducing
transaction costs between chain members; d) establishing alliances; d) increasing the exchange and flow
of information among actors; e) integrating small producers and entrepreneurs; and f) fostering the
sustainablemanagementof natural resourcesand the environment.
The number of chain organizations and agreements increased substantially between 1998 and 2002. The
Government's purpose of moving the agreements from the national to the regional and local levels was
based on integrating a new instrument called "rural agro enterprise nuclei", in the "Regional Chain
Councils" (CRC's). At least 60 nuclei are currently operating throughout the country. These regional
nuclei consolidate the initiatives of chain members in order to improve competitiveness, conduct market
analysis, identify specific chain needs and express these as formal demands, and enhance cooperation and
economic performance at individual and collective levels. Regional institutional capacities have therefore
been validated and placed to the advantage of the chain organizations. The CRC's are integrated into
"National Chain Councils" (CNC's), where public and private initiatives from severalregions for a single
product are brought together, inan effort for coherence.
For instance, R&D agendas defined in a participatory manner within the production chains, not only will
be a key inputto reachcooperation agreementsamong different chain participants but will also contribute
to determining other agendas at both the regional and national levels. For this reason the activities of
Component 1 include the strengthening of production chain capacities to identify their own
competitiveness-related priorities, to provide incentives for co financing of R&D initiatives, and to secure
long-termfinancing required for this type of activities.
Inconsequence, prospective researchagendas andthe process through which they are built will constitute
one of the most important institutional innovations promoted by this project to the strengthening of the
sector competitiveness in Colombia.
Likewise in order to strengthen the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System the project will
work within the productionchain framework. Bearing in mindresource constraints, the focus to be given
to the use of Project resourcesi s the admissibility to international markets with regard to the SPS of some
products or specific chains that will have a "spill-over" effect inother chains.
This is the case for the two commodity chains, beef and uchuva-Physalis which will be the focus of
resources in this component. Beef was chosen within the meat chain as a highly complex product with
regard to sanitary issues and because of the importance of the cattle sub-sector in the farm sector.

Likewise, uchuva (Physalisperu~iana)'~ chosen as a product representing the fruit and vegetable
                                                         was
sub-sector in which the country has comparative advantages and the development of which is currently
facing sanitary and phytosanitary constraints. These constraints are shared with a large portion of the
fruit and vegetablechains so their resolution shouldbeapplicable to a wider rangeof commodities.

Competitiveallocationof fundingfor science and technology

Project implementation ,will also make use of the country's experience in implementing competitive
mechanisms for public funding of demand-driven R&D subprojects. MARD, both in the PRONATTA
project and the present program, and COLCIENCIAS experience in putting in place and operating
competitive funds with the support of a Funds Administrator, will be used in this Project, replicating the
existing competitive mechanisms and seeking opportunities to strengthen and consolidate their operation
and more important, to improve the quality and scope of R&Dagendas.

In line with the above, the Project will strengthen the production chain capacities in the definition of
prospective R&D agendas and the design and operation of a Competitive Fund to implement priority
R&D subprojects. The prospective exercises will be performed in co-ordination with the National
Foresight Programme being implemented by COLCIENCIAS, and the active involvement of regional-
level actors through the production chains organization.

There i s an already an ongoing program in the MARD which has executed two calls for proposals in the
past year which allocates resources on a competitive basis to support R&D in the sector. This operation
will support this program duringthe life of the project.
InstitutionalArrangementsfor Implementation

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) will be the agency responsible for project
implementation. The MARD has broad experience with Bank-financed projects. It currently implements
the Productive Partnerships Support Project Apoyo a Alianzas Productivas (BIRF 7097-CO).                                                The
previously implemented projects are PRONATTA (BIRF 3871-CO) closed in December 2003 and the
Peasant Enterprise Zone Development Project - Zonas de Resewas Campesinas(BIRF 4367-CO) closed
in December 2003.               The MARD also has experience in implementing projects financed by other
international donors such as IFAD(Pademer) andIADB.

Project Oversight. The Minister of Agriculture will appoint a Project Board of Directors to provide
strategic guidance on Project implementation, and to ensure it conforms to national policies. The Board
will be chaired by the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development. It will be composed of the
Deputy Director to the National Department of Planning; the Director of the Colombian Institute for the
Development of Science and Technology (COLCIENCIAS); the Director of the ICA; the Chairman of the
National Council of Agriculture Secretaries on behalf of the regions (CONSA); and 4 private sector
representatives. This Board will be responsible for ensuring the coherence between Project activities and
public policy, as well as obtaining the appropriate support from the institutions of the National S&T and
SPS Systems. It will approve the Project's Annual Operational Plans and review the Project's progress

Physalis peruviana Land to the taxonomical family Solanaceae. It is characterized by its high content of vitamin A and C, Iron and Phosphorus.
It i s known in Colombia as a commercial crop since the SO'S, when it beganto have recognition in international markets. Currently, Colombia is
the world largest producer of uchuva, followedby South Africa. Uchuva fruit is a rounded berry with a diameter between 1.25 and 2.5 cms and a
weight of 4 to 10 grams covered by a five-sepal calyx which provides protection against pests. Total national production is estimated in 7.500
tons in 550 hectares. Interms of value and volume, Physalis is currently the third most important export fruit in Colombia after Banana and
plantain. In2003, 2.700 tons were exported valued 8.9 million dollars. Physalis is mostly consumed in fresh but some processing i s made to
producejam and caramelizedberries.

Implementation Reports prepared by the PCU as well as approving the portfolio of subprojects selected
and presented to it, by the Peer Review Panel. The Board should meet at least twice a year with the
option of meeting when deemed necessary by the PCU coordinator. The PCU coordinator will be the
technical secretary of the Board.
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU). A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be created with the
responsibility of implementing the Agricultural Transition Project. This Unit will report directly to the
Director of Technological Development and Sanitary Protection Directorate (DDTPS) within the MARD;
in turn, the Director of DDTPS would report directly to the Vice Minister of Agriculture. A Project
Coordinator will be appointed who would be reporting to the DDTPS Director on matters related to
Project implementation.     The Project Coordinator will be supported by six staff (see PCU's staff
composition below).
The PCU will be structured as a technological-administrative unit closely linked with the three technical
groups within the MARD's DDTPS (the Technological Development Group, the Sanitary Protection
Group, and the Genetic Resources, Biosafety and Intellectual Property Group). The participation of
technical groups and or professionals from MARD's Directorates will be facilitated by the Project's
Operational Committee.
StanComposition ofthe PCU. As mentionedabove the PCU will be composed of a Project Coordinator,
a Financial Specialist, a Procurement Specialist, an M&E Specialist, two Knowledge and Innovation
Specialists (one responsible for coordinating Subcomponent 1 activities and other responsible for
coordinating Subcomponent 2 activities of Component 1 of the Project), a SPS Specialist and a Secretary.
Inaddition, MARD will assign a1leasttwo counterpart officers to work inclose relationship with PCU's
M&Eand Financial Specialists, as a meanto strengthenMARD's institutionalfiduciary capacity. These
officers would be also part of the team responsible for closing of the activities of the Project at the end of
the operation period, thus contributing to assure continuity within the MARD. Staff from the MARD or
ICA could be engaged as a member of the PCU only when selected on a competitive basis, and fulfilling
the requirements established for the corresponding position as stated in the Operational Manual (OM),
and with the previous no-objection from the Bank. Inaddition, these professionals must be assignedon a
full-time basis to the activities of the PCU, and as a result, he or she will report directly to the PCU
Coordinator.
Responsibilities ofthe PCU. The PCU will be responsible of the general coordination of the Project's
implementation, coordinatingthe activities of all the entities involved inthe execution of the Project both
inside and outside the MARD. To carry out this task, the PCU will have the following responsibilities
among others: (i)   implementation and monitoring of the Project at the national level; (ii) be the  to
principal contact with the World Bank in Project supervision; (iii)      to coordinate the monitoring and
evaluation system and Project audit; (iv) maintain the Project's Operational Manual up-to-date; (v)
supervision of the Funds Administrator that will be contracted for Project resource management; (vi) to
consolidate and update the Project annual operative plans; (vii) to periodically update the Procurement
Plan; (viii) to consolidate physical and financial progress reports to the Bank and other institutions; and
(ix) to preparecredit disbursement requirements and ensure on the time flow of funds.
The MARD, through a public bidding, will hire a Funds Administrator for the Project funds
administration. The main responsibilities of this entity will be: (i)     to sign contracts and requests to
acquire goods and services, based on the terms of reference (TOR), technical specifications and
requirements made by MARD through the PCU; (ii) make the payments of each one of the contracts
                                                       to
and acquisitions according to MARDrequest; (iii)   to carry out Project accountancy; (iv) to update Project
income and expenditures and (v) to prepare and submit on the time and format-based reports as requested
by PCU.
Project Operational Committee. Currently, a Technical Directorates Committee, chaired by the Deputy
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and with the participation of all MARD's Technical


                                                    73

Directorates operates through weekly meetings. The Project will make use of this Committee of
Directorates converting one of its weekly sessions, in a monthly session of what i s called the Project's
Operational Committee. In this session, the PCU Coordinator will act as the technical secretariat of the
Operative Committee, will propose the meeting agenda and, when deemed necessary, will suggest the
participation of other external agencies involved in the implementation of Project.
Expert Panel (Peer Reviewers). The Expert Panel will review and evaluate subproject proposals for the
Competitive Fund, and recommend through the MARD selected proposals for financing to the Board of
Directors. Taking advantage of valuable lessons learned from PRONATTA, these panels will include at
least two experts on Safeguards as related to the sections in Annex 10. The essential safeguard experts
would be an environmental expert and a social expert, who will review the overall projects' potential
environmental and social effects and also the specific selection criteria for the screening of subproject
proposals, selection of subprojects and environmental effects of each selected subproject. Evaluations
and recommendations from these experts will be considered in defining the terms for contracts signed
between the MARD and the subprojects' executors and will also be taken into account as an indicator to
perform monitoring and evaluation that will be implemented by the PCU.
The Competitive Fund.        One of the Project strategies will be the operation of a demand driven
Competitive Fund to improve resource allocation and strengthen the provision of technology and
innovation in agriculture. Additionally, and capitalizing on the lessons learnt from other initiatives such
as PRONATTA, this project not only emphasizes competitive mechanisms to optimize resources
allocation for R&D, but also encourages cooperation and partnership to access funds to respond to the
demand-driven researchagendas.
The implementation of this fund will be governed by the rules established in the Project Operational
Manual. Any adjustments in the operational procedure of the calls for proposal and subproject selection
will be included in the Project Operational Manual, with previous approval (no objection) obtained from
the Technical Committee of the project and the World Bank.
The OperationalManual. Administrativeproceduresto be followed for project implementationpurposes
will be defined inthe Operation Manual (OM), to be deemedas the working document guidingthe project
implementing activities. This Manual will be adopted by the MARD and provide detailed information
regarding PCU and Funds Administrator functions, TORSfor PCU, subprojects eligibility criteria for
Component 1Competitive Co-financing, financial and administrative procedures, auditing, procurement
procedures, monitoring and evaluation activities, as well as the EnvironmentalAction Plan (EAP) and the
Pest Management Framework (PMF).           This Manual will also contain a summary of the objective,
activities and costs of the componentsand illustrate the administrative structure, the roles and functions of
the Boardof Directors and the FundsAdministrator.
Annual Operational Plans. Annual Operational Plans (AOP) will be consolidated by the PCU and
approved by the Project's Board of Directors and sent to the Bank for its no-objection, not later than
November 30 of each year during the Project's implementation period. The AOPs will indicate the
activities to be undertaken in each ComponendSubcomponent of the Project, the goals to be achieved
duringthe period, the responsible unidperson and the timetable for the execution of each activity and the
budget allocated to each task. The AOP serves as the main managerial tool for PCU Coordinator and
facilitates the Bank's biannual supervision of the Project.
Implementation Reports. ProgressImplementationReports will be prepared by the PCUto be submitted
to the Project's Board of Directors and to the Bank on a semi-annual basis; the Operation Manual will
indicate the content and specifications of this Report. Subprojects Monitoring and Evaluation Reports
(sample base selection) financed by the Competitive Fund will be prepared by independent experts. An
ExternalMid-Term review and an ExternalEndof Project Impact Analysis will be prepared.

Institutional Context and Linkages.
During implementation the project will interact with several agencies as well as regional institutions
linked both to the national SPS and S&T systems (Universities, CPGA, NGOs, producer organizations,
etc.).  Under Component 1, the PCU, with support from DDTPS and DCP, through the Technical
Secretariats of the National and Regional Production Chain Councils, will work with agencies and
organizations participating in the production chains in the consolidation of R&D prospective agendas.
Under Component 2, the PCU will promote coordinating mechanisms with ICA and INVIMA (the two
main institutions that would be involved in the implementation of this Component) to assure proper
Project's execution (see Figure A.6.1).    The Project's Operative Committee that will facilitate inter-
institutional operative mechanisms.

At the regional level, the Project will work with the production chains institutional platform, specifically
with the Regional Chain Councils (CRCs). The PCU (with the support of MARD's DDTPS and DCP)
will coordinate with the Technical Secretariats of the CRCs the implementation of certain activities of
the Project, mainly those related with the preparation of the prospective R&D agendas. The Technical
Secretaries will communicate Project information and priorities at a regional level; as well as promoting
the project and coordinating with MARD-DCP's chain coordinators. At the national level, the Technical
Secretaries are responsible for the coordination of processes leading to the participative design of
prospective agendas.

These Chain Councils will furnish the scenario for:          a) capturing demand from private sector
organizations (including small farmers organizations) that would be channeled to the competitive fund in
the Project's Knowledge and Innovation Component; b) identifying sanitary and phytosanitary conditions
in relevant subsectors; and, c) creating synergies between MARD and other sector and non sector
agencies (i.e. MPS, INVIMA, MCIT) participating inProject's implementation.

Given these existing arrangements, the Project will place an important emphasis on the capacities of
CRC's. The relationship between their Technical Secretaries and MARD Chain Coordinators clearly
works in favor of a better coordination between the central level and the regions. In order to strengthen
their pivotal role in the regional implementationof the Project's Sanitary and Phytosanitary Component,
it will be necessary to incorporate new CRC members, including Health Secretaries, and ICA and
INVIMA representatives, among others. The task of introducing and highlightingthese issues will be
assumedby MARD Chain Coordinators intheir annual work plans.

Country Issues

A Country Financial Accountability Assessment(CFAA) was completed inJuly 2004. The critical issues
affecting projects include the tight fiscal situation, budget and administrative processes that can cause
delays in implementation, and the national chart of accounts which extends to sub-national levels of
Government. At the project level, the Bank i s currently engage with the Government to improve project
financial management by: (a) improving the operation of Special Accounts held at the central bank and
related mechanisms for receiving and managing cash, (b) decreasing the incentives to employ
international cooperation agencies to manage project funds; and (c) improving and streamlining the
accounting and reporting requirements agreed upon in November 2002 between the Bank and the
country's Accountant General and Auditor's General Office.

Financial Management Assessment
A Financial Management Assessment (FMA) of MARD was carried out during preappraisal and
conducted in accordance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Guidelines for the Assessment of Financial
Management Arrangements inthe World Bank Financed Projects. The assessment concluded that MARD
lacks sufficient capacity to manage project financial matters and administer loan funds due to insufficient
financial staff, duplication resulted from manual systems for operational processes, and weak accounting
software. Therefore, it i s recommended that an Administrative and Financial officer be hired to support
the project coordinating group, and that hidher responsibilities will include the coordination of financial
and administrative issues related to project budgeting and general accounting with MARD, project
payments, project accounting and financial reporting to MARD and the Bank with support of a Funds
Administrator that will be contracted for accounting and payments.

Organization/Staffing
Details of the project implementation structure, workflows and staffing already have been described inthe
Annex 6. The project coordinating group of the Technological Development and Sanitary Protection
Directorate (DDTPS) would be responsible for keeping the project financial management arrangements
with assistance from a Funds Administrator that will be selected through a competitive process and that
will be responsible for: (i)  signingcontracts and requeststo acquire goods and services and subprojects
basedon the terms of reference (TOR),technical specifications and requirements made by MARDthrough
the PCU; (ii)   making payments of each one of the contracts, acquisitions, and subprojects agreements
according to MARD request; (iii)     project accounting; (iv) preparing quarterly expenditures forecast for
disbursements, (v) updating Project income and expenditures and (v) preparing and submitting on time
and format-based reports as requested by PCU. DDTPS would be staffed with a qualified professional
with clear terms of reference and responsibilities. The principal responsibilities of the Administrative and
Financial Officer are to: (a) request and analyze monthly project financial information from the Funds
Administrator; (b) make sure that project financial information of loan funds i s registered in the MARD
accounting and budgeting systems, and SIIF (national government's integrated financial system); (c)
review financial reports and Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) prepared by the Funds Administrator,
obtaining MARD's and MHCP's approval and submitting them to the Bank for reimbursement; (d)
review the financial monitoring reports (FMRs), prepared by the Funds Administrator, completing the
process of signatures and distribution in MARD and the Bank; (e) prepare monthly reconciliations of the
special account and submit       a copy to the Bank along with the withdrawals request; (f) prepare
administrative, financial, and accounting procedures necessary to account project transactions and


                                                     77

financial information reports (g) with MARD support define the project Chart of Accounts and the
accounting procedures to be implemented by the Funds Administrator complying with Resolution 380,
2002 and related laws stated for investment projects in Colombia. (h) practice periodic financial
reconciliations with the Funds Administrator; (i)    coordinate with DAF and DDTPS inMARD, regarding
budgetary aspects including registration, assignment, incorporation, and execution of resources, in the
respective fiscal year; (i) support the project manager in the administrative and inter-institutional
coordination process necessary for project implementation; (k) support the requests for contracts,
payments, (1) prepare and send to the Bank for no objection the terms of reference for external audits
along with the short list for its selection; (m) attend and disseminatethe auditors project requirements and
recommendations; (n) support the periodic evaluation of the project;    (0)practice internal control over all
the operations executed in the different components of the project, in particular those related with
disbursements, withdrawals from the Loan Account, and transfers to beneficiaries; (p) supervise the
Funds Administrator, particularly in ensuring the maintenance of separate accounts and registration of
financial operations, resources, and expenditures, in accordance with the norms acceptable to the Bank;
(4) propose measures to be taken when there is evidence of incorrect use of project funds; (r) participate
in the preparation of Project Annual Investment Plan, indicating the Bank financing each component, (s)
coordinate with the Bank, MHCP, MARD, and the Funds Administrator all the steps for the correct and
adequate flow of project funds; and (t) preserveand classify project information to facilitate audits and ex
post reviews by the Bank.

Internal Controls

The internal control system of the project would incorporate the policies and procedures established by
MARD in order to achieve the objectives and targets by the project and assure its efficient execution,
including incorporation of the administrative policies, the safeguard of goods, the prevention and
detection of fraud and errors, the complete and timely presentation and registration of financial
transactions, and the reliablefinancial information.

The procedures of the internal control system would ensure that:          (a) the procurement process has
followed the procedures established in the loan agreement and the project's operational manual; (b)
documents files are reliable and functional; (c) the Project i s executed according to administrative
processes and legally and fiscally valid norms; (d) the financial and accounting system supplies
information according to established accounting norms, is accessible to users, supplies adequate
information for audits, and provides reliable and suitable information; (e) the financial arches are
periodically and effectively done and secure systems are used to control the deposits and disbursement of
funds; and (0 the Project has established the procedures for planning and monitoring its activities,
including procurement of goods, works, and consultants, and the projection of cash flow of loan and local
counterpart funds.

ExternalAudit
The annual financial statements, SOEs, and deposits and withdrawals from the Special Account (Project
accounts) would be audited each year by an independent auditing firm hired by MARD under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. In addition to the annual financial statements conforming to the
International Standards of Auditing (WAC Standards), the audit report would include comments on the
accuracy and propriety of all expenditures, project management, eligibility for financing in terms of the
project's legal agreements, and standards of record keepingand internal controls related to the foregoing,
and on the extent to which supporting information could be relied upon as a basis for requesting
disbursementsfrom the loan usingFMRs. Audit reports and related statements would be submitted to the
Bank within six months of the end of the Borrower's fiscal year.

Written Procedures.
Project financial procedures will be described in the Operational Manual (OM), which will define the
roles and responsibilities of the project coordinating group, MARD, and the FundsAdministrator that will
be involve inproject implementation. The O M will be submitted to the Bank before negotiations and will
include among other financial procedures: (a) accounting policies and procedures including basis of
accounting; (b) cash flow charts with detailed processes; (c) reporting requirements of the Funds
Administrator, (d) formats and instructions of the FinancialMonitoring Reports (Res. 380, 2002 and other
related regulations); (e) internal control procedures including criteria and procedures for processing
payments; (f)records management, and (g) audit arrangements.

Accounting and Information Systems. As part of the FM assessment, the Bank will review the
accounting and information systems to be used for the project by the Funds Administrator before it is
finally accepted. For consolidation of general project financial information with MARD the systems will
be the ones already implemented inMARD.

Funds Flow and CashManagement.
The Bank would disburse the proceeds of the loan into a Special Account in US dollars in the nameof the
project, held by the National Treasury and Credit in the Central Bank. The project coordinating group
through the Director of DDTPS will request the National Treasury and Credit to convert the necessary
amounts into Colombian pesos and transfer them to the selected Funds Administrator to make eligible
payments.

Financial and Management Reporting. The project coordinating group with MARD's DAF and the
Funds Administrator will prepare Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) in conformity with Resolution
380,2002 of the Colombian Accountant General's Office for internal purposes, and informMARD of any
project development. FMRs will be sent to the Bank semiannually within 45 days after the end of each
such period (i.e. by August 15 and February 15). Resolution 380 of 2002 i s presently being reviewed by
the Bank and the Country's Accountant General and Auditor General's Office to simplify the reports and
improve their use for Project monitoring. The FMRs will serve as a basis for the annual audit of financial
statements.

Financial Management Risk. FMrisk in this project i s considered to be Moderate. The loan amount i s
high; however MARDhas implemented severalBank projects and fund administrators inColombia, have
generally good capacity and good record inthe administration of project funds. The risk will be mitigated
with the financial management assessment to be performed to the Funds Administrator before its final
selection.
Disbursement Arrangements
New Eligibility Policy. The project incorporates the Bank's new policy on eligibility for Bank financing.
This policy was approved by the Bank Board of Directors on April 13, 2004. To implement the policy,
the Country Financing Parameters for Colombia were approved by the LCR Regional Vice president in
May 2004.
The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of four years, with effectiveness expected on
September 30, 2005, through the end of the second quarter of FY 2009, with Project Completion Date
expectedon September 30,2009, and a Loan Closing Date of March 31,2010.

Disbursement Mechanisms and Documentation. While it is contemplated that disbursements will be
madeon the basis of the traditional transaction-basedmechanism, given the nature of this project and that
the bulk of disbursements for the subprojects (which represents approximately 70% of total project) are
processed in trunches in accordance with the financing agreements with beneficiaries resulting from the
competitive funds, and to facilitate alignment of the project request for disbursements with the financial
reports and allocated budget, the Bank team deems appropriate to evaluate in the near future the
possibility of transitioningthis project from traditionaldisbursementsto report-baseddisbursements.
Irrespective of the disbursement mechanism to be implemented for this project and to facilitate project
implementation, the project will have access to funds advanced by the Bank to a Special Account in US
dollars for processing disbursements for eligible expenditures under project activities. Funds deposited
into the Special Account as advances (depending on the disbursement mechanism) will follow the Bank's
disbursement operating policies and proceduresestablished for each mechanism as described in the Loan
Agreement and inthe disbursementLetter as the case may be.
Transaction-baseddisbursements. Inthis case, and authorized allocation for advancesmade into the
Special Account will be established. The authorized allocation for the account will be equal to 10% of
loan amount, and the project could request such advance as needed once the loan i s declare effective.
Once the initial deposit has been provided, MARD will submit subsequent withdrawal applications
requests for replenishments to the Special Account on a monthly basis. All withdrawal applications will
be fully supported by appropriate supporting documentation (i.e. invoices, receipts, and any other
evidence of payment) except for those expenditures for contracts not subject to prior review and for which
the Bank has approved the use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), as referred to in the Legal
Agreement and the Disbursement Letter. The project coordinating group with the assistance of the Funds
Administrator will be responsible for preparing and submittingwithdrawal applications to the Bank. All
supporting documentation of withdrawal applications (including those for which SOEs are used) should
be retained at its central location and be available for review by the Bank supervision missions and
independent auditors.

Use of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Loan withdrawal applications will be supported by SOEs for
all expenditures not requiring the Bank's prior review:         (a) contracts for works costing less than
US$350,000 equivalent; (b) contracts for goods costing less than US$50,000 equivalent, (c) contracts for
consulting firms costing less than US$lOO,OOO, (d) contracts for individual consultants, (e) training, (f)all
subprojects, and (g) operating costs. Co-financing for research subprojects will be disbursed following
financial terms of the subproject agreements.        SOEs for these Co-financings will be supported by
paymentstransfer to subproject beneficiaries.
Report-basedDisbursements: Inthe case that withdrawals of loan proceeds are madeusingReport-based
disbursements, the Bank will deposit into the Special Account an amount which the Bank has determined,
basedof the reports submitted (FMRs and additional reports for disbursement purposes) that i s required in
order to finance eligible expenditures during the next two period (no more than 6 months) following the
reportingperiod of such F'MRs. The borrower should submit withdrawal applications as follows:
    (a) Initial Withdrawal Application: A request for withdrawal of loan funds using the appropriate
         form (1903 b) provided by the Bank, along with the project's expenditures forecast for the next
         two reportingperiods; and
    (b) Subsequent Withdrawal Applications:          A request for withdrawal of loan funds using the
         appropriate form (1903 b) provided by the Bank, along with the FMRs for the period ended, the
         Special Account Activity Statement (including Bank statement), and any other applicable
         Summary Statement of Special Account Expenditures, and forecast for next two reporting
         periods.

As with the case of transaction-based disbursements, direct payments to consultants and service
providers, and reimbursement to the Government for pre-financed Bank's share of project expenditures
will be available to the borrower and set out in the Disbursement Letter.


RetroactiveExpenditures.
Retroactive financing up to US$3 million will be allowed for eligible expenditures under categories (1)
through (4) after April 25,2005.


Financial Management Action Plan

The most important actions that need to be carried out are the completion of the Operational Manual, the
Terms of Reference for the audit arrangements, and the selection of the FundsAdministrator, actions that
will be completed before project effectiveness. The FMAssessment for the Funds Administrator will be
confirmed by the Bank before the signature of the contract and the first Bank disbursement.

Supervision Plan.

At least one financial managementsupervision mission will be conducted eachFY, and a Bank Financial
Management Specialist will review the annual audit reports andthe semi-annual FMRs.

the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description of various items under
different expenditure category i s described below. For each contract to be financed by the Loan, the
different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project.team in the
Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the
actual project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.


Procurementof Works

Civil Works contracts procured under this project would include: laboratory infrastructure rehabilitation
and other related works. The procurement will be done using the Bank`s Standard BiddingDocuments
(SBD) for all International Competitive Bidding and National SBD agreed in advance with the Bank
when applying National Competitive Bidding(NCB) procedures.
Procurement of eligible civil works contracts, financed fully or partially by the Bank, and estimated to
cost US$ 5,000,000 (equivalent) or above per contract, should be procured following International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). Civil works contracts estimated to cost between U S $5,000,000 and US
$350,000 equivalent should be procuredthrough NationalCompetitive Bidding(NCB) procedures. Small
civil works contracts estimated to cost less than US $350,000 equivalent per contract may be procured via
shopping under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least
three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a
detailed description of the works, includingbasic specifications, the requiredcompletion date, and a basic
form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be
made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the
experience and resources to complete the contract successfully.
Any contract not financed fully or partially under the loan may be procured following national law
procedures based on the national law.


Procurement of Goods
Goods and non-consulting services contracts to be procured under this project would include; lab
equipment and other specialized equipment eligible for science and technology projects under the project;
computers, software and office equipment, communication equipment, vehicles, and eligible non-
consultants services.
Goods contracts estimated to cost US $250,000 and up will be procured under InternationalCompetitive
BiddingproceduresusingBank Standard BiddingDocuments; contracts estimated to cost more than US
$50,000 equivalent but less than US $250,000 equivalent may be procured using National Competitive
Bidding(NCB) procedures.
The procurement will be done using Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for all ICB and National
Standard Bidding Documents agreed with the Bank. Under NCB, all the following special provisions
agreed with the Colombian Government for procurement under Bank-financed loans, Co-financings and
credits will apply:


                                                    83

(a) All bidders, irrespective of whether they are foreigners or Colombians, will be treated equally and,
    particularly, no preference will be granted to any bidder or group of bidders for bid evaluation
    purposes. Bidders shall be allowed to submit their bids by hand or through the post office or private
    mailing services. There shall not be any requirement for any bidder to show evidence of the bidder's
    registration in any public registry, chamber of commerce or similar entity, whether in Colombia or
    elsewhere, or to appoint a representative domiciled in Colombia, unless and until such bidder is
    awarded the corresponding contract.
(b) Bids shall be opened in a public meeting to which bidders and their representativesshall be allowed
    to attend if they so wish. Date, time and place for the opening meeting shall be set forth in the
    bidding documents. Bid opening shall coincide with, or take place promptly after, the final date and
    time of the period for bid submission stipulated inthe biddingdocuments.
(c) Each bid shall be evaluated and the corresponding contract awarded to the responsive bidder who
    meets appropriate technical and financial standards of capability and whose bid has been determined
    to be the lowest evaluated bid. Such determination shall be made exclusively on the basis of the
    specifications, conditions and evaluation criteria stipulated in the bidding documents. If any factor
    additional to the amount or amounts of each bid is to be considered in bid evaluation, such factor or
    factors and the quantified manner on which they will be applied for purposes of determining the
    lowest evaluated bid shall be precisely stipulated in the bidding documents. For purposes of bid
    evaluation and comparison, the only bid amount or amounts to be used as a factor shall be the bid
    amount or amounts as quoted inthe corresponding bid, including correctionof arithmetic errors.
(d) The provisions of paragraph 2.46 of the Guidelines shall fully apply and, more specifically, bids shall
    not be disclosed to persons other than the persons officially charged with the task of comparing
    andor evaluating the bids while they are performing their official duties, without the corresponding
    bidder's written authorization. Moreover, bidders shall not be requiredto provide such authorization
    as a condition to be entitled to bid. This confidentiality requirement shall apply until the award of
    contract i s notified to the successful bidder. Thereafter, confidentiality of the bids shall be limited to
    those bidportionsfor which confidentiality has been specifically requestedby the bidder in question.
Contracts for eligible goods and non-consulting services which cannot be grouped into larger bidding
packages and estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract may be procured using shopping
proceduresbased on a sample request for quotations satisfactory to the Bank


Selection of Consultants

Firms. Consultants contracts with firms will include support and other studies; works design and
supervision; training services and workshops; and specialized technical expertise.             Short lists of
consultants for services estimated to cost less than $350,000 equivalent per contract may be composed
entirely of national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant
Guidelines.
Most contracts for firms are expected to be procured using Quality and Cost Based Selection Method
(QCBS). Consultant assignments of specific types as agreedpreviously with the Bank inthe Procurement
Plan may be procured with the use of the following selection methods: (i)            Selection under a Fixed
Budget -SFB--, for works supervision contracts; (ii)     Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications -
CQS--, for contracts estimated to cost below US $200,000 equivalent); and, exceptionally (v) Single
Source Selection -SSS-,       under the circumstances explained in paragraph 3.9 of the Consultants'
Guidelines.
Individuals. Individual consultants will be hired to provide technical advisory and project support
services and selectedin accordance to Section V of the Guidelines.

Training

Training activities will include, inter alia, workshops, seminars, tuition fees, scholarships. Inaddition to
the classic procedure of approving annually training budget and objectives, and if the training program
envisioned so permits, it might be a possibility the contracting of the organization of the total training
component, after determining a set of criteria for such training.
Operating Costs
Operational costs will include reasonableexpenditures to carry out the project such as travel and per diem
costs for official project staff and personnel commissioned under the project; rentals; utilities; project
vehicle fuel; communications (including Internet connectivity); maintenance of facilities, equipment and
vehicles; consumable materials and supplies; logistics and project support services, promotion material,
equipment, insurance taxes, and reasonableexpenditures incurredby the FundsAdministrator.
Subprojects


MARD would co-finance the implementation of research subprojects to eligible beneficiaries. Eligibility
criteria for these Co-financing would be described inthe Operational Manual.

Assessment of the Ministry's capacity,to implementprocurement

National System Application. According to recent update of the CPAR, it has been determined that the
possibilities of usingcurrent national systems inWorld Bank and IDB lending operations in Colombia are
very limited, thus not applicable to this project.
Project Management Arrangements.              The Project will be implemented by the Technological
Development and Sanitary Protection Directorship (DDTPS) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD) through a project coordination group which will include among others a
procurement specialist that will be responsible for any procurement process financed under the Loan
(biddingdocuments/request for proposals, evaluation report and winning bidproposal) with experienced
in Bank-funded procurement and that will be involved in all procurement cycle. MARD's departments
will provide specialized services such as assistance in drafting technical specifications and terms of
reference, bidand proposal evaluation, etc. duringprocurement implementation.
Procurement assessment of the implementation agency. A Procurement Capacity Assessment of the
implementation agency responsible for procurement was made by the PAS (JosC M. Martinez) in
November of 2004.
Inordertomitigatetheriskposedbythefact thatthefuturePCUwillnothavedirectexperienceinBank-
funded procurement operations, the following recommendations were suggested: (i)        procurement training
must be provided to the staff expectedto be involved in procurement of civil works, goods and services
before the project starts, thus reducing the risk of failure in procurement-related activities; (ii)
                                                                                                  in order to
facilitate a better understanding of procurement operations, an Operations Manual with a Procurement
Section must be prepared by the Client and reviewed and cleared by the Bank; and not least important;
and (iii) a procurement consultant with experience in Bank-funded procurement must be hired as part of
the core staff; this selection must be monitoredandclearedby the PAS.
We consider this project under High Risk category, procurement-wise, until the necessary procurement
capacity has been created. Both the proposed risk category (HIGH) and the resulting procurement
thresholds may be subject to revision once the Bank determines that the required procurement capacity
has been built at the MARD.

Procurement Plan. The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a General Procurement Plan for project
implementation which provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed
between the Borrower and the Project Team on April 29, 2005, and i s available at [provide the office
name and location]. It will also be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external website.
The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. Consistent
with new Bank policies, all procurement related information would be included in the Procurement Plan
and the LoanAgreement would makereference to the Procurement Plan.
Frequency of Procurement Supervision. In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out
from Bank offices, the capacity assessment of the ImplementingAgency has recommended 1supervision
mission after the first 6 months of procurement implementation and the, one mission annually to carry out
procurement consultation and post review of procurement actions.

                                       COLOMBIA: Agricultural Transition


Background
Public resources allocation to generate public goods in agriculture will result in important social profits.
The investment of these resourcesin R&D will generate internal rates of return IRR for the society in the
range of 23 to 140 percent depending on the type of project and the conditions in which these resources
are applied. These results are in line with international evidence on this field16. Profits for private
agricultural projects also improve substantially, since in many cases the margin on direct costs is
duplicated. Government's fiscal situation does not change because of both, low relative level of
investment, 30 million dollars in 4 years, and low level of taxation of the agriculture, as reflected on the
National Accounts of Colombia.
Internalratesof return(IRR) estimatesfor publicinvestmentinR&DandSPS projects
The economic evaluation estimated economic returns derived from investments on R&D and technology
transfer in agriculture. This evaluation focused on the following 7 production chains: corn, cocoa, rubber,
sugar cane (panela),plantain, meat and tropical export fruits (uchuva). It was carried out usingthe model
DREAM, which allows measuring economic returns or IRR and the changes in producer, consumer and
government's surpluses generatedthrough the investment of public resources in R&D inagriculture.
Table 1 summarizes the main results of the analysis. In all the cases there i s an increase in productivity
resulted from the project. In the case of meat (beef) and uchuva, the assumption i s that productivity rise
is the result of adopting sanitary standards to comply with international markets.

Corn. Colombia i s a net importer of grains (corn, soybean, sorghum). In 2003, imports increased to 2
million tons to respond to domestic consumption of 3.6 million tons (agro-industry and household direct
consumption). Despite of the incentives providedby the government to encourageproduction of corn and
com substitutesfor agro-industry, growing trend of imports does not diminish.
Regardless of low competitiveness of com in Colombia, public investment in R&D for this chain may
turn out to be socially profitable. Infact, two R&D programs were evaluated: one to improve breeding,
and the other to improve agronomkal practices. IRR are 44 and 82 percent respectively. IRR for the first
program was also estimated under a fully opened-market scenario and the results are a rank between 30
and 8 percent, this last one in a drastic case of decrease of the national production. Several simulations
indicate that a careful allocation of public resources to R&D in chains with competitive difficulties can
also be socially profitable, even in conditions of free trade.

Cocoa. There i s a significant internationaltrade of cocoa and its products in Colombia. In 2003, exports
and imports of these products accounted for 36 and 24 million dollars respectively. This positive balance
i s due to the diversification of exports towards value-added products, since trade balance of cocoa as
agriculturalcommodity is negative.

The government of Colombia is promotingcocoacultivation as economic alternative to illicit production.
IRR for R&D investments inthis chain are between46% to the 97% depending on the type of project and

Rubber. Colombia is a net importer of rubber. In2003, 18.540 tons valued 17.5 million dollars were
imported. National production is about 1.200 tons and the government of Colombia i s encouraging its
cultivation as alternative to illicit production. A considerable portion of assistance from multilateral
development agencies i s directed to this product.
Investment in R&D and SPS projects in rubber results in IRR of 43 and 23 percent. These rates are lower
than those for Corn and Cocoa because of the size of national production. Nevertheless, high social
revenuesfrom these types of investments are validated one more time.

Panela. Production of panela is one of the main agricultural activities and a typical product of rural
economies in Colombia. According to statistics from MARD, production in 2002 was 1.5 million tons.
International trade is marginal; in 2003 5.345 tons valued 3 million USD were exported and no imports
were registered.
Because of importance of national production, investment on R&D i s highly profitable, with IRR up to
90%.

Plantain. Plantainis produced indifferent agro-ecosystems.Itis estimatedthat 85 percent of cultivations
are associated with coffee and other crops such as cassava and fruits, while only 15 percent of the area i s
under mono-cultivation. The main market i s domestic fresh consumption (96 percent). According to
MARD's statistics, in 2003, 3 million tons were traded for local consumption, while 127.824 tons were
exported. Exports are still significant although decreasing. In2003, exports valued 35.8 million dollars, in
comparison to 156.000 tons exported in 1990with a value of 50.5 milliondollars.
Researchinboth breedingand SPS practices generates IRR of 80 and 140%respectively.

Beef. Colombia is an important producer of meat and milk. These sectors generate 35 percent of
agricultural GDP. While international trade of meat is small, that of milk products i s very dynamic and
growing. Exports of these products, particularly meat, are limited by the presence of hoof and mouth
disease. The investment of public resources in the amount of 2.9 million dollars in a sanitary project for
the eradication of the hoof and mouth disease generates an IRR of 24 percent. This magnitude, lower
than those evaluated in other R&D and SPS projects already analyzed i s explained for the low probability
of success of the project, estimated in 25 percent.
Export Fruits. In 2003, exports of non traditional fruits, like uchuva, pitahaya,passion fruit and tomate
de arbol, were 9.700 tons valued 17 million dollars. It i s worth noting the behavior of uchuva whose
exports achieved 2.627 tons (8.9 million dollars), showing a growing trend since 1994 when exports were
about one million dollars.
Public investment of about one million dollars in SPS Projects generates an IRR of 87 %, under the
assumption that success and adoption rates are 100%.
IRR also varies significantly depending on producers' level of adoption of the new technologies.
One of the most critical parameters inthe economic evaluation i s the level of adoption of results of R&D
and SPS projects. This parameter i s rather important given the structural conditions of Colombian
agriculture, characterized by its environmental diversity and its social organization in which small
exploitations are common. The economic analysis illustrates the high sensibility of IRR to different
levels of adoption.

An evaluation of production costs structures for the crops studied shows the favorable effect on
profitability derived from technological changes, sanitary improvements and income increases by the
enlargement of export markets. In fact, the analysis of gross margins over direct costs indicates important
improvements as a result of the projects: Corn producers from Piedemonte del Metu may increase their
margin over direct costs on 84 to 116 percent; cocoa producers from Alto Mugdalenu on 110 to 231
percent; rubber producers from PiedemonteAmuzo'nico on 144 to 205; panela producers from Antioquia
on 111 to 181percent; plantain producers form Caribbean valleys on 34 to 46 percent; cattle producers
form Caribbean valleys on 21 to 50 percent and uchuvu producers from altiplano cundiboyacence on 83
to 136percent.

Fiscal impact
Fiscal impact of the project is given by the fiscal contributions to central and local governments as result
of the increase of agricultural production promoted by the project. Another contribution is derived from
the increase of parafiscal payments.
If an annual increase in the value of production between 3 and 6 percent is induced by the project, it
would be equivalent to an increasebetween 400 and 800 million dollars, which would constitute the base
for new fiscal contributions.
However, and given the low contribution of agriculture to Colombian treasury, a marginal fiscal impact i s
expected. Infact, according to DANE's National Accounts (Matriz de Utilizacidn de Productos 2002),
agricultural contribution by indirect taxes is only 600 pesos by each million of gross agricultural
production value. Contribution by direct taxes i s also marginal; according to the same source, gross
agricultural exploitation surplus is barely a trillion pesos, equivalent to 4 percent of its aggregate value.
And DANE's estimatesthat the effective rate of contribution onthis surplus is also very low.
Since overall project investment (30 million dollars in four (4) years, or 7.5 million dollars per year)
equals 7.5 percent of MARD's annual budget, and given the low contributions from agricultural sector to
national treasury, fiscal impact is also expectedto be marginal.

                                  Colombia: AgriculturalTransition

Safeguard Category: S2 (Limited impact)

The key safeguard policy issues assessed in this project relate to: (a) compliance with the World Bank's
environmental policy (OP/BP 4.01); and (b) World Bank's pest management policy (OP4.09) in the
relevant oversight of the R&D agendas, the subprojects funded by the Competitive Fundand the Sanitary
and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) component activities of the project.
The safeguards framework proposedin accordance with both the Colombian law and the Bank Policy for
each of these triggered policies are describedinthe Project Operational Manual (OM). The outline of the
safeguardspresented below includes the respective safeguards analysis, the action plan or framework, the
budget, and the relevant legislative framework of Colombia, where applicable.

Additionally becauseof the importance of developing the small producer agriculture sector in Colombia a
SmallProducers Development Framework was also developed within the context of the Project.


       Annex 10.1: The Environmental Analysis and Environmental Action Plan (EAP)

E A Category: B
Background and Strategic Focusof the Project
The Summary of the Environmental Analysis (EA).
As indicated by the "Analysis of the Agricultural Sector and the Environment" (Le6n and Espinosa 2004)
performed as a part of the project preparation, agricultural activities are currently entailing potentially
high risks to environmental sustainability in Colombia.          A study, performed by IGAC - ICA -
CORPOICA in 2002 and quoted by L e h , showed that 32.7 percent of the transformed land in Colombia
i s being overexploited in terms of its natural resource use (68 percent of them to a severe and moderate
degree) while 29.7 percent i s being under-exploited. Natural resource overexploitation phenomena are
usually associated with the conflicts originating in the development of agricultural activities in sensitive
ecosystems such as the rainforest and mountain areas, natural forests, and wetlands. The overexploitation
impacts of environmental resources include soil erosion, desertification and soil compaction, as well as
pollution and salinization, both of soils and water resources.
An additional diagnostic component of the above mentionedenvironmental analysis (Le6n and Espinosa
2004) refers to the use of pesticides in the agricultural sector. The entire marketingprocess (registration,
sale, distribution, and use) involving pesticides in Colombia showed an upwards trend, that included the
use of fungicides and herbicides in particular. Notwithstanding the efforts being made by the health
authorities and the existing legislative framework of the country it was also observed that the use of
forbidden pesticides or high-toxicity pesticides in agriculture still exists. Therefore a pest management
framework was developed to address such issues and i s presentedbelow as the Annex 10.2.
Environmental dimensionof the RhD Agendas.
As the project is using the production chain approach as its institutional platform and that for each
selected production chain, a researchand development (R&D) agenda would be defined in a participatory
manner involving all production chain actors, the environmental safeguards would also be embedded
where applicable in the definition of the agenda. The environmental dimension for each of the project
components are as follows.




                                                     94

    (a) Component 1: Knowledge generation and Innovation.                  This project component aims to
    strengthen the agricultural production chain actors through the provision of technology and
    innovation in the definition, co- financing and implementation of R&D, as well as the preparation of
    participatory and demand driven R&D agendas around certain production chains, and the
    implementation and co-financing of these agendas through a Competitive Fund. Inthe formulation of
    the R&D agendas, the environmental safeguards theme would be taken into account in accordance
    with the national legal framework.        In addition the R&D agendas would take into account the
    previous efforts on this theme such as environmental guides, the environmental chapters of the
    competitive agreements, clean and safe environmental practices, and integrated natural resource
    management approaches.
    (b) Component 2: Strengthening of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures
    System. This component will focus on strengthening of the sanitary and phytosanitary aspects of the
    beef sector (livestock product) and uchuva fruit- (Physalis or Andean berries) sector. Ineach of these
    sectors, proposed interventions along the production chain are on: the definition of critical themes of
    SPS to improve competitiveness and establish certification and accreditation mechanisms, develop
    the capacity to improve sanitary standards, and to promote the use of good agricultural practices
    (GAPS)as a strategy to improve competitiveness. Similarly to the component one, the environmental
    dimension would be embedded in these activities where improved sanitary standards and promotion
    of GAPSoccur. Where necessary the project would draw on the experience of other Bank projects
    and national and regional expertise inthe two sectors.
Environmental dimensionof the CompetitiveFund.
The positive experience of usingCompetitive Funds as recorded in the country has had positive impacts
on various environmental variables. As shown by a study done by Ledn et al (2003)17, on the inclusion of
biodiversity criteria in agricultural sector policy, the subprojects financed both by: (a) PRONATTAover
the 1994-2001 period; and (a) by the National Agricultural Science and Technology Programme of
COLCIENCIAS, are to a large extent positively linked with the improved biodiversity use and
conservation in Colombia. The benefits to the development of the agricultural sector competitiveness
through improving the natural resource base, lessening of the risk vis-&-vis the current international
market demands, and the potential product entry into ecological markets are aspects which uses the
environmental dimension (Leon and Espinosa 2004).
Environmental dimensionof SPS in the Beef Production Chain.
The efforts of the project to address sanitary barriers to the beef industry in the component two would be
concentrated in the existing and established cattle ranching areas and i s not expected to create an
increased demand for land use for livestock in the forest frontier areas. This approach is in accordance
with the approved national regulation (Acta del "Acuerdo de Competitividad de la Cadena
Agroalimentaria de la Came Bovina", Febrero 9 de 2004 - The Agreement of competitiveness of the
agro-industry chain of the beef subsector). The basis of this approach i s to increase the productivity of
beef production in the specialized areas through intensified agricultural practices such as increased
carrying capacity and stocking of the cattle ranches, better nutrition and feeds use, improved carcass
quality and value addition, etc. This approach i s not expected bringnew land under cattle ranching. The
development of the agenda of the beef chain as described by Amador et a1 (2002)" i s also the localized
area of intervention proposedwithin this project.

The Environmental Strategy and Methodology of the Project.
Taking the experiences of the previous interventions of the Bank in the agricultural sector in Colombia
such as PRONATTA, and with the objective of enabling the concept and application of the environmental
action plan (EN) described below that assures appropriate evaluation of the potential environmental
impacts, it was considered necessary to establish basic indicators based on economic information, social
and environmental suitability, within an integral concept of environmental sustainability.
Given the production chain approach, definition of prospective R&D agendas, and the use of the
competitive funding instrument, as described above, the approach used to account for safeguarding the
environmental aspects for each component is as follows.
    (a) Component 1:Knowledge generation and Innovation.
    Within the context of funding the subprojects through the Competitive Funding mechanism, the
    environmental sustainability and optimal management of natural resources and quality of life of the
    population, shall be given due consideration by using the appropriate environmental criteria (Le6n
    and Espinosa, 2004: 74-80) and taking into account the legal framework.            Since screening and
    evaluation of subproject proposals would require an interdisciplinary vision, the subproject selection
    at the expert panel level will include in addition to the technical-scientific, economic, and business
    analyses, also an environmental analysis.        This project will incorporate the abovementioned
    environmental factors into the subprojects preparation and evaluation processes of proposals for
    funding through the Competitive Fund of component one. Furthermore the following aspects shall
    also be considered in the screening of subproject proposals, and implementation and management of
    the subprojects:
            (i) subprojectproposalsshallincludeadetaileddescriptionoftheproposedtechnological
               All
               interventions. This i s aimed at eliminating the use of potentially risky technologies as well
               as providing opportunities to search for more environmentally friendly technological
               alternatives;
            (ii)All subprojectsshallexplicitly identify anddescribethe mainpositive, neutral, and/or
               potentially negative environmental impacts and environmental risks (based on an indicator
               list) in their proposals;
            (iii) allcaseswherepotentiallynegativeimpactswereidentified, astatementonhowto
                 In
               lessen, compensate or prevent such impact should be required to be included in the
               subproject protocol.      In addition the required expertise shall be included in the
               involvedhired subproject implementation team.
    Positive environmental interventions will deal with topics such as: product safety, biodiversity
    harnessing, rainforest protection; promotion of crops and cattle breeding, under the agro forestry,
    livestock or agro-livestock systems; conservation and efficient use of irrigation water; proper soil and
    water management; management of agrochemicals; and sustainable agriculture (Leon 2004). The
    project framework also includes a mechanism of monitoring the environmental effects of the
    subprojectsfunded (see Environmentalaction plan budget, Table 10.1):

    (b) Component 2: Strengthening of the National SPS system.
    Within the context of environmental safeguards of this project component the key elements of
    consideration relates to: (a) diagnostics; (b) biosafety; and (c) capacity building. Diagnostics and
    biosafety laboratory practices would adopt acceptable good laboratory procedures and safe disposal
    of laboratory chemicals and biological reagents.
    (c) Capacity Development to improve the National SPS system.




                                                     96

    Training in Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to improve admissibility of agricultural products in
    the international markets (especially in the beef, fruit and vegetable chains) also means that progress
    i s being made in improving how the natural resourcesshould be used.
    The product quality evaluation in terms of admissible pesticide residues for entering EU or US
    markets i s a capacity that would need to be developed within the country SPS system. Awareness on
    these issues would therefore be increasednot only among agricultural practitioners but also among all
    the actors of a given production chain who are responsible for such an activity.
    Inthecaseof strengtheningthenationalSPSsystemwithrespecttoenvironmentalvaluation, thelack
    of technical diagnostic capacity and impact indicators of diverse alternative means of handling
    environmental resources i s one of the methodological problems.               The project through its
    Environmental action planidentifies the steps necessary to follow (see below).
Environmental Action Plan (EAP)
An Environmental Action Plan ( E M ) is proposed to avoid potential adverse effects that would play an
important role inthe agricultural transition process. Potential areas of change where the naturalresources
could undergo potentially negative or positive effects therefore require close attention are: (a) Growth:
Expansion of the processes of technological innovation at the national level and incorporation of new
areas within production chain development; (b). Agriculture: Changes in the farming practices and the
use of technological or consumer goods resulting from developed chains leads to the need to set up
sustainable use of fragile mixed farming practices and systems; and (c). Livestock: Changes in livestock
management associated with expansion of production areas (fronteras gunaderas) in terms of better
natural resource management and biodiversity conservation, implying a need for adjustments to the
production systems. Such changes may also include efficiency in terms of animal food and nutrition,
ensilage quality and product quality.
The specific objectives of the EAP over and above the PDO i s to: (a) incorporate environmental aspects
inall relevant activities andtechnologies proposed and financed by the project; (b) evaluate the potential
effects on the environment duringthe mid-term and final evaluation of subproject implementation; and (c)
conduct post-project impact analysis to delineate lessons from this project. The outcome of this project
will be to contribute to the development of sustainable and environmentally safe technologies in a defined
researchagendaor in selectedproductionchains and to this end, the following actions are proposed:
    (a) Environmental Screening of Subprojectsfrom Selection and Implementation to Monitoring
    and Evaluation under the CompetitiveFund:
    Draw up the criteria necessary for the Competitive Fund allocation by subprojects that are
    environmentally friendly. It would include:
         (i) MinimumPriorConditionstobemetbythesubprojects/activitiesbasedontheChecklist.
            The
            A checklist will include positive, neutral, and negative environmental effects that will be
            developed and used by the Project.         In addition subproject Proposals must include a
            description of technological packages to be used, a description of the main environmental
            effects identified, as well as the eventual efforts to be undertaken to abate, compensate for or
            prevent negative environmental impacts;
         (ii)
            Preparation and submission of the JustacationReport for each subproject that will be used as
            a filter for the selection and approval of the subprojects/activities.   In addition subproject
           proposals with high technical merit but lacks the environmental vision may be given an
            opportunity to improveits strategy for environmentalrisk and impact prevention;

    (iv) Expert Panel:

            0  Inconstituting the Expert Panel for the selection of subprojects, an Environmental
               expert will be included;

            0  Assessment and rating by the Expert Panel of the subproject proposals submitted will
               be done usingthe check list describedinthe Operational Manual;

            0  Identify areas andor themes (i.e. water, soil etc) that may be environmentally affected
               (by the Expert Panel) and when possible recommend the key environmental issues that
               are to be estimated or measured and evaluated for follow-up and assessment of
               activityhubproject (i.e. at mid-term). When necessary the Expert Panel may hire
               EnvironmentalExpertsRhematic Specialiststo assist in such recommendations;
    (v) The Operational Manual shall include a `negative list ofactivities' that would not be funded as
    described above.    Environmental criteria would also be further defined in the Operational
    Manual, including the use of forbidden pesticides, water and soil pollution risks, and risks
    entailed by the occurrence of agrochemical residue in food (the pesticide use aspects are detailed
    in the Annex 10.2 subsection).        The Manual would also contain a description of the
    environmental impact and risks analysis check list to be included in each of the Calls for
    Proposalsof the Competitive Fund.

(b) TheSPS Componentspecific activities:

Two targetedactivities are proposed for the component 2:
         (i) useofGAPSinday-todayfunctioningofthediagnosticandbiosafetylaboratory,and
           The
           SPS contributions associatedwith the chains as they relate to environmental effects would
           be monitoredusingthe indicators describedinthe Operational Manual.
         (ii) extentandgeographicdistributionofconnectivityoftheinstitutionsinvolved(ICA
            The
           and INVIMA) with the regionaVprovincia1 nodes and the effectiveness of the system to
           provide and function as a timely warning system on pest and disease spread etc., would be
           evaluated.

(c) Conducting mid-term andfinal evaluations:
Conducting mid-term and final evaluations of the results achieved by a random sample of subprojects
(12 at mid-term and 20 final) applying the technologies proposed by the component activities, in
order to qualify the environmental benefits obtained, taking into account the quality of the processes
and the end product. This would permit to identify good agricultural practices. These activities
would involve:

DisseminationStrategyof the EnvironmentalActionPlan(EAP)

The information sharing among the project beneficiaries is being done as part of the Dissemination
strategy of the environmental assessment. In order to ensure that this information reaches the main
stakeholdersinvolved, the following dissemination guidelines have been drawn up:

   a). The Plan publicly made available through the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's
        website (www.minagricu1tura.gov.co) and inthe Info shop of the Bank;

   b). Environmental criteria will be publicised within each of the Calls for Proposals to build
        awareness on the environmental dimension; and

   c). The SPS information system network will be used to disseminate specific environmental issues
        related to the activities on beef and uchuva production chains and its specialized clientele.
The additional coststhat would be incurredto implement this DisseminationPlan of the Environmental
Action Plan (EAP) as statedabove (section A.10.1) are includedinthe individual technical component
Budgets(see Annex 4 for details).

PestManagementStrategy
The two technical components of this project would include ecologically sound integrated pest
management (IPM) strategies including best practicesfor the use of recommended pesticides. Inaddition
the project approach includes terms of developing the export capacity where there are certain specific
requirements within the trade agreementthat is being negotiated and the existing local legislature (such as
the environmental analysis, human health in terms of toxicology, and better agronomy).                       Most
importantly, the legislative framework of Colombia i s strong in terms of health aspects, environment, and
inrelationto trade. This framework includes multilateralagreements(COPS - Contaminantes organicos
persistentes; Convenio de Rotterdam), supra-national agreements (Decision Andina 436 - Registro de
plagicidas), and other national legislation (decrees other than the above-mentioned agreements").             The
project would also encourage the use of integrated pest management strategies and best agricultural
practices where possible.
The project environmental analysis prepared by the preparation team and safeguard evaluation done by
the also identified potential to trigger the Bank's Pest management policy2o. The project therefore would
use both the national legislative framework and the World Bank listings and procedures on "Integrated
Pest Management" (IPM) including IPM components (biological control, cultural practices, and
development of pest resistant or tolerant varieties).


The PestManagementAssessment
A Pest Management Assessmentwas conductedto identify the current status of the policy environment in
the country and its capacity to comply with the Policy of the World Bank duringthe implementation stage
of this project as well as to delineate areas where special attention i s required. The pertinent points of the
pest management assessment within the Policy provisions that are consistent with the Bank's OP4.09
which was discussed and agreed at appraisal (Table 10.2.1), and are reflected in the Pest management
Framework (PMF) are listed in the Table 10.2.1). The table condenses the relevant Paragraph of the
Policy, mode of handling in the PMF, consistency to Policy, and gaps. Where there is consistency it i s so
indicated and no additional action i s required.
On the other hand where there is inconsistency a response is prepared in concurrence with the project
implementingteam.

The Budget
The proposed activities of the Pest Management Framework are financed under the Calls for proposal of
the Competitive Fund(component 1) and in the specific sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) activities inthe
component 2. The budget details of the activities mentioned in the above described Pest Management
Framework (PMF)are described in the Annex 4 within the respective technical components.



      Annex 10.3: The Social Analysis and Small producers Development Framework
Background and Strategy of the Small ProducersDevelopmentFramework (SDF)
Poverty indicators in the rural setting in Colombia are rather critical. Nearly 83 percent of the 12 million
people living in the rural area are under the poverty line while 43 percent of them are living in extreme
poverty. Agriculture continues to be the main economic activity notwithstanding the share of non-
agricultural activities that is increasing the income generation sources of rural families. Armed conflict
and its links with drug-trafficking, and the subsequent internal displacement of nearly 300,000 families
over the last few years in the country have had a significant bearing on the determinants of rural area
poverty (World Bank 2003).
In Colombia's agricultural sector is characterized by a deep divergence between the traditional small
producer sector and the modem entrepreneurial sector, where poverty continues to be prevalent among
the small producers. Therefore special attention i s required to alleviate rural poverty by improving the
competitiveness of this small producers subsector.         The small producers subsector is generally
characterized by insufficient land, often backward production technology use, and little or limited access
to supplementary services. The criteria used to distinguish the small producers from other producers
according to the Competitiveness study (World Bank 2003) was based on ownership and cultivation of
the plot, use of family labor only, and some cases the possession of not more than 20 hectares in the
Andean zones and 50 hectares in the Atlantic and Orinoquiu zones (Berry and Bejarano, 1990:135).
Small producers participate extensively in crops that represent about two-thirds of the total agricultural
production in Colombia (World Bank 2003). The primarily smallholder crops include coffee, traditional
corn, plantains, panelu cane, cassava, potatoes, fruit, beans, vegetables, cacao, rainfed rice under non-


                                                    105

mechanized technology, yams, jute, wheat, coconuts, arracacha, sesame, and barley. In contrast the
modem entrepreneurial sector i s defined as those with medium-size and large-farm sizes with modern
agricultural technology that benefits from most of the production and marketing services and policy
incentives. The primary commercial crops in Colombia are: irrigated rice, coffee, sugarcane, mechanized
rainfed rice, corn under modern technologies, oil palm, sorghum, cotton, export bananas, and soybeans
(World Bank, 2003).
There appears to be a positive change under way in the small producer sector, particularly in the
emergence of small-scale entrepreneurial producers in the potato, milk, panela, and some fruit and
vegetable commodities (World Bank 2003). This change i s accompanied by the increasing linkages
between small producers and agro-industries including the strengthening of the on-farm and village-level
small-scale ruralprocessingactivities. The competitive small producers are those with the efficient use of
resources at the farm level particularly family labor and careful control of cash costs. Some of the well
established links are in the coffee, oil palm, and milk subsectors while the emerging areas are berries,
passion fruit, other fruits, panela cane, and potatoes. Inother commodities in the fruit subsector such as
plantain, granadilla, and uchuva, direct links have been strengthened between the small producers and
exporters.

The Production Chain Approach and Social Significance
The framework of this project is to target the diverse agricultural activities included in the Knowledge
generation and Innovation Component ((2.1) and in the SPS Component ((2.2) of the agricultural sector
actors who are actually engaged in the selected production chains. The term production chain i s
understood to mean "a system including a set of activities and agents getting involved and in accord to
ensureproduction and marketing of goods and services**." For this reason, outcomes are not expected to
be obtained from a given social group; rather, activities, strategies and processes are expected to be
developed towards the promotion and improvement of social actors' capabilities in a productive
relationship privileged by the chain that is inclusive of all groups and small producers in particular. As
pointed out by a social evaluation of the project (Kairuz, 2005), however, the production chain approach
shows a great many complexities, and no final evaluation i s yet available about the benefits it has entailed
to the rural sector inColombia and to small producers. Moreover, the analysis highlightedthe fragmented
vision still prevailing in the production chain approach and, therefore, the need to making a contribution
towards "developing a comprehensive vision of the chain," that i s inclusive of the small producers.
Bearing in mindthat implementation of these two project components i s basedon the chain approach, the
wide range of grower associations (Gremios) involved in the chain i s obvious. The majority of Gremios
are associated with the 20 selected production chains at the national level and 76 organizations of the
chains at the regional level. An estimation of IICA in 2005 i s that 120 organizations and Gremios
represent an estimated 80,000 small producers (excluding the cafeteros - coffee producers) are
representedinthese chains. Among the 523,000 coffee producers about 73% have a farm size of less than
5.0 hectares. In addition about 70% of the total number of producers is represented by its federation
(Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros).        Strong organizations exist in Colombia regarding access to
productive factors and a capacity for dialogue with policymakers and agencies in charge of policy
implementation. These will be able to take increasing advantage of both chain-oriented activities and the
likely benefits this Project could eventually accrue. Moreover, a second set of organisations are also
present in the country who are highly vulnerable because of the weak or non-existent organizational
representation and their rather scant ability to access markets and scientific and technological
developments in particular, and to whom benefits are accrued ina more uncertain way.

The SDF within the ProjectDesign
The key objective of the Small producers Development Framework (SDF) implemented in the context of
this project is to include small producers as an integral part of the country's competitiveness and export
strategy. The aim of SDFi s to:
    (a) Ensure that the small producers are not excluded from the benefits derived from this project
    implementation and to actively look for opportunities for small producers to benefit from this
    investment;
    (b) Designdissemination strategiesto formulate prospective agendas (subcomponent 1.1)that include
    small producers inthe chain;
    (c) Take into account the social vulnerability of small producers inthe development and definition of
    the prospective agendas; and
    (d) To include training activities within the competitive fund for innovation and improved
    accessibility to the competitive fund of beef and uchuva productionchains.
Attaining competitiveness in production is one of the avenues of achieving sustainable reduction of
poverty. Smallholder productioni s very relevant to Colombia's comparative advantage and assisting this
producer group to improve their livelihood could also contribute to creating a more efficient agricultural
sector, in addition to its social merit. It should also be noted that some of the small holders targeted are
expectedto be indigenous people (2% of the population).

Small producers Development Framework (SDF)

Guidelinesfor SDF
Specific mechanisms have been designed within the Project to foster a stronger link between the small
producers with activities to be carried out and to improve their ability to make good use of Project-
derived benefits. It could also be noted that some of these beneficiaries of innovative interventions may
be indigenous people. The relevant guidelines of the SDF are:

Component 1: Knowledge generation and Innovation
    (a) Perspective R&D Agendas:          An activity aimed at strengthening the ability of agricultural
    production chain actors is being proposed by the design of Component 1, to identify their scientific
    and technological needs and the eventual development of prospective R&D agendas. Resource
    allocation focused on this goal has been designed in such a way as to allow for highest incentives to
    be driven to relatively less developed chains. This i s to some extent related to the weakness of the
    organisation's productive basis and, thus, with growers precarious living conditions. Significant
    importance shall be assignedto those programs and subprojects envisaging the transfer of technology
    to small producers as one of the likely benefits expected. Such a transfer shouldtake place within the
    framework of programs and should be focused on the incorporation of small producers into
    production chains.
    (b) The social evaluation of the Project (Kairuz, 2005) identified the risk that those regions in which
    meaningful advances have not yet been made by the production chain approach may be left out of
    financial support from this project. To mitigate this risk the following actions are adopted: (i)
    dissemination efforts made through suitable regional channels; and (ii)       applicants will be given
    assistance so that subprojects are designed in line with the Project methodologies. Recommendations
    madeby the social evaluation have been fairly explicit incalling upon all agencies making up science
    and technology institutions in the regions to promote their active involvement in the Project
    development and, supported by credible regional experts, to find out the regional experience in
    prospective studies so far. How the production chain actors and regions are getting involved in the



                                                     107

  execution of activities envisaged by this component will be described in the Project Operational
  Manual (OM), section on SDF.
  (c) The Competitive Fund
           (i) Screening mechanisms for the selection of subprojects. The project would use the
                screening mechanisms for identifying and supporting subprojects that benefits the small
                producers when such a proposal i s technically sound and relevant for the R&D
                prospective agenda of that production chain. Priority will be given to R&D subproject
                proposals that contain modules or activities on transfer of technology and technical
                assistance.
           (ii) The social impact of subprojects. The specific goal this criterion seeks to achieve i s that
                the scope of technology dissemination and adoption processes involved in the economic
                evaluation of subprojects is widened to cover small producers so that the latter's
                incorporationinto the production chains concerned may be encouraged.
           (iii) Mid-term analysis. At the mid-termevaluation of the project a specifically designed field
                study will be conducted to determine whether the project benefits have reachedthe small
                producers and to monitor any evidence of exclusion of project benefit for the small
                producers due to project-inherent omissions and extemalities and if positive, corrective
                measures would be taken to rectify such a situation.

Component 2. Strengthening of the National SPS system:
   (a) Regarding the Component 2 on strengthening of the National Sanitary and Phytosanitary
      Measures System (SPS), a specific activity has also been designed to improve access to
       production chains chosen (beef and uchuva) by small producers who will get involved in the
       establishment of strengthening of good agricultural practices (GAPS). Inclusion of this
       population into the Project i s warranted because of their vulnerability inthe event of a more open
      economy for trade. Developing their export potential as a growth strategy, demands strong
       support to improve their competitiveness level. Where possible and applicable activities targeting
       the entrepreneurial small producers will be promoted;
   (b) A spill-over effect of the strengtheningof the commercializedexport sector is the benefits for the
       small holders such as better access to vaccination programs for cattle etc which may not have
       occurred if there was no investment made in the absence of this Project. Another potential spill
       over effect is the improvedproduce quality inthe local market;
   (c) Better access to information provided by the SPS information system would include benefits to
       the small producers;
   (d) The Project will support these small producers by improving technology transfer and increasing
       training inproductive practices enhancing their access to dynamic markets.
   (e) The mid-term and final review would include an analysis of the contribution of this component
       through its various subcomponentson the small producers of the two selectedproductionchains.


The Budget
The budget for the activities targeting the small producers under the proposed Small producers
Development Framework (SDF) is embedded in the cost tables of each of the components described in
Annex 4.
