The project has the following\n            components: (1) The aim of this Component is to support the\n            provision of technology and innovation through the\n            strengthening of agricultural production chain actors in the\n            definition, co-financing and implementation of Research and\n            Development (R&D), as well as the preparation of\n            participatory and demand driven R&D agendas around\n            certain production chains and the implementation and\n            co-financing of these agendas through a Competitive Fund.\n            (2) The aim of this component is to strengthen the Sanitary\n            and Phytosanitary Measures System, enabling it to respond to\n            the sanitary standards of international markets and thereby\n            enhance the admissibility of agricultural products to these\n            markets. (3) The aim of this component is to ensure proper\n            project management and execution and will finance a Project\n            Coordination Unit which will be attached to the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD's) Technology\n            Development and Sanitary Protection Directorate (DDTPS) and\n            be responsible for the general management of the project."}, "docdt": "2005-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
