"Final", "loan_no": "7313", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Agricultural Transition\n            Project for Colombia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: operations in the rural sector\n            with a high degree of innovation require an extended\n            horizon, intensive supervision, continuous support for\n            capacity building, and repeat financing to maximize impact,\n            learning and sustainability. The time required for projects\n            such as Agriculture Transition Project (PTA) to implement\n            and mature greatly exceeds Bank averages. The importance to\n            such projects of experienced Bank and borrower project teams\n            with continuity of leadership and a focus on capacity and\n            institution-building cannot be overstated. Formally\n            establishing and staffing and Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) and safeguards unit in the UCP - which is itself\n            embedded in MADR, the principal sector institution -\n            immediately established the mainstream credentials of this\n            important activity. Continuous support from supervision\n            missions and an increasing body of research products and\n            data, plus the development of regional workshops and\n            interactions with subproject managers, dissemination of\n            evaluation studies, and databases, provided a strong\n            incentive to sustain the activity, utilize its products and\n            build further capacity within the Ministry of Agriculture\n            and Rural Development (MADR) and the sector. A pre-defined\n            and well-prepared portfolio of investments in National\n            Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures System (SPS) ready for\n            implementation remains prudent, and can mitigate the\n            difficult problems with construction and operation of highly\n            sophisticated works, which absorb much  time and additional\n            costs in 'learning by doing'. For SPS\n            interventions to be sustainable, they must have\n            pre-established prioritization criteria and require\n            counterpart funding. The PTA has shown that it is important\n            to establish, during project preparation/appraisal, clear\n            prioritization criteria for the resources within the system\n            and institutions."}, "docdt": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
