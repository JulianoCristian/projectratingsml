REPORT AND RECOIIENDATIONS OF THE PRESSIDET
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CN A PROPOSED
LOAiN TO THE TRUSTEES OF THE PORT OF KARhCHI
1.          I submit herewith the fo'llowing report and recominendations on a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to U.S. $17 m:ll-
lion to The Trustees of the Port of Karachi., Pakistanr, usually known as the
Karachi Port Trust (ITT).
Part I - Eistorical
2.          In August 1955 the Bank made a Loan (126-PAY) of t1408 million
to KPT to reconstruct and modernize 13 cargo berths and to provide carCo
handling faQilities and trarast sheds. The project was virtually completed
in 1962 and the loan has now been almost completely disbursed.   While the
work was in progress traffic moving througlh the port increased even more
than had been expected and the need becam.e apparent for improving ot,her
facilities of the port. Further improvements and some expans-on were pro-
posed by KP' as part of Pakistan's Second Five-Year Plan (1960-65) and fi-
nancial assistance was sought from the Bank. A mission visited Pakldstan
in April 1963 to appraise the protect and subsequently in October/November
1963 received further inforiation in addition to that suipplied by monthly
progress reports arising through Loan 126-PAX. Negotiations were held in
Washington in HIarch 1964 with representatives of the Government and KPT and
have now been completed.
3.          The proposed loan would be the Bank's eighteenth to Pakistan0
The statius of previous loans on March 31, ;964 w.as as follows'2

Net amount held by Bank                            247.5
The proposed loan will complete the contribution of $74.4 million pledged
bv the Bank under the Consortium arrangements for the second and third years
(1961/62 and 1962/63) of the Second Five-Year Plan.
I.          The International Development Association has made ten credits
to Pakistan totalling $104.5 million.
5.          Of the Bank loans $12k5 million was undisbursed on March 31,
196h.  The major part of this was due to delays -in letting contracts under
the $80 million loan for the Indus Basin project made in September 1960.

change cost of $;17 million (45%) -ill be met by the proposed loan, The

The Borrower
11.        ITT vas established by the Karachi Port Trust Act of 1886 (ITT
Act). Thougl vested with the property and managerment of the port its auton-
om7y is limited by the authority of the Central Goveniment which must approve
policies and decisions of major importance. Ordinary and capital budgets,
rates charged and loans incurred need the approval of the Government. There
are 11 Tru).stees on the Board, representing Government, comrrmercial and ship-
ping interests, labor un-ons and the Karachi Nluniclpa' Corpor-ation. A ma-
Jority, including the Chairman, is appointed by the Government.
12.         The organizat-on is sound and wsell managed, It has informed the
Bank of its intention to take measures to inprove or strengthen various as-
pects of its operations and organization, such as the collection and prepa-
ration of statistics of port activities, the Engineering Department, stludies
to ascertain the costs of its services and studies of techniques for bulk
handling of certain cargos,  Labor relations are good and the port has been
remarlkably free from strikes.
13.         KPT is financially sound. Operating revenues have more than
doubled since 1953/54. The operating ratio (operating expenses as a per-
centage of operating revenues) has been satisfactory, varying from 52% to
7h% since 1953/54. It is expected to be around 65 percent over the nex.t
five years,  The only long-term debt outstanding is the Bank Loan 126-PAK
and loans totalling $5.1 million equivalent from Consortium members - United
Kingdom, Japan and Canada. During the five-year period of construction of
the project (1963/64-1967/68) KPT wrill require funds totalling $53 million
equivalent for capital works (including the project), debt amortization and
replenishment of reserves. Of this, IYl wrill provide 60 percent from its
owm resources. The rest would be covered by that part of Bank Loan 126-PAK
disbursed in 1963/64, the proposed Bank loan, and the Consortium loans of
$5.1 million equivalent. For guaranteeing the proposed Bank loan the Guar-
antor proposes to levy a charge on the Borrower of 1/2% per annum on the
amount outstanding.
The Economy
14.         A summary of Pakistan's current economic situation was included
in my Report and Recommendations (IDA/R 64-7) of March 9, 1964, on twjo pro-
posed development credits to Pakistan for the East and Tiest Pakistan Educa-
tion Projects. There have been no important changes in the general situa-
tion since then.

150         Attached are a draft Loan Agreement between The Trustees of the
Port of Karachi and the D3nk (Second Karachi Port Project) (No. 2) and a
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the
Bank (11o0 3),. Both Agreements are in the usual for!i and are substantially
similar to th.e doculments executed in respect of Loan '126-RAK. Provision
has boon rade in Sections 1.01 (b) and 6.01 of the Loan Agreement so that
a default under Loan 126-PAR will constitute a default under the proposed
loan, and vice versa.

Chairman and twro other Trustees0  In addition, the Agreement must be
sealed and attested in Pakistan by the Secretary of 1GTO   It will there-
fore be necessar-y for the Loan Agreement, if approved, to be sent to
Karachi. for execution by KPT and then returned to the Bank for execution
by it concurrently with the Guarantee Agreement.

tion 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the BanLk is attached (lNo. 4).

18.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Ar-
ticLes of Agreement of the Bank.
