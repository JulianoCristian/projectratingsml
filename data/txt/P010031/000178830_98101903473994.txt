PAKI STANi
THE PORT OF KAP.AC.II EXPAISION AND IINPROVENIENT PROJECT
SU-iSARY
The Government of Paklistan has requested the i ank to help
finance the present expanision and improvement project of the Karachi Po;t
Trust (KPT).   Bank Loan 126-PAK of August 4, 1955 was made to help
finance KPT 's reconstruction program at that time.
ii.       Th2is report covers the appra:Lsal. of the foregoing project
estimated to cost PRFs. 178.5 million (IJS$37.5 million equivalent) over a
period of 5 years, l963-64 to 15'67-68, incll'sive.  Of the total cost
US$17.0 million would be foreign exchangc.
iii.      KIT is a c:orporation with limited authority.  Separate accounts
and armual budgets are prepared subject tc Government approval and control.
The port's managemernt is reasonably conpetent but tlhe Engineering Departmeint
requires to be strengthened.   The assistance of consulting engineers is
required for the design, preparation of tender documents, analysis of
bids and the supervision of most of the projeco.
iv.       The port complex consists principally of seventeen berths on
the East Jha2ves, four berths on the WJest Wharves, tw(o bulk oil piers and
variotus moorings ancd lighterage facilities.  Depths alongside vary irom
2h to 34 feet at Mean Low Water.   The port is provided with eight transit
sheds, some 500 acres of open storage space and a reasonable amount of
mechanicall-handl-ing equipment and floatiniy craft.
v.        Traffic has develoned steadily: it totalled 5.6 mill:ion toinS in
1962-63 as compared with 2.5 million i n 1948-49.  Bearing in mind the
inadeauacy of the present accommodation, operating efficiency is hi2ln
but is achieved at the cost of congestion to ships waiting for berths.
vi.       Overall thle rate structure is such as to generate an adequate
return on KPP s'  i nvestments -  nowemver the const nf ini 7- duHal servirces
needs to be periodically reviewed in order to rationalize rates.
'Jii.     KFPT operates at a profit and has built up considerable reserves
which are invested -Ln Governi,ent and Municipal secTurities  ith the
exception of IBRD Loan 126-PAK and Consortium loans totalling PRs.24.3
mi 111 inn   sq f`re  ' 1 nn-t,'rm rlcdb.  Its fi nnnrcnil posl tionn is
sound.



- ii -
viii.     The Droject will materially assist in the economic develop-
ment of Pakistan. The tiiain objective is to provide additionial capacity
to cope with present and part of the forecast future traffic, and the
relhabilitation and reconstruction of existing facilities in the port.
A master plan study to determine the port's fliture developnent is
included in the project.
ix.       Estimates of futulre traffic have been made in the light of
information supplied. by the Government, the Oil Companies and KPT.  They
are considered reasonable and a suitable basis for port planning purposes.
x.        KIT's accumulated reserves and prospective earnings are amply
sufficient to finance the local currency cost of its development program
which includes the project.   KPT s debt service coverage will reniain
satisfactory.
xi.       The project is technically feasible and economically justified.
However KPT should undertake and implement; studies with respect to:-
(a) Costs and the rationalization of rates.
(b) Collection and compilat:ion of statistics.
(c) Strengthening of the Engineering Department.
(H) Mechanization of the handlinrg of hulk rirv targoes.
xii.      Satisfactory agreenmPt was reach.lhd on the above noints dchrina
negotiationS and the project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$17.0 millioi
equivalent=   KPI    l would he the borroweTr, a suitable term would be 25 vears
including a 5 year period of grace.



I. INTRODUCTION
l.~~1 Th     Goe.et on    -aistarn has requested the Barnki . o assi st

in financing the present expansion and development project of the Karachi
Port' Trusti which is parti of Pakistan' s Second Five-lea Plan.  The
project is a suitable one for a Bank loan of US$17.0 million equivalent
anu th-is report i s an aiJpraisa± therle0f.
2.        This report is based on iniform ation obtained by a  iission wiich
visited Pakistan in April 1963 and provided at that time by the Karachi
Port Trust, their consultants, and various other agencies.  Additional
information was rece4ved in October/Nove.ber 1963 and incorporated in
this report as was data provided by monthly progress reports supplied by
the port authority in connection wiTlh i:ank Loan 126-PAK of August 4, 1955.
3.        The 1955 loan amounting to UTS$14.8 million was made to reconstruct
and modernise 13 cargo berths, Nos. 5 to 17, of the East iTharves and to
provide cargo-handling facilities and transit sheds at the reconstructed
berths.   After some initial difficulties the project was satisfactorily
completed in 1962 except for some minoor works in the area of the rew transit
sheds.
II. KARACHI PORT TRUST
A. Ownership and General Powers
4.        The Karachi Port Trust Act of 1886, as modified to date, created
a Board called "the Trustees of the Port of Karachi" more commTonly known
as Karachi P'ort Trust (KPT).  The Board is a body corporate with perpetual
succession anLd is vested with the property and management of the port.
KPT has legal juriscliction over the 1 and, water and facilities within the!
port boundcaries which are adequate for its operations.
5.        KIT has limited autonomy.   Its general powiers are limited by
the overriding author-ity of the Central Government which must approre
policies ancd decisions of major importance.  Government approval is
required for the ordinary and capital budgets, the rates to be charged by
the port and loans incurred by KPT.   A7ain subject to Governmaent approval,
KPT has all the powers necessary to manage and operate the port and water-
ways under its jurisdiction; to maintain, improve and regulate their use;
to provide 1;erminal facilities for ships, cargo and passengers; and to
establish iits rates and dues.  Subject to the directions of the Govern-
mejit men-tioned above, KPT has the necessary powers to operate the port
efficiently..
B.  Organization and Management
6.        The 1960 Government of Pakistan Ordinance reduced the number of
trustees on the Board from 17 to 11, including the Chairman.  The trustees

responsible for carrying out the general policy of the Board and the day
to day operations of the port.
c.        The organiization of tne port is weii established and is soulnd,
but there is need of a fresh approach to some of the operational, technical
and fi.nancial problems of a modern port,.  KrlP's main departments are
headed by the Deputy Conservator, Traffic Manager, Chief Accolmtant,
Chief Engineer and the Mqechanical Engineer.
9.        Tthe operations of the Deputy Conservator s department include
the pilotage and allocation of anchorages of vessels and the buoying and
lighting of the navigation channels. The Traffic Manager's department
allocates berths to vessels and arranges for the receipt and delivery
of cargoes.   The senior officers on tthe traffic and operational side
of the administration are experienced in the operations of the Port of
Karach.i, bui are in need of new ideas, especially in the application of
modern cargo-handling techniques.

10.       The Chief Accountant is capable and w-ell-versed ill KPT's folm
of accountancy.   Previous promptings of the Bank to have KPi' initiate
an improved accounting system have not been too successful, but certain
improvements have been introduced mnd the present system of account keep-
ing is acceptable.
11.       The Chief Engineer's departnent is concerned with the survey
and maintenance of depths in the navigational channels and alongside
berths and waith the planning, provision and maintenance of the facilities
of the port.   New construction is normally done by outside contractors,
KPT having no New rWJorks departmernt or adequate equipment to undertake
work of tins nature.   For the major reconstruction scheme recently
financed by Loan 126-PAK and now practicall-T completed, a separate
engineering department was set up under an "Engineer-in-Chief."   This
department is now largely disbanded and most of the engineers who wvere
seconded to it have returned to their previous employment.
12.       KPT's Engineering Department is small and reqiLres strengtherning.
Tt deals only with the civil enAineerIng aspects of NC?P 's work a-nd a
reorganization appears necessary.   An increase in the number of engineer-s

Departmnent is not caipable of efficiently carri ng out supemrision over
the variouF items in the project.

C. The Staff and Labor
15.       So-nd procedures, set up over many years, are in operation for
the recruitment, promotion, welfare andt discipline of KP] s staff.
Clerical ancd administrative staff are generally not of a high standard,
prIMJarily because salaries ofLerea Dy KPrv are low.  rrivate industry
offering higher wages can attract the best-qualified people that are
available.   However KPrr provides fairl:y comprehensive welfare, housing,
medical and school programs.   Such facilities and services are generally
in short supply and help considerably in attracting and retaining workers.
In addition there are various recreational facilities, libraries, canteerns,
co-operative societies and an employees' welIfare fund.



16.       Port labor is increasingly well organi zed by two main labor
union, but is, in general, reasonably satis ied and Karachi port has
beenl remark-ably frae of strikes.  Labor relations are good and procedures
for the settlement of disputes are sound and have been successful.    Over
5,500 men are employed on the permanelnt staff and the average number of
hoarly employees has been about 3,,U00 in recent years.
17.       The number of men employed by KPT is relatively large and it
may be that with increased mechianization, accompanied by increased strength
in the labor unions, a redundancy in ranpower will result and a necessary
reduction will be difficult to effect.    Expansion of port traffic will,
of course, compensate for this tendency.
IIIe THE PORT OF KAFACHI
A. Development of the Port
18.       About 100 years ago the Port; of Karachi consisted only of a
sheltered anchorage, surrounded by many islets and creeks, capable of
handling ocean-going ships in almost any state of tide or weather.    Since
that time improvements to the anchorage include wharves, railway sidings
and transit sheds.   By 1910 there were 17 deep-water berths at the East
Wharves aggregating 8,600 feet and the port was primaril-Y engaged in the
handling of exports - particularly wheat.   Between 1920 and 1929, four
deep-water berths (Nos. 18 - 21) were constructed on the west side of tL.e
harbcr and land reclamation continued to provide additional areas for
future port develorment.   The present, port layout is showJn on the attacled
map.
B. Principal Facilities
19.       The entreuace to the harbor -s protected by the Manora break-
water and the Keamari groyne from which a channel, about 700 feet wide
and about two miles in length, leads loo the first berths of the East
Wharves.   These wharves provide the main berthage facility of the harbor
and number from 1 to 17 in all; berths 5 to 17 have been reconstructed during
the l=ast few years with the help nof T.oan 126-PAK.  Onnosite tile Rast
Wharvres there are four berths which presently constitute the latest develop-
ment of the nort. and consist of foeur conc-rete t iiqs vwi th a dienth alongs ide
of 32 to 31 feet at low water.   In addition, there are two lighterage
berths and one ship rpi pair berth  VesseDls can also he a-ccnmmordted at
moorings.   Ship building and repairs are carried out at the Karachi Ship-
yard which has  22   mile long access channel dredged tn a depth of 20 too
25 feet.   In 1957 an old bulk oil pier was extended so that two oil
tankers coul-d berth at one time.



- 5 -
20.       The limiting depthl across the bar is 28 feet at mean low water
which norma'.lv enables a 25 foot draft shi.p to enter at low tide.  The
mean tidal ra.nge is aboat 7 feet so that vessels of 32 foot draft can
enter the port on anv da7r of the irear.  IThe depths available in the inner
harbor are greater than those across the b.ar.  The main berthing facilities
include the followirng insta,latimo.s

two Bulk Oi:L Piers and berths 1 GD 4 Of o  te East 5Whnarves, tre fac'.itives
of the port are, in general, in good condition. The port is reasonably
provided w-ith quay cranes (52 of which were part of the project fLinaiced
by Loan 126-PAK) and there is a modest number of mobile cranes and other
cargo-handling equipment.   There are two shore-based heavy lift cranes
(25 and 30 tons capacity).   Bunkering facilities are provided at the
East and West Wharves and there is no shortage of water or electricity
in the port.    The port is wiell provided with roads and over-bridges ani
has a comprehensive railway network of over 100 miles of track serving
all of the main berths.   In the harbor area, under the control of KPT
and private enterprise, over 500 acres of storage space is available.
Covered storage is provided in eight transit sheds, aggregating about
825,000 square feet.
22.       There are 60 steel barges and a number of' lighters in the port
varying from 25 to 250 tons.   Among FKPT's floating craft are:-
6 tugs
2 bucket dredgers
1 grab dredger
4 hopper barges (800 tons)
1 30-ton floating crane
1 60-ton floating crane
(about) 20 launches of various types

2i4.      The prLncipal febaL-leb of Irl   o UpeI-atLons, its LtrafficLUan
operating ef'ficienlcy are set out below:-
A. Operations
25.       The port n.ormally works on a two shift basis and weckends and
holidays are worked as required.    Stevedoring on board ship is perforned.
by private contractors but KPI personnel handle goods on shore and operate
mechanical-htandling equipment.   General cargoes are normally check<ed by
tally clerks, this being particularly essential when berths are worked
with ships clouble-banked, which frequently has been the case during the
congested conditions of recent years.
26.       Passengers are handled under fairly pirimitive conditiorns at the
West Wharves and at Berths 1 to 4 of the East Wharves.    These latter
berths are in a generally dilapidated condition, the quay cranes havding
been removed, and no railway locomotives allowed to run on these berths,
as a safety precaution.   All berths in the harbor are normally serviced
bv road and rail.   Road traffic has increased in recent years while rail.
traffic has decreased, but normally all long distance cargo, because of
Karachi's relatively isolated position from its main service area, is
handled by tlhe railways.
27.       Ships moored at the anchorages sometimes load cargo overside to
and from lighters.   Ships under repair are handled at the moorings when.-
ever possible.   The lighters ply to and from lighter berths at the West
Wharves and also at the upper end of the harbor.    Heavy lift imports are
handled by PI'M's floating cranes into lidhters and thence to the West
Wharves where they can be put ashore by the land-based heavy-lift cranes.
B. Traffic
28.       In recent years out'bound cargoes have averaged 25 percent of
the total tonnages through the port as compared with 60 percent in the
immediate pre-war years.    Since Partition, in 1947, the basic pattern
of trade of the port has changed.    The main outgoing7 products now are
rice, cotton, oilseeds and cement.    Import traffic is composed largely
of pe-troleum produc-ts, U.S. commodi.ty aid wheat (under P.L. !8o), iron
and steel products and a wide range of general dry cargo goods.

under P.L. 480; a faster thani eipected. rate of increase in dieselization
on the railway; a raFid growth in motorization and unforeseen large ship-
ments of rice and cement either for export or to East Pakistan.
30.       Over 120,000 passenigers, including Haj pilgrims, have b3en
handled in the port during each of the past eight years; 156.500 were
handled duping 1962-63 (see Appendix L-).  Of this total, 138,000 travelled
an international or coastal vessels arnd 18,500 uilgrims used specially
chartered shins.
31.      I^hbile there has been no significant increase over the past 10
years in the numoer of vessels engagecd in international shipping whichr
entered the port annually, the average size of vessels and their cargoes
have been increasing.
32.       Karachi is the "home" port for most Pakistani flag vessels:
six shipping companies, which at the raoment jointly control over 40 vesse's,
are based t,here.  The Pakistan Navy, which operates its own installations
within the general area of the port anid harbor, often uses K?I' s anchorages
to moor its oim vessels.
33.       Despite some dislocation of traffic during the reconstruction
of the East Wharves the proportion of the total traffic handled at the
different locations has not changed significantly in recent years.  The
distribution of traffic handled is roughly as follows:
East Wharves               50%
West W-harves              15%
Oil Piers    >,            30%
Bunders, etc '/             5
C. Operating Efficiency
34.       KPPT's Traffic Department has not, until recently, kept separate
statistics of berth occupancy and of tonnage handled at each berth, and
therefore the efficiency of port operations had to be appraised on a
"wharves" basis.  As already described in paragraph 19, there are four
deep-water berths at the West Wfharves and seventeen at the East hliarves.
Berths 1 to ,. the reconstruction of which is part of the project now

under consideration, are in poor condit4-on and, according to KPT, can
on:Ly be operated at 50Z of their caDacitv.   Therefore it will be con-
sidered that, for the purpose of detenrining the average dry tonnage
handled -er berth, the Eas-t Wharves aLig7regate only 15 berths.
35.       The average dry tonnage ner- b2rth per year handled during the
last three years car.n be approximate`ly determined as follows:
East Ullarves   West Wharves
1960-61                            173,00         217,000
1962-63                            190,000         179,000
36.       The above figures take into account the cargo lightered from

slhps frequenttlY undergo  r    sairs at wo.king berths, and are m;ore re-
luctant to pay for overtime and week-end working.
38.       Appendices 1 and 2 show that in 1962/63, some 43% of dry cargo
traffic was of a bulk nature, comprising coal, wneat, sugar, cement,
fertilizer, rice, oil seeds, salt, scrap iron and iron ore.    Hlethods of
handling these various types of bulk cargo dif-fered, but in no case was
handling fully mechEaized.
39.       The effici;ency of port operations is corroborated by the numbers
of torns of bULk handled, per nooK per hour, in Karachi and. compared -with
U.S. ports' averages.

40.       However, this quite favorable comparison does not hold good for
generaLl cargo handling where the latest f-igures for the handling of general
cargo impor1;s is 9.5' tons and for expo:rts 12.6 tons per hook per hour.

Li.       Chronic congestion of ships ensures a very high berth occupanc,
in the port.   Alloring Sor one berth being out of cor,miSsion annually
for dredging and maintenance and incliidirg vessels that have been double-
ba:nked, KPT estimate that berth occupancy was as high as 99.3 percent
for the year ending Jlune 30, 1963.  Dven figures well below this can
only oe achieved at the expernse of delays to silippi-i and cargoes.  At
present the port is generally in an over-worked condition and without
"breathing space" between different sh:ipmenlts of cargo which would a'low
for efficient receipt and delivery, clearing of sheds, maintenan^e of
installations, etc.   Despite these adverse conditions operating efficiency
on the present two-shift system has been good.
42.       Congestioin of vessels waiting for berths at Karachi has persisted
for many years, but,, rnotwri.thstanding increasing traffic, waiting time of
vessels has actualliy been reduced.  The average waiting time for foreign
vessels, excluding oil tankers, which was 36 hours in 1960-61 became 16
hours in 1961-62 and 13 hours in 10962-63.  However waiting ti-me varies
largeLr from one month to another as can be seen from Appendix 5 and can
not be explained by seasonal causes.   Rather congestion is due to thLe
!bunlching! of ships, particularly vessels carrying food grains.
v, F7NATCES AND TARNY1NGS
A. Rates and Port Charaes
L3.      1Main services for which rates are assessed are wharfage, storage,
berthing, mooring, cranage, water supply and pilotage.    Wharfage and
-t,orang charges renresent the main inrome of the ponart, aot. 2/3 of' it_,
totLa operating revenue.   In March 1962 KPT submitted for Govermiental
approv1 a reni sed scale of charges.  These h.ave recently ;een apnroved
and will be implemented by iPT in July- 1964.
44.       The new scale aims to rationalize the major tariff rates under
fepfer and broader headings    . to adapl-t the charges to the actual cos of
the services renidered.  However, service costs are not taken as the sole
rc'id1nrg factor alndi various commorr iie-s, w.7hich are included in IJOest
Pakcistan's export promotion effort, benefit from reduced rates.   Simnilar
adranta-es are offered to food- in impo,r^s and to certain materials
required for developing industries.   In certain instances corrections
have been m.,ade to adjust the rates to those appli  in Indi an pots
The overall financial effect of the new scale wil-L be a slight increase

Reveni.e Reserve Fuid. and in fwids entitled ';other", such as Pro 'oAent
Fund, Fire and Accident Insurance, Snpl oyees Welfare etc. are not avail-
able for the financiing of the project.
47.       The debt/equity ratio is 20/8O and the current ratio stands
at 2.L : 1.   KPT's financial position Is sound.
C. Earnings
45.       Appendix 7 gives KPT's income accounts fror,m 1953/54 through
1962/63.   With the exception of 1958/59 and 1961/62, operating revenues
have grown steadily and lhave more than douibled since 1953/54.
49.       Operating expenses include contributions for Depreciation and
Replacement.  Depreciation is calculated on an annual basis of 1,'3Oth
of the tota:L value of equipment, machinery, craft, etc. and 1/70thl of
that of construction works, buildings, etc. which, when related to a
reasonable service 'Life, appear to be :Lnadeouate.  Since 1959/60 these
annual contributions also provided about PRs. 1.0 million for major
replacements.
50.       By 1956, KtPT had paid off all outstanding long-term debt exceplt
IBRD Loan 126-PAK for iwhich redemption contributions are made to the
Sinking Fund.   Provision was rmiade in Loan 126-PAK for pay,ment of "interest
during construction."  INotwithstanding t:his provision, KP1' continued
to make equal annual contributions to the Sinking Fund of PRs 5.S5 millicn
which covered not only the amortization but also the interest charges
alreadv paid from the Loan 126-PAK account.   Thus the contrib'utions
made to the Sinking Fund exceeded the actual requirements of the debt
servi-e.   In the oresent oroiect no interest during construc,ion has
been included.
51.       The operating ratio remains good; since 1953/54 it varied fron
52 nercent to ?4 ne:rcent.  Debt serv-ice is amplv covered and siince 1956
when KPT's old long-term debts were repaid, its debt coverage ratio has
never dropned lower than 2)    1.

VI. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
56.       Except for the new bulk oil jetty, whic-h was completed in 1957,
there has been no increase inI the dieep-sea shippinlg berths in the port of
Karachi since 1929.   As has been shown, the facili'ties of the port are
being very exten-sively utilized - at a rate hiaher than average and whicoi
is beyond the normal maximum for efficiency.
57.       In order to eliminate the present over-worked condition of the
port, JP., with its consultants, has devised the present project which
'ill provide a moderate expansion of the port's capacity.    The project
irnciudes a new oil berth to replace an old dilapidated jetty, reconstruct-
ion of berths 1 to 4 of the East Wharves, construction of thiree nevr
berths at the WJest Wharves, widening and deepening of the navigable
channel, rehabilitation of Manora breakwater and the Dreparation of a
master plan.   A detailed description and comments on the individual items
of the project are provided in Appendix 8; the estimated cost of each
project item is given in Appendix 9.
58?.      The Droiect is the maximum that can be provided within the present
physical layout of the port, but, as explained in Sara. 71 it iwill be in-
sufficient to cater for the forecast increase in traffic.   The future
needs of the port require to be studied and its further development co-
ordirated within the framework of a master plan; the u)reparation of iu hich
is includecd in the project.
B. Cost Estimates
59.       T'he total estimated cost of the project is PRs 178.5 million of

minor works will be supervised by Mi;s, C-r.ief Engineer's department,
suitably auirmented by thie recruitment or secondment of Pakistani engineers,
on a basis agreed during negotiation.

documents and the analysis of bids.
D. Justification cf the Project
(a) Greneral
62.       The economy of Pakistaan, and that of West Pakistan in particalar.
has grown steadily since Partition.   During the ten years 1950-5J to
1959-60 GNTP for the country as a :hole (no satisfactory breakdown by
Provinces is available) grewi at a compound rate of 2.2 percent per arnnr,
which was almost equal to the rate of population groXith durirng the period.
Over the first three years of the Second Plan (1960-65) GNP has been
inzreasing at an annaal average rate of' 3.7 percent.  Given aver2ge
w-eather conditions in the remaining twc years of the Plan, the total
increase in GINP will be about 22 percent (equivalent to an average of
4 percent per annum).
63.       The past growth of the economy has been accompanied by an
increase in traffic through the Port of Karachi:

64..      On the bas- s of existing information, it is not p,ossible to
deterpiine thJe relatiorshi p becieen the _roTth of specific traIffics through;
Karachi port :rith the growth in provincial or national GN?.  The volume
and type of imnports for example is inflj.enced by aedidnistrative changes
in quotas, rhanges in t.he Open General Licerce list, tne a'Tai.ability of
export Bonus Vouchers (i.e. right-s to a portion of the foreign exchange
earned from ex-ports v`hat can be uased to buir imports), the specifiLc reqwure-
merits of particular capital development p2ojec-ts as well as by the avail-
ab'ility of foreign eKchanrge earnecd or niade available bri thle Aid to
Fakistan Consortium, and by agreement+s made under the US P.L. L,80 Commodit-
Aid Sche.mT.  Tn recent years pxnort..s q ,av.e incraased partly as the rs-l.-t

a result of the largs investments made in ind-try, agiculture and iln-
frastructure during the Frst and cLurrent Five Year Plaris.
65.       The fact that Karachi is the only, deep-water port serving the
4-4 M..].J:Lion  Jo.le ln W;est Paki± ar has ±  UiLt the c eLU.ion of a'l
norma', irnport/export trade and inter-wing trade on this one port.  The

uj itmurue ra-±ll
66.       Thea question of estimaating future traffic through the port w%as
approached in two ways. First, a product by product forecast was examined
in the Baxic in the :Lght of provisional information relating to the Third
Five Year Plan (1965-70) which became available after the rnission's visit.
WIhiere necessarly, adjustments were made to the forecast which had been
prepared on the basis of information suppl:ied by Governm.ent Departments,
private oil cormpaides and KPTt s ovm enqiLries.  The changes were mainly
with respect to the somewhat optimistic performances expected from the
agricultural sector as comnared wsith past progress and technical possibilities.
67.       The result of this analysis, details of which are given in
Appendices 10 and 11., p;oduced tlle following forecast total figures;
(000,000 tons)
L962-63     1969-70     Percent
Actual      Forecast    Increase
Dry Cargo Iriports                  2.3          3.2         39
Dry Cargo Exports                   1.5          1.9         27

These forecast totals ar3 compared in Chart ITo. 2282 in the Appendix with
projections of pas`.- shori.-term and long-term trends.
68.       The second approach was one relating traffic through the port
wJith past and future tota' GNP.  Tn -its recently published "Guide'ines
tc) the Third l'ive Year Plan" the Goverrmer.t has ainrcanced. it hopes to
stepD up the 2rowth rate of GNP from an average L oerceont Te:' annum in
the Second Plan to 5.4 percent in the Thi.rd Plarl.  This would produce
a total inrrasep in fli\IP of 30 nnrcent. hnbewren '-65 anid 1970.  To achJ eve
this, total capital development expendi.tires will have to rise substantially
in the Third Plnr., abo- t one-half of wrhich worid.`rl si ne in West Fakistan
Expenditures relating to the Indus BaEin Vlorl:s Program are outside the Plan

capacity.   The reconstruction of berths 1 to 4 at the East Wharves will
remove the present limitations on their full utilization.   After the
completion of these works the port will nave 24 effective deep-water berths
:or dry cargo.   On the basis of a hig:h average rate of hnandling of 2u0,009
tons per deep-water berth annually the porttS capacity will be about 4.8
rmillion tons of dry cargo.  This tonnage is forecast to be reached oy
1966-67, one year before the project is expected to be completed.
(c) Alternatives to the Project.
71.       By using more inechanical-handling equiprmient, by the work-ing of
longer hours and by the adoption of ot-her means to increase operational
effic:iency some redLction in the p;^esent over-worked condition of the port
might be achieved.   Given the immediate forecast and longer term traffic
increase that are expected, these measures will not avoid the need to
build additional berths and restore existing ones to full operational
capacity.   While some of the items in the project could perhaps be located
elsewhere within the harbor area, the proposed sites are the most practical
tc meet tihe immediate foreseeab'e traf'fic reauire.nents.  They are also
the most easily exploited and, therefore, the least costLly alternatives.
According to both KPT and its consultarnts they do not conflict with the
envisaged master plan of long term development.   Any further physical
expansion beyond that in the project would have to take place away from
the present port layout and vill form part of the master plan study.

(d) Benefits of the Project
74.       The new oil bertlh, with the complementary channel widering and
deepening scheme, will replace the dilapidated oil berth and give KFT a
mocdern, t-wio berth terminal with sufficient' capacitj for all foreseeable
POL traffic.   The rehabilitat-ion of Marora breakwater will ensure pro-
tection to ships and help maintain the existing hydraulic regime at the
entrance to the harbor thus maintaininn: access to the port.
75.       Approximately 40 percent of the total cost of' the Project, or
some us$l14.7 million equivalent, is to keep in serrice or renlace exist-
ing facilities which need urgent repair or are du.e for reconstruct`on.
The repairs to the LTanora breakwaater, the reconstruction of berths 1 to
4 of the East W-1harves and the replacement of the bulk oil pier come within
thus category.
76.       The three new, berths at the West Wharves and the reconstruction
of' berths 1 to 4 of the East V.Tharves Till elimrinate some of the delays
to shipping and corresponding delays tc cargo.    The arnual average of
slhoping days lost w,aiting for berths in recent years has been one ship
day on all vessels using the port.   Shipping companies engaged in the
Karachi trade estimate that one day!s delay to a ship costs PRs. 6,000
or US$1,250 equivalent.   Withi the increased traffic and greater demand
for berthing space, delays and costs can be expected to increase.    Thus
byt 1969-70 lost shipp ing days may reach 1.800 each year ( a figure wxhich
was exceeded in 1960) and the financial loss to be about 1S732A million.
The savin, of this amount would represent a gross return of about 9 per-
Cent on the TJSt?5.0 m1illion to be irve:tod in wfarvres

A. Future Financial Results
79.       Earnings expected to be realized during the construction pericd
of the Project (1963/64 - 1967/68' are given in Appendix 12.    The l9`3/6!'
figures are those of KPT's budget, wh.ich a.ppear conscrvative.  Operating
reventres from l96l/65 to 1967/68 are c-alcula-ted on the basis of I'PT's
present scale of chargea.   Operating expenses take into account expected
salary increases and the cost of additi.onal staff requJired to deal w;ith
the nort's increasing activities.   The forecast income accounts provide
for (i) depreciation as presently calculated by KPT, (-i) major rep2ace-
ments by a fixed annual contribution of PRs. 1.0 million, and (iii) mincr
replacemrentS and reneowals by a fixed annual contribution of PRs. 0.4
million.
80.       Allowances are also miade for the se;vice of long-term debt
includ:ing (i) IB2D Loan 126-PAK, (ii) loans from consortiuam, coluntries at
6 percent. interest for ?5 years -nclud-ng a five year pericd of grace,
and (iii) a propoced second IBRD loan "assturied at 51 percent interest for
25 years including a five year grace period), allowance being made fo- a
'-2 percent Government charae as guarantor fee, maling a total of 6 percent
interest.   Notwithstanlding the grace periods of above loans (ii) ard (ii:i),
KPT intends to make advance annual contributions to the Siniong Fund
starting in :1964/65 for future debt amortization.
31.       During the construction period the operating ratio is expected
to remain low, some 65 percent.   The debt coverage ratio will drop from
3.4 to 2.8 : 1, no allowances being made for the advanced contributiolns
to the Sinkiiig Rand re'erred to in nara. R80  The inerost,P earnerd ratio
will decline from 7.2 to 3.7 : 1.

ment is rcasona'bly corapetont.  Thc operations of tho port are rcasonably
efficient.   The project is technically, economically and financially
sound. and uil  provide in a reasonable manner additional capacity needed
to help eliminate the present congestion in the port and wrill provide for
part of the forecast increase in traffic.   A master plan studv is re-
quired to determine how further expansion of the port should be undertaken.
Those items of the project dealing with repair and replacement will
maintain the existing facilities of the port.

operations in orCer to ratior.alize rates.
(b) Studies s'hould be undertaken to improve the collection

DX.AILS AND COINUTS ON THE PROJECT
1. The 1Ned.w Oil PierPi
T.he new oIl pier, for wrAhich the cont-act has bhen let-, .r71 1 "PrOn
the existing, old bulk oil pier which was constructed about 53 years ago and
is in a dilapidated condition i  Th- new    c         be U        to and
aligned with a second, 644 ft. long, concrete jetty which was constructe(d
;- -101f7
1Tlle rnew structure -vJill be of U0.dtei, Ud3tesi-g lU andcop;^Jlse aci rJ.l-ti V e±ly
small reinforced concrete jetty, 235 ft. x 35 ft., supported on steel box
piles, flank-rued by four mooring dolphins and complete with a shore conUecio'±Ln
carrying the pipes and a 12 ft. access road. It has been possible -to design
the new facility as a short, open structure rather than as a continuous,
closed one, and hence at a lower cost because of the inclusion in the project
of the widening of the channel opposite the new oil pier.  Tne wideiJ.ng ifill
enable sihips to move more freely in the channel opposite the oil installation
with a reduced risk of colliding with the oi.l piers or ships berthed thereat.
Designed de-pth alongside wil]. be 36 ft. at Mean Low Wlater and the new- facility,
together with the 1'357 jetty will meet the demands of the increased petroleum
traffic and in particular those of the new oil refinery which started opera-
tions in Karachi in 1962.
2. IWidening and Deepening of the Navigable Channel
This item provides for the widening and deepening of a portion of
the main navigable chlaannel. The existing fixed moorings in the area 1wfill be
moved to new positions in order that the channel may be widened and some
additional moorings will be provided in new locations.
At present the channel width in the lower harbor is 600 ft. and
tho depth of water provided in the area of the oil piers is 31 ft. belowi MIean
Low Water. This improvement scheme will provide a width of channel of
1,100 ft. and a depth of 34 ft. below Mean Low Wlater. The length of the
dredged area will be about 7,500 ft. and the quantity of dredged materia:L wzill
be approximately 3.0 millioin cubic yards.
KPT has sought the advice of an internationally knotn dredging
company, their past and present consulting engineers, and the Vlallingford
Hydraulic Research Station, U.K., and the consensus of opinion gathered is
that the iob can readily be done and will not be detrimental to the regime of
the waters in the harbor area.
A side benefit of the scheme will be that most of the dredged
mater-ial    bell hp. mitahlp for repelmaton purnposes and will be used to ricliyrn
about 150 acres of marshy foreshore land on Manora Island adjacent to the
irm.rproved channel. The wiTidened navnigable ch an.nel wrill prorie,nd irTnn.rnei ri're
for ships proceeding to and from the upper harbor and safer clearances between

passing ships and vessels moored at anchlorages and o-l tankers berthed at
the oil piers. This will help eliminate the chance of collisions leading to
oil spreading in the har'bor area -vwith its inherent risk of fire.
3. Reconstruction of Berths 1 to 4 East W.rharives
The main item in the project, financed by Loan ITO. 126-PAK was the
reconstruction of berths 5 to 17 of 't,he East W1harves.  KPT has nowr decided
that berths 1 to 4 of the East Wharves should be reconstructed.   The existing
quays are some 50 years old and much of the superstructure has been corroded
and weakened, and consequently IJPT has had to reduce the permissible loadings
on the quays thereby severely limitinp their usefulness in the last few years.
The reconst-Lncted berths 1 to L Till have the follo.wing lengths and
depths at hbean Low Water:
No. 1          500 ft. long          28 ft. deep
No. 2          500 "l                   if if
No. 3          550 11  I              34 t< tx
No. L          500" i                 3t"
The netT berths will 'h nrovidedA wi th t3hreP t.ra t, sheds and wi-th the usila
road, railua,r, electricity, water, bunkerage and cargo-handling facilities.
In addition it is T-Pr ?s inten.tion to~ inzororate amoc'ern passenger ter.ninal
into the upper level or the sheds for coastal and intercont'nental traf'ic.
The arrangements for designing and supervising the construction will

The Hianora breal:water was bu)ilt in lo'2-74 at the Fouth end of
ianora Island.  it is 1,500 ft. lIong, 24 ft. wide ard is constructed of large
concrete b:locks.  The breakwater has freqnlently been danmaged during severe
monsoon conditions., th1e last major repair be-ng carried out durir- 1952/53
at a cost of PRs 1.7 million.
The reconstruction of the b-eakwater wTill involv.re the placing of
small stones as a protective berm, placing precast concrete blocks or patented
tetrapods of about 12 tons vie-ght as a protective armoring on each side of
the breakwater and special protection using larg,er armoring up to 20 tons in
weight at the head of the breakwater.

COAL
Although local coal is of poor quality w-th a low calorific value
it can be improved by briquetting and coking.   EXplorations are urderwav to
increase Local production which is esxpected to reach 1.5 million tons -t)br
1965.   A tJarget of 3.0 million tons is being set for 197C, by tihlch time
imports are expected to cease.
IRON AND STEEL
:Imports which at present average about 250,000 tons a year are
expected to remain on the same level until 1966 when the new steel furnace
and mill Tlhich are to be constructed in Karachi come into production.  1he
nill; -.ith an initial capacity of 350,000 tons, till require inmported scrcp
cnd otiler raiu naterials which cre expocteo.d o anount to L50,000 tons a year.
Iirports of manufactured iron and stee:L products are expected to decline to
sor.e 1C0,000 tons - year macing a total i>mport under this hoading, therefore,
of abouu 550,000 tons b: 1970.
WHEAT
During the first Five Year Plan period (1955-1960) foodgrain
production increased at a slower rate than the population.   Large tonneaes
of commodity aid wheat have been imported from the United States under
Public Law L80.   One objective of the Second Five Year Plan was to continue
raising foodgrain production in order that self-sufficiency could be achieved
by about 1970.   The plan targets were based on an estimated annual increase
of 1.8 percent p.a. in population.   The 1961 census, however, has revealed
a rate of growth of 2.3 percent p.a.   Some recent statistical studies have
shown that population may, in fact, be growing at an even faster rate tharn
2.3 percent. p.a.  This suegests that the target of self-sufficiency in
foodgrain production is likely to remain elusive even at the present modest
levels of per capita consumption.   Therefore. the mission has assumed an
import of 200,000 tons of wheat as being still necessary by 1970.
SUGAR.
The import of sugar which has declined as a result of greater
local nroduct.on is t-xnPrt.P1 to bh fTirthir rc.Pdri_

General cargo imports, exclusive of iniports drectly related to tbe
nddus Basirn Works, are expected to increase by about 50,0CO tons a year.
This figure may be conservative when compered with the s'arp increase
recordod under this item during the first three years of the Second Five
iear Plan.
P,O.L. PRODUCTS
The Karachi refinery was cormpleted in November 1962 with an aniua.
lnitial capacity of' 1,500,000 tons.  The company concerned has decided to
build additional urits which will increase the refinery's capacity to
2,100,000 tons a yejar.  The figures showm in Appendix 10 take inbo accolunt
this maximum capacity which wrill probably not satisfy the total needs.
Imports of refined products, therefore, are still to be expected.    According
to the "Transportation Survey of West Pakistan 1962" carried out by Trarnsport-
ation Consultants Incorporated, the total needs will amount to 4,000,ooc tons
in ltSoO.
EXPORTS
RICE
T'he Second Five Year Plan envisages that rice production in West
Pakistan will increase by some 10 percent p.a. to a total of 1.3 million
tons by 1965.   A target of 1.8 million tons has been set for 1970.    It, is
expected that increased quantities of the highly desired West Pakistan rice
can be sold oversea,s, particularly to the Middle East.  In the information

of 461,000 tons would be maintained and increased at a rate of 25,000 tons,
annually through 1970.   However, in view of the greater than expected rate
of population increase and the inodest increases in purchasing power thlat cai.
be ex>;eC,SC in '.eSt Pakistan by 1970 it is felt that, in thiS casc, it -ould

SALT
Rock salt, which is m3n.red mainly irn Nor-th East Punjab, is not an
attractive export item because of the great distance of the mines from 1t.he
coast.   Only sea salt produced in the Karachi area is eccnomically
exportable..  Any increase, however, in prodlAcion is likely to be absorbed
by the expanding local cherwicE%l indrstries and the growing popilation anld
therefore salt export is foreeast to remain at a moxi:m,um level of l00,000
tons a year.
COTTON
The Government's policy which tended to emrphasize the production
of sugar and foodgrains to the detriment of cotton has been reversed.    It
is expected to result in a total production of 2.2 million bales in 196;
rising to 3.0 mi'lion bales in 1970.    This is to be achieved m^re by
increasin2 yields, the greater use of fertilizers and better seed rather
than by additicnal acreage which has to be shared with other agri c.l¢turai
products, mainl%r w-heat, for which self-sufificiencv is soup.g-h'.  Desnite the

OTHEJR
Other exports have been asslxmed to increase by 25,COO tons a yaar
to 1970 on the bas:is of the actual 1962-63 fi.gures.  This tiend, which s
probabliy conservative, is expected to be possible because the gradual
indastria:i_.zation of West Pakistan should res-ult in larger quantities c:F a.
variety of manufactured items and consurer du.rables, porin ons of which 3hould
be availab:;e for export.  One of the Second Five Year Plkn Coals is to
increase production of heavy industry by 15 perceent and srmall-scale i.L:dutry
by 50 percent.   Some 5 percent of this incroased industrial productior Is
expected to become available for export.
