PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Third
Railway Project in Sudan for which Credit 457-SU in the amount of US$24.0
million was approved by the Board on January 8, 1974. The Credit was
closed on September 30, 1980.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Eastern Africa
Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the files, from
Appraisal and Supervision Reports, and from data supplied by the Sudan
Railways Corporation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department but
the project was not audited by OED staff. The Draft Completion Report was
sent to the Borrower but no response was received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 457-SU)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was unsuccessful in that it did not enable the
railway to carry the increasing freiqht traffic that was available. While
the project provided a significant addition of locomotives and freight
waqons, operational efficiency of the railways declined during the project
period and available freight traffic was increasingly diverted to road
transDort.
The PCR highliqhts the following points of interest relating to
the preparation and execution of the project:
- During preparation and appraisal, the Bank did not adequately
appreciate the magnitude and complexity of the obstacles to improving
operational efficiency. In particular, manpower and managerial constraints
proved to be more serious than had been estimated. Unfortunately, the
technical assistance and training component of the project did not address
these issues adequately. In retrospect, the scarcity of trained, skilled,
motivated and disciplined manpower at all levels of railway operations is
probably the single most important source of inefficiency in railway
operations in Sudan (Para 9.07).
- Potential diversion of existing rail traffic to road transport
was by and large ignored during appraisal. This traffic diversion reached
major proportions during the implementation of the project (Para 2.09).
- Appraisal forecasts of railway traffic (Paras 4.01-4.07) and
anticipated improvements in efficiency (Para 4.10) were far too optimistic
and not in line with past experience.
-  Despite clear violation of a major covenant of the Credit
Agreement, the Bank showed an unwillingness to enforce the covenant
(Paras. 3.11-3.18).

SUDAN THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Sudan, the largest country in Africa with an area of about 2.5
million square kilometers and a population of 16 million, is served by
4,800 km of railway, about 18,500 km of roads and tracks (of which only
about 1,500 km are paved) and 1,690 km of navigable water ways. Prior to
appraisal, the Sudan Railway Corporation (SRC) had a near monopoly of
inland transport, especially on the most important Port Sudan-Khartoum
route connecting the country's only deep water port with the capital and
the rest of the country. Subsequently, as a result of poor performance of
the railways, there has been a significant growth in freight transport by
road at the expense of the railways. Government policy also has tended, in
recent years, to encourage. road transport along corridors served by the
railway. Thus, roads were constructed on routes parallel to railway lines
on the Khartoum-Port Sudan, Wad Medani-Sennar-Kosti routes; also, import
duties on trucks were reduced to promote expansion of road transport.
Despite these actions favoring road transport, Government retains the view
that the railway will continue to play a significant role in transport of
agricul.ural produce and other low value commodities that move in large
volume over great e 3tances. The mass of Sudan's export surpluses in the
future, therefore, appears to be adapted to railway transport.
1.02      The Railwavi Project (Credit 457-SU) was the third in a series of
Bank-financed projer.s for che Sudan Railways. The first loan (202-SU,
1958) of US$39.0 million 5'nlpeK finance the railways' 1959-60 investment
program which cDnsisted of (i) acquisition of locomotives and rolling
stock; (ii) track re.abilitation; (iii) extension of western lines; (iv)
modernization of workshops; (v) modernization and expansion of Port Sudan;
and (vi) acquisition of river craft. It was not completed until 1964. The
second loan (440-SU, 1965) of US$31.0 million assisted in financing of the
railways' 1966-68 investment program; its principal features were (i)
procurement of mainline and shunting diesel locomotives; (ii) procurement,
construction and improvement of rolling stock; (iii) relaying of rails on
the Khartoum-Atbara-Port Sudan line; (iv) the acquisition of a dredger and
certain equipment for the improvement of river services; and (v) the
completion of the new cargo berths and the construction of a cargo shed at
Port Sudan. Execution of the project was slow and the loan was not fully
disbursed until mid 1972, three years later than scheduled.
1.03      Bank experience in lending for railway development in Sudan was
reviewed in the Project Perforniance Audit in 1974 for the Second Railway
Project. It concluded that the ultimate objectives, to increase the
efficiency and capacity of the railways, were not achieved, noting that a
major problem was the low availability and poor operational performance of
the locomotives. The audit also noted that locomotives procured under the
project proved unsatisfactory for the climatic conditions of Sudan. The
evaluators expressed the view that too much attention had been focused on



equipment procurement and not enough on equipment utilization.  While the
Audit report was published after the initiation of the Third Railway
Project, this project provided for greater efforts aimed at developing
labor skills in the system.
1.04      The only other Bank Group financing in the transport sector prior
to appraisal was IDA Credit (331-SU, 1972) of US$7.0 million which was
primarily directed to the improvement of highway maintenance but also
included technical assistance for planning and coordination of the
transport sector as a whole. This project was satisfactorily completed in
1979/80.
1.05       During the seventies, Bank Group involvement in the transport
sector increased substantially. Recognizing the special need (expressed in
the Performance Audit of the Second Railway Project) to improve utiliza-
tion, the Bank, in 1973, proposed a technical assistance project aimed at
achieving improvements in operating efficiency. UNDP made available
US$434,000 for this purpose. The Bank was named the executing agency for
the project which engaged a team of nine managerial and technical experts
to give operational assistance to SRC by way of advisory services and
counterpart training. A Technical Assistance Project, approved in 1976
(Credit 614-SU, US$4 million) financed the execution of pre-investment
studies in various sectors, including transport. The Bank engaged a
workshop expert from the Indian Railways to investigate the problem of low
availability of locomotives and on-line failures. Technical assistance and
training have continued as a necessary component of Bank-financed projects
in this sector. The Bank approved a project (Loan 1287T-SU and Credit
643-SU, US$20 million and US$9 million) for developing four domestic
airports in 1976. Implementation of this project was long delayed and most
of the funds were cancelled. In 1977, the Board approved a Fourth Railway
Project (Loan 1467T-SU and Credit 727-SU, US$8 million and US$12 million)
and in M4arch 1978, approved a Port Project (Credit 781-SU, US$22 million)
to improve Port Sudan. The Second Highways Project was approved in 1979
(Credit 882-SU, US$41 million) for road construction, maintenance and
design. A Second Port Project for the further development of Port Sudan
and to provide for handling of container traffic was approved by the Board
in April 1982 (US$25 million).
1.06    Bank lending to the railways was intended to improve operational
efficiency and to provide sufficient capacity to enable the system to carry
expected increases in traffic. Simultaneously, the Bank sought changes in
SRC's organizational structures and in SRC's relationship with the
Government through conditions of loan negotiations and specific covenants
in the credit agreement or project agreement. However, notwithstanding
substantial Bank financing during the late seventies and early eighties,
performance of the SRC has been unsatisfactory. Operational efficiency
declined during most of the project period and the railways were unable,
given the poor level of efficiency, to carry the available traffic.
Organizational and managerial changes did not have a significant impact on
operations.



-3-
1.07      Following this experience in the implementation of Bank-financed
railway projects, there is now an increasing concern as to how to alleviate
institutional and managerial constraints on the performance of the SRC.
Future Bank involvement will focus on improving the performance of its
management and staff, with special emphasis on improving SRC's
competitiveness with road transport, development of SRC's ability to
maintain and operate the locomotive fleet and restoration of SRC's
financial viability.
1.08      This completion report is based on information supplied to Bank
Supervision missions in December 1981 and May 1982 and on a review of the
Bank's files in Washington.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01      The Third Railway Project was first conceived as a part of the
Sudan Government's and SRC's five-year-development plan (1971-75). In its
original version, this plan included the replacement of wagons, siqnalling
equipment, etc. A sum of £510.0 million was assigned for procurement of
wagons and £S5.0 million for improvement of fixed installation. The total
foreign exchange cost of this procurement was expected to be aporoximately
£56.7 million, of which external assistance of £54.0 million was sought
mainly for purchase of wagons.
2.02      This plan was substantially modified after a Bank Mission to
Sudan in late 1971 recommended a substanti.al increase in investment
allocation to the transport sector in general and to the railways in
particular. It also widened the scope of the proposed lending to include
the initial development of Port Sudan. A pre-appraisal mission in
September 1972, after reviewing the investment requirements in the light of
price changes, increases in taxes, and other considerations, proposed an
allocation of £527.0 million (US$75.0 million) for railways and £S3.0
million (US$8.4 million) for the Phase I development of Port Sudan. It was
expected that the foreign exchange component of the plan would be £S14.5
million (US$42.0 million) and the Mission recommended Bank Group lendinq of
the order of US$20.0 million. The appraisal mission, in December 1972,
revised this to IJ524.0 million.
2.03      The project consisted of (a) the 1973-75 investment program of
the Sudan Railways Corporation (SRC); (b) equipment and technical
assistance for Port Sudan; (c) equipment and technical assistance to the
newly-formed River Transport Corporation (RTC); (d) airport pre-investment
studies; and (e) training for the staff of the Auditor General. The total
project cost, at time of appraisal, was estimated at US$79.7 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$44.1 million (5596). IDA's contribution
to the foreign exchange expenditure was estimated at US$24.0 million which
is about 54%O of foreign costs or about 30%O of total project cost.
2.04      The primary objective of the project was to increase substantial-
ly the carrying capacity of the railways, thus, enabling the system to
satisfy increasing demands for its services. To this end, the project
focussed on the need for investment both to improve the railway's operating
standards and to procure additional locomotives and wagons for increased
carrying capacity. This, it was expected, would increase capacity from 3
million tons in 1972 to 4.4 million tons in 1980. The plan also envisaged
investment to improve the cargo-handling productivity at Port Sudan and to
expand the bulk oil transport capacity of the River Transport Corporation.
The project provided for technical assistance in the form of training
centers for the railway staff, pre-investment studies for aviation and
technical assistance and development studies for Port Sudan.



2.05      The various components of the project are summarized below:
Railways
i)     Track renewal, consisting mainly of sleeper replacements,
drainage improvements and siding installations.
ii)    Structures and communications, including minor additions
and improvements to railway buildings and workshops and to
workshop equipment and handling facilities. An important
element was the provision of better communication on the
Port Sudan-Khartoum routes to improve traffic operations.
iii)   Locomotives and Rolling Stock.  This was, by far, the
major component of the project. On the basis of an
anticipated increase in railway traffic and with a view
towards elimination of steam traction, the project
provided for rehabilitating the diesel fleet and for
buying 10 main-line and 20 shunting diesel locomotives.
Based on an. assessment of the additional wagon capacity
that would be necessary to carry the anticipated increase
in freight traffic, the project provided for the
procurement of 620 freight wagons (to replace small-
capacity wagons more than 40 years old and unsuited to
carry bulk cargos over long distances) and an additional
380 wagons including 100 oil tank wagons to handle
increases in freight traffic. Additional passenger
coaches were also to be provided to meet the forecasted
passenger traffic. Also included in the project was a
program to reduce breakdown of trains through provision of
roller bearings and improved couplers for rolling stock.
iv)    Training.  Equipment and initial foreign expert assistance
for the central railway training school-proposed to be
established at Atbara.
Ports
i)     Equipment, Facilities and Structures.  The project
provided for a limited expansion in port facilities, some
extra storage sheds and for the purchase of new and
replacement shore and floating equipment.
ii)    Technical assistance to improve port management and
reorganize maintenance.
Other Project Items
i)     Provision of equipment and technical assistance to the RTC
to ensure coordination with railway services and to
increase efficiency of fleet operations.



- 6 -
ii)    Pre-investment. studies for a fut.ure airport construction
project.
iii)   Assistance for the training of senior staff of the Auditor
General.
2.06      During preparation and appraisal staqes, much att.ention centered
on the procurement of diesel locomotives. SRC's original investment plan
made no allocation for the dieselization of traction power.  In a revision
of the plan, £S6.0 million (or as much as 25°o of the SRC investment
proqram) was allocated to the procurement of diesel locomotives for a
gradual transition from steam to diesel traction.  Bank staff were
influential in this basic change in the program. While Sudan Railways, in
the beginning, was reluctant to abandon steam traction, Bank staff
suggested further acquisitions of diesel locomotives, permittinq
the replacement of steam traction which, in the Bank's view, would almost
certainly produce a very high rate of return and, at the same time, bring
about a much improved utilization of existing wagons.
2.07      At the early stages of project preparation and pre-appraisal, a
number of issues arose and some differences developed between the Bank and
the Government. While the Bank and the Government resolved their
differences on some points, in other instances, including key issues having
a significant impact on the railway project, the Bank had little
influence.  Five of the important issues were:
i)     Proposed construction of a paved road parallel to the
railways between Port Sudan and Khartoum;
ii)    proposed construction of an oil pipeline between Port
Sudan and Khartoum,
iii)   construction of a new port at Suakin, about 40 km south of
Port Sudan,
iv)    acceptance of external technical assistance for railway
operations, and
v)     the excessive level of Sudan Railways' receivables based
on transport services to Government agencies.
Each of t.hese issues is discussed in turn.
2.08      Even before the pre-aopraisal mission in August 1972, the Bank
was aware of the proposal for constructing t.he first 500 kms of a 1,200 km
road to provide a new link between Khartoum and Port Sudan. The Bank
expressed the view that economic justification of this proposed investment
was doubtful, and that the road would endanger the railway's financial
position by causing a major diversion of high value traffic from rail to
road transport. The Bank advised the Government to postpone this
investment until studies establishing the road's technical and economic
viability could be completed. No further mention of this issue is made in



the files. The appraisal report for the Third Railwav Project did not
consider that diversion of traffic from rail to road transport was a
serious issue. The economic evaluation of the railway project assumed that
available traffic would not be transported by any means if railways did not
increase capacity. Actually, substantial diversion of traffic from rail to
road did occur even before the construction of the paved road in the late
seventies and the diversion increased thereafter.
2.09      A decision to build an oil pipeline from Port Sudan to Khartoum
was imminent at the time of the pre-appraisal mission in September 1972.
This decision was influenced by the inability of the railways to handle all
bulk fuel traffic. The Bank suggested that the decision be postponed until
a study, financed by the Bank and conducted by consultants, could assess
the need for such a pipeline. In January 1973, the consultants study
showed that the pipeline project was not justified. The Bank then obtained
an assurance from the Government that it did not intend to construct the
pipeline at that time. The Decision Memorandum dated February 6, 1973,
however, stated that there still was a need to include in the Credit
Agreement written assurance that the Government would not proceed withi the
pipeline without Bank approval. In early July 1973, prior to negotiations
of the Credit Agreement, the Bank was informed that Government had decided
to construct the oil pipeline. It appears from the files that the only
reaction of the Bank to this decision was to revise traffic forecasts and
adjust, accordingly, the rolling stock requirements. The issue was not
raised during negotiations for the railway project. The pipeline began
operation in 1977.
2.10      As early as November-December 1971, an economic mission to Sudan
noted the Government's inclination to build a new port at Suakin to supple-
ment Port Sudan. The economic mission felt that investment in the proposed
new port could be postponed by as much as ten years by expanding the
capacity at Port Sudan. It, therefore, advised the Government to postpone
this investment until studies establishing the need for a new port were
completed. However, during the pre-appraisal mission in September 1972, it
became known that a decision to build the first phase of the port at Suakin
seemed already to have been taken without the benefit of feasibility study
or firm financial arrangements. Nevertheless, it was agreed during the
appraisal, in December 1972, that the Third Railway Project would include a
small sum for financing consulting services to examine alternative possibi-
lities for expanding Sudan's port capacity, including the development of a
new port at Suakin. This suggests that either (i) the decision to
construct a new port was not yet finalized at the time of the appraisal or
(ii) while the decision had already been taken, the inclusion of consulting
services for port development was accepted under Bank pressure to process
the loan applicatior.. Subsequently, during credit negotiations in November
1973, the Bank was informed that the Government was proceeding with the new
port at Suakin and that no consulting services would be required for
evaluating the need for a new port at Suakin. While this departed from the
understanding reached during appraisal, it was realized that, in any case,
it would be five years or more before full facilities (including infra-
structure development) at Suakin would be available. In the meantime,
there remained an urgent need to expand Port Sudan's facilities and



-8-
consulting services could usefully identify specific short and long-term
port development possibilities. Preparation for the Port Suakin project
reached a tentative conclusion in June 1981 when agreement, in principle,
was reached between Governments of Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Federal Republic
of Germany to proceed with Port Suakin so as to start operations by
mid-86. However, under strong Bank objections and pressure, assurances
have been obtained from the Government that this development would be post-
poned.
2.11      The need for foreign technical assistance for improvement in
railway operations was recognized by the Planning and Transport Ministries.
Nevertheless, there was considerable reluctance in the railways' management
to accept that there was a need for such help. The appraisal was made
conditional upon the realization of substantial progress in the
arrangements for technical assistance. Furthermore, the Issues Paper
recommended that credit negotiations should not be undertaken until a firm
commitment for the technical assistance services had been obtained. This
condition was presumably met by the Government. However, this commitment,
even if fulfilled by the Government, was not an adequate basis for the
effective use of technical-assistance. This became evident soon thereafter
when the consultants were faced with a generally uncooperative and negative
attitude of railway management.
2.12      At the time of pre-appraisal, Sudan Railways receivables were of
the order of US$5.5 million in excess of normal, much of this excess being
due to slow payment by Government-controlled organizations. The mission
advised the Government that it would expect a significant reduction in the
level of receivables by the time of appraisal. The Issues Paper recom-
mended that a satisfactory solution to this problem be reached as a pre-
requisite for negotiations.  No satisfactory solution was found, however,
and a specific covenant (Section 3.03) was introduced in the Credit
Agreement to ensure settlement of Government accounts and other overdue
accounts with SRC by June 30, 1977, and that Government would agree to the
prompt settlement on a monthly basis of accounts for services rendered by
SRC after February 1, 1974. These conditions were not fulfilled until FY
78.
2.13      The Credit and Project Agreements contained a number of other
covenants which sought to ensure financial autonomy and viability for the
railways and ports. These covenants are discussed in Chapter III and Annex
2.
2.14      At time of appraisal, the intended completion date for the
project was September 1976 and the closing date, June 30, 1977.

III.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.01      The Third Railway Project Agreement was signed on January 31,
1974, and became effective on July 29, 1974. This delay in effectiveness
is attributed to the time taken by the Sudan Government to provide the
Bank, as required for credit effectiveness, evidence that a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement had been duly executed by the Government and Sudan Railway
Corporation (SRC). The planned date of effectiveness, May 1, 1974, was
extended twice at the request of the Government.
Procurement:
3.02      There were considerable delays in the execution of the project.
During the first few years, progress in procurement of items financed under
the Credit was satisfactory. In the later stage, however, procurement was
slow. This was attributable to (i) lack of detailed list of goods; (ii)
insufficient response to some invitations to bid; and (iii) delays in
delivery after signing of contract.  The lack of a detailed list of goods
at the time of appraisal delayed disbursements considerably and, thus, the
completion of the project as shown in Figure 3.1. While the appraisal
report provided a general description of items and estimated costs of.
principal components of the project, the basis for more definitive
specifications was lacking at time of appraisal, awaiting studies to be
completed. Subsequently, while procurement of items already identified
progressed satisfactorily, identification and preparation of procurement
documents for other items led to long delays in delivery. For example, in
the case of SRC equipment for telecommunications, and workshops and
training school and equipment for the Sea Ports Corporation, bids were not
evaluated, nor contracts awarded, until the end of 1976. As a result, the
opening of the training school was delayed until May 1980, and the instal-
lation of communications equipment was not completed until March 1981.
3.03      In regard to project items not financed by the Credit, progress
in procurement was slow, particularly for the rehabilitation of existing
main-line locomotives. Rehabilitation of English Electric locomotives was
delayed due to shortages of crucial spare parts financed by ODA; the
availability of Hitachi locomotives for service remained low throughout the
period. These delays compounded the inefficiencies of railway operations.
3.04      Annex 1 gives the procurement plan for Bank and non-Bank financed
items. The time taken in the various stages of procurement of IDA-financed
items is given below. In the absence of similar information at time of
appraisal, a comparison between anticipated and actual timing could not be
made.

3.05      With the exception of a diesel crane (65 m tons) and machines for
the technical school, invitations to bid for various components followed
within two months after IDA approval of tender documents. For most items,
the procedure from the invitation to bid through the approval by IDA of the
proposed contract required about seven months.
3.06      Except for PABX equipment for Atbara and the 65-ton diesel crane,
the delivery time for IDA-financed equipment was reasonable.
Project Cost:
3.07      The estimated costs, at time of appraisal, of different
components of the project are snown in Table 3.1, while Lhe percentages
representing different components in the estimated total project cost are
shown in Table 3.2. A high proportion of total cost is allocated to items
designed to increase transport capacity, particularly by increasing the
number of locomotives, wagons and oil barges.  Nearly 69% of foreign costs
(and 57% of total costs) fall into this category while, at most, 17% of
foreign cost (and 28% of total costs) are investments for improving the
efficiency of operations.
3.08      As a result of delays in execution and increased prices, the
credit procured less goods than intended at time of appraisal. To maintain
the same real content of the original project, an allocation of US$92.0
million would have been required in 1980--a 15% increase in the cost of
items included in the project at appraisal. The cost increases made it
necessary to reduce significantlv the list of itrms in the appraisal. An
18% cutback in the foreign currency cost of the project was necessary and,
for some components, even greater reductions were required.  For instance,
the cost of the Railway Training School at Atbara, estimated at US$1.0
million during appraisal, rose to US$4.0 million when building began; this
necessitated curtailment of the plan with the remainder to be executed
during the planned Fourth Railway Project.
3.09      At the time of project appraisal (November 1973), the Bank did
not require that the Borrower submit to it a report on completion of the
project. As a result, information on many items not financed by the IDA



- 11 -
credit was not maintained by the Borrower, which makes appraisal cost and
actual cost comparisons difficult for the non-IDA financed items. Table
3.3 shows a comparison of the actual costs and appraisal estimates of IDA-
financed items for the SRC. Available information on non-IDA items is also
provided.
Disbursements:
3.10      The disbursement schedule prepared at time of appraisal is given
in Table 3.4. Disbursement was expected to begin within five months of the
date of signing of the Credit Agreement, i.e. June 30, 1974.  Actually, the
Credit did not become effective until the end of July 1974. As a result of
procurement delays (see Para. 3.02), actual disbursements were much slower
than anticipated as illustrated in Figure 3.1. The initial delay of about
one year remained the second quarter of 1977 and the disbursement was only
about half the forecast amount until that year. In subsequent stages, the
divergence between the Bank's revised disbursement schedule and actual
disbursement became greater. Disbursements were finally completed in
September 1980.
Change in Project Content:
3.11      A comparison between actual and forecast procurement of major
equipment is shown in Table 3.5 and Table 3.6. For most items, the
appraisal report did not specify the quantity of items to be procured in
the project. Consequently, it is impossible to compare, in physical terms,
actual procurement with the quantities envisaged at time of appraisal.
This problem is apparent in Table 3.5 which provides data on actual
procurement, but little information for forecast procurement. Costs of
different components rose significantly in relation to appraisal estimates
with the result that the physical dimensions of the project were reduced.
3.12      Soon after the Agreement was signed in January 1974, there was a
major change in the original investment plan of the SRC on which the
project was based. This change was the inclusion in the plan of the
following additional procurement: (i) 140 passenger coaches from Hungary;
(ii) 20 heavy line locomotives and 10 light line locomotives from General
Electric, USA; (iii) 10 heavy line locomotives from Germany.  The
additional 40 locomotives and 140 passenger coaches were estimated in
1974 to cost US$55.0 million equivalent, thus increasing planned investment
during the three years from US$79.7 million to US$134.7 million. While no
part of this additional procurement was to be financed from the Credit,
this new investment clearly had major implications for the project. The
background of this change is outlined in the following paragraphs.
3.13      While the Bank was aware of tenders being invited for the 40
locomotives at the time of negotiation, it was given to understand that the
Government and SRC would make a formal request to the Bank for its concur-
rence. Clearly, the Bank was of the view that a case had yet to be made
for the purchase of the additional locomotives and that justification was
required before the Bank would agree. It was, of course, presumed that
Section 4.03 (see Annex 2) would preclude any unilateral action on the part
of the Government and SRC on this matter.



- 12 -
3.14      At the time of negotiations, SRC was already well advanced
towards inviting bids for the 40 additional locomotives. Apparently,
during negotiations, IDA was informed that SRC would need to re-evaluate
its locomotive requirements in view of the possibility that the targets for
operational efficiency established in the appraisal report did not
materialize. According to the Government, the Bank had been fully briefed
prior to negotiations concerning the Government's and SRC's intention to
buy the locomotives and the Bank, had been made fully aware that the
Government planned to go ahead and acquire this additional equipment with
bilateral financing. Moreover, in the Government's view, the requirement
in Section 4.03 of the Credit Agreement that investments over p200,000
needed Bank approval, did not apply to investment in the 40 additional
locomotives.
3.15      Subsequently, when the SRC was far advanced toward the purchase
of the locomotives and coaches, the Bank decided after much deliberation
that it would make no move to prevent the procurement although it
recognized that the Government's action was in clear violation of Section
4.03 of the Project Agreement. This decision caused some concern among the
Bank's staff because (a) an addition of 50 new line locomotives of
different types over a period of two years would create serious problems in
providing adequate maintenance and in training of personnel, and (b) the
breach of contract by SRC so soon after negotiations would set an adverse
pattern for subsequent implementation of the Project. The Bank's decision
concerning this matter was influenced by the following factors: (i) SRC's
consultants on operations had determined that additional locomotives would
be needed because operational inefficiencies led to a relatively heavy
requirement for locomotives; (ii) in view of the soft lending terms for the
purchase of these items and the favorable railway tariff at that time, the
additional capital investment was not expected to place an excessive burden
on SRC's finances.
3.16      There seems little doubt that a genuine misunderstanding
developed with regard to this procurement. There was also a reluctance,
both on the part of Sudan Government and the Bank, to clearly spell out
their disagreement and its consequences for the project. While the
Government made it known to the Bank that it was considering proposals for
purchase of additional wagons and locomotives, it did not insist on
amending the Agreement to allow for this possibility. Eventhough the Bank
knew that the Government was negotiating for the purchase of the additional
items, it did not stress that the loan could not be approved in those
circumstances. Section 4.03 of the Credit Agreement, while necessary for
preventing future violations, was not specific enough in relation to the
known disagreement.
3.17      The SRC apparently considered it necessary to purchase the addi-
tional locomotives in view of the low operational efficiency using existing
locomotives. In view of the failure to achieve operational targets, it
would appear that the Railways' decision had some justification. However,
while the SRC claimed that the decision to procure additional locomotives
would result in improved operational performance, improved efficiency, in
fact, was not realized except in the year 1976-77.



- 13 -
3.18      The purchase of the additional locomotives exacerbated an alreadv
difficult problem of equipment maintenance. To alleviate this problem,
some re-allocation was made in the category "Freight wagons and components"
where the original allocation of US$10.79 million was raised in December
1978 to US$13.44 million to permit an increase in procurement of spare
parts. The other measure the Bank took was to suggest to the consultants
on operations that they reorder their priorities to devote greater
attention to problems of maintenance and training of personnel for the new
fleet. In view of the continued decline in operational efficiency, these
measures were clearly inadequate.
Technical Assistance:
3.19      Implementation of the technical assistance component of the
project included the following specific items:
a)     the establishment of a central railway training school at
Atbara, financial assistance to the school for equipment
and initial foreign expert assistance (US$1.0 million).
b)     Consultants to-the Sea Ports Corporation to improve port
management and to re-organize maintenance; they also
examined the medium and long-term port requirements of
Port Sudan (US$0.67 million).
c)     Consultants to undertake engineering and economic analysis
for the further development of airports at Port Sudan,
Wau, Juba, and Malakal; these pre-investment studies
formed the basis for a future airport construction project
(US$1.0 million).
d)     Assistance in training senior staff of the Auditor General
employed on SRC and other public enterprise auditing
(US$0.16 million).
The total cost of this technical assistance was US$2.83 million which
constituted roughly 12% of the total credit.
3.20      Construction of the railway school was greatly delayed as the
design of the school and the listing of necessary equipment for the school
required much more time to prepare than anticipated. Also, as a result of
cost increases, the scope of the original plan was reduced. The first
phase of operations of the training school operation began in May 1979. By
December 1979, the school organized and conducted a refresher course and a
basic course, both covering diesel and mechanical engineering, track
maintenance, signalling, traffic and goods handling, and materials manage-
ment. The basic course included air-conditioning and refrigeration. A
total of 283 students took part in the first phase. In the meantime, the
school introduced an overseas training program for instructors.
3.21      The Sea Ports Corporation (SPC) contracted with consultants for a
feasibility study for future development of Port Sudan. This work was



- 14 -
completed satisfactorily in March 1977 and provided the basis for the Sudan
Port Project appraised in July/August 1977 and approved in June 1973.
3.22      As part of the training program for the staff of the Auditor
General, staff members attended specifically tailored training courses in
the U.S. and U.K. On-the-job training in auditing was also provided.
3.23      Consultants on the pre-investment study on airport facilities
requirements completed their work satisfactorily.  Their draft report was
reviewed by the Bank in February 1975 and led to the appraisal of the Civil
Aviation Project in May 1975.
Project Implementation Schedule:
3.24      The appraisal report did not present a project implementaton
schedule although it did specify when certain events were to be
accomplished. In the following table, some important elements of project
timing are indicated, showing the dates of key actions anticipated during
appraisal and comparison of those dates with actual dates for the actions:
Bank Dis-
bursement   Project      Loan
Effectiveness Completed  Completion Closing
Appraisal May 1, 1974   Dec. 1976  Sept. 1976 06/30/77
Estimate
Actual    July 29, 1974 Sept. 1980 Sept. 1980 09/30/80
It is evident that implementation of the proJect (completion) was
delayed four years.
Covenants in the Project and Credit Agreements:
3.25      The Credit and Project Agreements specified a number of
conditions, fulfillment of which was necessary for the withdrawal of the
credit. Many of these conditions were of a general nature, common to most
IDA credits. In addition to these general conditions, there were more
specific covenants, particularly concerning the SRC. These sought to
ensure that appropriate changes in organization and management would be
introduced and financial measures taken to achieve efficient functioning
and financial viability of the project entity. A review of the performance
under each of the covenants is given in Annex 2.
3.26      It is clear that compliance with the covenants was, in a number
of cases, unsatisfactory. Sections 4.03 and 4.05 of the Project Agreement
were violated very early in the project and the violation significantly
altered the investment allocation in the transportation sector. Sections



- 15 -
3.03, 3.06 and 3.07 of the Credit Agreement were complied with only after a
delay. Covenants that specified targets, either operational (Section 3.01
of the Project Agreement) or financial (Section 4.04 (a) of the Project
Agreement) were not fulfilled, reflecting the overall failure of the
Project to achieve the aim of improving operational efficiency.
(See ANNEX 2).
3.27      While compliance with many covenants was not satisfactory, it can
be argued in retrospect that the covenants themselves did not address
sufficiently the principal constraints on the railway. For instance, the
organizational and institutional changes called for in the covenants
(Section 3.05 of the Credit Agreement and Section 3.03 of the Project
Agreement) were implemented without much delay but railway operations
continued to decline despite these changes. Clearly, the problems
addressed by the covenants were not the most serious constraints on effi-
cient functioning of the railway. The Bank failed to address the primary
problems of the SRC and, therefore, the Credit was not employed to best
advantage. Fulfillment of the organizational covenants did not have a
material impact on the project.
3.28      Conversely, the failure to implement certain of the covenants may
not have affected the Project adversely. In fact, the decision of SRC to
procure additional wagons and locomotives, in violation of the Project
Agreement, was supported by the Consultants on operations and this decision
was later endorsed by the Bank. Most of the important covenants dealt with
measures necessary for the financial viability and profitability of the
enterprises involved.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
4.01      A major objective of the project was to improve the railways'
operational standards and to provide additional capacity needed to meet the
expected growth in demand for rail service on the trunk routes.  Traffic
forecasts were of crucial importance in not only assessing the railways
investment requirements (in terms of loconotives, passenger coaches and
freight wagons) but also for estimating financial feasibility and economic
viability of this investment.  However, the forecasts for all categories of
rail freight traffic were far too optimistic.  Moreover, the divergence
between estimated and actual traffic widened throughout the period of
project implementation.  The appraisal estimate of freight traffic for
FY-79 of 4.2 million tons greatly exceeded the actual traffic for that year
of a little more than 2 million tons, as showvn in Figure 4.1.  There was a
steady decline in freight traffic over the entire period except for FY-76
when it increased over the previous year. Freight and passenger traffic
over the period FY-73 to FY-79 is shown in Table 4.1.
4.02      The fall in freight traffic an' increasing disparity between
forecasted and actual traffic is observed for both export traffic and local
traffic but was less dramatic in the case of import traffic.  Freight
traffic from Port Sudan inland was expected at time of appraisal to decline
during FY-77 compared to FY-76 as a result of anticipated diversion of bulk
petroleum products from rail to a planned oil pipeline between Port Sudan
and Khartoum.  The pipeline was, in fact, built and bulk oil traffic from
Port Sudan inland in FY-77 was diverted from the railway.  However, the
extent of that diversion was less than anticipated as indicated in Figure
4.2.
4.03      The downward trend in export traffic (i.e., traffic to Port
Sudan) has been particularly striking. Except for an increase during
FY-76, traffic continuously declined during the period FY-71 to FY-79; this
decline was of the order of 52% (compared with a 15% decline in import
traffic). Bank projections for export traffic were especially optimistic
as indicated in Figure 4.3.
4.04      The trend in local traffic over the same period shows a pattern
of decline similar to that for export traffic; the fall in local traffic
was 60%. Most of this decline took place during three years -- FY 72 and
FY 76, and in FY 79. In FY 76, local traffic, unlike the other major
traffic components, fell rather than increased. Figure 4.4 shows that the
Bank's forecast of local traffic was far too optimistic.
4.05      The sharp fall in freight traffic carried by the railway during
most of the seventies cannot be attributed to a decline in economic
activity in Sudan. In fact, during the period FY 72 - FY 78 immediately
after the turmoil in the south, GDP growth averaged around 8% per year. In
the agriculture sector, while there were large year-to-year fluctuations in
output levels, thie overall contribution of this sector to the economy
increased. These trends are indicated in Figure 4.5.

4.06      Further evidence that the railway traffic decline was not caused
by a fall in economic activity is seen in trends of exports and imports at
Port Sudan. The total volume of imports rose steadily over the seventies.
While exports volumes were not increasing consistently over this period (in
fact, exports declined during 1977-1979), they almost never fell below the
level achieved in 1970 (as shown in Figure 4.6). The steady increase in
total export and import traffic at Port Sudan during 1970-1979 is illus-
trated in Figure 4.7.  The inability of the railways to carry available
traffic reflects the failure of the railway to coimpete effectively with
road transport. It also reflects the failure of the project in achieving
one of its goals: that of handling a growing volume of traffic.
4.07      The decline in railway traffic over the past decade has been
caused by several factors.  Prominent among tihese are (i) poor quality of
railway service, especially delays and uncertainty in delivery of freight;
(ii) lack of marketing of railway service; and (iii) insufficient road user
charges and consequent difficulty of the railway in competing with road
transport. The ability of the railway in the future to arrest the
diversion of traffic to the trucking industry will depend on efforts to
overcome these problems.
Operations
4.08      At time of appraisal, the Bank recognized that there was a need
for substantial improvement in operational efficiency of the Railway.
Accordingly, it was agreed that the railways would achieve the operational
targets specified in the Project Agreement. These targets formed the basis
of the Bank's assessment of SRC's locomotive and wagon raquiremaents.
However, despite the purchase of an additional 40 locomotives by SRC
outside the scope of the original project, these targets were not achieved.
4.09      A comparison of the established targets with actual performance
during the seventies is shown in Table 4.2 and Figures 4.8 and 4.9. It is
obvious that the project had no positive effect on operating efficiency.
In fact, poor operations were the main reason for the railways' inability
to carry available freight traffic and resulted in an increasing proportion
of traffic being diverted to truck transport.
4.10      The targets of operational efficiency set during appraisal were
based on the performance actually achieved in the peak performance years.
As such, these reflected optimism that levels of performance achieved then
could be regained and surpassed. These targets did not, therefore, take
into account the decline in railway performance that occured in the years
immediately prior to appraisal. This is highlighted in the table below
which shows the extent of improvement that was anticipated in a short span
of two years and compares this objective with the trend observed in the
years just before appraisal. Moreover, while these targets were agreed
upon by the SRC and the Bank, it was clear even during negotiations that
SRC had serious doubts if these targets could be achieved. In fact,
paradoxically, its assessment of locomotive requirements was made on the
clear assumption that these targets were unachievable. This premise was
known to the Bank during negotiations.

4.11      There were a number of reasons for the continued declined in
operational efficiency of the railway. Undoubtedly, inadequate equipment
and hardware were contributory factors. While SRC's marshalling yard
system functioned reasonably well, the telecommunication and signalling
systems were poor. In general, maintenance facilities training were inade-
quate to support the program of dieselization initiated in 1960. Dieseli-
zation of SRC started with the delivery of 15 Cockerill-Ougree locomotives,
followed by the addition of 55 locomotives from English Electric. At the
time of appraisal, SRC had 103 diesel locomotives and 96 steam locomotives
for line service and 59 diesel and 31 steam locomotives for shunting.
While some modification of maintenance facilities and training of staff for
the servicing of diesel locomotives was undertaken, the steps taken proved
to be inadequate. Moreover, unlike steam locomotives which require few
imported spare parts, diesel locomotives depend heavily on parts from
abroad and on foreign exchange to purchase such supplies. Thus, inadequate
maintenance capability and a shortage of spare parts led to a decline in
the availability of diesel locomotives from approximately 80% in the mid-
Sixties to about 65% at the time of appraisal in 1973. While this problem
was identified at appraisal, and some provision was made in the project to
alleviate the problem, those provisions were clearly not adequate. In
fact, in terms of allocation of funds in the project, as much as 69% of the
total foreign cost of the project was allocated to expansion of carrying
capacity and, at most, 17% of foreign cost (and 28% of total cost) was
allocated to investments for improving operating efficiency including
workshop performance. The Bank was prevented from alleviating the spare
parts problem by its own policy which, at that time, did not permit
Bank-financing of spare parts, an operating expense.



- 26 -
4.12      The addition of 50 new diesel locomotives during FY 76 improved
the availability of locomotives for a short time. However, maintenance
problems and shortages of spare parts soon affected these locomotives as
well as older units and the availability of the locomotives, generally. A
deteriorating balance of payments situation in the seventies, and
consequent limitations on the availability of spare parts for the railway,
contributed to poor railway operations. Moreover, imbalance in traffic
because of declining exports (in 1977-1979) and increasing imports resulted
in longer turnaround time for wagons and worsening utilization of wagons.
4.13      While these were important factors, poor morale and staff in
efficiency in SRC was critical in preventing improvement in operations.
The project achieved little to improve the skills or effectiveness of
operating personnel. While provision was made in the project for a
training school, its program was not designed to deal particularly with the
problem of near- term improvements in the capability of operating
personnel.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Operating Results:
5.01      The appraisal took 1973 as the base year for the financial
evaluation, and projections were prepared for five years, 1974-1978. For
the prior six years, 1968-1973, SRC recorded operating profits on railway
operations in all years, after provision for depreciation.  Freight ton-km
had remained relatively constant during this period and passenger-km had
been on the increase. However, during the projection period, with the
exception of 1976, the net ton-km decreased annually. Passenger-km
increased to a peak in 1977 and decreased thereafter. As a result, SRC
recorded net losses in all years except 1976 when revenues were sufficient
to cover all working expenses, depreciation and interest charges. In 1974
and 1975, revenues were not sufficient to cover the working expenses.
Details are given in Table 5.1.
5.02      Tariff increases were granted in most years, but it is believed
that they were not always sufficient to meet inflation. The traffic
costing system used by SRC accumulated costs in global terms and not on a
point-to-point basis, thus, it was not possible to relate costs to
tariffs. A point-to-point system is being introduced under the Fourth
Railway Project.
5.03      During the period 1974-78, salaries and wages increased 72% in
absolute terms from £Sd 11.89 million to £Sd 20.50 million but in relation
to net ton-km, the increase was two and a half times, as the salaries
increased while ton-km dropped 24%. A major contributing factor was that
management was unable to reduce the labor force as traffic declined and
total employees remained constant at approximately 35,000 throughout the
period. During the same period, the cost of fuel per net ton-km increased
over 2+ times. SRC had no control over this increase. The expenditures
for spare parts increased by 23% but an analysis is not meaningful as they
were procured when foreign exchange was available and procurement did not
necessarily equate with demand.
5.04      During the period 1974-1978, the utilization of available
locomotives and wagons decreased which indicates that the drop in tonnage
carried and, hence, the decline in profitability was not the result of a
lack of rolling stock but was due to a decline in operational efficiency
and/or the lack of a marketing policy.
5.05      The cash flow for the period is given in Table 5.2, together with
the comparable figures from the appraisal projections. The appraisal
estimated that the cash flow would show a slight improvement each year and
that the estimated overdraft of £Sd 6.25 million in 1973 would be covered
by the end of 1976. In fact, SRC recorded negative cash flows each year
during the projection period ending 1978 with an overdraft of £Sd 20.88
million. The major contributing factor was the low level of internally
generated funds from operations. For three of the five years, revenues did
not cover working expenses.

5.06      As a result of the operating losses, SRC's retained earnings fell
into a deficit position, and total equity (capital, capital surplus and
retained earnings) declined from £Sd 58.24 million in 1973 to iSd 38.51
million in 1978. The working capital was negative from 1975 when current
liabilities first exceeded current assets. Accounts receivable in 1978
represented approximately seven months of revenue outstanding. However, in
most instances, this was beyond the control of SRC as Government
Departments and parastatals were slow in remitting payments. In this
respect, SRC had on numerous occasions put forth strong efforts to bring
these accounts to a current basis. The railway remained solvent only by
extending its overdraft facilities and by the deferral of customs duties.
Details are given in Table 5.3 and Table 5.4.
B.   Financial Covenants:
5.07      The Credit Agreement called for all Government accounts to be
paid on a current basis commencing February 1, 1974. In addition, all such
accounts which were in arrears were to be paid in full by June 30, 1977.
This covenant was substantially adhered to but approximately one year late.
5.08      SRC maintained excellent accounting records and usually supplied
the Association with finalized annual accounts approximately four months
after the year end. The Project Agreement called for audited accounts
seven months after the year end but this was never accomplished. This
covenant was unrealistic, and in later Credits to the railway and to the
Sea Ports Corporation, the requirement was changed to nine months.
5.09      The Project Agreement also called for a financial review by March
of each year. SRC supplied the Association with revised budgets without
exception during the entire project period. Except for two occasions when
the computer failed, all financial accounts and projections were prepared
on a timely basis.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      Until 1971, SRC was a Government Department under the direction
of the Minister of Transport and Communications, who was responsible for
not only the railway but also Port Sudan, Nile River Steamer Services and a
number of hotels and rest houses. In 1971, the hotels were turned over to
a newly-created Hotels Corporation and, in 1972, the River Transport
Corporation (RTC) was created to take over the river operations.  A special
covenant in the Credit Agreement required that an independent Sea Ports
Authority be established by July 1, 1974, to operate Port Sudan.
Consequently, the Sea Ports Corporation (SPC) Act was promulgated on March
18, 1974, under which the corporation assumed responsibility for all
seaports, harbors, and lighthouses.
6.02      Within this framework of three separate, and to some extent
autonomous agencies, a number of organizational changes took place during
the project period. In July 1975, a new organization and a wage structure
were introduced in t-he SRC which, it was hoped, would make management more
effective and provide incentives to staff. This re-organization featured
(a) the strengthening of management by providing three Deputy General
Managers and one Assistant General Manager, and (b) the decentralization of
operations by providing for the setting up of five autonomous operating
regions. These measures were approved by the Bank. A further re-
organization was undertaken in early 1979 with a view to reducing the chain
of command by having department heads report directly to the General
Manager. During this period, there were repeated changes in the occupants
of top managerial positions. However, while these changes may have had a
short-term favorable impact, they were unable to effect any sustained
long-term benefits for a number of reasons, some socio-political. For
instance, it was not generally possible for General Managers to reduce
staff even if this was warranted on grounds of inefficiency or reduced
traffic; the declining trend in staff productivity was a direct consequence -
of this limitation. There was also a failure on the management's part to
inculcate feelings of loyalty or involvement with the corporation's goals,
particularly in the RTC. There was, moreover, a general reluctance to
accept foreign technical assistance. Even at the early stages of
negotiations, the Government and SRC had shown little enthusiasm for
accepting the Bank's suggestion of having UNDP-financed consultants to
evaluate railway operations and suggest remedial measures. Even though
consultants were hired and some of their recommendations were accepted,
this did not have any significant impact on the functioning of the railway,
due, in part, to a lack of cooperation between consultants and the railway
staff, and SRC resistance to change.
6.03      The failure of management to overcome technical and financial
obstacles despite a fair degree of autonomy led to a questioning of the
fundamental Bank policy of encouraging the creation of autonomous entities
in the transport sector. The Bank supervision mission in Sudan during
February 25 to March 11, 1977, called for re-consideration of this policy
on the basis that management talent was too scarce to make independent
entities workable. Both with regard to RTC and SPC, management weaknesses



- 45 -
were identified, particularly in those functional areas in which they were
formerly dependent on the Sudan Railways Corporations--accounting, procure-
ment, operations and maintenance. It was felt that while autonomous
organizations may be conducive to effective managerial control and
financial independence, due consideration should be given to the scarcity
of key management talent in the borrowing country. Moreover, since River
Transport, Railway and Port facilities are closely inter-related, coordi-
nation would be better accomplished if they were put under a single manage-
ment. The mission did not suggest the merging of the three corporations
but emphasized that these considerations should influence the evaluation of
future re-organization proposals.

VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01      The main justification for the project at time of appraisal
rested on the expectation of increased economic activity, particularly a
larger volume of exports of agricultural products and increasing imports of
capital equipment and other inputs; accordingly, the railways would be
required to carry a significantly larger volume of traffic. It was assumed
that without the project, that is if the railways did not have the addi-
tional capacity to carry this expected traffic, the goods would not be
carried by any other means of transport. Hence, a measure of the project
benefits was the net value of export and import traffic that would not be
carried were the project not undertaken. A rate of return of over 21% was
anticipated during appraisal.
7.02      These benefits failed to materialize partly because economic
activity and, thus, total traffic did not expand as much as was antici-
pated. More importantly, the railways were unable to compete effectively
with a growing trucking fleet and, thus, carried decreasing proportions of
total traffic. In fact, freight traffic carried by rail declined in
absolute terms almost continuously during the project period. More than
three million tons were hauled by the railway in FY 72 but the level fell
to two million tons in FY 79, far lower than the four million tons expected
during that year. This inability of the railways to carry even the volume
of freight traffic handled in earlier years (let alone carry additional
traffic for which the project was planned) was the most significant failure
of the project. There are various reasons for the declining efficiency of
the railway and the loss of traffic to the trucking industry during the
seventies. Whatever the reasons, an unfortunate consequence of declining
efficiency is that more equipment is needed to handle a given amount of
traffic. Assuming the worsening efficiency was unavoidable, the additional
locomotives and wagons may be justified, taking into account the higher
alternative cost of road transport. If, however- the railway failed to
take reasonable steps to prevent a decline in efficiency then one cannot
justify the procurement of additional equipment on the basis that it is
needed because of poor operations. Thus, a basic question relates to the
causes of declining efficiency and the extent to which the problem could
have been prevented.
Procurement of Locomotives:
7.03      The 10 main-line and 20 shunting diesel locomotives, plus the 40
additional main-line locomotives purchased outside the project, were
expected to replace progressively old and inefficient steam locomotives.
Benefits were expected to accrue in (a) fuel economy; (b) reduction in cost
of fuel haulage arising from reduced fuel use; (c) savings due to closing
of watering stations not needed with diesel operation; (d) savings from
reduced repair and maintenance necessary for the newer fleet of locomotives
and (e) savings from reduced labor force required.
7.04      Economy in fuel use.  The diesel locomotives are more fuel-
efficient than steam locomotives for a given number of locomotive



- 47 -
kilometers. Even though the price per ton for diesel fuel is more than
that for furnace fuel, a net gain in economy was anticipated at the time of
appraisal. It was expected that, with the project, diesel locomotives in
1976 would account for as much as 95% of total locomotive kilometers;
without the project, diesel locomotives would account for only 81% of the
total locomotive kilometers. This percentage increase in use of diesel
locomotives was expected to yield an annual savings in fuel costs of the
order of ESd 265,000.
7.05      To estimate the actual benefits from dieselization, it is first
necessary to establish whether there was actually a replacement of steam by
diesel locomotives during the project period. Data in Table 7.1, Column 4
shows that the share of steam locomotives in total distance travelled
ranged around 26-33% during FY 71 - FY 75 and declined significantly there-
after, as new diesel locomotives were added to the fleet. Conversely, the
percentage of diesel locomotive use rose considerably during the period,
reaching 89% in FY 76. As indicated in Column 4, the appraisal estimate
that, by 1976, 95% of total distance travelled would be handled by diesel
locomotives, was a little optimistic but not far off the mark. This target
was achieved in FY 80.
7.06      In measuring the fuel economy achieved under the project, the
actual diesel and furnace oil costs over the period are compared with the
fuel cost that would have been incurred if the relative use of the steam
locomotive fleet had not been diminished. The total fuel requirement in
the hypothetical case, assuming no replacement of steam by diesel
locomotives had taken place under the project, is determined as follows:
Assuming that the steam locomotives would have continued to maintain their
26-33% share in distance covered, this ratio is applied to the actual total
distance covered during each of the years FY 76 - FY 80 (Column 3) to
derive the hypothetical distance that steam locomotives would have
travelled (Column 5). The total distance actually covered by both diesel
and steam (Column 3) is then reduced by the distance that would have been
covered by the steam locomotives in the absence of the project (Column 5)
to obtain an estimate of hypothetical distance travelled by diesel
locomotives (Column 6). The distances actually travelled by diesel
locomotives are then reduced by hypothetical distances travelled by diesel
locomotives in each of the years FY 76 - FY 80, the differences being the
reduced distance covered by diesel locomotives in the hypothetical case.
Distances for steam locomotives are, of course, increased by a like amount
because of the assumed diversion.
7.07      Had steam locomotives continued to cover 33% of the distance
handled by all locomotives, those units would have travelled an additional
1,301 thousand kilometers in FY 76, while diesel locomotives would have
travelled 1,301 thousand kilometers less in that year. Correspondingly,
furnace fuel requirements would have been greater and diesel oil requi-
rements less in the hypothetical situation as compared with actual
experience. The savings arising from these differences in fuel require-
ments in each year, FY 76 to FY 80, are evaluated at the FY 76 prices of
the two fuels. The differences between the two series of fuel costs are
the net benefit based on fuel economy as shown in Column 11 under alterna-



- 48 -
tive assumptions. For the entire period FY 76 - FY 80, the estimated
savings in fuel cost are £Sd 3.0 million to £Sd 5.0 million.
7.08      These benefits, reflecting economy in fuel consumption, are
projected to FY 85 on the basis of two alternative sets of assumptions:
(i) that after FY 80, there would be no further dieselization and that the
proportion of distance travelled by steam locomotives remains unchanged
thereafter at 7%; and (ii) that the proportion of distance travelled by
steam was reduced to zero from 7% by FY 81 and would remain unchanged
thereafter. These alternatives permit calculation of a reasonable range of
benefits.
7.09      Reduction in Cost of Haulage of Fuel.  As a result of dieseliza-
tion, the total tonnage of fuel consumption in each of the years FY 76 - FY
80 was reduced below levels that would have prevailed without the project.
In Table 7.1, this reduction is the difference between the tonnages shown
in Columns 10 and 9, or the amount presented in Column 2 of Table 7.2.
This reduction in fuel tonnages accounts for a corresponding saving in the
cost of carrying fuel on the railway. Given the actual average haul during
each year FY 76 - FY 80 (Column 3 in Table 7.2) and the average revenue per
ton-kilometer in FY 76, the savings resulting from the reduction in fuel
haulage is estimated as shown in Column 5. Over the period FY 76 - FY 80,
this ranges from £Sd 1.5 million to ESd 2.2 million. To project these
benefits for the period FY 81 - FY 85, it is assumed that benefits from
savings in fuel haulage are related to the economy in fuel consumption.
Accordingly, a range of benefits is shown in Tables 7.3 and 7.4 correspon-
ding to assumptions noted above (7.08).
7.10      Savings from Closure of Watering Station.  The closing of
watering stations is a direct consequence of the progressive displacement
of steam locomotives by diesel locomotives. Supervision missions reported
that there were no significant compensatory increases in servicing facili-
ties for the additional diesel locomotives. Estimates of savings from
these closures have been obtained from SRC for the period to FY 80. For
purposes of analysis, it is assumed that the benefits remain constant from          -^
FY 80 - FY 85, at the FY 79 value as indicated in Tables 7.3 and 7.4.
7.11      During appraisal, it was expected that with progressive dieseli-
zation, there would be a reduction in expenditures on maintenance and
repair since older locomotives were to be replaced by newer ones.  In
actual facts, this economy was not achieved.  Similarly, the appraisal team
evaluated benefits assuming that the labor force engaged in locomotive
workshops could be effectively reduced.  While a reduction in labor force
was warranted as a result of declining traffic during this period,
reduction in staff was not feasible.  As such, these potential benefits
have been left out of our computation.
7.12      Benefit/Cost Analysis.  Tables 7.3 and 7.4 show the streams of
costs and benefits related to the procurement of locomotives under the
project over the period to FY 85, using alternative assumptions for
deriving benefits as discussed above (7.08 and 7.09). It is assumed that
the locomotives, with an initial value of £Sd 17,924,450, have an economic



- 49 -
life of 25 years and that their remaining value is proportionate to the
years of service. Thus, the salvage value in FY 85 is fSd 10,754,670.
Taking into account all relevant costs and benefits, the economic rate of
return ranges from 7.9% to 9.6%. The rate of return at time of appraisal
was expected to be over 22%.
Procurement of Freight Wagons:
7.13      The justification given at time of appraisal for the procurement
of freight wagons was that the equipment would be needed for (a) replace-
ment of older wagons with consequent improvement in efficiency and (b)
increased capacity for carrying expected additional traffic. The appraisal
report, however, was not explicit as to the basis of its economic analysis
and rate of return calculation. Since both the efficiency of wagon utili-
zation and total traffic carried on the railway declined during most of the
project period (see Figures 4.8 and 4.9), it is obvious that the antici-
pated project benefits did not materialize.

VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01      The Bank has had a long involvement in the Sudan transport sector
with particular attention to the railways. During this time, a substantial
investment of Bank funds has been made both for the procurement of
locomotives and wagons and for improvement of existing workshops, telecom-
munications and track facilities. Projects have included components for
technical assistance which have been aimed at the training of local staff,
advisory services and various types of studies. In contrast to the earlier
projects, there is now an increasing focus on overcoming the institutional
constraints to improving railway operations.
8.02      The Third Railway Project was identified at a time when railway
operations were deteriorating and SRC sensed an urgent need to expand the
carrying capacity of the railway, thus, enabling it to meet a significant
increase in traffic anticipated in the seventies; SPC also saw a need for
some improvement in operating efficiency. The emphasis in the project was
on increasing the overall carrying capacity of the railway (and, to some
extent, river transport and port facilities).  About 57% of total project
cost (and 69% of foreign costs) was devoted to investments for increasing
carrying capacity while, at most, 28% of total costs (and 17% of foreign
costs) went towards investments designed to improve operating standards.
Relations with the Borrower:
8.03      The Project was identified at a time when both the Bank and the
Sudan Government were keen on expanding Bank activities in Sudan. While
relations were cordial and cooperative during most of the project period,
there were instances when the dialogue was strained and at least one
mission reported an uncooperative attitude on the part of SRC toward Bank
supervision. Although relations were generally amicable, the Bank was
unable to persuade the Government and SRC to accept its recommendations on
issues that were, in the Bank's view, critical to the successful execution
of this project. Furthermore, the Bank and SRC had a serious misunder-
standing concerning the procurement of certain locomotives. This led to a
breach of an important covenant in the Credit Agreement.
Project Implementation Delay:
8.04      Largely as a result of delays in the procurement and delivery of
some items, the Project was completed three years later than scheduled.
This delay, in turn, caused cost overruns to the extent of 15% of the
original cost estimate with the result that the real content of the Project
was greatly reduced. These delays were largely the result of inefficient
planning on the part of SRC. For instance, the failure to prepare the
project in greater detail before appraisal caused delays in procurement.
Further delays became unavoidable when cost increases in the intervening
period required a cutback in project scope and a revision of the list of
items to be procured.



- 55 -
Benefits from Project:
8.05      While the Project increased the potential carrying capacity of
the Railway significantly, this added capacity was not fully utilized
because of declining operational efficiency. During most of the project
period, the railway did not carry a level of traffic equal to that hauled
prior to the project. This traffic shortfall was largely the result of the
diversion of traffic from the railway to road, a loss attributable in large
part to the deterioration in operational efficiency of the railway and the
lack of adequate road user charges on the trucking industry. Most indices
of operational efficiency worsened during the period and, even towards the
end of the project, these measures were significantly short of the targets
fixed for 1975. Some benefits from the locomotive procurements were
realized as a result of certain cost savings related to the replacement of
relatively inefficient steam locomotives by diesel locomotives. The
failure of the railway to achieve either its operational targets and/or
increased levels of traffic also had unfavorable effects on financial
performance. Frequent tariff increases did not offset these adverse
influences. The technical assistance and training component has not shown
significant achievements so far.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      In retrospect, it is evident that the project should have placed
primary emphasis on achieving improvement in railway operations rather than
on increasing transport capacity through additions of locomotives and
rolling stock.  While the need for outside technical assistance was
discussed in detail during negotiations, in the end the external aid
consisted of a group of consultants doing a field study to determine the
nature of operational problems and recommend actions needed to overcome
them. The group did not address itself to the implementation of the
actions recommended and, therefore, accomplished little toward achieving a
trained, disciplined and motivated worl; force. Organizational and
managerial chanaes undertaken during this period (separation of SRC and
SPC; creation of posts for three Deputy General Managers and one Assistant
General Manager; regionalization; etc.) could not overcome the adverse
effects of more fundamental problems.
9.02      The experience under the first and second railway projects had
shown that despite heavy investment in rolling stock and equipment,
efficiency had not improved. Yet, the Third Railway Project established
ambitious operational targets and included only modest project elements to
deal with improvements in performance. The PCR for the Second Railway
Project identified "poor maintenance" as the principal cause of poor
performance. Lack of adequate maintenance capability was recognized by the
Bank at the time the Third Railway Project was appraised, but insufficient
action was taken under the project to overcome these limitations, particu-
larly in view of the large procurement of new locomotives.
9.03      Another lapse seems to have been the inadequate attention to the
potential of diversion of railwav traffic to road transport. While this
issue was mentioned early in the project cycle (along with the potential
impact of a pipeline project and the decision to construct a new port),
there was almost no discussion of it in the appraisal report. Competition
from the trucking industry has been a major cause of the declining traffic
on the railway. In December 1974, it was stated in a Supervision Report
that "...competion from road haulage will not wait for the new road [Port
Sudan-Khartoum] to be built. Generous incentives are being given for the
purchase and operation of trucks ... about 1/7 of the connage of goods
leaving Port Sudan is now going by road, and this proportion is increasing
rapidly". A vear earlier, the Bank projected railway traffic and economic
benefits under the assumption that in the absence of increasad railway
capacity, additional traffic would not be carried by any other means of
transport.
9.04      Tne PPAR for the Second Railway Project found that projections of
traffic and other economic variables were too optimistic. In the Third
Railway Project, projections of operational targets and traffic levels were
also too optimistic and did not reflect the declining trends of the years
immediately prior to appraisal. The wide gap between appraisal forecasts
and actual performance is directly attributable to insufficient considera-
tion being given to potential truck competition. This, in turn, was at



- 57 -
least partly a consequence of substantial optimism that operating
efficiency could be improved in the short term through relatively modest
project components and managerial adjustments.
9.05      The Bank's recommendation for the separation of the functions of
the SRC, SPC and RTC may have had an adverse impact on the project. The
rationale for this separation was that it would prevent the subsidization
of railway operations through profits generated in port operations. This
objective was accomplished,but, since managerial and organizational
resources in SRC have been scarce, creation of autonomous and separate
units may have resulted in spreading these resources too thin.
9.06      Throughout the project period, from preparation until the final
stages of the project, the Bank exhibited considerable flexibility in its
dealings with SRC. While some flexibility in these circumstances was
essential, there were instances when the Bank should have been more firm,
particularly in respect to non-compliance with Section 4.03 of the Project
Agreement. The Bank might have been more demanding also with regard to
plans for building of a new port at Suakin at an earlier stage and the
construction of an oil pipeline from Port Sudan to Khartoum.
9.07      In conclusion, the experience with this project suggests the fol-
lowing lessons:
i)    The scarcity of trained, skilled, motivated and disciplined
manpower at all levels of railway operations is probably
the single most important source of inefficiency in railway
operations in Sudan. Although this problem can be elimi-
nated only in the long run, it is important to recognize
that benefits from Bank-financed projects will depend upon
alleviation of this limitation. In addition, future
Bank-financed projects should be designed to address this
basic problem.                          -
ii)   The transport sector as a whole should be considered in
some detail when appraising a specific project in one of
the sub-sectors. In particular, the impact of road
transport and government policy on railway traffic needs
thorough analysis. It should be recognized that in Africa
diversion of rail traffic to road transport occurs
relatively rapidly. Railways in all countries including
Sudan need to concentrate on selected traffic and not seek
traffic economically better adapted to another mode of
transport. Even though the road transport unit cost
exceeds rail transport unit cost, development of road
transport in some situations is advantageous because
institutional bottlenecks in the railway are difficult to
overcome and transport improvements are essential to
general economic development.

iii)  The use of covenants should be considered carefully before
inclusion in Loan and Credit Agreements. Those conditions
considered to be essential pre-requisites for the success
of the project are better required prior to credit
effectiveness. Only a critical set of clearly specified
and realistic measures absolutely necessary for the success
of the project should be included in covenants; those
covenants should then be strictly enforced and in cases of
non compliance the remedies should be invoked promptly.
