In particular, the project will: support\n            restructuring the Environmental Division (ED) in the\n            Ministry of Transport, Environment and Women's Affairs\n            (MTEWA) for better policy planning and coordination; and\n            strengthen the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to\n            better carry out its analytical, monitoring, and enforcement\n            responsibilities; support ongoing efforts to integrate\n            environmental considerations in the overall development\n            planning process; and help the government take immediate\n            remedial measures to reverse the trend of environmental\n            degradation through pilot programs involving participatory\n            approaches to environmental management.  The project will\n            comprise three major components:  (1) Institutional\n            Strengthening -restructuring ED within MTEWA to allow it to\n            play a central role in environmental policy, planning and\n            coordination nationally; restructuring and strengthening CEA\n            by establishing and implementing a staff development\n            program; enhancing the Industrial Licensing and Inspection\n            Program; developing environmental codes of practice for\n            small industries; improving   EIA capacity, and\n            strengthening the environmental information system;\n            providing office and technical facilities to accommodate\n            both ED and CEA; and studying linkages between sector and\n            economy-wide policies and the environment including an\n            annual review of the environmental implications of the\n            Public Investment Program (PIP), and further updating the\n            National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).  (2) Community\n            Environmental Initiatives Facility (CEIF) -which will be\n            established to finance well-planned environmental activities\n            at the grass-roots level within the priority NEAP/PIP.  CEIF\n            will provide a mechanism for pooling resources -to which\n            other donors could also contribute- and serve as a vehicle\n            for private sector and NGO participation and for\n            decentralizing environmental activities.  (3) Pilot Land\n            Management Component -which will entail pilot projects\n            involving community participation in rehabilitating degraded lands."}, "docdt": "1997-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
