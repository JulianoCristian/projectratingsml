The project showed that absorptive capacity in\n            the institutions being strengthened was a key constraint in\n            the achievement of outcomes. While certain project\n            activities were implemented expeditiously, there was a clear\n            lack of ownership for the project and project activities\n            were not internalized in the institutions being\n            strengthened. A key ingredient for institutional performance\n            and reforms is sustained and committed leadership. Long\n            delays were experienced in the recruitment of staff to\n            technical staff positions that were identified in the\n            Staffing Plan for the restructured Ministry of Environment\n            (MOE) and Central Environmental Authority (CEA). Delays in\n            filling technical staff vacancies and poorly designed\n            consulting inputs due to lack of absorptive capacity in MOE\n            and CEA, resulted in the technical assistance consultancy\n            inputs of EA1P being only marginally effective.\n            Institutional development requires continuous engagement\n            with the client, particularly with regard to the\n            implementation of reforms. Community Environmental\n            Initiatives Facility (CEIF), and Pilot Land Management\n            Component (PLMC) suffered from long delays in disbursement\n            of funds for community activities. Funding delays adversely\n            affected project outcomes as well as a loss in community confidence."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
