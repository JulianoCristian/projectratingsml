"The project will develop small-scale\n            enterprises (SSEs) in Malaysia by significantly increasing\n            the availability of institutional credit and expanding and\n            improving TA.  This will provide integrated services to\n            those SSEs which presently do not receive adequate\n            institutional credit and high quality technical assistance.\n            It will also strengthen BPMB institutionally, and expand\n            MIDF's SSE lending. Over the 3-year project period,\n            some 1,100-1,200 subloans will be made with an average size\n            of US$75,000-US$89,000. Under the TA component, the project\n            will provide staff training for the participating agencies,\n            equipment for workshops, laboratories and classrooms,\n            expansion of physical facilities and recruitment of\n            experts/advisors.  The project will also strengthen the\n            coordination mechanism for financial and technical\n            assistance and the monitoring and evaluation of all TA programs."}, "docdt": "1984-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
