strengthening\n            institutional arrangements for urban development programs,\n            providing low-cost shelter and other urban services to the\n            poorer sections of the population, and creating employment\n            by assisting small enterprises through credit and technical\n            assistance programs. The major components are: (a) shelter\n            and related physical elements (urban upgrading, sites and\n            services, construction materials loans, training centers,\n            and technical assistance); (b) a credit line and the\n            construction of industrial premises to promote and diversify\n            economic activities in the region; (c) regional feeder roads\n            and river control works; and, (d) technical assistance to\n            strengthen the Fideicomiso (Trust Fund) Lazaro Cardenas\n            (FLC), and studies to prepare additional urban development\n            projects for possible assistance from the Bank."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
