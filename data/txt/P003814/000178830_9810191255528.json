improve\n            rural road infrastructure in selected provinces by\n            strengthening the capacity of the district public works\n            agencies and by implementing an expanded program of rural\n            road works. The project will support a rural road\n            development program for a three-year period beginning April\n            1982 in about 25 kabupatens (districts) in the five\n            provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Bangkulu, Jambi\n            and West Java. The programs will be based on an improved\n            methodology for screening possible road works using data\n            readily available and for selecting economically justified\n            works. In addition, the project would support an improvement\n            program for the provincial public works agency in Jambi\n            Province. Equipment will be provided for force account work\n            and for leasing to small contractors. Consulting services\n            will be provided to assist in implementation of the road\n            works programs, in monitoring and evaluating those programs,\n            and in preparing future programs for additional districts\n            and provinces."}, "docdt": "1981-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
