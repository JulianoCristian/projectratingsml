The project\n            will also provide consultant services and technical\n            assistance for construction supervision and the preparation\n            of a variety of feasibility, tariff and efficiency studies.\n            A household energy strategy component will be implemented\n            following the completion of an ongoing household energy study."}, "docdt": "1989-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
