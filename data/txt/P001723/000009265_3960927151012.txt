MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.          The following Memorandum and Recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment credit to Mali for SDR 24.2 million (US$33.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and help finance a Second Power Project. The project
would be cofinanced by AfDF, CCCE, CIDA, SIB, FAC and KfW.
Background
2.          Only about 41 of Mali's populatiorn currently has access to
electricity. About 75Z of Mali's electricity is supplied from the Selingue
hydroelectric plant, which was commissioned in 1980. The present installed
generating capacity is sufficient to meet electricity demand in the intercon-
nected system until the early 1990's, but over the medium term, the existing
hydroelectric plants need to be rehabilitated, and the transmission and
distribution facilities need to be extended. Beyond that, the least cost
supply of electricity could be from power facilities to be installed at the
Manantali dam, which was recently completed by OMVS (a regional entity
grouping Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and Guinea). Development of the power
sector to date has been hampered by a fragmented organization which splits
sectoral responsibility among three agencies: the Direction Nationale de
l'Hydraulique et de l'Energie (DNHE), a government department whose function
is to plan and construct major power and water schemes and provide technical
supervision; Energie du Mali (EDM), the utility responsible for operation and
maintenance of most power and urban water facilities, including those con-
structed by DNHE; and Office pour l'Exploitation des Ressources Hydrauliques
du Haut Niger (OERHN), which was created to operate the Selingue hydroelectric
plant and to promote irrigation and fishery activities. This situation has
led to poor coordination of investment planning and difficulties in systems
operations. EDM is still faced with a precarious financial situation due to a
high level of accounts receivable from both the Government and private sector
and its poor operational efficiency.
3.          Agreement has been reached on the principles of the institutional
reform of the power sector, which provides for the unification of sector
responsibilities into EDM. The Government of Mali (GOM) would be in charge of
policy making, overall planning and regulatory matters, and be responsible for
regional and multipurpose projects. EDM has started to implement measures
aimed at improving its efficiency and this will continue under the proposed
project.
4.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's continued involvement in the
power sector is needed in order to: (i) help resolve the sector's complex
organizational and institutional issues; (ii) ensure that power sector
investments are integrated in a least cost development program; (iii) assist
the Government in mobilizing financing for the sector's investment program
while ensuring that it is directed to priority projects. IDA has taken a



- 2 -
leading role in the preparatory work for restructuring the sector, in invest-
ment planning, and in articulati:g measures to restore financial health to the
sector. IDA's presence in the sector is important to ensure the complete
rehabilitation of EDM's facilities and the optimization of investment deci-
sions taken in connection with the regional Manantali multipurpose project.
IDA has also taken the lead in organizing donor meetings whose purpose was to
ensure optimal coordination among all the aid and development agencies active
in the sector.
5.          Project Obiectives.  The proposed project aims at correcting the
most critical deficiencies in the power sector by: (i) consolidating into EDM
the responsibility for planning, construction and operation of all power
sector facilities and separating its water and power activities; (ii) stream-
lining the relationship between Government and EDM; (iii) effecting improve-
ments in all aspects of operations, including the introduction of a perfor-
mance contract with specific efficiency targets; and (iv) financing part of
the investment program of the power sector for the period 1989 to 1994,
including the continuation of the rehabilitation of generation and distribu-
tion systems and extension of the power grid to meet economically justifiable
loads. The rest of the investment program includes ongoing projects financed
by other donors and GOM, and projects related to Manantali. In addition,
assistance to GOM will be provided to develop and implement a household energy
strategy.
6.          Project Description.  The project comprises an institutional
component which would support the implementation of the sector's reorganiza-
tion and strengthen the utility's general and financial management by: (i)
providing training and technical assistance; and (ii) financing materials and
essential spare parts, thereby strengthening EDM's working capital position.
The other components are: (a) Generation: li) rehabilitation of the Sotuba
hydroelectric plant; (ii) repairs to the cooling water intake and major
overhaul of the Selingu4 hydroelectric plant; and (ii) rehabilitation and
extension of diesel stations in Bamako and four isolated centers; (b) Trans-
mission: construction of a 230 km, single circuit, 150 kV transmission line
to extend the grid supply from Bamako to Segou; (c) Distributions (i) rehabil-
itation of medium and low voltage lines and substations in Bamako; (ii)
construction of about 200 km of new medium and low voltage lines and as-
sociated substations in the unelectrified neighborhoods of Bamako; and (iii)
rehabilitation of the existing distribution system and construction of about
275 km of medium and low voltage lines and substations in seven isolated load
centers; (d) Engineering: consultant services for the engineering, preparation
of bid documents and construction supervision for the generation, transmission
and distribution components; and (e) System Studies for improving efficiency
and preparation of future power sector investments. The project also includes
financing for the implementation of a household energy strategy.
7.          The project, to be implemented over six years, is est.mated to
cost US$103.2 million equivalent (including interest during construction
estimated at US$5.2 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$82.6
million (812). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project



- 3 -
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mali are given in
Schedule C and, D respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report No.
7466-MLI dated March 2, 1989 are also attached.
8.          Agreed Actions.  The Government and EDM have agreed to implement:
(i) a detailed program to strengthen EDMs organization; (ii) a comprehensive
plan to reduce energy losses and the level of accounts receirable and; (iii)
the institutional reform of the power and water sectors, which include the
transfer of the technical responsibility for planning, construction and
operation of all power facilities to EDM, with the exception of regional and
multipurpose projects, a performance contract for EDM and the signing of a
management contract between EDM and OERHN for the operation of the Selingue
hydro-electric plant. They also agreed to an annual review of the power
investment program, limit on EDM's level of indebtedness and reasonable con-
tribution to EDM's capital expenditure from internal resources. Adoption of
the revised legislation and signing of the contracts would be a condition of
effectiveness, as well as the execution of a of a subsidiary Loan agreement
between the Government and EDM.
9.          Benefits.  The proposed project would strengthen the institutional
framework of the power sub-sector as well as the power utility so as to
improve efficiency and facilitate future development. Rehabilitation of
generation and distribution facilities would be completed and the power grid
would be extended to meet economically justifiable loads. The rehabilitation
would reduce both the cost of generation and energy losses. The household
energy component would initiate a concerted effort to protect the fragile
environment around urban areas.
10.         Risks.  There are no unusual technical risks associated with the
project, given EDM's experience under the First Power/Water Project and the
use of competent consulting engineers for design, execution and supervision of.
the different project components. The main risks are institutional, namelys
(i) the functioning of the power sector entities after the reforms have been
introduced; and (ii) the power utility's ability to effectively reduce system
losses and improve billing and collection. GOM and EDM's management are
committed to improving EDM's efficiency and are supporting the reform mea-
sures. Moreover, the training and technical assistance components are being
designed to minimize these institutional risks. The use of performance
contracts would enable close monitoring of institutional and efficiency
improvements.
11.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
