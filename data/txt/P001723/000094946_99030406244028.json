The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            A performance contract between the Government and a\n            Government-owned power company, is not an effective\n            mechanism to improve the operational and financial\n            performance of the company because it does not provide a\n            legal check to enforce the contract. 2) Management contracts\n            can be an effective approach to correcting significant\n            institutional weaknesses. However, the following conditions\n            must be respected to produce results: a) the management team\n            must be given sufficient leeway to operate and implement all\n            changes to restructure and strengthen the institution; b)\n            the duration of its stay should be in line with the severity\n            of the problems facing the institutions; and c) it must\n            prepare a session/follow up plan which identifies the\n            managers who will take over; and a transition plan for the\n            actual transfer of management. 3) When the implementation of\n            a project experiences serious difficulties, there are\n            significant benefits to be derived from staying the course\n            while finding ways and means to rework and reengineer the\n            project. This involves making adjustments to the project\n            design to take into account the changing political and\n            economic realities while keeping in mind the project's\n            fundamental objectives."}, "docdt": "1998-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
