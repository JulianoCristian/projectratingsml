INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMEIT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TiE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
TROMBAY IV FERTILIZER EXPANSION
AND PLANT OPERATIONS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to India in an amount equivalent to US$50 million on standard IDA terms to
help finance the Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion and Plant Operations Improve-
ment Project. US$33 million of the proceeds of the proposed credit would be
on-lent to the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI) for 15 years, including
five years' grace, at an annual interest rate of 9h.
PART I--THE ECONOMY
2.      An economic report "Economic Situation and Prospects of India" (402-IN,
dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 20, 1974.
A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.      India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for its
size and diversity, and the extreme difficulty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of
which are attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation
of conflicting political views tends to favor less than optimal economic
solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the
Government.   Governing a country divided into more than 20 States with a
population of some 580 million and over 60 major languages is an extraordinary
responsibility.   The country's poverty and poor natural resource endowment,
supplemented by a net transfer of external resources averaging in recent
years well below US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on
the rate of growth.   Any judgment of India's economic performance must
take these underlying circumstances into account.   So, also, must account
be taken of two massive uncertainties which overhang India.   The first is
the availability of water.   A bad monsoon, which is inevitable from time to
time, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy and wipes out the
results of years of effort.   The second uncertainty is the availability
of external assistance.   The vast majority of bilateral aid is committed
annually, usually several months after the start of the fiscal year, and
with considerable uncertainties about the level of commitments and disburse-
ments of particular donors.   Any delay in IDA replenishment has an enormous
impact on aid flows.   Together, these considerations severely complicate
planning and force a high degree of caution in foreign exchange management.
4.      In this perspective, the performance of the economy has been far
from bad.   In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly 4% per
annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth rate of
less than 1% during the preceding 50 years.   Population has also grown
faster in the past two decades than previously, but per capita income has
nevertheless risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first half of



-2-
this century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1% a year since inde-
pendence.
5.      Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on others
and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs.   The growth of
the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health services, etc.)
has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high cost and has yielded
results of variable quality; many industrial and agricultural investment
schemes have been highly successful, but others have taken excessively long
to be completed and have operated well below full capacity; in some regions
of the country growth and structural change have been rapid and compare
favorably with developments in many other parts of the world, but in other
regions there has been stagnation and possibly even decline.   Despite these
improvements and although the distribution of income in India is relatively
even by comparison with many other countries, there has been little impact
upon the living standards of the vast masses of the urban and rural population.
The Government has become increasingly concerned about the plight of the
lower income strata which, conservatively measured, consist of some 200 million
people with incomes of-less than US$60 per head per year, and has initiated
in recent years a variety of programs specifically designed-to alleviate
poverty.
6.      In broad-terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to change.
Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 42% of national
product in the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years previously.
The share of output contributed by the industrial sector has increased only
slowly and since .the late 1960s has remained approximately constant at a level
of 23%.   There has,.however, been a shift in the composition of industrial
production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital goods now contributing
about one-third each compared with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer
goods production 25 years ago.
7.      One of India's most impressive achievements since the mid-1960S
has been the doubling of the average growth rate of productivity in foodgrain
production.   This has been achieved primarily through the introduction of
new, high-yielding seed varieties and through complementary itiprovements in
farming practices.   Nevertheless, much remains to be done to consolidate the
production growth in the wheat belt and to extend it both to other areas and
to other foodgrain crops, most particularly rice.   Other crops have, in most
cases, shown a slow but fairlJy constant rate of productivity increase.  Irri-
gation has played a major part in agricultural growth and, by reducing dependence
on the monsoon, has reduced variability in performance.   For instance, the
drought-induced decline in foodgrain output in 1972/73 was only some 6%, com-
pared with a fall of almost 20% due to the drought in the mid-1960s.   At
present only about half the potentially irrigable areas has been developed.
Fuller utilization of the existing irrigation system and extension of the
irrigatied areas are, therefore, matters of the highest priority in order to
meet India's rising food needs and to protect the econonr against the vagaries

of the weather.   Land which cannot be irrigated accounts for about 50% of
the cultivable area; output from non-irrigated land will thus remain
important and substantial benefits remain to be realized through technical
change and investment.
8.      Performance of the industrial sector has been variable and to some
extent disappointing.   Industrial growth averaged about 7% a year in the
1950s, rose to 9% in the first half of the 1960s, but declined to some 5%
through 1972 and in the past three years has been negligible.   The slow
growth since the mid-1960s is especially worrying.   To some extent it was
precipitated by the severe drought of 1966 and 1967 and the accompanying
general recession.   But it has also been the result of many other factors:
the relatively limited opportunities for further import substitution which
had from the outset been at the center of the industrialization strategy;
the recurring and at times acute bottlenecks in the production of a number
of key intermediate goods such as power, steel, and cement; shortages of
imported raw materials;  and cumbersome administrative procedures.    In
the past year, the Government has made a number of important changes in the
regulations and administration of the industrial licensing system, and in
the recent budget for 197./75 has made several tax concessions in order to
stimulate the private sector.   There are one or two promising signs that
these measures may be having some effect, but it is too early to form a
balanced overall judgment.
9.      The gross domestic savings rate has been in the region of 14% for
the past decade.   While this compares favorably with other countries having
similarly low income levels, it has fallen far short of India's resource
needs.   And although external assistance has been substantial in absolute
terms, in relation to national income it has been small, so that the gross
investment rate has reached as high as 17% in only a few years.   More
recently, at a time of generally sluggish economic activity and also because
of a decline in foreign assistance, the gross investment rate has been only
about 14-15%.
10.     The economy has been passing through an unusually difficult period
in the past two years.   On top of the stagnation of the industrial sector,
agricultural production was severely set back by the drought in 1972/73.
Foodstocks have been depleted and there have been severe food shortages in
many parts of the country.   Prices have risen to very high levels and there
has been considerable political unrest.   Despite the favorable monsoon in
1973 and the consequently good autumn harvest, as well as large imports in
1973/74, the food position has remained tight.   The situation has been
greatly aggravated by the withholding of grain from the market for specula-
tive ard insurance reasons, induced by the prevailing climate of inflation
and shortages, and by the growing realization that the 1974 spring harvest
would fall short of earlier expectations.   The crop shortfall has been the
result of acute shortages of fertilizer and of electric power and diesel for
irrigation pumping as well as poor winter rains.   All these difficulties havie
meant that performance in the Fourth Plan (1969/70-1973/74) has turned out



- 4-
well below the targets: an aggregate growth rate of 3% per annum compared
with the aim of 5.7%, with capacity and production achievements in al the
major sectors falling far short of the original goals.  The growth rate of
5.5% in 1973/74 represented no more than a recovery from the negative growth
the previous year.
11.     Shortfalls in agricultural production, both of food crops and crops
used for industrial raw materials, have been a prime cause of the inflation
which has beset the country for the past two years.  Prices have gone up as
a direct result of the imbalance between supply and demand, and also indirectly
because of the massive budgetary outlays, and consequent deficit financing,
needed for drought relief, food subsidies, and crash production programs.
The acute shortages of many intermediate and industrial commodities and, more
recently, the surge in import prices have also contributed to the inflationary
situation.   Inflation is now running at an annual rate of around 25%, compared
with only 4-5% a few years previously.  The Government has made several attempts
to reduce the rate of inflation, so far with little success.
12.     The domestic economic difficulties together with the recent surge in
world commodity prices have severely upset the development program.  The
iAfth Plan, which was published in draft last December and was due for imple-
mentation starting in 1974/75, is currently under revision, and in the interim
the Government is proceeding with a substantially scaled-down program.  Capital
expenditure is being held down to a level which in real terms is likely to be
below that of last year.   The thrust of the investment program is on the key
secf;ors whose output is in critically short supply: coal, electric power, oil,
ron-ferrous metals, fertilizer, steel, and transport.  Within the tight budget,
allocation to the social sectors, most particularly education, have been cut
below previous levels.   In line with the Government's aim to relieve the per-
vasive commodity shortages and to stimulate industrial production, the 1974/75
bIudget has also made a number of tax and other concessions to private industry.
But the budget has also introduced additional taxation as well as increases
ii rat-es on transport and other public services, in order to hold down the
LIud, 4' deficit.
13#     Ever since the balance of payments crisis of the late 1950s, a shortage
-if foreign exchange has constituted one of the most critical constraints on
dve'rlopnent of the econo'y.  The recent increases in world commodity prices
have added to these problems, at a time when the economy is singularly ill-
placed to deal with them.   Petroleum has become a very prominent item in the
nmgort bill.   In 1972/73 imports of crude oil and petroleum products amounted
> ~.34265 million, equivalent to 10% of merchandise imports; estimates of the
ccorresr9onding figures for 1973/74 are US$625 million and 18%, and for 197b/75
depen-ding on the availability of external financing and other factors, US$1,300
m.LUlior± and 26%. In the Draft Fifth Plan the Government had already set out
nitJ.i.-us programs of indigenous energy development in order to reduce dependence
*:. Lpor ed oil, but these have had to be supplemented by a variety of other
T--S ag 51  The short-term focus is on reduced consumption, by increasing the
prircie, of petroleum products and, more important, by converting oil-burning
Vtil  ?* Q to coal wherever possible.  But there are only limited opportunities



-5-
for immediately reducing petroleum consumption, and somne cutback in supplies
appears inevitable.   Since the bulk of petroleum consumption is concentrated
in such vital sectors as agriculture (as feedstock for fertilizer production
and as fuel for irrigation pumping and mechanized farming), goods transport,
and industry, with final, private consumption accounting for no more than 10%
of total consumption, reduced oil supplies are bound to depress overall economic
production.   Another emphasis of short-term policy is on removal of the
immediate bottlenecks in coal production and transport.   For the longer term,
programs are already under way to raise the efficiency of oil utilization and
to step up the pace of development of coal-based fertilizer technology, of
oil exploration, and of exploitation of the considerable hydroelectric resources.
None of these energy adjustment measures will be easy or quick of attainment
and it will be several years before results of appreciable quantitative
significance will be realized.
14.     The increase in oil prices is only one element in a large widening of
the trade deficit.   The need for large imports of food and fertilizers, at
the exceptionnlly high prices of the past year, and the price increases in oil,
steel, non-ferrous metals, and other vital imports increased the import bill
by 37% in 1973/74.   This increase was partly offset by a 14% increase in exports,
several export items benefiting from the commodities boom, but the estimated
trade gap was about US$650 million compared with US$50 million the year before.
The outlook for 197)/75 is bleak, as the full effect of the deterioration in
the terms of trade comes to be felt.   Even with a severe compression of food,
fertilizer, and petroleum imports and a probable decline in general maintenance
imports in real terms, the total import bill could rise by a further 40% if
prices continue at their present level.   Exports promise to continue doing
well, which should reduce the impact of the enlarged import bill.   Nevertheless,
there is a critical need for external assistance at a much higher level than
the US$1,300 million last year, which was itself US$400 million (or L5%) higher
than the previous year.   The Government secured two million tons of food aid
from the USSR last year, half of which remains to be disbursed this year, and
has negotiated credits from several oil-producing countries.   The Government
has also drawn its gold tranche and first credit tranche from the IMF.   Ln
addcition, the Consortium is discussing what action is possible to help India
overcome its difficulties and several members have already announced large
increases in their aid programs for 1974/75.
15.     As a result of substantial past borrowings, India's external public
debt (disbursed only) stood at US$9.9 billion on March 31, 1973.   Debt service
in 1973/74 is estimated at US$700 million, equivalent to around 24% of export
receipts.   This compares with a level of debt service of about US$200 million
in the mid-1960s.   In order to mitigate the negative effects on growth of
such a high burden of external debt and to forestall any danger of a foreign
exchange crisis, from 1968/69 onwards the Consortium has extended debt relief
to India.   In 1973/74, the most recent year in which this action was taken,
the amount of debt relief was about US$185 million.   An the assumption that
India can obtain its large, new financing requirements on appropriately soft
terrs, debt service is expected to grow more slowly over the rest of this



-6-
decade than it did in the 1960s and should be equivalent to around 20% of
export receipts by 1980.
PART II--BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
16.     Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 41 loans and 60 development credits
to India totalling US$1,177 million and US$2,723 million (both net of cancellation),
respectively. Of these amounts, US$627 million had been repaid, and US$959
million was still undisbursed as of April 30, 1974.   Annex II contains a summary
statement of disbursements as of April 30, 1974, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
17.     Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of which US$6.8 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled.   Of the balance of US$21.6 million, US$14.6 million
represents loans and US$7.0 nmllion equity.   A summary statement of IFC oper-
ations as of April 30, 1974, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
le.    In recent years the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on agri-
culture.   The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit opera-
tions.   Major irrigation, marketing, and seed development are other agri-
cultural activities supported by the Bank Group.   In recognition of the
importance of industrialization for India's future development, the Bank Group
has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer sector
and also, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institutions,
in a wide range of medium- and small-scale enterprises.   IDA financing of
industrial raw materials and components for selected priority sectors has been
instrumental in facilitating fuller capacity utilization in these sectors.
The Bank Group has also been active in supporting infrastructure development
through assistance to the power, telecommunications, and railway systems.
Family planning, education, water supply development and related urban invest-
ments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
19.     The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been con-
sistent with India's need and the Governnent's priorities.   The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power and transport remain highly
relevant.   The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
in the present world commodity situation.   Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit and on-farm investments, command area development of existing irrigation
schemes, and seed production form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next year.   Special emphasis will be given to projects bene-
fiting small farmers and landless laborers.   Lending in support of infrastructure
and industrial investments will focus on energy-related projects.   Repeater
credits for power and railways have high priority in this context, and dis-
cussions are under way with the Government in an effort to identify and prepare
projects specifically designed to facilitate coal production and coal transports.
Lendinlg for fertilizer projects, which has been an important feature in recent



- 7 -
years, is expected to continue to occupy a prominent place in the future program;
the use of coal-based technology will receive particular attention.
20.     The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic reports
and of the discussions within the India Consortium.  The need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time when out-
put and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different price situation.
Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial raw materials and
components continues to be an essential element within the overall program of
assistance.   As in the past, Bank Group assistance for projects in India should
include as appropriate the financing of local expenditures.  India imports
relatively few capital goods because of the capacity of the domestic capital
goods industry.   The import conponent of projects tends to be especially low
in such high-priority areas as agriculture, education, and family planning.
For the Bank Group to be able to make an appropriate contribution to the
financing of projects, it is important to cover a proportion of local expend-
itures.
21.     Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion contri-
buted by the Bank Group has grown significantly.  In 1969/70 the BanLk Group
accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements and 12%
of net disbursements, as compared with an estimated 35%, 28% and 42%, respect-
ively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group is expected to
continue growing.  Whereas on March 31, 1973, the Bank Group share of India's
outstanding external public debt was 21%, by 1979 it is likely to account for
almost 30%.   Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly in the
form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly.  In
1972/73 about 13% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank Group.
PART III-- THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
22.     Increased fertilizer production is an essential part of India's programn
to increase agricultural production.  Approximately 24% of total development
expenditure by the public sector has been devoted to agriculture in recent
years, with priority being given to accelerating the spread of modern technology
through increasing the availability of inputs such as improved seeds, irrigatior.
credit and fertilizers.  The output of foodgrains, particularly the high-
yielding varieties of wheat and rice, is largely a function of the fertlilizer
application rate.   It is estimated that, under present conditions in India,
the application of one ton of fertilizer yields an incremental production
of five to seven tons of foodgrain.  Thus, shortfalls in the supply of fer-
tilizer, whether imported or produced domestically, have consequences of the
utmost gravity for essential food supplies.
23.     Consumption of fertilizers in India has been increasing at an average
annual rate of about 17% since 1963/64, when it was at a level of 575,000
nutrient tons, but it still remains very low relative to usage in- more developed
countries.   In 1973/74 it reached a level of 2.8 million tons, of which 66%



-8-
was nitrogen, 23% phosphate, and 11% potash.   Almost half of this total was
imported.   The level of imports, and therefore the increase in consumption,
would have been higher were it not for the scarcity of fertilizer on the
world market and the extremely high prices prevailing.
24.     Although domestic production of fertilizer has grown from 327,000 tons
in 1963/64 to 1.45 million tons last year, it has not kept pace with the growth
in consumption.   Projections through the end of the decade show a continuing
deficit, even assuming optimistic start-up schedules for new projects and high
capacity utilization for all plants.
25.     The present intention is to create an installed capacity of about 6.0
million tons of nitrogen and 1.8 million tons of phosphate by 1978/79.   Present-
ly, India has an installed capacity of about 2.3 million nutrient tons of
fertilizers.   In addition, there are 18 projects under construction with a
total capacity of 2.6 million tons.   When these are completed, about 60% of
installed capacity will be in the public sector and the balance in the private
and cooperative sectors.   There are also 10 projects, involving a total
capacity of 2.0 million tons, at &n advanced stage of consideration for
implementation during the next five years.   With the exception of three new
projects which are coal-based, all of India's existing and planned projects
are based on petroleum products, including naphtha and fuel oil, and domestic
natural gas.
26.     Recent developments in the world market have made it more clear than
ever before that India cannot afford to rely on imports for more than
a small proportion of her fertilizer requirements and must give high priority
to the domestic production of fertilizer.   At the same time, the increase in
petroleum prices has had an important impact on the economics of fertilizer
production, making coal the preferred feedstock in the Indian situation.    In
the long run, coal-based fertilizer plants will have to figure prominently in
Irdia's fertilizer investment strategy, not only because of her sizeable coal
deposits but also because significant progress is likely to be made in coal-
iase;d fertilizer technology.  Fbr the foreseeable future, however, such a
development will be constrained by coal shortages and by the prospects for
more efficient use of coal as a substitute for petroleum products in power
generation and other industrial uses.   At current prices, about US$60-80 is
needed to buy the oil required to make a nutrient ton of fertilizer which would
cost about US$500-600 to import; a favorable relationship would also exist at
long-range forecast fertilizer prices of about,US$280 per nutrient ton.    Thus,
for the next two or three years India should pursue the rapid implemeltation.
of projects based on petroleum feedstocks which are at an advanced stage of
preparation.
27.     Only about 65% of India's installed nitrogenous fertilizer capacity
was used in 1973/74, largely for reasons outside the control of the industry
itselt.   The largest single cause of low capacity utilization was power
sh3xrtages and fluctuations;  because of power problems alone, the Fertilizer
Corporation of India (FCI) suffered a production loss of 48,200 tons of
nitrog>en last year.  This is almost 13% of its installed capacity and is



- 9 -
worth about US$25 million at present import prices.   In addition, design
deficiencies and aging equipment result in the fact that the effective
capacity in several plants is less than the rated capacity. Projects under
construction suffer from delays in commissioning, particularly because of
procurement and start-up difficulties, shortages of cement and steel, and
delays in the supply of local equipment.
28a     The Bank Group has been active in the fertilizer field in India.
IDA has made three Credits, for the Fertilisers and Chemicals, Travancore,
Ltdc (FACT) plant in Cochin and for the Gorakhpur and Nangal Units of FCI.
These project have all aimed at a balanced expansion of capacity while at
the same time removing bottlenecks to the efficient utilization of existing
capacity.   Gorakhpur and Nangal are proceeding satisfactorily, and
virtually all the equipment has been ordered for both projects.   The Cochin
II project was envisaged as a follow-on to Cochin I, a major ammonia/urea
complex financed through bilateral credit.   Cochin I was expected to begin
operations in mid-1971.   However, it has still not been commissioned. Manage-
rnent attention has been concentrated on solving the problems of this project,
to the detriment of Cochin II, which is now about a year behind schedule.
The Cochin Unit has also suffered from procurement and labor problems.   IFC
has participated in two private sector fertilizer projects: Indian Explosives
Ltd. in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and Zuari-Agro-Chemicals Ltd. in Goa, both of
which are now in operation.   The Bank Group is now considering two other
fertilizer projects for financing in .Y 1975: expansion of the FCI plant at
Sindri, in Bihar, and construction of a new IFFOO (Indian Farmers Fertiliser
Cooperative, Ltd.) plant at Phulpur, in Uttar Pradesh.
PART IV-- THE PROJECT
29.     The proposed project was appraised in May/June 1973 and in October
1973.     The appraisal report (No. 448-IN, dated May 20, 1974) is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.   Negotiations were held
in Washington in May 1974.   The Government of India was representated by
Mr. S. Venkataraman, Adviser, Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals, and
Mr. V.N. Rajagopalan, Director, Department of Economic Affairs; FWI was
represented by Mr. R.S. Gupta, Director (Finance), Mr. K.S. Sarma, Officer
on Special Duty, and Mr. R.R. Poricha, Chief Engineer.   Attached as Annex
III is a credit and project summary.
Trombay IV Expansion
30.     The major part of the proposed credit would help finance the expansion
of the capacity of FOI's Trombay Unit, located in the industrial zone of
Bombay, by 250,000 TPY of nitric acid and by 355,000 TPY of nitrophosphate
fertilizer (Trombay IV).
31.     The existing Trombay Unit has an annual design capacity of 240,000
tons of complex fertilizer (NPK), 99,000 tons of urea and 30,000 tons of
methanol.   Intermediate products include ammonia, nitric and sulfuric acid.
It was constructed in several phases (Trombay I-III) during 1962-65. In
the early years of operation, technical problems limited production, but since
1968 a number of improvements have been made to remove various bottlenecks
and in 1973/74 the plant achieved about 90% utilization of effective capacity.



- 10 -
The management has embarked on additional investments to modernize the
existing plant facilities and to improve pollution control.   This modern-
ization program is not part of the proposed project, but will be implemented
concurrently and is important to Trombay's expected operational and financial
improvements.   It is scheduled to be completed by 1976 and is linked with
the proposed project only by the nitric acid plant and some common utilities
which are components of the proposed project.
32.     Two units are involved in the proposed project--a single train 250,000
TPY nitric acid plant and a 355,000 TPY nitrophosphate plant which would
utilize the nitric acid to convert phosphate rock into fertilizer.   The
process is commonly used in Europe in producing phosphate fertilizers.
Offsite facilities to be added consist mainly of storage, utilities and
housing.   The commissioning of the nitric acid and nitrophosphate plants
are planned for October 1976 and April 1977, respectively.   The principal
raw materials to be used are ammonia, phosphate rock and diammonium phosphate
(DAP) or triple superphosphate (TSP).   Ammonia is critical and in short
supply.   Therefore, all of the ammonia requirements of the project (about
100,000 TPY) will be met from a new ammonia/urea plant to be established at
Trombay under another expansion project (Trombay V) to be carried out con-
currently with Trombay IV.   Engineering contracts are  about to be concluded
for Trombay V, which will be financed through Italian and Austrian credits.
The Trombay V project will be constructed by FCI in accordance with an agreed
schedule and is expected to be completed in May 1978, one year later than
Trombay IV.   Until the ammonia plant reaches full production, the ammonia
needs of the Trombay IV expansion will be met primarily from various local
sources, with the balance provided by imports.   The Government has assured
an adequate supply of raw materials (Section l.02 of Development Credit
Agreement).   The Government and FCI have also provided assurances that
adequate railway facilities to transport the average daily output of about
3,000 tons and the additional power requirements for the project (9 MW) will
be made available (Section 2.03 (d) of Project Agreement and Sections 3.01 (a)
and 4.03 of Development Credit Agreement)'   Allocation for additional rail-
way wagons has been included in the Indian Railways program, and the Tata Power
Company has taken steps to install additional transmission facilities at the
site.   These measures should avoid two problems which frequently affect
fertilizer plants in India.
33.     The Trombay IV expansion will be implemented by FCI, a public sector
corporation which was incorporated in 1961 and is India's largest fertilizer
producer, accounting for about 20% of nitrogen and 6% of phosphate capacity
in the country.   In addition to five operating units, all of which are being
or will soon be expanded, FCI has seven new plants under construction.   The
management and technical staff are sound, although they are strained by FCI's
very large expansion program, designed to increase its capacity almost eight-
fold by 1979.   The Corporation has a satisfactory debt/equity ratio of 27/73,
which is projected to rise to 43/57 in 1976/77 and to decline thereafter.
As a result of start-up delays in three plants, operational losses in two, and
substantially higher raw material costs, its net income and working capital
positions are weak, but they are projected to reach satisfactory levels in
1975 and to improve further thereafter.   Attainment of the forecast improve-
ment in sales revenues and profits depends on the performance of new plants
and on increased capacity utilization in existing plants.



- 11 -
34.     To assure the financial viability of the project, the Government
of India and FCI have agreed that:   (a) 17I and the Trombay Unit will main-
tain a long-term debt/equity ratio not exceeding 50:50, and (b) FCI will
maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.2 to 1 (Section 4.0b of the
Project Agreement).   These are similar to covenants which were agreed in
the Gorakhpur and Nangal projects and have been observed.
35.     Because FCI's managerial and technical resources are taxed by its
large expansion program, the Corporation needs outside engineering companies
to supplement its own staff in project execution.    The Association will
finance these services, as it has in previous Indian fertilizer projects.
In Trombay IV, FCI will be the prime contractor; the nitric acid plant
contractor is Davy Power Gas and the nitrophosphate plant contractor is
Uhde, both selected in April 1974 after international competition.    FCI
and these contractors will share responsibility for engineering, procurement,
budget control and scheduling and erection of the two plants involved.    FCI
has prepared a Project Implementation Plan which has been found satisfactory
by the Association.   Its.staff, with some advanced training for selected
managerial and technical personnel as envisaged under the project, are
capable of handling their responsibilities in the large-scale expansion
of Trombay capacity.
36.     FCI is currently involved in litigation through the International
Chamber of Commerce regarding contracts for the original Trombay plant.
Although the total claims discussed have been as high as US$13-23 million,
an interim award agreed by a majority of the tribunal in February would
involve payment by FCI of less than US$250,000.    The Government has pro-
vided assurances that it will make available to FCI sufficient funds for
the settlement of such claims (Section 4.04 of Development Agreement).
37.     The project provides for adequate equipment to control pollution
in order to comply with the environmental quality standards set by the
Bombay municipal authorities.    FCI has already taken significant steps
to reduce pollution levels at the Trombay Unit and has provided assurances
regarding control of the potentially harmful emissions produced by the
project (Section 2.10 of Project Agreement).
38.     The Trombay IV expansion is estimated to cost US$64 million equiva-
lent (including US$4.0 million interest during construction and US$6.5 million
duties and taxes), of which US$25 million would be in foreign exchange.    US$33
million of the proposed IDA credit would meet 62% of the project cost, net of
interest and taxes, the balance being provided by GOI equity.     The proceeds
of this portion of the credit would be on-lent to FI for 15 years, including
five years grace, at an annual interest rate of 91-.   As in previous projects,
the exchange risk would be borne by the Government.
39.     This portion of the credit would be used to finance US$19.5 million
in equipment and spare parts, US$306 million in license fees and design
engineering, US$4.6 million for plant erection and commissioning, US$1.8
million for project management and training, and US$3.5 million in
unallocated funds to meet physical and price contingencies.    All equipment



- 12 -
would be procured by international competitive bidding, except an estimated
total of US$5 million for three types of items: proprietary items, items
to be procured under contracts for US$50, 000 or less, and items in short
supply whose timely procurement is critical.  Concerning the latter, the
procurement schedule provides that the Association may waive the require-
ment for formal tendering in specific cases involving items whose delivery
times are critical to the project for process or schedule purposes and
where experience indicates that tenders would yield an inadequate response,
if any.   About 10% of the equipment in terms of cost would be reserved
for local procurement and would not be financed under the proposed credit.
Local suppliers competing for the supply of equipment under international
competitive bidding would be granted a 15% preference or the current rate
of import duty, whichever is less.
Plant Operations lmprovement
40.     While expansion of India's fertilizer capacity must proceed as rapidly
as sound financial, technical and managerial considerations permit, increased
capacity utilization at existing plants, including accelerated completion of
plants nearing commissioning, will yield the highest and most immediate
returns.   The Government has already undertaken a concerted effort to over-
come technical problems and bottlenecks,  A major requirement is foreign
exchange fbr equipment, materials, and consulting services.
41.     Accordingly, in support of the Government's efforts to increase
utilization of existing capacity and expedite the completion of plants about
to be commissiorned, the project contains a Plant Operations Improvement com-
ponent.   The major part of the US$17 million of the proposed credit allocated
to Plant Operations Improvement would be used for the three FCI plants and
one FACT plant scheduled for commissioning in 1974.  Each of these is about
three years behind schedule due to technical problems which could be over-
come if corrective measures are taken.   Fbreign exchange is needed primarily
for consulting services, boilers, utility systems, rotating equipment,
reactors, and consumable materials such as chemicals and catalysts.  Expend-
itures for operating plants would consist mainly of a turbo-alternator to
provide captive power to FCI's Gorakhpur Unit (which lost 23,600 tons of
nitrogen production in 1973/74 due to power shortages) and modifications to
the sulfuric acid and nitric acid plants at FACT's Udyogmandal Unit.
42.     According to an Implemrntation Plan agreed with the Government, a
Coordination Group would be established with representatives of the Ministry
o' Petroleum and Chemicals, FCI, FACT, and consultants appointed in consult-
ation with the Association.   This group would undertake a preliminary review
of the six operating units of FCI and FACT and the four plants scheduled
to be commissioned in 1974, with a view to establishing priorities and consti-
tuting small groups of specialists (including consultants as necessary) to
study the operations of each plant.  These groups would develop a detailed
optirnization program for each plant for review by the Coordination Group,
which would then submit proposals. to the Government and the Association
for their approval.



- 13 -
43.     Of the Plant Operations Improvement portion of the proposed credit,
US$12 million would be allocated to equipment and spare parts, US$3 million
to engineering and consultant services, and a maximum of US$2 million to
consumable materials.   The Government would make the foreign exchange
proceeds of this portion of the credit available through the Reserve Bank
of India to FCI and FACT, who would purchase foreign exchange with their
own rupee resources through authorized banks.   All disbursements under the
Plant Operations Improvement component would be for foreign exchange expen-
ditures; and equipment and materials would be procured by international
competitive bidding except an estimated US$6 million for duplicate or replace-
ment items, items whose delivery is critical for process or schedule purposes,
and contracts for US.$50,000 or less.  Funds would be disbursed orly on
the basis of agreed optimization programs for individual plants.
Returns and Benefits
411e   Trombay is now the most profitable unit of FCI, with net profits of
Rs 89 million in 1973/74 compared to total net profits of the Corporation as
a whole of Rs 40 million.   The pre-tax financial return for the Trombay IV
expansion is about 13.5% and by 1978/79 net profits are projected to increase
to Rs 165 million for Trombay and to Rs 461 million for FCI.   The calculations
in the appraisal report are based upon conservative projections of 1978 prices
for inputs and finished product.   Although fertilizer prices and tle prices
of some inputs in India have been increased recently, they do not take fully
into account the current world price situation,   The Government has agreed
to establish prices for fertilizer and its inputs at levels which would permit
a reasonable rate of return on invested capital after manufacturers meet
their expenses and debt service requirements out of revenues (Section 4.06
of the Development Credit Agreement).
45.    The economic rate of return of the Trombay IV Expansion is 16% at 90%
capacity utilization.   At 80% capacity utilization with a six-month com-
missioning delay and a 10% cost overrun, sensitivity analysis shows the
return would drop to about 13%, still a satisfactory level.    The net direct
annual foreign exchange savings attributed to the project are estimated at
about US$18 million once the plant is operating normally at 90% capacity.
As a result of the project, employment at the Unit will increase by about
20% to 2,500, and existing staff should be utilized more efficiently.    In-
direct employment benefits are limited primarily to marketing.
46.    The impact of the Plant Operations Improvement Program on the Indian
economy is expected to be very significant--though difficult to quantify--
because of increased supply of fertilizers within a short period of time.
The four plants nearing commissioning alone have a total capacity of 600,000
tons of nitrogen, worth US$300 million a year at present import prices.    Most
of this output could not, of course, be attributed to the Plant Operations
Improvement Program, but it is conservatively estimated that the proposed US$17
million investment would result in an average incremental annual production
of 60,000-90,000 tons of plant nutrients.   At forecast international prices
and direct production costs per nutrient ton of fertilizer of US$280 and
US$120, respectively, the incremental production would provide a net annual
benefit of US$10-15 million to the economy.

These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. The first two loans are fully
committed, and disbursements under Loan 789-IN are ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 89    Beas Equipment; US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has been
subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated develop-
ment of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The closing date of December 31,
1972, has been postponed for the second time to June 30, 1974.
In No. 614   Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing
Date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high yielding varieties. The Corporation is working
efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality. Seed
production is meeting targets. Implementation problems over processing plant
construction and land-levelling have been resolved. Expansion of an existing

processing plant is in progress, and tenders for a new plant are under
preparation. Large scale land-levelffng demonstrations have stimulated
demand for such work and orders are to be placed shortly by contractors
for imported machinery.
Cr No. 176   Kadana Irrigation;  US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: Sept mber 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam on
the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The project
also includes field channel construction, land levelling, drainage works and roads
and a program to support agricultural development. The project will be completed
about two years behind schedule because of delays on dam construction.   The agri-
cultural components of the project are also behind schedule. Some of the delays
in implementation have occurred at the start of the project. before major invest-
ments have been made. These will not affect the economic justification of the
project. Further delays have occurred as a result of material shortages in the
present construction season, and the need for additional spillway construction.
If material shortages are not relieved and the additional spillway construction
is not started forthwith, the resulting delays could affect the economic justi-
fication of the project.

ANNEX II
Page 5
The above agricultural credit projects total US$319.9 million.
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization equipment only,
all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long and medium-term
credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments
as imported tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling.   Disbursement
of these credits started slowly.   So far as the minor irrigation components
were concerned, the main difficulties stemmed from the institutional require-
ments, in particular the introduction of changes in lending criteria and
lending terms and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assessing
groundwater availability.   These constraints have now been overcome and dis-
bursements are accelerating, reflecting high demand for minor irrigation
investments spurred by the experience of the  1972   drought.   Tractor pro-
curement has been delayed following the substantial change in both the supply
and demand situations since the projects were originally appraised.   The
credits have recently been amended to permit the financing of indigenously
manufactured tractors as well as imported tractors and to reallocate some
funds earmarked for tractors to minor irrigation components.
Cr No 230 Agro Aviation; US$6.0 mil lion credit of January 28   1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The project is designed to improve facilities for aerial spraying
of pesticides as part of India's plant protection program.   So far no dis-
bursements have taken place.   There were initially difficulties over air-
craft procurement specifications which have     been resolved.   More recently,
however, issues have arisen concerning the training program for agricultural
pilots and maintenance engineers, the implementation of which is a prerequisite
for disbursing against importation of aircraft.   These difficulties are under
discussion with GOI.
Cr No. 267   Wheat Storage;  US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which provides storage facilities in India's wheat
belt, comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons capacity) and 10
silos (200,000 tons capacity) and an all-India grain storage study. Warehouse
construction is about 75 percent complete and preparations for silo constructioc:;
are progressing. The Government Food Ministry intends to select a local research
institute in the near future to conduct the study.
Cr No. 456   Himachal Pradesh Apples Processing and Marketing;  US$13 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project has been designed to promote the development of apple
production in Himachal Pradesh and comprises, roads, cold storage, juice
processing, and marketing.  The conditions of effectiveness have to be ful-
filled by July 23, 1974.

Cr No. 241   Telecommunications IV;  US$78.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
Cr No. 403   Telecommunications V; US$80.0 million credit of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31. 1976
Both projects are continuations of Telecommunications III. Tele-
communications IV has been designed to support the telecommunications expan-
sion program over the last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Procurement
action for delivery of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed.
Production problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 months. However, production has now picked up and disbursements have
accelerated. Full disbursement is expected by the closing date of December
1974. Telecoimunications V was declared effective on July 30, 1973.
Cr No. 242   Power Transmission II: US$75.o million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30. 1975
Cr No. 377   Power Transmission III Project;  US$85.0 million credit of May 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project financed
by Loan 416-IN, has been designed to assist in financing the purchase of equip-
ment and materials required to develop a power transmission program in nine
States under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of
problems associated with preparing bid documents suitable for international
bidding and the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but contract
awards have now been completed. Disbursements started in June 1973 and should
be completed by the closing date of September 30, 1975. Power Transmission
III became effective on October 10, 1973.
Cr No. 268   Pochampad Irrigation;  US$39.0 million credit of August 23,
1971;_ Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha.  It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads.
Until mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with
construction and Credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acute
shortage of construction materials, especially explosives for the canal
excavation, has since hampered progress. As a result, construction of the
main canals is now likely to fall more than one year behind schedule.
Land development is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water
availability in the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the
credit operation for land development and has requested IDA financing for a
COmmand Area Development Project (GAD), to be implemented by a Central Authority
for all farmers in need of land development. The project will include the
setting up of a well-coordinated technical and administrative organization
backed by suitable legal measures. Project preparation is underway and appraisal
scheduled for November 1974.

February 9. 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The Cochin Fertilizer project is now proceeding about one year behind
schedule. Procurement has been completed and, although labor and management
problems remain a potential source of difficulty, no further delays are anti-
cipated.   As of April 30, 1974, US$8.8 million had been disbursed under the
Credit.   The engineering design for the Gorakhpur Fertilizer project is
well advanced and virtually all the equipment has been ordered.  Although
delivery of some equipment may take longer than forecast during appraisal,
the project is progressing without serious difficulties.  Engineering work
and procurement for the Nangal Fertilizer project are proceeding satisfact-
orily.

establishment of wholesale markets in about 50 towns.  A supervision mission
visited the project in February and reported good progress in the selection,
design and appraisal of individual market sub-projects.  Disbursements have
begun and should accelerate as construction of markets get underway. Mysore
Wholesale Agricultural Markets became effective on September 7, 1973.
Cr No. 312   Population; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972; Closing
