tures" means expenditures in the currency of a country other
than the Borrower and for goods or services supplied from the
territory of any country other than the Borrower.
3.   The disbursement percentages have been calculiated in compli-
ance with the policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan
shall be disbursed on account of payments for taxes levied by, or
in the territory of, the Borrower on goods or services, or on the
importation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof; to that
end, if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in respect of
any item to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan decreases
or increases, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, increase or
decrease the disbursement percentage then applicable to such item
as required to be consistent with the aforementioned policy of the
Bank.

withdrawals shall be made:

Agreement; provided, however, that on account of expenditures for
purposes of Part C of the Project, no withdrawals shall be made in
respect of expenditures prior to the date of the Amending Agree-
ment between the Borrower and the Bank and CODELCO-CHILE and
ENAMI, dated                           ; and
(b) on account of expenditures for purposes of Part C of the
Project unless the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to the


﻿- 13 -
Bank that: (i) ENDESA has entered into such contracts satisfac-
tory to the Bank as shall be required for the execution of the
Program; and (ii) each of the contracts mentioned in Section 2.09
and 2.10 of the ENDESA Project Agreement has been executed and
delivered and constitute valid and binding obligations of the
parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms.
5.   Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Loan or
the disbursement percentages set forth in the table in paragraph
1 above, if the Bank has reasonably estimated that the amount
of the Loan then allocated to any Category will be insufficient
to finance the agreed percentage of all expenditures in that
Category, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower: (i) reallocate
to such Category, to the extent required to meet the estimated
shortfall, proceeds of the Loan which are then allocated to
another Category and which in the opinion of the Bank are not
needed to meet other expenditures, and (ii) if such reallocation
cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall, reduce the disbursement
percentage then applicable to such expenditures in order that
further withdrawals under such Category may continue until all
expenditures thereunder shall have been made.
6.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the pro-
curement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the
procedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expendi-
tures for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting
any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan
Agreement, by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the
Loan as in the Bank's reasonable opinion represents the amount of
such expenditures which would otherwise have been eligible for
financing out of the proceeds of the Loan.
