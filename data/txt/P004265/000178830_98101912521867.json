provide for\n            development of 14,800 ha of new land for rice and tree\n            crops, and rehabilitation of 3,700 ha of existing rice land\n            in Perak State, on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It\n            would also include roads, housing, community facilities,\n            palm oil and cocoa mills, and supporting services for\n            agriculture and community development for about 6,900\n            settler families, presently landless or cultivating\n            uneconomic-sized holdings in Perak and other states. The\n            project focuses on one of the major identifiable groups of\n            rural poor, the rice smallholders, and addresses two of the\n            main factors responsible for their poverty, the small size\n            of holdings and the low productivity of rice land. All of\n            the direct benefits to be derived from the project would\n            accrue to the settler families, about 35,000 people, whose\n            present income is about US$230 per capita, well below the\n            1981 absolute poverty level income of US$320. With the\n            project, average incomes of settler families are expected to\n            reach US$560 per capita. Additional benefits would accrue to\n            the settlers through improved housing and community facilities."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
