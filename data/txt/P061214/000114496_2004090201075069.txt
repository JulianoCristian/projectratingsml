Re:
Credit  Number 3252 - SOL
      (Structural Adjustment Credit)
List of Participating Countries
Excellency:
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Structural Adjustment Credit) 
between the Solomon Islands (the Borrower) and the International Development 
Association (the Association). Pursuant to Resolution No. IDA 183 of the Board of 
Governors of the Association, and more particularly, to the definition of 
“Participating Countries” to be found in Section 1.01 (a) of the Development Credit 
Agreement, we have to inform you that, for purposes of the Agreement, the following 
countries are not “Participating Countries” and, therefore, not eligible to supply 
goods and services under the Credit: the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Brunei 
Darussalam, Cyprus, Kuwait, Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. This list 
of ineligible countries is in addition to the list of ineligible countries under 
paragraphs 1.6 and 1.8 of the “Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA 
Credits” published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, 
September 1997, and January 1999.
Yours sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
