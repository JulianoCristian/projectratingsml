to the economic crisis. The crisis\n            reflects the cumulative effects of years of poor economic\n            management and weak fiscal discipline, exacerbated by the\n            East Asian financial crisis and the collapse of its major\n            export markets for logs. The project will help restore\n            macroeconomic stability and move the economy to a path of\n            sustainable growth and development, while mitigating the\n            social cost of adjustment. The structural reforms will be\n            implemented in the areas of : a) the public sector,\n            reduction of the scope of government, rightsizing and\n            restructuring of government and the civil service, and\n            strengthening of planning, budget, accounting, and\n            monitoring systems; b) the financial sector, normalization\n            of financial relations with the government, liberalization,\n            and strengthening of the Central Bank's regulatory and\n            supervisory powers and capacities; c) forestry, measures to\n            reduce exploitation to sustainable levels, minimize the\n            environmental impact and benefit development; and d) private\n            sector development, measures to stimulate a supply response,\n            and improvements in public expenditure allocation to benefit\n            the poor and vulnerable groups."}, "docdt": "1999-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
