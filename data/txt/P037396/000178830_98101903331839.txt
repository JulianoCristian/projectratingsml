ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BOARD
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOUID POWER PROJECT
(TARBERT 3)
SUDIMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project consisting of a
250 MJ oil-fired thermal generating unit required for the expansion of
the electricity supply system in the Republic of Ireland. A loan to help
finance the project has been requested by the Electricity Supply Board
(ESB), a Government agency responsible for electric power supply through-
out the country.  A loan of US$20.0 million equivalent is proposed.  The
loan would cover about 95% of the project's foreign exchange requirements
and would represent about 71% of the estimated total cost of the project.
This would be the second Bank loan to the ESB; the first (Loan 591-IRE)
for US$14.5 million was made in March 1969 to help finance the Turlough
Hill Pumped Storage Project.  Experience with that Bank-asaisted project
has been satisfactory to date.
ii.       The electric power system in Ireland has been expanding at
about 9% per year over the past decade with the average growth rate over
moving five year periods showing a steady upward trend from 8.2% at the
beginning of the period to 10.6% at the end. Consumption is expected to
grow at 10% per year over the next several years.
iii.      The project is an essential part of the program to increase
generating capacity to meet anticipated load growth. The program has
been formulated in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Joint
Electricity Authority (NIJEA), responsible for the co-ordination of all
power operations in Northern Ireland, and has been designed to promote
the most economical use of the generating capacity of the two interconnected
systems, consistent with acceptable service standards.  The proposed
project would represent about 9% of the cost of the ESB investment program
for the five-year period 1971/72 through 1975/76.
iv.       The project is technically sound and the estimated cost is
reasonable. All engineering planning has been carried out by ESB staff,
who will also supervise construction. The staff has had considerable
experience in the design and construction of large generating units and
is capable of carrying out the project without the assistance of consultants.
v.        The ESB is a stable organization with a successfal operating
history.  A reorganization of management was carried out recently to
differentiate more clearly the policy-making and operational functions.
Although the old organization functioned well, with the reorganization
the ESB will now be better able to meet the demands of the rapidly
growing system.



-ii-
vi.       The ESB's financial position is regulated by the Electricity
(Supply) Act of 1927, which provides essentially that revenues should
cover all expenditures including depreciation and debt service, and
should allow for appropriate reserves. This criterion has in the past
proved adequate to produce a return which has ensured sufficient funds
to carry out its operations.
vii.      The internal financial rate of return on the project is
estimated to be about 28%. This comparatively high figure reflects
the fact that the new oil-fired facility will be more efficient
than existing thermal plants, a large proportion of which is comprised
of peat-burning stations that have relatively high fuel expenses.
viii.     The project would form a suitable basis for a loan of US$20.0
million equivalent for a term of 17 years, including a grace period of
about five years.

ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BOARD
APPRAISAL OF TE SEOND POWER PROJECT
(TARBERT 3)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ireland, on behalf of the Electricity Supply
Board (ESB), has requested a loan to help finance a project consisting
of a 250 MW oil-fired thenmal unit as an extension to the generating
facilities at Tarbert, which now comprise two recently commissioned
60 MW thermal units. Tarbert is on the south bank of the broad estuary
of the Shannon River in County Kerry, western Ireland (see Map).
1.02      The Borrower would be the ESB. The proposed loan amount of
US$20.0 million equivalent would cover about 95% of the estimated foreign
exchange requirements of the project. Its cost is estimated to be
US$28.1 million equivalent, which is about 9% of the ESB's capital
expenditure program for the period 1971/72 through 1975/76. This would
be the Bank's second loan for power to Ireland, the first one being
Loan 591-IRE (US$14.5 million) to the E5B in March 1969 to help finance
the 280 MW Turlough Hill Pumped Storage Project. Construction of that
Project is proceeding satisfaetorily.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission
composed of Messrs. J. Beach, S. S. Scales and E. Stichenwirth which
visited Ireland in July 1970.



II. THE BORROIER
Economic Background
2.01      The Republic of Ireland, about 27,000 sq mi in area, has a
population of 3 million and a population growth rate of about 0.4% per
year. Some 650,000 of the people live in Dublin, the capital and largest
city.  The recent progress of the economy has resulted in 4%  real growth
in GNP in 1969, accompanied by a rapid growth in the use of electricity
by industrial consumers (para. 2.02).  The industrial sector accounts for
one-third of total GDP and is responsible for 50% of total exports. In
1969 the principal industrial exports were metal ores, chemicals, clothing,
electrical machinery and equipment, beverages and tobacco. During the last
five years, the value of industrial exports has increased by nearly 130%,
or an average of 18% per year.
2.02      The Government's Third Program for Economic and Social Development,
1969-72, emphasizes the need for continued expansion of the industrial sec-
tor. A growth of 6.5% in real terms for this sector is expected to be
achieved during the plan period.
2.03      The electric power sector absorbs over 10% of the funds allocated
to the Public Capital Program. This high percentage is to ensure that the
ESB system expands rapidly enough to meet future demand for power. The
demand is expected to grow at not less than 10% per year, particularly
because of the emphasis being placed on industrial development. The per
capita consumption in Ireland of 1,370 kWh is among the lowest in Europe,
ranking Ireland above only four other European countries (Greece, Portugal,
Spain and Yugoslavia). Its consumption is only one-third that of the
United Kingdom.
Electricity Supply Board (ESB)
2.o4      The Electricity Supply Board was established in 1927 to re-
organize and regulate the generation, transmission and distribution of
electric power throughout the country. The ESB gradually acquired some
160 local undertakings engaged in the business of electricity supply, so
that today it is the sole agency providing public electricity supply in
Ireland. Its activities cover all aspects of electricity supply, from
construction of its own power stations to the sale of all types of elec-
trical appliances.  The ESB is one of Ireland's largest enterprises.  It
is the largest in terms of assets and revenue and second in the number of
employees (about 10,000), being surpassed only by the Government transport
company.
2.05      The ESB, a Government statutory body, is generally free of
governmental control except for the obligation to burn indigenous fuel
(paras. 2.07, 2.08 and 2.09), development of rural electrification
(para. 2.10), and approval of tariff changes and borrowing. The seven
members of the Board, including the full-time Chairman, are selected
from business and the professions. The Cabinet appoints them for



individual terms of up to five years; reappointments are customary, which
contributes to the Board's high degree of responsibility and continuity.
Until recently, the Chairman was the chief executive officer. He and the
Chief Engineer, Chief Accountant and Secretary formed an executive comaittee
that dealt with routine matters.
2.06      ESB's rapidly expanding operations influenced the Board to under-
take a reorganization to differentiate clearly between the policy-making
and operating functions. Consultants (Messrs. McKinsey of London) assisted
in this reorganization, which is now completed. Under the new organization,
the Chairman and the Board are concerned only with policy-making, establish-
ment of guidelines and objectives, and such vital areas as tariff changes,
fund-raising and senior executive appointments. Details of the ESP manage-
ment structure following the reorganization are in Annex 1.
Use of Peat
2.07      Two-thirds of Ireland's total peat production is consumed in the
ESB power stations (most of the remainder is sold as briquettes for domestic
and industrial uses). The production of commercial milled peat, briquettes
and other peat products is the function of the Peat Board, a Government
agency that started intensive development of the bogs some 19 years ago
with the goal of relieving the country's dependence on imported fuel. The
FESB supports the Peat Board's activities by buying peat at rates fixed by
it with Government approval. Although the peat-fired stations and the
associated bog development were all originally designed for 20 to 25 yearso
life, a recent survey indicated there is enough peat on the bogs to fuel
these stations until the late 1980s.
2.08      Peat costs more than twice as much as imported coal or oil.  In
1969/70 the fuel cost for plants burning peat averaged 0.78d/kWh while
that for oil-burning stations was only 0.31d/kWh. Moreover, the location
of the peat stations on the bogs involves heavy investments in transmission
to convey the output to the load centers. Since the weather determines to
a large extent the amount of peat that can be harvested, a good harvest
year for peat has the effect of increasing the ESB's generating costs;
this is because, regardless of the disparate cost of peat, the ESB has a
commitment to buy all peat that is delivered. But with the percentage of
total electricity generation supplied from peat declining rapidly -- from
an estimated 31% in 1970/71 to 18% in 1976/77 -- the problem is becoming
of less imprtance.
Puture of Peat Stations
2.09      Because supplies of peat will be available on the present scale
for another 15 years or more, the Board has had to decide whether to
maintain existing peat-fired stations for a very long period at heavy
expense or to install new and more efficient peat-fired plant. In con-
junction with the Government, the Board has decided to proceed with
installation of a second 40 MW generating unit at the Shannonbridge
station, using milled peat, for commissioning in 1974/75. Under the
eircumstances this decision is justified.  Preliminary site construction



- 4 -
work for the station has started. The ShannonbEidge extension together
with existing peat stations is expected to fully utilize the remaining
peat resources, hence no further investment in new peat stations is
contemplated.
Rural Electrification
2.10      In an effort to check migration from rural to urban areas and to
other countries, the Government in 1946 initiated a social program to improve
rural living conditions. The ESB was required to contribute to this program
by carrying out a country-wide rural electrification project. The Govern-
ment accepted liability for payment to the Board of a subsidy averaging 50%
of the capital outlay for the project. Though discontinued in 1955, un-
fortunately during the years of maximum expenditure, the subsidy was restored
in 1958 and increased to 75% in 1962. At the 75% level of subsidy, which
will continue until at least 1975, the ESB is able to recover its investment
in rural electrification. An estimated 90% of the rural areas have now been
served.
Tariffs
2.11      The Act that created the Board in 1927 stipulates that electricity
tariffs should be set at levels to produce revenues which, together with
revenues from other services, cover the following:
(a)  operation, maintenance, adninistration, taxes and similar
items properly chargeable to income
(b) depreciation
(c) interest chargeable to revenue, amortization of debt, and
allocation to the sinking fund reserve (see Chapter V)
(d)  sums that the Board considers proper to set aside for the
reserve fund, extensions and renewals.
Tariff increases are subject to approval by the Minister of Industry and
Commerce.
2.12      The provisions of the Act and the way they have been adiministered
have proved effective in adjusting tariffs so as to maintain the sound
financial position that has characterized the Board's operations. As in
Loan 591-IRE, the documents for the proposed loan include, as an event of
default, any change made in the Act of 1927 (and as subsequently amended)
that in the Bank's opinion would adversely affect the execution of the
project or the financial condition of the Board.
Accounting and Audits
2.13      The Act requires the Board to have its accounts audited annually
by a qualified auditor appointed by the Government. Kennedy, Crowley and
Company, Chartered Accountants of Ireland, has been the auditor for the
Board for several years, has given satisfactory service, and meets the



requirements of the Agreement for Loan 591-IRE with respect to the appoint-
ment of independent auditors. To ensure that these requirements are
continued, Government and Board have agreed to continue to appoint auditors
acceptable to the Bank.
Electricity Output and Sales
2.14      For the year ending March 31, 1970, the ESB Stations generated
5,242 GWh -- an increase* of 497 GWh over the previous year. The rise in
maximum demand was 7.4%. Electricity supplied by the system was as follows:
GWh Generated    Percentage
Hydro                                        594             11.3
Peat (sod)                                   543             10.3
Peat (milled)                              1,377             26.3
Coal (local)                                  92              1.8
Oil                                        2,636             50.3
Total                             5,242             100.0
Output from local fuel sources was 38.4% of the total. This high pro-
portion of generation from indigenous sources was due to the excellent
weather that prevailed during the year, resulting in higher than average
utilization of peat and reduced generation from hydro sources.
2.15      Sales increased by 10% over the previous year.  Increases by
categories are shown below.
1969/70   1968/69    Percentage
GWh       GWh       Increase
Industrial                         1,414      1,303          8.5
Domestic                            1,964     1,791          9.7
Commercial                         1 ,034       918         11.3
For further details of historic and forecast sales, see Annex 3.
2.16      The high growth rate in demand for electricity (10% in 1969/70,
12.4% in 1968/69 and 10.3% in 1967/68) reflects the greater use of electrical
appliances by cammercial consumers and the success of the Board's promotional
campaign directed at the domestic consumers with a view to developing the
cooking, water-heating and off-peak night storage heating loads. Industrial
growth in 1969/70 was lower than in previous years (Annex 3) but is expected
to recover as a result of the emphasis being placed on industrial develop-
ment by the Government.
Existing ESB Facilities
2.17      At the end of fiscal year 1970, thf  ESB generating capacity
amounted to 1,410 MW: 220 NW of hydro capacity, 407 MW in peat-fired steam
stations, and 783 MW of capacity in thermal stations fuelled by coal or
imported oil. Generating stations and load centers are interconnected by
means of an extensive 220 kV and 110 kV grid network. The transmission and
distribution systems are well built and maintained and the ESB uses the



- 6 -
latest in construction materials and techniques. In 1970, transmission and
distribution losses averaged 11% of units sent out from generating stations;
this is satisfactory. Annex 2 gives details of existing generating stations,
and the Map shows the 220 kV and 110 lcV transmission system as it is ex-
pected to be in 1976.
Interconnection with Northern Ireland
2.18      A basic agreement setting up the objectives and authorizing con-
struction of a two-circuit interconnection between the systemsiof the ESB
and the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Authority (NIJEA) was signed
in October 1967. In early 1970 the first 275 kV circuit of the inter-
connection, with a capacity of 300 lMW, was commissioned.  Construction of
the second circuit is under way and should be ready for operation in mid-1971.
2.19      This interconnection will bring considerable economic advantages
to both parties, the most notable being the reduction in reserve generating
plant to be held by each system with a consequent reduction in capital
investment. The reduction in reserve generating capacity requirements is
striking (see Annexes 5 and 6). Following the interconnection, both parties
have agreed to the joint planning of future generating plant requirements
of the combined system. Apportionment of the total required generating
plant between the individual systems is made so that equal risk of failure
to meet peak demand will exist in each system in the event the intercon-
necting tie becomes unavailable.
Future Expansion Program
2.20      Analysis of the various alternative plant installation programs
is discussed in paragraph 4.03. That which has been adopted by the ESB
in agreement with the NIJEA as the optimum program is given below (loca-
tions of the facilities are shown on the Nap).  Construction work has
started on all units preceding Shannonbridge, and Board approval has been
given to construction of the remaining facilities.

2.21      The program beyond 1977/78 is uncertain at this time, but the
ESB is seriously considering building a nuclear power station for com-
missioning in 1978/79.
2.22      The high voltage transmission system is being expanded by
installing single-circuit 220 kV transmission lines betwieen Tarbert and
Killonan and between Killonan and Dublin. The route of these circuits
and forecast commissioning dates are shown on the Map. This program is
adequate. The 110 kV transmission system will be expanded each year to
cover requirements, and there will continue to be a systematic expansion
of distribution facilities. Through 1970/71-1976/77, ESB's total invest-
ment is expected to be L186 million; the percentage for generation will be
33%, for transmission 16% and for distribution 51%.

III THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
3.01      The project proposed for Bank financing (Tarbert No.3)
would consist of a 250 MW extension to the Tarbert generating station,
situated on the Shannon River in western Ireland (see Nlap). The
station's existing plant comprises two recently commissioned 60 MW
oil-fired thermal units.
3.02      Tarbert No. 3 would consist of a single oil-fired generating
unit, tandem compound, operating at a pressure of 2,350 psi and tem-
perature of 1,0000 F with reheat at 550 psi, 1,0000 F. As in the case
of the existing units, the electrical and mechanical systems would
be arranged on the unit system basis. The generator would be linked
through a 300 IiVA unit transformer to a 220 kV outdoor switchyard.
Its output would be transmitted to the main system at Killonan over a
220 kV line which is to be constructed (para. 2.22).
3.03     Foundation conditions are excellent, hence foundation piling
would not be necessary. No ecological problems are anticipated.
Ample supplies of cooling water are available from the Shannon River;
as the volume required will be small in relation to the river flow,
marine life would be unaffected by the warm water discharge from the
turbine condensers. Also., though the station site is remote from
populated areas, the boiler stack would be tall enough (400 ft) to
ensure that waste boiler gases will be sufficiently dispersed to
maintain atmospheric contamination well below acceptable levels.
Status of Engineering and Procurement
3.04     Except for projects requiring specialized design experience
(such as the Turlough Hill Pumped Storage Project the Bank is helping
finance), the ESB staff normally undertakes all of the engineering
and design work for new projects. This will be the case in the pro-
posed project. The staff has considerable experience in designing
and supervising the construction of large thermal stations and there-
fore is capable of undertaking the work without consultants' help.
3.05     Bids for the boiler and turbo-alternator for Tarbert 3
which were invited in May and July 1970 respectively in accordance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines have been received and are
being evaluated. Looking to its future requirements, the ESB has
invited bids to cover not only the procurement of Tarbert No. 3
(the object of the proposed loan), but also for identical units for
Pigeon House 'B' at an existing site in Dublin, and Tarbert No. 4.
Alternative bids have been invited as follows:



- 9
(a) one 250 14W unit at Tarbert
(b) one 250 MW unit at Pigeon iouse 'B'
(c) one 250 M1W unit at Tarbert and one 250 1IW unit at
Pigeon House 'B? to be ordered simultaneously
(d) one 250 14W unit at Tarbert with option of purchasing a
second unit within two years
(e)  two 250 MW units at Tarbert and one 250 1W unit at
Pigeon House 'B' to be ordered simultaneously
(f)  one 250 NW unit at Tarbert and one 250 NjiW unit at Pigeon
*lHouse 'B' to be ordered simultaneously, with option of pur-
chasing a second 250 14W unit at Tarbert within two years.
3.06      The ESB believes, with some justification, that it can expect
to gain financial advantage by placing definite orders for more than one
unit at the same time. Even though the first units at Tarbert and Pigeon
House 'B' may be ordered together, construction of the latter would be
phased one year behind Tarbert in accordance with estimated system require-
ments (see Annexes 5 and 6). The ESB has declared its intention to re-
quest the Bank to help finance the PigeonHouse 'B' unit early in fiscal
year 1972. The ESB will likely decide to order the two units simultaneous-
ly, as this would be sensible should the price be attractive. It would
then probably request Bank financing for the second unit, which would
have been procured after international competitive bidding, but the
ESB of necessity would have entered into a supply contract before the
Executive Directors could consider a further loan. ESB's action would
have been similar, though different in form, to exercising an option to
purchase equipment at a price obtained after international competitive
bidding. The idea of Bank financing of equipment under option provisions
0          was accepted recently in the case of Thailand (South Bangkok Unit No. 4),
although in that instance the option will not be exercised until the
Executive Directors have approved the loan.    It has been emphasized
to the ESB, and the ESB understands, that the Bank is not making any
commitment at this time, moral or otherwise, to finance the Pigeon
House 'B' Project in fiscal 1972.
3.07     Bidding documentation for other plant and works required for
the project are under preparation.



* 10 -
*onstruction Schedule
3.08      The Tarbert site is excellent from the viewpoint of construction,
as no site preparation of any magnitude is needed. Consequently, with the
long lead time required between placing of orders for major plant and
arrival at site of the main components, the site work would not commence
until about mid-1972 and the schedule of disbursements (Annex 4) allows
for this. The construction provides for full commercial operation of
Tarbert No. 3 in October 1975. This is reasonable.
Cost Estimates
3.09      The cost estimates for the project were prepared by the ESB.
Civil works costs are based on unit prices for similar works being carried
out for the 120 MW extensions at Pigeon House'B' and Great Island generating
0           stations. Major equipment cost is based on recently received bids for
boiler and turbo-generator plant. A price contingency allowance of 10%
has been included for both equipment and civil works especially with a view
towards the price escalation clause included in the bids for equipment.
The overall cost would be about US$112/kW installed which is attractive.
The fact that a number of common facilities are already at the project
site -- e.g., basic fuel handling and cooling water equipment, water
treatment plant, station offices and access roads -- contributes to this
quite low unit cost.

Disbursements
3.10      The proposed US$20.0 million loan would cover the actual
foreign exchange cost of generating plant and associated equipment for
which contracts would be placed after international competitive bidding.
The main civil works (including the turbine house and boiler house
foundations, plant foundations, structural steel work and cladding) are
corventional in nature. These works, which would be undertaken by
competent Irish contractors, would not be put out to international
comipetitive bidding and would not be financed by the loan.
3.11      The turbo-generator and boiler specifications request that
tenders allow for such items as stairways, galleries, tanks,boiler and
turbine structures to be manufactured in Ireland as sub-contracts to
the main contract. Tenders include alternative prices for the import
of equivalent items. In deciding whether equipment should be wTholly
_imported or manufactured locally, the ESB may at its discretion apply
0          a preference not exceeding 15% or the prevailing duty, wlhichever is less,
to the cost of locally manufactured goods. An analysis of the above
items which could be manufactured in Ireland suggests that about 70% of
the orders for such equipment with an aggregate value of about 1900,000
are likely to be awarded to Irish sub-contractors. For orders placed
with Irish manufacturers, disbursements would be made from the loan
account for 70% of expenditures in local currency   representing the
foreign exchange component of such orders subject to a maximum sum of
US$2 million equivalent.
3.12      The loan would represent about 71% of the estimated project
cost and would cover about 95% of the total foreign exchange requirements.
Expenditures prior to signing of the Loan Agreement would not be eligible
for reimbursement. Should the project be completed for less than the
estimated cost, any undisbursed amount of the loan would be cancelled
unless there were good grounds for applying savings to related works.
3.13      It is estimated that the loan would be disbursed according
to the schedule in Annex 4.

IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE P1)OJ2CT
Load Forecasts
4.01      For planning purposes, ESB's generation development reports of
1963 and 1967 adopted an annual growth rate of 9% for units generated.
The substantially increased growth rate for the past two years, however,
indicate6 that 9% is too low. Therefore, for assessing load growth for
the decade ending in 1979/80, the 1970 generation development report has
adopted an annual growth rate of 10% (see Annexes 5 and 6). Analysis of
the annual growth rate over successive five-year periods since 1957-1962
revealed a steady upward trend ranging from 8.2% in that first period to
10.6% in the 1965-1970 period.
4.02      In view of the substantial increases in sales in the past three
years (10.3% for 1967/68, 12.4% for 1968/69 and 10% for 1969/70), there
is every indication that the higher level of growth will continue.  In
fact, recent growth in industrial sales and continuing enquiries from
industrial consumers concerning future power requirements indicate that
the assumed 10% growth rate may be too low. However, the growth rate
and accumulated error are both reviewed annually and planning targets
adjusted if necessary.
Evaluation of the ESB Plant Installation Program Against Alternatives
4.03      Following a determination by the FSB and NIJEA of the amount
of generating capacity required in their respective systems for the
period through 1977/78 (see Annex 6), a number of alternative plant
Installation programs were considered by the ESB that involve generating
units of various sizes and the consideration of advantages to be gained
by using existing sites rather than developing new ones. After a cost
analysis of the various alternative programs, the one selected (see
para. 2.20) represents the least-cost solution on a present worth basis
using discount rates in the range of 8-12%. The proposed project -- a
single-unit 250 MW extension to the generating facilities at Tarbert
thermal power station -- is the first major generating facility to be
constructed as part of the program approved by the Board in 1970.
Estimated Internal Financial Rate of Return
4.04      Tarbert No. 3's generating capacity is necessary to meet market
conditions expected at about the time the unit would come into service
at the generation security standard set by the ESB and NIJEA.
4.05      The internal financial rate of return for Tarbert No. 3 is the
discount rate at which the present worth of the facility's cost, in-
cluding operating charges but excluding taxes and depreciation,is equal
to the present worth of the benefits to be obtained over the life of the
project. Capital charges include the cost of the facility and the es-
timated cost of the attributable transmission and distribution facilities
required to transmit and distribute the power generated by Tarbert No. 3
to the ultimate consumer. Until the new unit's full output can be



- 13 -
apportioned to new sales, the benefits include cost savings realized from
the initial displacement of less efficient generating plant. Thereafter,
the benefits are valued at prevailing rates for the sale of power,
estimated to average 2.17d/kWh in 1975/76 and 2.14d/kWh thereafter.
h.o6      On this basis, a rate of return of 28% is indicated (see Annex
7). This comparatively high internal financial rate of return reflects
the low investment cost of the new oil-fired facility and the fact that
it will be more efficient than existing thermal capacity, a large pro-
portion of which is comprised of peat-burning stations that have rela-
tively high fuel expenses for operation.

V. F2NANCIAL ASPECTS
Past and Present Financial Position
5.01      ESB's finances are sound. This is made possible by the stipulations
of the Act (para.2.11) and the way they are applied. The Act enables the
Board to set tariffs at levels which produce revenues sufficient to cover
all costs, including debt service and provisions for extension and renewals.
5.02      Average revenue per kWh rose from 1.98d per kWh in 1967 to 2.14d
per kWh in 1970, as the result of tariff increases in November 1968 and
January 1970 of 7% each. Since higher consumption per customer leads to
sales in lower priced tariff categories, the average revenue per kWh in-
creased by only 2% to 4% per year during the past four years, a trend
which has been assumed also to prevail in the future.
5.03      In the past, operating and administrative expenses have reflected
the trends in costs of materials, labor and other items and are reasonable
considering ESB's operations, which comprise generation, transmission and
distribution of electric energy. Fuel prices increased in fiscal year
1968 by about 21 .3/ton for oil because of the Suez surcharge, and by a
further LO.8/ton due to the devaluation of the Irish pound in November
1967. Both these charges increased the oil price from about B3 to h5 per
ton. These oil price increases were offset to a large extent in 1968 by
favorable hydro conditions, but in fiscal year 1969 resulted in a sharp
rise in fuel costs which were offset by the 1968 tariff increase. The
operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) was 80%
in fiscal year 1970 and is expected to improve gradually to 70% in 1977
(see Annex 9). This ratio, being relatively unfavorable even for a pre-
dominantly thermal system, reflects the burden that the cost of peat is
imposing on the ESB operations (para. 2.08). However, a gradual improvement
can be expected from the installation of the additional oil-fired plants,
whose fuel cost is considerably lower (see Annex 8).
5.04      ESB's depreciation policy and procedures result in an annual
average depreciation rate on a straighti4ine basis of about 3.7%, which is
satisfactory for reflecting the average useful lives of ESB assets and for
creating internal funds for renewals. The actual method of calculation is
described in Annex 9.
5.05      By law, the ESB is liable to taxation on income.  In assessing
its impact, ESB is authorized to charge accelerated depreciation against
taxable profit in addition to the normal depreciation. The accelerated
depreciation is calculated on the basis of new assets; since the Board's
heavy investment program is estimated also to prevail in the future,
accelerated depreciation, in fact, relieves the Board from paying income
tax during the forecast period.

5.06      ESB's capitalization at the end of fiscal year 1970 was as follows:
millions of h      %
Equity                                                   38.6         22%

Other Long Term Debt                                   22.7         13%
Total Long Term Debt                                   140.4         78%
Total Capitalization                                    179.0        100%
5.07      The equity consists of reserves built up from retained earnings,
and of nonrepayable Government financing of rural electrification. Govern-
ment repayable advances were made prior to 1954 under the Act and its amend-
ments and consist of 50 year loans at annual interest presently averaging
about 4.5%. At that time, the Government was essentially the only source
of borrowings for the Board. The Act Amencnent of 1954 authorized the ESB
to borrow money by issuing Redeemable Stock, essentially 19 to 25-year
sinking fund debentures, and other types of securities, subject to prior
approval of the Minister of Finance (para. 2.05). Since then the Board
has borrowed about 169 million from the local market in issues at interest
rates between 5% and 9.5%. In addition to Loan 591-IRE for the Turlough
Hill Pumped Storage Project, two foreign loans with an aggregate nominal
amount of 114.1 million equivalent, for a 15-year term including a grace
period of 5 years and interest at 6-3/4% per annum were contracted re-
centlzy. ESB's long term debt also includes a 6%, h500.000 loan from New
Ireland Assurance Company Ltd., and three suppliers' credits totalling
h7.8 million over 7 to 10 years and at interest rates between 5-3/8% and 6.6%.
5.08      The terms of ESB's redeemable stock (34% of the capitalization)
require that certain fixed annual sums be set aside from revenues and allo-
cated to a sinking fund reserve. This reserve is a pool out of which pay-
ments for amortization, purchase of sinking fund investments and early
repayments (cancellation) are being made.
5.09      Sinking fund requirements need a careful calculation in order to
keep tariffs at appropriate levels, because they are one of the "expenses"
to be covered by revenues. Loan 591-IRE therefore required that charges
should be made each year sufficient to ensure full repayment of all issues
of the Borrower's redeemable stock, created after 1958, by their latest
redemption dates. Because of the present tight money situation in Ireland,
however, the Board issued in early 1970 and recently medium-term stock of
about E3.2 million and about E3.5 million, the terms of which do not pro-
vide the funds for total amortization by the latest redemption date. The
Bank, aware of the present difficulty in raising sufficient long-term capital,
waived this stipulation in both cases, and subsequently agreed during negotia-
tions that the Borrower may issue in future stock of 15 years or less if it
provides for at least 15-years sinking fund allocations for any such issue;
the outstanding amount of such stock should not exceed 20% of the total
outstanding debt in any given year, otherwise the Board would have to consult
with the Bank prior to a new issue. For long-term issues (more than 15 years)
sinking fund allocations have to be sufficient for repayment by the latest
redemption date.



- 16 -
5.10      In fiscal year 1970, the value of current assets is about 2.1
times the value of current liabilities. This current ratio includes an in-
creased amount for accounts receivable that is due to a prolonged strike
of ESB administrative staff, causing delays in bill collection and recording.
Current assets further include temporary cash investments arising from the
fact that the ESB normally raises the major portion of its loan funds toward
the end of the fiscal year and invests money not immediately needed in short-
term Government bonds.
Financing of the Project
5.11      The Project would be financed by the proposed Bank loan (71%) and
by local borrowing and intemnal sources (29%). rThe proposed Bank loan would
not finance interest payments during the construction period of the Project.
Future Financial Position
5.12      Annex 10 shows the detailed financing plan of the ESB for the
years 1971 through 1977. A condensed version for the estimated project

5.13      The financial projections for the E3B were prepared on the basis
of current prices, with no allowance for possible future changes of price
levels. This is appropriate as the Board is able to adjust tariffs quickly
in response to changing conditions.
5.14      The projected revenues from sales take into account the 6% tariff
increase of January 1971, and are based on an estimated 10% annual increase
of units sold. It is estimated that the larger part of this increase will
be in the lower-priced brackets of the tariff, so that the growth of
revenues is only around 8% per year, and the average revenues are expected
to decrease from 2.29d/kWh in 1972 to 2.14d/kWh in 1977 (in 1971 tariff
increase in effect only for 3 months).
5.15      Although the ESB in the past has had access to finances on reason-
able terms in local capital markets, conditions have become less favorable
recently, hence the Board will find further borrowing on a larger scale
somewhat more difficult. The future issues of redeemable stock are there-
fore estimated not to exceed 1l1 million per year for long and medium-term
issues during the forecast period. The proposed Bank loan of US$20.0 million
equivalent at 17-year term including a five-year grace period would put
the financing plan on a sound basis.  The remaining requirements of the
projected period for funds are expected to be covered by Loan 591-IRE
(15.5 million), an assumed foreign exchange loan for PigeonHouse 'B'
(18.3 million), Government subsidies for rural electrification (B12.6
million), consumer contributions (11 .4 million) and future loans
(Fs13.3 million).
5.16      The Board's financial prospects are satisfactory.  The forecast
ratio of current assets to current liabilities would average a satisfactory
level of 2.4 throughout the period under review. The ratio of long-term
debt to total capitalization was 78% at the end of fiscal year 1970, and
is expected to decrease gradually to 58% in 1977, as retained earnings
increase.  These debt levels are satisfactory and reflect the long-standing
policy of financing expansion principally by debt, which is acceptable in
the stable circumstances in which ESB operates wherein revenues can be
adjusted readily to requirements. Total interest would be covered between
1.3 and 2.3 times by operating income, and the debt service co-verage by
internal sources averages 1.6 during the forecast period.
5.17      The projections show a rate of return on net fixed assets in
operation of 8.0% in fiscal year 1971, gradually increasing to 10.5% in
IS            fiscal year 1977.  Revenues are such as to produce internal funds sufficient
to finance about 45% of requirements during the project construction period,
which is adequate.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations in January 1971, the following agreements
were reached:
(a) the Government will continue to appoint qualified
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.13).
(b) the loan documents will include as an event of default
any change made in the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927
as amended which in the opinion of the Bank adversely
affects the carrying out of the Project or the financial
condition of the Board (para. 2.12).
(c)  the Electricity Supply Board agreed:
(i) to make adequate sinking fund provisions
for the repayment of stock issues, created
by it after 1958, by the latest applicable
redemption dates, except that for any stock
issue of fifteen years or less, the latest
redemption date for the purpose of sinking
funds will be a date not more than fifteen
years from the date of issue;
(ii) the total of stock issues of fifteen years
or less shall not exceed 20% of the total
borrowings outstanding in any given year
without prior consultation with the Bank
(para. 5.09).

* ESSIR - Equal Separate, Standard Interconnected Risk. The criterion of equitable division
of total plant between Northern Ireland and E.S.B. Systems (see paragraph 2.19)
The surplus/deficit figures refer to the extent to which the separate or combined systems
are able to meet peak demands with the accepted generation security standard and for
all probable plant outages.

Determination of Required Generating
Capacity and Size of UiI-ts to be Installed
Generation Security Standard
The ESB's generation security standard and that of the
NIJEA are based on a risk of failure to meet demand once in fifteen
years. This means that in the long run, once in every fifteen years
there will be insufficient plant capacity available to meet the daily
peak even when all the spinning reserve has been utilized. Load
restriction is, therefore, inescapable on that day. Since the
capacity of a generating unit could form an appreciable proportion
of the total system it is not possible to maintain a constant risk
level from year to year and in the case of the ESB3 and the NIJEA the
security risk averaged over a five year period is expected to meet
the standard. For comparison the security standard adopted by some
other countries are shown below:
Failure Risk
Country                 1 Day in
Norway                    10 yrs.
France                   1  yrs.
Ireland                   15 yrs.
Spain, Portugal           20 yrs.
Sweden                    30 yrs.
Great Britain             33 yrs. - after voltage and
frequency reduction
Belgiurr                 100 yrs.
Netherlands              300 yrs.
Generating Set Forced Outage
A method involving probability is used to assess whether
a given plant program will meet the generation security standard
adopted. In order to make this assessment a forced outage figure
must be assigned to each generating unit. This figure represents
the likelihood of that particular set being unavailable to meet peak
demand on a particular day for which the trial is being made. Care-
ful records of plant outage are kept and, as a result, future forced
outages of existing plant can be estimated with some confidence. For
the larger 120 1TW and 250 7"  sets of which ESB has no direct experienc
it draws on the experience of electricity authorities in Britain,
France, Germany and the U.S.
Determination of Required Generating Capacity
Until 1961, the total capacity needed in the ESB system
was determined by the amount of thermal plant capacity needed to
supply back-up energy for the hydro and peat-fueled plants, both of
November o, 1970



AMTEX 6

which are weather dependent. Thermal capacity sufficient for this pur-
pose inherently provided enough capacity to meet peak power demands.
After 1961, as the proportion of hydro and peat-fueled stations de-
clined, system peak demand became the determining criterion. Since
1964 the System Operations Department (see Annex 1) has had the exclu-
sive use of a computer for construction and generation programming,
and other engineering studies. The availability of thzis machine has
led the ESB to develop advanced procedures in the planning of its
generation construction programs.
The method used for programming construction of generating
capacity for the joint systems of the ESB and the NIJEA involves a
demand forecast using as input the 100 growth in generation (kWh) and
the historical relationship between the annual generation and the 50
highest peaks occurring during the same year. Generating plant is
then fitted to the demand curve using the historical outage data,
refered to above, until a system is developed which has, on the average,
a probability of failure to meet peak demand on not more than one day
in 15 years.
Apportionment of the total required generating plant between
the systems of the ESB and the NIJ$A is made in such a manner that,
should the interconnecting tie between the systems become unavailable,
equal risk of failure to meet peak shall exist in the separate systems
Size of Unit to be Installed
Large generating units are attractive because of their lower
unit capital cost and also because of their lower unit operating costs.
The ESB has estimated that to install one 250 ]1W unit at Tarbert in-
stead of two smaller units will result in a capital saving of B700,000
and a 2% saving in annual fuel costs.  The 250 P1W capacity of Tarbert
3 will represent only about 7% of interconnected system capacity
which is very conservative indeed.   A more normal figure would be in
the region of 10-15%. The change to larger size generating units is
clearly in the ESB's interests.

Internal Financial Rate of Return
The method followed to determine the internal financial rate
of return on the project consists of discounting the net cost/benefit
stream attributable to the project to find the rate at which the
present value of the stream becomes zero. In the calculation, the
following elements have been taken into consideration:
Costs
(i) capital investments, net of all duties, taxes and
depreciation, in the project and associated transmission
and distribution facilities necessary to convey the energy
produced by the project to ultimate consumers.
(ii) operating and maintenance costs for the project and for
the associated transmission and distribution system.
(iii) the cost of fuel used by the project. It was assumed that
the project would be base-loaded as soon as commissioned
(80% plant factor) and would so remain for the first four
years of its life. Thereafter, because of the introduction
of other even more efficient generating facilities, plant
factors of 75% and 65% have been assumed for the periods
1980-91 and 1992-2001 respectively. It was also assumed
that the unit heat rate and therefore the cost of fuel
per unit generated would increase by 10% during each of the
two aforementioned periods due to a reduction in thermal
efficiency.
Benefits
(i)  fuel savings in 1975/76 and 1976/77.  These were determined
from a reduction of units generated at less efficient
thermal stations at prevailing unit fuel costs (see Annex 8).
After 1976/77 all units generated were assumed to represent
new sales (after deducting units used in auxiliaries and
losses in the transmission and distribution system).
(ii) revenues on sales, attributable to the project, calculated
at tariffs expected to be realized at the time the facility
is commissioned (2.17d/kwdh in 1975/76 and 2.14d/kWh there-
after).
The cost/benefit stream is shown on page 2. The equalizing
discount rate is approximately 28%. This comparatively high internal
financial rate of return reflects the louz investment costs of the new
oil-fired facility and the fact that it will be more efficient than
existing thermal capacity, a large proportion of which are peat burn-
irng stations which have relatively high fuel expenses for operation.

Depreciation
The method used by ESB for computing depreciation charges is
based on the concept that the original cost of assets is regarded as the
value of an investment to be recovered by charging depreciation on the
basis of an annual fixed sum which, if invested at a theoretical 2.5%
interest, would produce the original cost by the end of the assumed life
of the asset.  The annual depreciation charge therefore consists of two
elements, an annual fixed charge, and a sum representing the interest
deemed to have been earned. Compared to the equal annual charges produced
by the straight line method the sum of the two elements commences with a
lower charge during the early life of an asset and gradually increases
,         throughout its lifetime.
It is furthermore the Board's practice to continue depreciation
contributions on assets which remain in service after the expiration of
their hypothetical lives which it is reasonable to consider as a contri-
bution towards obsolescense and an offset to assets retired before the
due date.
