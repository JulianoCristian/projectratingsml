A single oil-fired generating unit would be\n            connected to the main 220 KV grid system by a 65 km\n            transmission line. ESB has considerable experience in\n            designing and supervising the construction of large thermal\n            stations and is able to perform these functions without the\n            assistance of consultants. The project is technically sound\n            and represents the least-cost solution of a number of\n            alternative sites considered. The internal financial rate of\n            return on the investment for the project would be 28\n            percent. This comparatively high rate of return reflects the\n            low investment cost per KW of the new oil-fired facility and\n            its higher efficiency as compared to the existing thermal capacity."}, "docdt": "1971-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
