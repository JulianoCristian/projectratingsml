INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BOARD
WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF IRELAND
February 10, 1971



REPORT AND RECOTAv1EIDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CG A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BOARD FOR
THE SECOND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$20 million to the
Electricity Supply Board (ESB) in Ireland.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's second loan to ESB and
also to Ireland.  The first loan (591-IRE) of US$lh.5 million was made
in March 1969 to help finance the Turlough Hill Pumped Storage Project.
Performance under this loan has been satisfactory and there are no out-
standing problems.
3.        In 1970 the Government of Ireland, on behalf of ESB, requested
further Bank financial assistance to enable ESB to meet the rapidly
expanding demand for power. The proposed loan should help ESB to
achieve its development plans in spite of the prevailing difficulty
of raising the necessary long term capital in the domestic or external
markets.
4.        This second power project, a 250 MNe oil-fired thermal unit,
is an extension to the existing generating facilities at Tarbert; it
was appraised in July 1970 and was found to be satisfactory. Nego-
tiations with ESB and the Irish Government took place in Washington
in January 1971. The negotiators for the Borrowers were led by
Mr. L. J. Barry, Director (Finance) of ESB; the negotiators for the
Guarantor were led by Mr. Sean Murray, Assistant Secretary, Department
of Finance.
5.        The following is a summary statement of the Bank loans to
Ireland as of January 31, 1971:

6.        The Bank is considering one other loan for Ireland in FY 1971.
This would be to the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, a development
finance company, for which a loan uf US$10 million will be proposed for
relending to Irish industry. The negotiations also took place in January
and the loan is expected to be ready for consideration by the Executive
Directcrs during FY 1971.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE. PROPOSED LOAN
7.        Borrower:                Electricity Supply Board
Guarantor:               Ireland
Amount:                  The equivalent in various currencies of
US$20 million
Purpose:                 To assist in the financing of the supply
and installation of a single 250 1'J oil-
fired generating unit and associated
equipment
Amortization:             In 17 years, including a five-year period
of grace, through semi-annual installments
beginning June 15, 1976 and ending
December 15, 1987.
Interest Rate:           7-1/'4 percent
Commitment Charge:       3/4 of 1 percent
Estimated Internal
Financial Return on
the Project:             28 percent
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Ireland - Appraisal of the Second
Power Project (Tarbert No. 3)" (PU-56a) on the proposed project is attached
(No. 1).
9.        The electric power system in Ireland has been expanding at a rate
of about 9 percent over the past decade with a higher average grewth rate
of 10.5 percent in the last five years. Consumption is expected to continue
to grow at 10 percent per year over the next several years, particularly due
to the emphasis now being placed on industrial development. To meet this
projected increase in demand ESB is undertaking an extensive expansion
program in the 1970's. The proposed project is the first major generating
facility to be constructed as part of this program.



10.       ESB is an autonomous statutory corporation which generates and
sells all central station power used in Ireland. Since its establishment
in 1927 the Board has progressively expanded and has become one of the
largest enterprises in the country.   It is a well established institution
wxith a competent management and efficient staff. A reorganization of its
management structure, completed recently, now differentiates more clearly
between the policy-making and operating functions. The legislation estab-
lishing ESB provides that revenues should be sufficient to meet all finan-
cial requirements including depreciation, annual debt service and adequate
appropriations to reserves for extension and renewal. ESB financial situa-
tion is generally satisfactory and internally generated funds will finance
about 45 percent of its total capital requirements during the estimated
project construction period.
11.       The proposed project is an essential part of the program to increase
generating capacity to meet anticipated lead growth and at the same time to
take advantage of the economies of scale afforded by larger-sized generating
units. The program has been formulated in collaboration with the Northern
Ireland Joint Electricity Authority (NIJEA), responsible for the coordination
of all power operations in Northern Ireland, and has been designed to promote
the most economical use of the generating capacity of the two interconnected
systems, consistent with acceptable service standards.
12.       The proposed project consists of a 250 IvAF extension to the Tarbert
generating station which is situated at the mouth of the Shannon River in
Wlestern Ireland. A single oil-fired generating unit would be connected to
the main 220 KV grid system by a 65 km transmission line. ESB has consider-
able experience in designing and supervising the construction of large thermal
stations and is able to perform these functions without the assistance of
consultants. The project is technically sound and represents the least-cost
solution of a number of alternative sites considered. The internal financial
rate of return on the investment for the project would be 28 percent.   This
comparatively high rate of return reflects the low investment cost per K,J
of the new oil-fired facility and its higher efficiency as compared to the
existing thermal capacity.
13.       The cost of the project would be $28 million equivalent of which
the foreign exchange component would be $21 million equivalent. Thus the
proposed loan would cover about 71 percent of the total cost of the project
and 95 percent of its foreign exchange cost. The remaining 5 percent repre-
sentsthe foreign exchange component of the civil works which will not be
submitted for international competitive bidding and therefore will not be
financed from the proceeds of the Bank lzan. The proposed project would
represent about 9 percent of the cost of the ESB's investment during the
project construction period. ESB's present plan to finance its total
investment program for the period 1970/71-1976/77 envisages that about
four-fifths will be covered by ESB's own resources, borrowing on the
domestic market and other domestic contributions. The balance is expected
to be financed by borrowings in external markets.   Projected earnings of the



Board over this period would gradually increase the rate of return on net
fixed assets in operation from 7.0 in fiscal year 1969/70 to 10.5 in fiscal
year 1976/77. Total interest on debt would be covered on the average 2.0
times by operating income. The debt service coverage by internal sources
will average 1.7.
14.       ESB has been experiencing considerable difficulty in raising suffi-
cient long-term money on the Irish capital market. It is therefore likely
that ESB will again be forced as already twice in the past to depend partially
on medium-term issues. The proposed loan agreement anticipates this possi-
bility and provides that for any issue of redeemable stock of fifteen years
or less the sinking fund provision will be made on a fifteen year basis.
In the unlikely event that these medium-term stock issues should in total
exceed 20 percent of the total amount borrowed and outstanding, the Bank
would be consulted before any further issue were made.
15.       Procurement for all major plant and equipment is being carried
out on the basis of international competitive bidding. The generator and
boiler specifications allow for the manufacture of certain specified items
in Ireland as sub-contracts to the main contract. Tenders would include
alternative prices for the import of equivalent items. In deciding whether
these items should be wholly imported or manufactured locally, the ESB may
apply a preference equivalent to the protective tariff or 15 percent, which-
ever is lower, to the locally manufactured goods. For contracts placed
locally 70 percent of the expenditure in local currency, estimated to
represent the foreign exchange expenditures of these contracts, will be
disbursed up to a maximum of US$2 million equivalent. Retroactive finan-
cing is not proposed and any surplus funds remaining in the loan account
would be cancelled unless there were good grounds for applying savings
to related works.
16.       ESB has informed the Bank that in the course of execution of
its long-term investment program it will, in due course, request further
Bank financing for a similar 250 MWJ power plant at Pigeon House B near
Dublin. In this connection ESB is likely to gain financial advantage
by placing definite orders for more than one unit at the same time.
ESB therefore, with the Bank's concurrence, invited bids last summer
under international competitive bidding, allowing several options
including the simultaneous ordering of identical generating units for
both plants. The Executive Directors have been informed through the
Monthly Operational Summary of the possibility of ESB entering into
a supply contract for Pigeon House B before the Executive Directors
could consider a further loan for this project. Although this form
of procurement procedure has been accepted by the Bank as being
advantageous for ESB, it does not commit the Bank in any way to
finance the Pigeon House B Project.



PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMITS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The Draft Loan Agreement betTveen the Bank and the Electricity
Supply Board, the Draft Guarantee Agreement between Ireland and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The provisions of the loan and guarantee agreements follow the
usual pattern in projects of this kind. As the Electricity Supply Act 1927
provides adequately for the rates to be charged by ESB, the rate covenant
is based on this legislation rather than a requirement to earn a specific
rate of return (Sections 5.04 and 8.02 of the Loan Agreement).
PART V - ECONOIff
19.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ireland" (EMA-2), and an updating memorandum (EITQ.-23a), were distributed
to the Executive Directors on December 13, 1968 and on July 27, 1970, res-
pectively. A basic data sheet is annexed.
20.       After the adoption in 1958 of the First Program of Economic Expan-
sion and of outward-looking economic policies the Irish economy showed a
satisfactory grow]th performance.  These policies are based on industrial
development geared to export markets and a system of grants and tax incen-
tives to attract foreign enterprises. The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement
signed in 1965 provides for free trade with the United Kingdom by 1975. The
Government has also applied for full membership of the EEC. Domestically,
the Government has been implementing a policy of modernization and reorgani-
zation of Irish industry to increase its competitiveness in the enlarged
market which may emerge.
21.       Since 1958 Ireland's GNP in real terms has grown at an average
annual rate of about 4 percent. Industrial output has been increasing by
6-7 percent each year and industrial exports by nearly 18 percent per year.
Investment has been rising rapidly and its ratio to GNP increased from
13 percent in 1958 to 22 percent in 1970.   Unemployment and emigration
have been falling. Since the early sixties the population has ceased to
decline.
22.       Fluctuations during the process of expansion have created balance
of payments problems. A restrictive credit and budgetary policy restored
external equilibrium following the inflationary pressures of the mid-60's.
With relaxation of the policy in 1966 the economy regained momentum. The
rising level of economic activity generated again an upward pressure on
wages and prices and an increase in the balance of payments deficit on
current account from $53 million in 1968 to $166 million in 1969. Credit
restrictions uaere again imposed and the deficit in 1970 is expected to
be reduced to around $120 million. The Government has recently announced



wage and price controls as -ell as tax increases and expenditure reduction
in a supplementary budget. The full impact of these measures cannot be
gauged at present. They do, however, indicate that the Government is firmly
committed to reestablishing economic stability in the interests of long-term
growth.
23.       The demand for foreign investment capital will remain high despite
substantial efforts to raise domestic savings. Betveen 1960 and 1970 gross
national savings increased from 16 percent to an estimated 20 percent of MJP.
Future gross borroving requirements are likely to average about $220 million
a year. The total outstanding external public debt was $272 million on Sep-
tember 30, 1969 and the debt service in 1970 is expected to be about a percent
of exports of goods and services.  The debt service ratio in 1976 would be
about 5 percent. Ireland has an excellent debt service record and is credit-
worthy for Bank loans.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WiITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEiMIT
24.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOi.M11DATION
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.
