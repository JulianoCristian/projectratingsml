BANQUE NATIONALE POUR IE DEVELOPPEMNT ECONOMIQUE (ENDE)
SUMMARY
i.        This report brings up to dato thQ situ.tion and prospects of BNDE,
uhich uorc described in detail las-t year, in report No. DB-41a, uhich mas
presented to the Executive Directors (R68-197) on October 18, 1968.
ii.       BNDE's direct lending operations continued to increase, and
during 1969, total loan commitments are expected to reach a new high of
DH 66 million. BNDE is the main long-term lending institution to industry,
and there are few new Moroccan enterprises which have not been assisted by
it. BNDE also continues to play an active promotional role with respect
to new industries. BNDE was reluctant to make new equity investments in
the past two years, partly as a result of some large equity commitments, in
earlier years, which did not turn out well, but it is now overcoming this
reluctance and intends to play a more active role as an equity investor.
iii.      BNDE's loan portfolio has improved as a result of the good
earnings shown by textile manufacturers following two successive good har-
vests and their increasing experlence in the industry. Also, BNDE's textile
exposure has diminished. BNDE's arrears situation continues to be good
and the hard-core risks in ENDE's portfolio appear adequately covered by
reserves.
iv.       With respect to profitability, the reduction in share capital,
effected in 1968, has improved leverage and BNDE's profits have increased
both in absolute terms and as a percentage of share capital. The dividend
rate has been increased to 6% which is still too low, however, to permit
substantial sales of BNDE's existing shares above par, to private Moroccan
investors. The rate of return on capital employed, which was 5.2% in 1968
continues to be low, due to the low level of interest rates. These low
rates are causing concern since they may be encouraging uneconomic invest-
ments. Arrangements have therefore been made with BNDE during loan
negotiations to apply stricter return criteria for approving new projects.
v.        Decision-making at Board level has improved with the constitution
of an Executive Committee of the Board in May 1968. BNDE's General Manager
has no deputy and he, therefore, has to concern himself both with questions
of external relations and general policies as well as problems of internal
coordination and administration. As a result, internal coordination is
suffering. BNDE's Director General is much aware of the need for a deputy
and has indicated during negotiations that an appointment will be made by
August 1970. A foreign advisor was engaged early in 1969 but resigned
after a few months. There is still need for advice, but it is now less
general and is focused on specific aspects of project appraisal.
vi.       Appraisals and follow-up have improved although there are still
weaknesses, particularly with respect to the economic merit and marketing
aspects of appraisal work. Staff has been strengthened during the year and
has the potential to make a valuable contribution to BNDE's work if
internal coordination problems are resolved.



vii.      The present Bank loan is close to being fully committed.
WB.ioln. the process of negotiating  for an AID loan of $ 3.0 million
equivaleat, half of which is usable for local currency expenditures. BNDE
is looking to the Bank for the balance of its needs. It is a suitable bor-
rower. Given the Bank's heavy exposure in BNDE and the resulting need to
encourage BNDE's search for other resources, as well as to give impetus to
further organizational improvement at ENDE, a loan of $15 million is recom-
mended to cover needs for about 15 months instead of a longer period.
viii.     The features of the proposed loan should be those normally applied
to loans to development finance companies and the loan should be available
to finance BNDE's import needs in respect of investment projects financed
by it. The financing of public sector projects should be permitted but in
each case the Bank's prior approval should be required. In recognition of
improvements in technique of appraisal as well as the growing experience of
BNDE's management and staff, an increase in ENDE's free limit from the
present $150,000 to $300,000 is justified.  This is recommended with an
aggregate free limit of $4 million. Such an increase would still leave
more than two thirds of the proposed loan requiring prior Bank approval.

APPRAISAL OF BANQUE NATIO1IALE POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE (BNDE)
I.  INTROIXJCTION
1.        The Bank has made three loans to BNDE for a total of $47.5
million. The third loan was made on November 5, 1968, at a time when
various steps designed to improve BNDE1s performance and return on
capital had either just been taken or were about to be introduced. This
report assesses developments since then,and the prospects over the next two
years as to the quality and volume of BNDE's work. It also recommends a
fourth loan to ENDE in an amount of $15 million.  The report's preparation
coincides with the completionof BNDE's first decade, over seven years of
which were spent in association with the World Bank Group.
II.   ECONOMD:C AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
2.        Morocco still is a largely agricultural economy and develop-
ments in that sector, especially as regards disposable income, have a
pervading influence elsewhere, as shown in the slump due to the bad
harvest in 1966. In 1967 and 1968, GDP in real terms increased by 7% and
12% respectively, the latter increase due mainly to the exceptional
harvest in 1968. About 13% of GDP was accounted for by industry (including
handicrafts) in 1967 and about 12% in 1968, down largely because of the
unusual harvest. Manufacturing output in the four-year period 1964-68
grew only by about 13%. However, this rate appears to have increased
in 1969. The relatively slow expansion of industrial activity is due
partly to the fact that this is a relatively new field for Moroccan entre-
preneurs (except for textiles), and existing foreign enterprises have
not been aggressive in recent years in their expansion plans.
3.        Industry is oriented to import substitution for consumer goods
but there are some important industrial exports, mainly canned goods
consisting of sardines, vegetables and fruit juices. One of the main
areas of recent expansion of production was the textile industry, which
for a while grew at a faster rate than demand; only last year was full
capacity utilized in large segments of the textile industry. Manu-
facturing is principally concentrated on the Atlantic littoral betwieen
Rabat and Casablanca, the latter city serving as headquarters for most
firms and banks in the country. Most industrial concerns are privately
oined, though there are a few large public enterprises engaged in mineral
e-traction, chemicals and sugar refining.
4.        Recent Trends and Short-Term Investment Perspective.  Morocco's
exceptionally good harvest in 1968 was largely responsible for a GDP
increase of 12% over 1967. As a result of the increase in purchasing
power, demand for consumer's goods increased and industry operated at a
higher percent of capacity than in 1967. Most industrial sectors, as



- 2 -
can be seen fror2 the following table, exhibited fairly hi,h growth rates
in output from 1967 to 1968:1/
Metal transformation     + 9%
Constructionmaterials    + 15.1%
Chemicals                + 9.6 
Foodstruffs              -  2.0%.
Textiles                 + 13.2%
Leather                  + 16.0%
Paper                    +  2.0%
Soaps and Oils           -  2.0%
Others                   + 4-5%
The decline in foodstuffs production reflects the large drop in output of
the modern milling industry, following the decline in imports of cereals
and the shift of activity to traditional mills. Preliminary figures indi-
cate that the higher rate of the industrial production expansion since 1963
continued in the first eight months of 1960. This observation is based on
t,,he significant e:pansion of production of construction matcrial, fuels,
electric energy and assembly plants over 1968 levels.
5.        Total actual fixed investment in all sectors (including manu-
facturing) during 1968, the first year of the new Moroccan five-year
plan, amounted to DH 1,970 million, higher by 4% than the 1967 overall
investment level. In 1968, approvals by the Investment Commission 2/
of new industrial investments, both private and public, amounted to DH 311
million as compared to a yearly average in 1965-67 of DI 338 million. This
average was inflated by an unusually high volume of approvals in 1967
(DH 520 million) due to three very large public sector projects: two
sugar mills and a textile plant totalling DH 260 million in investments.
The following table shows the evolution of approvals by the Investment
Commission from 1964 to 1968 (in DHi million):
1964      1965      1966      1967       1968
Industry  221.5     277.2     206.8      520.5     311

238.5     311.7     272.8    682.6    386
1/   Source: BNDE figures based on Central Statistical Office data.
2/  This Commission is chaired by the lirector of Industry and includes
representatives of a number of Ministries, Public Agencies, the
Caisse de Depots et de Gestion and BNDE.  The Commission decides on
the incentives to be granted to new industrial and hotel investments.
Since reliable data on actual investments in the industrial sector
vas not available, approval figures from the Commission have been
usad instead as a rough indicator of investment trends. 1969 figures
are not available.



- 3 -
In view of the important advantages granted under the Investment Code,
a majority of investors try to obtain the Commission's approval. The
foregoing totals are likely to include, therefore, most new industrial
and hotel investments. The main incentives are Government grants of
up to 20% of the value of fixed assets, tariff protection, exemption
from custans duties on imported equipment, accelerated depreciation,
constitution of tax-free investment reserves, the freezing of tax rates
for up to 10 years, as well as low-cost loans.
6.        Industrial investments under the 1968-1972 Five-Year Plan are
expected to amount to DH 1,421 million, an average of DH 284 million per
year. Of the five-year total, DH 675 million has been programmed for the
public sector of which DH 385 million for a phosphoric acid and ammonium
phosphate plant, DH 100 million for the COTEF textile plant and DH 130
million for sugar refineries.  The balance of DH 746 million is estimated
for private sector investments, on the basis of projects known to the
Investment Commission and the Plan authorities at the time of the Plan
preparation. (At the end of the 1965-1967 Plan period, it was found that
actual approved investments exceeded original Plan estimates by over 20%.)
Proposed private sector investments in industry, which are included in
the current Plan, are mainly for sugar refineries, construction materials
(cement), where recent production increases have taken up available
capacity, paper pulp (e.g. extension of Cellulose du Maroc), paper,
plastics, ceramics and some textiles. No metallurgical or mechanical pro-
jects are listed in the Plan, although there is at least one such project
pipe manufacturing by SCIP, a company being financed by BNDE. The
Moroccan Government hopes that, with its new associate membership in the
Common Market, industrialists in labor intensive industries in the private
sector, such as leather goods and clothing, will be able to increase
their exports.
7.        Approvals of specific new tourism investments during 1968-72
are planned for DH 691 million in hotel facilities and DH 69 million in
0           infrastructure.  New hotel investment approvals would thus average
DH 138 million per year as compared to DH 88 million per year in the
1965-67 period. The intended increased tempo of hotel investments re-
flects the Government's desire to better exploit Morocco's natural
tourism potential.
Long-term Financing in Morocco and BNDE's Role
8.        Data are available only through the end of 1968.  Annex 1
shows the total cost of BNDE's approved projects between 1964 and 1968,
and BNDE's share of such financing.  While the total estimated cost of
projects approved increased from DH 67.4 million in 1964 to DH 353.5
million in 1968, the amount actually approved by BNDE in the form of
direct loans and equity investments increased from DH 20.6 million to
DH 64.2 million during this period. Total BNDE financial assistance



- 4 -
including rediscounting commitments and guarantees, increased from
IX 120.5 million in 1967 due to the high level of rediscounting commit-
ments in that year. Annex 1 also showrs total industrial and tourism
investments approved by the Investment Commission during the same period;
these figures do not include all new investments, but they probably
include a majority of them. It thus appears that in recent years, ENDE
has been providing financing for a major share of new investments and
that there are few new industrial or tourist enterprises which have not
received some form of financial assistance from ENDE.
9.        ENDE's financing activities have drawn in other institutions.
ENDE itself makes direct loans and equity investments; it also gives
rediscount commitments for medium-term loans for which local commercial
banks assume the primary risk, while BN E acts as the agreed Iter-
mediary between these commercial banks and the Central Bank .-  Although
BNrE's risk and financial commitments are low in its rediscountable
business, its role is important since rediscountable loans often form
an integral part of financing packages put together by ENDE and which
usually include also direct BNDE loans.
10.       While ENDE remains Morocco's major long.term financing
institution for industry, there are some specialized public sector insti-
tutions dealing with agriculture (Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole),
housing and hotels (Credit Immobilier et Hotelier, CIH, with which ENDE
has a special relationship for hotel financing) and the Caisse de Depots
et de Gestion (CDG) which adminiters pension funds and has several
affiliated companies including CIH.  CDG's long-term lending activities
are principally concentrated outside the field of ENDE's work, although
like ENDE it is an equity investor in industrial and hotel companies.
Also worth mentioning is Maroc Leasing, which finances the purchase of
smaller equipment; it is a leasing company, in which Banque de Paris
et des Pays-Bas has a controlling position and in which BNDE has 20%
of the share capital and to which it has made several loans. In the
past few years, foreign suppliers credits, on terms competitive with
BNDE's loans, have become available and, though not actively encouraged,
are considered acceptable by the Moroccan authorities on balance of
payments grounds. These credits are not insignificant inasmuch as
they represent about 17% of long-term capital moving into Morocco in 1968.
It is difficult to forecast their impact in the future, but it is known
that these credits seem no longer to have the same attraction to
Morrocan industrialists as they did before in view of the foreign
exchange risk which, unlike the loans from ENDE, these credits involve
for the borrowers.
11.       Ownership of industrial enterprises is either in the form of
direct family investments, still the preferred form among M4oroccan
industrialists, or foreign direct investment, mainly French from the
pre-independence period. Although BIDE's role in making new equity
1/   For this, BNDE charges 3/4% per annum on the amount of rediscountable
loans outstanding.



- 5 -
investments has not been important in recent years, it was important
earlier with the result that its equity portfolio at N1VOber 30, 1969,
consisted of 25 companies in which ENDE had invested close to DH 22
million. In addition, BNDE has actively participated in tourism pro-
motion through its subsidiary SOMADET, of which BNDE owns 50% of the
EH 5.6 million in share capital. SoMADET has set up several hotels and
"villages de vacances"t in different areas of Morocco. Another source
of equity capital has been the Bureau d'Etudes et de Participations
Industrielles (BEPI) established by the Government in 1957 to study
new' industrial projects and participate in their capital. BEPI Ias
quite successful in setting up a few important industrial operations:
light car assembly, tire manufacturing, yarn spinning mill (COFITEX),
an. oil refinery (SAMIR) and the chemical fertilizer complex at Safi.
Most of these new enterprises were launched mainly with private foreign
sponsors since private Moroccan industrialists wiere reluctant to invest
in enterprises which they could not control.  BEPI has not been very
active in the past two years.  A third institution, the Societe
Nationale dtInvestissement (SNI), invests mainly in securities of
operating companies. There is a stock market in Casablanca, but its
activity in attracting new funds into share investment appears insigni-
ficant, and the market is thin. The three institutions (BNDE, BEPI,
SNI) have had only limited success in revolving their portfolios.
Relaticns with Government and Business Community
12.       The widespread influence of the Government over the modern
sector of the economy, especially through the granting of investment
incentives, and the fact that the Government possesses the largest block
Of shares and representation on the Board of BNDE are important reasons
for BNDE to maintain good relations with the authorities. 1fhile ENDE
maintains freedom of maneuver on the details of projects and in regard
to its internal organization, it is not surprising that there is con-
siderable respect in BNDE for official wishes in regard to major
policy areas, such as the support of the textile industry and the form
of assistance to hotels. Within this framework, BNDE has tried to let
business considerations prevail and to improve its performance.
13.       Relations with the business community appear to be correct
and somewhat formal with BNDE being thought of as an institution close
to the Government. Clients are often referred by the Investment
Commission to BNDE as a source of long-term and of foreign exchange
finance. There is no evidence of BNDE supporting any particular group.
BNDE has made some efforts to attract foreign investors in partnership
iTth Moroccan interests with a moderate amount of success as for instance
in its joint hotel ventures through SOMADET or for some starch and
canning projects.  ENDE is keen on keeping good relations with the com-
mercial banks and appears to have done so successfully.

III. BNDE'S GOALS, ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
Objectives and Policies
14.       BNDE was established in 1959 to assist the economic develop-
ment of Morocco with medium- and long-term financing of enterprises, to
promote new enterprises and to encourage the capital market.  BNDE's
Statement of Policy (Annex 2) permits BNDE to finance non-private enter-
prises but only when private capital to carry out the project cannot be
found on reasonable terms. BNDE has financed relatively few public
sector projects since its policy statement was adopted in 1963. With
the Bank's concurrence BNDE is planning to increase its normal limit
on commitments to a single enterprise from 10% to the equivalent of 15%
of its equity and subordinated loans.  The proposed change has not yet
been approved by BNDE's Board and is not reflected in Annex 2.
Shareholders
15.       IFC invested $1.49 million in BNDE's share capital in 1962 as
a result of which the Government gave up its majority control, although
it remained the largest shareholder. The share capital of DH 30 million
was ref1uced in 1968 to DH 20 million to improve leverage and to increase
profitability of the share capital. The relative composition of owner-
ship in BNDE remained approximately the same, and is shown in Annex 3.
The two most important shareholders are the Government, with 43.2% of the
shares, and IFC, with 24.7%, amounting to DH 4.94 million ($976,000
equivalent); other foreign institutions own 16.25%. Though both the
Government and IFC agreed in 1962 to seIl some of their shares to
qualified Moroccan investors, no sale of that type has as yet occurred
(see paragraph 37).
Resources
0             16.        The reduction of BNDE's share capital in 1968 by DH 10 million
and the simultaneous grant of a 2% subordinated Government loan of
DH 10 million had the effect of increasing BNDE's local currency resources
by DH 1.7 million, as 17% of the shareholders chose to receive 6% ten-
year bonds instead of cash for the payment of their shares. The medium-
and long-term resources (net of repayments) invested by BNDE or available
for investment as of June 30, 1969, were as follows (see Annex 4 for
further details):



-7-
DH Million
A.   Local currency:  Share capital                20.0
Reserves and surplus       l.6
Subordinated
Government loans         40.0
Long-term bonds            15.0

B.   Foreign currency: World Bank loans
(US$47.5 million
gross, US$40.7

repayments)             203.5
C.    Total long-term resources                   290.1
The heavy proportion of foreign exchange resources (70% on the basis
of the table above, and 51% on the basis of the balance sheet) re-
flects the importance of import financing in BNDE's lending operations.
This high proportion is due to the fact that Morocco produces few capital
goods, and the local currency component of investments is usually finan-
ced by equity or by medium-term loans from commercial banks. These
medium-term loans are often rediscounted at the central bank through
BNDE as described in paragraph 9. Including IFC's investment, the Bank
Group is providing 57% of BNDE's total long-term resources outstanding.
BNDE is presently trying to diversify its foreign borrowings, and
negotiations with AID for a $3 million loan have substantially advanced.
1/  Bank loans to BNDE are denominated in dirhams on BNDE's books
since the foreign exchange risk is carried by the Moroccan
central bank.



- 8-
Board and Executive Committee
17*  The Board of Directors (Annex 5) consists of 17 members, 8 of whom
(including the Chairman and the Director General) represent or are vomin-
ated by the Government or government agencies, 5 of whom are private
Moroccan bankers or industrialists, 3 represent the foreign shareholders
and 1 IFC which has been on BNDEts Board since October 1963.  IFC is
represented by Dr. A. A. Khosropur, who replaced Mr. E. T. Kuiper in
June, 1969.
18, Until mid-1968, investment decisions were made either by the Director
General (up to DH 750,000) or by the full Board. Since the Board met
only four times a year, Board voting on most projects was done by mail, a
procedure which hampered effective discussion between Board members. Con-
sequently, on May 31, 1968, an Executive Committee was constituted and given
by the Board powers to approve all commitments for rediscountable credits
without limit and other commitments by BNDE up to DH b million for a single
enterprise. Matters of policy remain the responsibility of the full Board.
The Executive Comrittee has seven members, shown in Annex 5, of whom the
IFC representative is the only non-resident in Morocco, and it meets once
a month.  After one year's experience, it is evident that the main advantage
of the new set-up is that projects are now being discussed in the Executive
Committee, thus giving directors an opportunity to exchange with management
and each other both conclusions and opinions.
19& Management, Staff and Procedures
Mr. Mohamed Benkirane, BNDE's Director General for four years, is
heavily burdened with work.  In the absence of a deputy, he has to concern
himself with a chief executive's functions of maintaining effective
relations with Government,clients, commercial banks, and his own Board. He
also has to deal with problems of internal coordination and administration.
The Bank has been emphasizing for some years the need for the appointment
of a deputy, and this has again been done during the recent loan negotiations.
The matter has indeed become acute in the face of the expected substantial
volume of business and BNDE's expanding portfolio. The Director General shares
the Bank's concern and has indicated that a deputy will be appointed, at the
latest in August 1970. During loan negotiations in 1968 for the third loan,
it was agreed that BNDE would recruit an adviser and an appointment was
actually made.  The incumbent, however, left the service of BNDE last
September. Though experience at BNDE has been growing, there is still need
for advice but it is now less general and focused on specific aspects of
project appraisal work, especially the assesssment of market and economic
considerations.
20.  Staff.  Annex 6 is BNDE's organization chart.  BNDE's has one
foreign department head and one other foreign staff member.  BNDE's
professional staff has grown in experience and several of BNDE's staff
members at the middle and senior levels are of high caliber. Full advantage
of their competence is not taken, however, because coordination and
communication among BNDE's departments are not as goed as they sboild be. 
This is a problem to which the Director General and especially the Deputy,
when appointed, need to pay particular attention.



- 9-_
21.       Appraisals are the product of three departments: Develcpmelnt
(technical aspects), Economic Studies (for market surveys, especially
on a macro-economic level), and Credit which is supposed to synthesize
the job and make financial projections. The coordination problem is
especially felt in appraisal work. Appraisals of small projects, be-
cause they involve only one department, are often better and more co-
hesive than those of large projects.  BNDE has also accumulated a
valuable stock of expertise in appraising hotel projects, a fact which
has been helpful in evaluating projects prepared by CIH through whom
BNDE has been financing hotel projects with IBRD funds under a conven-
tion established in 1966. On the whole, there have been improvements
in appraisal methodology especially in regard to financial analysis.
Still,the treatment of markets is thin and needs strengthening par-
ticularly since, as a result of Morocco's association with EEC, BNDE
hopes to finance more export oriented enterprises which would have to
face a more competitive environment than in Morocco itself. Also,
there is insufficient appraisal of the economic merit of projects.
These two weaknesses have now the attention of the Director General and
he is seeking outside technical assistance. The Bank is also consider-
ing ways of helping BNDE in this regard.
22.       Prospects are good for further improvement in appraisals with the
recent strengthening of the Development Department. The staff in this
department has the potential to make an important contribution to new
projects and new promotions. To prepare itself better, BNDE intends to
hire another engineer and business school graduates.
23.       Follow-up Work.  Since 1966, supervision reports have increased
in number and more recently in quality. They are more timely and the
short-term financial analysis is adequate. Further improvements are
needed in terms of comparing actual operating results with previous pro-
jections and new market developments, and in making revised profita-
bility analyses.
24.       Operations.  A summary of BNDE's operations is given in Annex
7. Since inception and until December 1 1969, total financial assistance
approved had amounted to DH 820 million.A/ Of this total, DH 386 million
was in the form of direct medium- and long-term loans; DH 380 million
in secondary risk commitments for rediscountable medium-term credits
granted by commercial banks, DH 20 million in equity investments and
DH 34 million in guarantees. The average loan size is about $295,0O0
equivalent; average investment, about $121,000.
25.       Up to 1965, the annual approval volume of new direct loans was,
on average, about DH 25 million. Afterwards, lending more than doubled
and DH 56 million was approved in 1966, DH 50 million in 1967 and DH 64
million in 1968. In the first eleven months of 1969, direct loan approvals
amounted to DH 55.7 million and total approvals for the year should be just
over the 1968 level. Annual rediscounting commitments have shown
great fluctuations, from a low of DH 11 million in 1964 to a high of
1/ Figures for the first 11 months of 1969 are prelimi.aiy.



- 10 -
DH 71 million ir. 1967, mainly influenced by the incidence of occasional
very large commitments, such as the SUNAG sugar mill (DH 45 million) in
1967.  Rediscounting commitments have been extremely low in 1969 (DH
3.7 million) as a result of the credit ceilings imposed by the Central
Bank in 1969 on the commercial banks in view of the large credit ex-
pansion which took place in 1968. Equity investments of BNDE decreased
from DH 5.5 million in 1966 to DH 2.1 million in 1967, none in 1968 and
DH 0.1 million in 1969.
26.  In its earlier years, BNDE played an important role in equity
financing of new enterprises and its equity portfolio at December 31,
1968, consisted of 25 companies in which BNDE had invested close to
DIH 20 million.  In addition, BNDE has actively participated in tourism
promotion through SOMADET which has set up several hotels and "villages
de vacances" in different areas of Morocco.  The absence of equity in-
vestments since 1967 is due to shyness resulting from the fact that
some of BNDE's early heavy commitments in Moroccan companies, such as
Cellulose du Maroc and Manuver, have not turned out well and have con-
stituted a drag on the overall financial performance of BNDE. However,
other promotions and equity investments are doing well (SOMADET,
SOTHERMA,  Xaroc Leasing).  BNDE is now planning again on new equity
investments.
27.  The sectoral breakdown of BNDE's direct loans approved in each of
the last four years is as follows:
Sector                                     1966    1967    1968      1969

100     100     100       100
The sectoral emphasis of BNDE's direct loans has changed from a concen-
tration in 1966 on textiles to a more diversified pattern in 1967 and an
emphasis on the tourism and food processing sectors in 1968. During the
first eleven months of 1969, hotel loans continued strong (31%) and
textile lending again was important (19%). All textile loans, however,



- 11 -
were granted to existing companies for expanding, modernizing or balanc-
ing their facilities. Maroc Leasing continued to be an inmortant borr-
ower from BNDE. Wkhen the loans approved in the past two years are dis-
bursed, in view of the different lending pattern regarding industrial
sectors, BNDE will have a better diversification of its direct loan
portfolio, which included 30% in textile sector loans as of December
31, 1968, and 24he in June 30, 1969.
28. The spurt of hotel lending in the past 2-3 years is due to
pressure of demand and a streamlining in 1J68 of the procedures under
the 1966 convention between BNDE and CIH which governs the use of IW-iD loan
funds by CIH.  BNDE's role in hotel financing is likely to decline if CIH
becomes a direct borrower from IBRD. An appraisal of CIH, with a view to
a Bai: loan to it, is now under way.
29. Since BNDE became associatdd with the Bank Group in 1962, its
operations have shifted markedly towards private sector assistance.  It
has also provided strong encouragement and increased its assistance to
Moroccan-owned companies (62% of the total) while continuing at the same
time to finance foreign-owned concerns.
30. BNDE has not restricted itself to lending operations in reaction to
proposals brought to it, but it has actively promoted new ventures in the
industrial field (plastics, cement, fishmeal, bitumen and lubricants,
electric motors, feed, olive oil, bottling) and in the tourism field
through SOMADET.  BNDE has become particularly interested in the process-
ing of agricultural products and is presently conducting several studies
in this field. A study of the textile industry's prospects has just been
completed to give some background information for possible future invest-
ment decisions given BNDEts heavy exposure in this sector.
IV. FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS
Evaluation of Loan and Equity Portfolio
31.  Loan Portfolio.  BNDE's portfolio outstanding on September 30, 1969
amounts to RH 152.5 million of which DH h5.4 million is oovered by
government guarantees. The remaining DH 137.1 million outstanding
is accounted for largely by textiles (DTi 45 million)  food industries
*( ii 20 million), mining 2nd chemicals (Di 21. million;, paper (.DH 11
anillion), leasing (DH 12 million), and tourism (0I 16.5 million).  A
recent analycsis of the 40 most important clients representing tuo-thirds
of the outstanding non-guaranteed portfolio -as carriad out, and parti-
cular attention ;,as paid to the te:tile sector where the results of 20
companies (representing over 8a,4 of textile loans) were examined:
a.  Tei- les. The textile sector appears to have adequately weathered
its 1967 crisis due in part to higher conswaer income resulting
from last year's ex.cellent harvetet and to the fact that a numbor
of M-roccan tuxtile entorpriaij have zcquired more experience



- 12 -
and improved their productivity. Despite heavy tariff protection,
there has been a tendency for textile prices to decline as a
result of internal competition in Mrocco and better productivity.
Although production capacity and internal consumption are cur-
rently in approximate balance, the Government is carrying out
its plans of two years ago to set up the COTEF plant in Fes
(50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms) which will eventually add some
25% to available capacity. In view of BNDE's continuing large
exposure in textiles, the situation should be kept under constant
review.
b. Problem Projects. Seven medium to large projects have diffi-
culties; they account for DH 17 million in principal outstanding
(9% of BNDE's portfolio). They are mostly covered by very good
guarantees. Four of the seven projects do not represent serious
repayment risks and the hard core risks are a glass, a textile
and a leather company. The three account for about DH 3.5 mil-
lion in principal outstanding and BNDE's potential losses from
these projects should be well below BNDE's exposure.
32. Arrears. BNDE's performance in this regard is reasonably good despite
some recent increase in the amount of arrears. The detail of arrears at
June 30, 1969 is not available, but total arrears in principal and interest
of over one month amounted to DH 3.8 million as compared to DH 2.95 million
at December 31, 1968. At the end of 1968, actual arrears of over three
months amounted to 0.88% of the portfolio carried at BNDE's risk while the
principal on which these arrears occurred (DH 3.6 million) represent 2.92%
of BNDE's risk portfolio.
33. Equity Portfolio. Details of BNDE's equity portfolio are given in
Annex . As Of 1ovembe. 30, 1969, BIT?E had subscribed to the share capital of
25 companies for a total of DH 21.7 million, of which DH 20.7 million had
been paid in. BNDE made specific provisions of DH 2.1 million for the
depreciation of four unprofitable investments.  Thus, net investment was
DH 19.6 million of which DH 18.5 million had been paid in.
34. On the basis of total original subscriptions, equity investments may
be subdivided as follows:
Profitable companies distributing dividends         DH  8,811,350
Profitable companies not distributing dividends         2,126,800
Companies starting up or under construction             3,734,000
Unprofitable companies                                  6,775,225
Companies being liquidated                                217,000
DH 21,664,475
Paid-in net equity portfolio of DH 18.5 million represents about 8% of
BNDE's total assets.  During 1968, dividend income amounted to DH 397,000,



- 13 -
a yield of only 2.3% on the net portfolio. Prospects for a quick improve-
ment are remote in view of the fact that the portfolio is weighted dowin by
a few large unprofitable investments included in the above category of
nearly DH 7 million.  On the other hand, most companies in the first two
headings in the table above, accounting for investments totalling DH 10.9
million, are profitable and have excellent prospects. An improvement in
the yield of these companies is quite likely with a resulting improvement
in the overall return on BNDE's equity portfolio. Moreover, the real
worth of these shares is greater than that carried on BNDE's books, al-
though that gain cannot be realized while the shares remain unmarketable.
35. Summing up, BNDE's serious risks of loss on its loan and equity port-
folio total only about DH 4-5 million; but given security provisions, not
all of this is likely to be lost.

37.  Little has changed in the relative structure of the sources of BNDE's
income. In 1968, as in 1967, clqse to 90% of BNDE's gross income, including
the Government interest subsidy4. , was contributed by interest on its direct
loans. BNDE's net income after taxes increased by 12.4% in 1968 over the
1967 level, mainly as a result of higher gross income from direct and re-
discountable loans. Although gross income as a percentage of average total
assets remained at 6.65% in 1968, gross profits on average net worth in-
creased from 9.9% to 12.4%, and net profits on share capital from 8.8% to
14.9%. These sharp increases were mainly due to the improvement in lever-
age brought about by the one third reduction in share caoital effected in
1968, and its replacement by a low interest (2%) overml±ent loan. The 1968
return of 15% on share capital is not likely to increase quickly in view of
the slowing down in the rate of increase of BNDE's total assets. The pre-
liminary figures for the first six months of 1969 confirm these trends.
Considering the better 1968 results, BNDEts General Assembly approved on
June 23, 1969, a 6% dividend, the first at that level, following payments of
3-5% and 4% in two previous years. This represents a 1968 payout of about
40% and in its amount (DH 1.2 million) is identical to BNDE's dividend payment
in 1967. A 6% dividend is an improvement, but, with 10%-12% being paid out
by better industrial companies and commercial banks, it is unlikely to induce
enough interest among Moroccan investors to buy BNDE's slares.

39.  About half of ENDE's current liabilities are three- and six-month bonds,
guaranteed by the Government and held mainly by insurance conpanies. They
are automatically reneaied at maturity by BNDE and the insurance companies
as long as the Government's authorization and guarantee for these operations
is given. As usual, authorization was received with respect to 1969 opera-
tions. BNDE uses these resources to a large extent for the temporary
financing of loan disbursements for which BNDE already has the Bank's under-
taking for reimbursement.  Also, in the unlikely event that these bonds were
not renewed, without prior notice being given to BNDE, BNDE's cash surplus
from operations and collections in any one year would be enough to more than
cover the excess short-term liabilities.  Thus, BNDE's liquidity position is
stronger than appears at first glance.
40. As BDUDE's present debt/equity limitation established with the Bank is
4.5:1, BNDE's borrowing capacity was about DH 235 million as of June 30,
1969, while debt was only DH 131.25 million or 2.4 times the borrowing base
provided for in the Bank loan contracts. Net worth was 16.2% of the total
loan and equity portfolio outstanding.
Reserves
41.  BNDE is allowed to set up tax free reserves against its current income
at an annual rate of 1% of the direct loan portfolio outstanding, and
0.15% of newi rediscountable credits granted each year. BNDE has taken full
advantage of this agreement with the Government in constituting general re-
serves against possible losses. These increased from DH 8.6 million in
1967 to DH 10.4 million in 1968, representing 5.5% of BNDEts total loan and
equity portfolio and 7% of the portfolio at BNDE's own risk!/. In addition,
BNDE has set up some provisions against losses for special loans and equity
investments.  These provisions amounted to DH 2.5 million at December 31,
1968 and DH 2.1 million of this amount represented provisions for losses on
specific equity investments (see Annex 8, page 2). In addition to the pro-
visions of DH 2.1 million already made, BNDE should consider further provi-
sions of roughly DH 1.8 million to allow for its other unprofitable invest-
ments in companies with no prospects of quick improvement. The general re-
serves already constituted of DH 10.4 million appear adequate to cover both
these additional provisions for equity investments as well as any foreseeable
losses from the loan portfolio (see paragraph 35).
1/ "Equity" as defined in Loan Agreement 571-M4R with IBRD includes the
portions of subordinated loans falling due after the last maturity of
Bank loans to BNDE. The earlier maturities are included in "debt".
2/   Reserves were estimated at DH 11.6 million at June 30, 1969 after a
notional allocation for taxes and dividends.

Interest Rate and Effect on Profitability and Resource Allocation
42.       BNDE charges its clients a rate of 7% p.a.  This low rate bas been
a matter of concern to the Bank Group since 1962, for essentiallY two reasonst
a. It helped keep BNDE's profitability low and resulted in a
return on equity too low to stimulate sales of BNDE's shares
to private parties, which was one of the original objectives
of the Bank Group't association with BNDE in 1962.
b. An interest rate of 7% p.a. is also low in relation to the
cost of capital and opens up the possibility that uneconomic
projects will be financed by BNDE. The low interest rate is
reflected in the fact that the return on the total capital
employed by BNDE is still under 6%.
I43.      The concern under (a) above was partly mitigated by the change in
BNDE's capital structure referred to in paragraph 15. However, though the
return on share capital rose to 14.9% in 1968, it is still too low to permit
dividends high enough to trigger substantial share sales.  BNDE's share-
holders must therefore continue to be concerned with BNDE's earnings as must
BNDE itself, if it hopes one day to be able to issue new shares, as it will
no doubt have to do.
44.       The cost of capital and the impact of low interest rates on the
allocation of resources is a matter of general eoonomic policy. The Govern-
ment had already in 1968 agreed to survey the interest rate structure in
Morocco. Following discussions during the Banks Annual Meeting in 1969,
it is now intended to undertake this survey in 1970.
15.      BNDE can, within limits, avoid contributing to possible resource
misanlocations through its present low interest rate level by applying
stricter criteria concerning the acceptable return on projects which it
considers for financing. Arrangements to that effect were made during the
recent loan negotiations.  BNDE plans to require that the projects it
finances earn a minimum return of lC% (before financial charges) on the
total investment. BNDE also intends to elaborate the analysis of projects
in order to evaluate their economic benefits in relation to their costs.
V. THE OUTLOOK
Business Prospects
46.       The Moroccan market is not large, but there are compensatory
factors auguring reasonably well for further private investment. Among them
are increases in demand and purchasing power resulting from recent good har-
vests as well as stepped-up Government investment, the need for equipment
replacement, further import substitution opportunities in several consumer in-
dustries (especially food), and the expected pick-up of the construction indus-
try induced by more hotel construction. The recent association with the EEC,



- 17 -
which allows Moroccan manufactured goods free entry, should also encourage
the establishment of some export oriented industries. These factors make
it likely that industrial investment, sanctioned under the Investment Code,
will at least be maintained at about DR 300 million annually or more over
the next few years; such a level would approximate or be somewhat better
than that achieved in the past two-three years. These general observations
are strongly supported by the pipeline of industrial projects in BNDE.
Prospects for investments in tourism facilities seem even better, judging
from the hotel projects underway and planned. This, however, is unlikely
to matter significantly to BNDE if, as is likely, its lending for hotels
diminishes materially because CIH borrows directly from IBRD.
47. At the beginning of December 1969, BNDE was studying 26 industrial
projects which BNDE hoped would be considered before the end of 1970. They
involve direct loans of DH 98 million and cover a variety of industries,
such as cement (three projects), textiles (five extensions of existing com-
panies), pharmaceuticals, fishmeal, transport, packaging and electronic
assembly.  In addition, BNDE had five very large projects before it,
including a public sector projectV/, (paper pulp, nylon filament, ore mining,
petroleum refining and another from laroc Leasing). Each would call for a
loan of DH 10-12 million from BNDE. Prospects are that at least two of
these large projects would go forward in 1970.
48.  In addition to its industrial projects, BNDE is likely to finance some
hotel projects presented by CIH before 1IH receives, as is possible, a loan
from the Bank. Six hotel projects would probably be approved early in 1970
involving loans of about DH 10 million.
Forecast of Operations
49.  Annex 11 contains BNDE's forecasts of operations through 1974, which
are compared with actual data for 1968 and a 1969 estimate based on eleven
months' actual experience. Contractual commitments are projected at totals
of DH 65 million and DH 60 million for 1970 and 1971, respectively.  Consi-
dering recent experience, the general investment outlook and the projects
BNDE is considering, the forecast levels of commitments appear feasible
even without substantial hotel business. They compare with commitments now
expected to total DH 66 million in 1969, a likely peak year for BNDE.
50. BNDE expects that its rediscountable medium-term business will pick up
next year to a level of DH 30 million, which is still lower than the levels
attained in 1967 and 1968. The expected 1970 level would depend on the
commercial banks' credit volume to be authorized by the central bank. BNDE
is overcoming its recent aversion to equity investments, and is planning to
approve in 1970 three equity investments for a total of DH 8.5 million in
respect of projects already under consideration.
1/ BNDE can finance public sector projects under its Policy Statement but
a specific authorization by the Bank was needed under the arrangements
governing Loan 571-MOR for the use of Bank funds for such projects. It
is intended to continue this arrangement under the proposed fourth loan.



_ 18 -
58.. Resources Needed. BNDE expects that its traditional financing patterrn
will continue and that 90% of its dlirect loan approvals will be for finan-
cing import needs. BNDE's estimated local resource needs would be comfort-
ably met by BNDE's own cash generation and repayments on its local currency
loans as shown in Annex 12. The third Bank loan (5711MOR) bad an uncommitted
balance of about DH 6.3 million ($1.3 million) on December 1, 1969, for
which projects were already earmarked. They would, if credited, exhaust
available foreign exchange resources. In addition, BNDE expects to commit
by the end of 1969 DH 6.2 million in foreign exchange loans.  Commitments
for industrial projects of DH 65 million in 1970 and DH 60 million in 1971,
imply import needs of about DH 58 million and DH 54 million for 1970 and
1971, respectively.  In addition, BNDE expects to finance approximately
DH 10 million ($2 million) of hotel projects within the next few months.
On this basis, BNDE's foreign exchange resource gap not covered by the
proposed AkD loan, would be as follows (in DH thousands):
Resources available from Bank loan 571-MOR
on December 1, 1969                              6,335
Projects presented to Bank at December 1,
1969                                             6,500
Estimated commitments in balance of 1969           6,200
Estimated hotel projects - first quarter 1970    10,000
Estimated foreign exchange commitments (1970)    58,500
Estimated foreign exchange commitments (1971)    54,00
Total needs through 1971                     135,200
Foreign resource gap                             128,865
AID loan (as per paragraph 52 below)               7,500
Net resource gap ($24.3 million)             121,365
Thus, BNDE's foreign resource gap through 1971 is of the order of $24
million.
52. USAID approved in principle on June 30, 1969, a $3 million loan to the
Moroccan Government, to be relent to BNDE at an interest rate of 4%. The
draft agreement, which is expected to be signed in early 1970, provides
that, failing reasonable opportunities for procurement in the U.S.A., half
of the AID loan may be used for local currency financing. Present expecta-
tions are that 50% of the loan will be so used. Preliminary contacts have
been made by BNDE to investigate the possibility of loans from two other
sources but they have not come through. Since BNDE's contribution centers
heavily on financing imported equipment, BNDE is hoping again for Bank funds
for the bulk of its foreign exchange needs.
53. At the end of 1968, the Bank Group's share (including the IFC investment)
in BNDE's total long-tern debt and equity was about 58%. In view of the
Bank's high involvement in BNDE's resource structure in past years, the Bank



- 19 -
has encouraged BNDE to look for alternative sources of funds, leading in par
to the negotiations for an AID loan. B171E's financial projections, which
are discussed in the following paragraphs, show that at the end of 1972, if
the Bank were to continue lending to BNDE for the balance of its foreign
exchange needs, the Bank Group's share would rise to 66% of BNDE's total
long-term debt and equity. This is very high.
Financial Projections
54. Annexes 12 through 14 are BNDE's projections of cash flow, income
statements and balance sheets based on BNDE's forecast of operations in
Annex 11. The relative contribution to BNDE of various sources of income
is expected to remain approximately the same through 1972. Interest income
is based on a continuing spread of only 2% but the yield on the equity port-
folio is projected to increase gradually from the present 2.3% to 3.6% by
1972.  The latter appears reasonable.  BNDE's results are expected to evolve
as follows:
Earnings before          Earnings after interest and taxes
interest and taxes/    on Share   on Average    on Average
Average total assets   capital    equity         total assets
1969           5.6%             16.6%        10.5%          1.48%
1970           6.2%             18.2%        10.6%          1.46%
1971           5.8%             20.4%        11.1%          1.47%
1972           6.2%             21.8%        11.0%          1.43%
The sudden improvement in BNDE's profitability from 1967 to 1968 (see
paragraph 37), due largely to the improvement in leverage, will continue at
a slower rate and will follow the trend of BNDE's growth in total assets.
55. Although profits on share capital are expected to increase to 21.8%,
BNDE foresees a dividend increasing slowly from the present level of 6% to
7.25% by 1972, if it is to continue to make full use of the tax advantages
accorded to the constitution of reserves, which are projected to pre-empt
in 1972 DH 2.9 million of the net-of-tax profit of DH 4.3 million. At this
rate, reserves of DH 10.4 million in 1968, will have increased to DH 20.8
million, equal to 7.2% of the estimated loan and equity portfolio outstanding,
by 1972. In view of the fact that reserves already appear adequate, the
projected increase in dividends would appear justified. Obviously, the
situation would be better if BNDE could earn a higher spread on borrowed
funds, thereby being able both to pay higher dividends, which could enhance
share sales prospects, and to continue to develop surpluses.
56. On the basis of the forecasts, BNDE's liquidity position is expected to
improve from its current ratio of 0.93:1 in 1968 to 1.25:1 in 1972. Debt
service coverage, quite high in 1968 at 2.25, falls to a low of 1.15 in 1969
due to the repayment to IBRD of loan collections made at the end of 1968.
Coverage is estimated to remain above 1.2 until the end of the estimated
period of the Bank loan. BNDE's present debt limit of 4.5:1, as allowed and
defined in its Loan Agreements vith the Bank, is not e'pected to be approached
through 1974.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
57. BNDE continues as the major long-term lending institution to the
industrial private sector, and it has assisted over the past few years a
majority of new industrial and tourism investments undertaken in Morocco.
Direct loan commitments will likely reach a new record in 1969 of DH 66
million.
58. In order to improve its decision-making procedures, BNDE created in
1968 an Executive Committee with powers to approve loans and investments up
to DH 4 million.  It still has to strengthen management by appointing a
suitable deputy to the Director General who is heavily burdened with work.
*         No delay should occur in ihe appointment of a deputy which should, on present
plans, be effective by August 1970.
59. Some progress has been made in the past year in appraisal methodology,
strengthening of staff and thoroughness of work. Also, follow-up work
has improved. Internal coordination is wanting, an area in which an active
Deputy General Manager could be of great help. If this internal coordina-
tion is provided, BNDE's work could improve reasonably fast since the
organization already has a good number of able staff members with increasing
experience. Further improvements are needed on the marketing and economic
aspects of appraisals.
60. A review of BNDE's portfolio has not uncovered any striking weaknesses
that cause special concern; the position is, therefore, better than it was
a year or so ago. The recent improvements in the textile industry have
helped. However, that industry, which accounts for the largest exposure of
BNDE, is heavily dependent on weather variations which determine purchasing
power, and the situation has to be kept under constant review. Otherwise,
BNDE's financial position appears reasonably sound and reserves appear
adequate to cover any foreseeable losses.  BNDE is liquid and able to meet
its financial obligations.
61. BNDEts profitability prospects are adequate but not bright. Though
the share capital reduction has improved earnings per share, it is at this
time unlikely that the shares will become rapidly marketable, above their
par value, in view of the poor prospects for large increases in earnings
and dividends in the near future.
62. Though the cost of capital in Morocco has not yet been the subject of a
systematic inquiry, BNDEts interest rate appears low and might, as such,
channel scarce resources into uneconomic investments.  It is therefore en-
couraging that BNDE will apply stricter criteria regarding an acceptable re-
turn on investments in the consideration of its projects. The general study



- 21 -
of Morocco's interest rate structure,planned for 1970, would also be a stvep
in the right direction.
Recommendations
63. Though there is likely to be limited hotel business, BNDE has attrac-
-          tive business prospects as demonstrated by a wfell-stocked project pipeline
consisting of a variety of industries. Most of these projects require
financing of import needs.
6h. BNDE is presently negotiating for a loan from AID. Other sources have
been pursued for assistance but cannot be counted on. Therefore, BNDE is
looking to the Bank to meet the balance of its needs. Given its business
prospects and its record, BNDE is a suitable and creditworthy
borrower for a Bank loan. However, in order to encourage BNDE's continued
search for other resources, and to give impetus to the improvements BNDE
still has to effect in its organization, a loan is recommended to cover
BNDE's estimated foreign exchange needs for about 15 months instead of a
longer period. Accordingly, an appropriate amount will be the equivalent
of US $15 million.
65. The features of the proposed loan should be those normally applied to
loans to development finance companies and the loan should be available to
finance BNDE's import needs in respect of investment projects
financed by it. The financing of public sector projects should be permitted
but in each case the Bankts prior approval should be required. In recogni-
tion of improvements in technique of appraisal as well as the growing
experience of BNDE's management and staff, an increase in BNDE's free limit
from the present $150,000 to $300,000 is justified. This is recommended
-with an aggregate free limit of US $4 million. Such an increase would still
leave more than two thirds of the proposed loan requiring prior Bank approval.

BANQUE NATIONALE POUR LE DEVELOPPENENT ECONOMIQUE
Statement of Policy            -
(Approved by the Board of Directors on March 29, 1963,
and Amended on March 7, 1966 and September 24, 1968)
1.        BNDE's general investment policy will be guided by the
following principles:
(a)   BNDE's objective will be the encouragement of
productive investment in Morocco, chiefly in the
industrial field. To that end it will assist par-
ticularly in the financing of private industrial
enterprises to which the major portion of its
resources will be devoted,
(b)   BNDE will assist a non-private enterprise only in
special circumstances, and when private capital cannot
be found on reasonable terms to carry out the project.
(c)   BNDE will assist a non-industrial enterprise only
when capital cannot be found elsewhere on reasonable
terms.
An enterprise will not be considered "private" if the Government or any
of its agencies directly or indirectly hold 50% or more of its out-
standing voting stock.
2.        BNDE will consider enterprises only on the basis of their
economic and financial merits. To this end, projects wiLl be analyzed
as to their economic desirability, technical feasibility, financial
soundness, management competence, etc., to insure that only sound pro-
ductive ventures are financed B!TDE will finance only projects which:
(a)   have a high economic priority, and
(b)   promise to provide a satisfactory rate of return
on the investment.
BNDE will perform adequate supervision of the operations it finances.
3.        BNDE should, as appropriate, make use of a variety of forms
of investment, including, within the limits of sound financial practice,
equity participations, and the underwriting or participation in the
underwriting of securities sold by investment enterprises.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        In order to assist the development of the Moroccan capital market,
BNDE should stand ready to sell portions of its investments to other
private investors, with due respect to its own interests and to those of
the other participants in the investments sold.
5.        When one or more commercial banks participate with BNDE in
*    ~      lending to an enterprise, BNDE should exert every effort to ensure that
the terms of all the loans, taken together, are well suited to the needs
of the enterprise.
6.        BNDE should, whenever appropriate, extend technical assistance
to its clients in respect of the formulation, execution and operation of
projects.
7.        BNDE should not normally make direct loans or other investments
in favor of one single enterprise aggregating more than 10% of BNDEts
paid-up capital, reserves and outstanding long-term Government loans, with
the exception of such loans and investments which are covered by a Govern-
erient guarantee or guarantee from the Caisse Centrale de Garanties or by a
bank guarantee after examination of the financial position of the bank
concerned. In entering into discounting arrangements with a commercial
bank, involving contingent liabilities, BNDE will limit the amount of its
individual commitments on the basis of its assessment of the financial
positicn of the bank concerned and in the light of BNDE's share capital
and reserves.
8.        In general, BNDE should not take any single equity participation
larger than the smaller of (a) 10% of BNDEts paid-up capital and reserves
and (b) 25% of the share capital of the investment enterprise concerned.
In the case of underwritings, BNDE might take a larger commitment in the
faith that it will not in fact have to take up more than the proportion
of shares here indicated.
9.        BNDE will build reserves consistent with sound financial practice.
It will annually appropriate a portion of its income to reserves.  Appro-
priations will be made so as to build up total reserves to a level that is
appropriate to the size and quality of BNDE's portfolio of loans and
equity investments, while permitting the distribution of an adequate divi-
dend to BNDE's shareholders.  The Board of BNDE will review every year the
situation in this respect.
