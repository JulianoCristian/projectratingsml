the Critical Imports\n            Rehabilitation Loan Project, a quick-disbursing US$40\n            million loan, is to support the initial phases of the\n            government's stabilization and reform program by\n            facilitating (1) structural reform, primarily enterprise and\n            banking reform; (2) macroeconomic stabilization; (3)\n            establishing financially viable and effective social sector\n            policies and institutions; and (4) rebuilding and\n            rehabilitating Bulgaria's infrastructure and improving\n            the environment, and by improving the effectiveness of World\n            Bank operations. The proceeds of the loan will help finance\n            the immediate import of socially important goods currently\n            in very short supply, whose immediate availability is\n            crucial to easing pressures faced by Bulgarian households,\n            and to helping achieve greater acceptance of the\n            government's economic policies, particularly its\n            far-reaching stabilization and reform program."}, "docdt": "1997-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
