mixed results, for while the\n            Critical Imports Rehabilitation Loan (CIRL), and the\n            Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL) are\n            rated satisfactory, with a likely sustainability, the\n            Rehabilitation Loan (RL) is rated unsatisfactory, and\n            sustainability is unlikely. The key lessons address\n            primarily, the credibility issue during a critical period,\n            when although actions were taken in 1996 to reverse the\n            economic decline, and arrest the financial crisis,\n            incomplete efforts led to the fall of the government. The\n            interim government however, took immediate actions towards\n            economic stabilization, and structural adjustment reform\n            programs, setting the Currency Board, which established the\n            credibility in Government's policies. The effective\n            coordination among the international financial institutions,\n            and development partners contributed to successful reform\n            programs. However, the report reinforces the notion that one\n            tranche, quick disbursement operations, are appropriate only\n            if, agreed multi-year programs are in place, to be supported\n            by a series of lending operations, and, if uncertainty\n            significantly affects institutional strength, thus requiring\n            continued re-calibration of project design, implementation,\n            and performance."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
