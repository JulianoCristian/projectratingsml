SECOND FELCRA LAND D!VELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Su ary
Borrower:             Malaysia
Beneficiary:          Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitatiotn Authority
(FELCRA)
Loan Amount:          US$66.0 million
Terms:                Repayable in 15 years including 3 years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project Description: The project would support Government's program for the
rehabilitation of idle smallholder Lands to raise the
rural standard of living and the level and efficiency of
agricultural production for export revenue generation.
It would be the third Bank-assisted project for FELCRA
and would finance over three years most of FELCRA's land
development program and associated investments including
an expenditure time slice of the agricultural development
costs.  The project would replant some 45,000 ha wicr oil
palm, ibber and other crops and maintain during the
development phase a further 69,000 ha replanted prior to
the project, in group farming schemes managed by .'ELCRA,
construct scheme access roads and buildings, two palm oil
mills deferred from other FELCRA projects and a Central
Training Center, provide vehicles and equipment and
strengthen FELCRA's management services.
Benefits and Risks:  Incremental production and revenues from the production
of palm oil, rubber and diversiUed crops and improved
farm incomes for some 18.000 households, including a
large number of small farmers previously earning under
the poverty level. There are no significant implementa-
'tion risks although the project imposes a Government
obligation to fund completion and maintenance of scheme
infrastructure, and, over the longer term, would be
vulnerable to major fluctuations in commodity prices.

SECOND FELCRA LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
Agriculture in the Econoq
1.1       Malaysia's agricultural sector continues to play a key role in the
economy, although its relative importance is declining as the country proceeds
towards industrialization. In 1986, the sector's share of GDP was 20Z, down
from 24% in 1980. During the same period, the share of sectoral employment
fell from about 40% of total to 32%, with a drop in absolute numbers working
in agriculture, from an estimated 1.9 million in 1980 to 1.7 million in
1986. This has placed some constraints on agricultural production, with
occasional harvest losses in tree crops and often sub-optimal cultural
practices in padi. Nonetheless, Malaysia's long-run agricultural growth rate
has been high by any standards. During the 1960s and much of the 19709, real
output grew at 7% per annum. As for the rest of the economy, however, this
rate slowed in the 19809 to 2.5% per annum (1984-1986), largely as a result of
decelerating expansion of the land frontier, which in turn is traceable to
reduced public expenditure programs brought on by falling commodity prices and
their negative impact on Government revenue. Commodity exports remain the
mainstay (60%) of Malaysia's foreign income: tree crops, commodities, mining
output and manufactures have contributed about one-third each to total export
value, with agriculture's share being gradually eroded in favor of industry.
1.2       Sector Composition.  About one-third of Peninsular Malaysia and 5%
of East Malaysia are under cultivation; most of the remaining area is under
tropical forest or secondary regrowth. The total cultivated area is estimated
to be about 5 million hectares. Tree crops are planted on about 4 million ha,
(rubber 1.9 million, oil palm 1.6 million, cocoa and coconut 0 3 million
each), padi on 0.6 million ha and the balance in minor crops.*   Rubber has
long been the largest crop area, but it is being overtaken by oil palm because
of relatively higher profitability and a growing scarcity of rubber tappers.
Interest in coconuts has declined but cocoa area has expanded at an annual 23%
increase for almost two decades, rising from 2,000 ha in 1960 to 307,200 by
1986. Food production has generally stagnated over the same period, as
incomes have not been competitivIe with those from tree crops or off-farm
work. Padi production in particular has fallen steadily.
1.3       The Government's 1984 Household Income Survey estimated that 864,000
households, 32% of the national total of 2.6 million households for that year,
were primarily employed in farming. Some 155,000 were rubber smallholders,
116,000 padi growers, 100,000 oil palm growers, 81,000 estate workers, and the
rest divided among mixed farming and fishing. To these must be added large
1/   Areas projected for 1987, Ministry of Finance Economic Reports.

numbers of undocumented immigrant laborers in padi and tree crops.  Whereas
padi growers are almost entirely smallholders with less than 3 ha each, the
organization of tree crops is characterized by a large, but declining, private
estate presence (Table 1.1). Government is trying to offset the reducing
share of these estates in the industry through its public smallholder settle-
ment programs.

The Tree Crop Sector
1.4       Malaysia's climate and soil conditions provide a strong comparative
advantage for tree crop development, and the country is the world's largest
producer and exporter of rubber and palm oil. In 1984, Malaysia accounted for
about 36% of the world's natural rubber output and 44% of exports, and more
than half of the world's palm oil production and 61% of exports (Table 1.2).
Malaysia is also a major exporter of wood and timber.

1.5       Yields.   Malaysian yields are high, both on total planted area and
on mature area. For oil palm, overall yield of fresh fruit bunch (ffb) in
1986 averaged 18 tons/hA compared with 9.5 tons/ha and 11.9 tons/ha for
Indonesia and Thailand, respectively. Dry rubber yields were about 760 kg/ha,
compared with 400-500 kg/ha for Malaysia's two neighbors, and the overall
cocoa yield of 600 kg/ha (dry beans) was also superior Lo those of other major
world producers (Ivory Coast 514 kg/ha; Brazil 580 kg/ha; Ghana 170 kg/ha).
It is important to note that these overall yields greatly underestimaste the
high average yields, among the world's highest, of Malaysia's mature produc-
tion areas. For 1985, the yields for estate oil palm were about 23 ton ffb/ha;
for estate rubber 1,338 kg/ha and for smallholdings about 800 kg/ha; for
estate cocoa over 1,000 kg/ha and smallholder cocoa about 400 kg/ha.
Malaysia's yield superiority reflec.s strong natural production advantages,
and good institutional performance ox research, extension, and marketing based
on individual commodity specialization. As a result, despite increasing labor
costs, Malaysia's high yields and wide use of advanced technology result in
significantly lower marginal production costs for all three crops compared to
those of most competitcrs. Government policy concentrates on organizing
smallholders into quasi-estate arrangements to transfer the institutional
advantages and technology needed to reach the higher yields. For example, the
Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) has settled 94,000 smallholders
(Fifth Malaysia Plan, 1986) in schemes analagous to estates, in terms of
performance. The strategy is a key part of policy initiatives to raise rural
incomes and generate foreign exchange and is also being followed by the
Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) and the
Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA) for their
respective target groups.
1.6       Future Prospects.  Labor cost is the major issue for rubber,
Malaysia's cost of tapping being approximately two to three times that of
Indonesia and Thailand. The major issues for oil palm, however, are access to
foreign markets and price instability. In 1985, f.o.b. palm oil prices
dropped from M$1,600/tor, to M$450/ton and have since recovered to M$750/ton.
While a price of M$750/ton covers the long-run cost of production (including
replanting), income fluctuations have caused major disruptions in the indus-
try.
1.7       Malaysia's production of edible oils is virtually unprotected,
either by exchange rate manipulation or price programs, but it faces formida-
ble barriers from domestic and export intervention programs of competitors,
both those producing palm oil for exports and those producing substitutable
edible oils. In 1984, palm oil cost less than one-half that of soy oil to
produce; the weighted average cost of major palm oil producers was US$250/ton
against US$570/ton for soy oil and US$750/ton for rape seed oil.  Because of
its dominance in production, the palm oil production cost is predominantly
that of Malaysia.
1.8       Quite clearly, future labor productivity in rubber, and market ac-
cess in palm oil, will affect future land use, employment, growth and other
indicators of economic well-being. Based on immature plantings already estab-
lished and the longevity of intervention programs, it is expected that
Malaysia's tree crops export position will remain strong. The corollary is



that policy must concentrate on cost-reduction. The obvious course is to ex-
ploit the gap between estate and smallholder performance, as Government is
attemping to do through the rehabilitation and consolidation of smallholdings
under FELCRA.
Agricultural Issues
1.9       Diversification.  Malaysia's agriculture, and to a large extent the
whole economy, is highly dependent on what happens in the rubber and palm oil
industries. Hence the need to diversify has preoccupied policymakers for most
of this century an5 quite substantial resources have been invested in diversi-
fication programs._/  Diversification within the tree crop group has been very
successful (from rubber to oil palm, cocoa, coffee), but diversification into
annual food crops has had only mixed results. Despite the relatively high
subsidy protection for food production, the long-run average returns to grow-
ers are still in favor of tree crops. Padi, which has been the focus of the
Government's food security program, enjoys free fertilizer, subsidized credit,
guaranteed purchase prices and other transfers, but production continues to
fall with low commodity prices and often unsatisfactory yields. This had led
the Government to rethink its agricultural strategy, since the gains from spe-
cialization are high (rubber and palm oil exports average M$7 billion annual-
ly, excluding the value of manufactures based on these commodities), while
total food imports average only M$3 billion. Looking to the future, other
diversification possibilities for which Malaysia is apparently suited in terms
of climate and soils seem limited but would include some fruits, especially
bananas, and vegetables. However, progress over the medium term will be quite
slow, as major efforts are needed to develop suitable production and post-
harvest technologies, particularly for fruits.
1.10      Rural Poverty.  Absolute poverty defined as not having access to
basic subsistence requirements is not considered significant in Malaysia,
although relative poverty defined as not having access to the country's
average level of consumption goods and services remains high at about 24% in
rural areas, compared with only about 8% in urban areas (Household Income
Survey, 1984). Rural poverty is most intense among padi growers, coconut
smallholders and rubber smallholders, and the smallness of farm size is seen
as the major cause. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the incidence of
rural poverty has in fact declined by more than half from its level of 58% in
1970, under the impact of expanding government-sponsored schemes to group
smallholders into more efficient and remunerative production units, and acce-
lerating industrialization which has increased farm family incomes through
access to off-farm work. Unfortunately, the growth of off-farm work has led
to increased part-time farming with attendant productivity problems and the
locking up of land that would otherwise be available for farm size growth of
small fragmented holdings. Ihe migration to urban areas continues despite a
reduced rate of non-farm job creation and increasing urban unemployment. This
has led Government to review its employment creation strategies and to focus

Agricultural DiversificaLion Prospects.



-5-
on improving productivity and incomes of smallholders as a way to relieve
pressure on urban facilities. The Fifth Malaysia Plan, 1986-1990, provides
for a major stress on in-situ development through rehabilitation and consoli-
dation of unorganized smallholders, primarily for production of tree crops,
which offer the highest returns to labor. For this FELCRA is the lead insti-
tution.
Bank Sector Strategy
1.11      The Bank has consistently supported the Government's objectives and
institution-building efforts in agriculture. To date, the Bank has made 24
agricultural loans, amounting to US$781.3 million, or nearly 45X of total
lending to Malaysia. Of these, the most successful have been the six loans to
assist implementation of some 66 FELDA settlement schemes, based on tree crop
development in the states of Pahagg, Johor and Negeri Sembilan (Loans 533,
672, 885, 967, 1044 and 1590-MA).-   Results from two FELCRA projects have
also been quite good (paras. 2.12-2.13). Success has been mixed among other
area development projects, which focussed on existing small farms units pro-
ducing foodcrops, particularly rice. Problems have included smallness of farm
size, shortage of irrigation water and consequent out-migration of labor.
However, in ecologically favored zones there have been notable successes
(e.g., the MUDA Irrieation Projects financed under Loans 434 and 1717-MA,
which have led to a doubling of cropping intensity, increased yields and
strong institutional development). Government policy now emphasizes the need
to concentrate on developmen; of older areas with entrenched rural poverty.
The Bank supports this view MI and in more recent years has been assisting the
Government in its efforts to support structural change within agriculture.
While some new settlement schemes may be justified, future Bank financing for
agriculture will concentrate mainly on the consolidation of older areas, pro-
duct diversification and policy changes to foster increased efficiency within
the sector.
II. SMALLHOLPER LAND DEVELOPMENT AND FELCRA
2.1       Malaysia has a history of successful government organized land de-
velopment programs for smallholders. Three factors have contributed to this
success:  the programs have been well designed and implemented; they are
modelled on the highly successful and productive Malaysian private estate
sector, which is characterized by modern production technology and skilled
management; and the crops chosen are commercially valuable tree crops (mainly
rubber and oil palm) for which Malaysia has natural and comparative production
advantages. The largest of the implementing agencies is FELDA, traditionally
concerned with opening up tracts of new State lands for settlement, usually

landless farmers. The second and expanding parastatal, FELCRA, focuses on the
rehabilitation of low producing and/or idle smallholdings, through replanting
with high value perennial crops.
Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA)
2.2       Origin.  FELCRA was established in 1966 under the National Land
Rehabilitation and Consolidation Authority (Incorporation) Act, as a Federal
statutory body linked with the MinisLry of Land and Regional Development. In
the early 1960s many of the States had alienated large tracts of land to
farmers whose existing land holdings were too small to provide an adequate
income. However, in most cases the new holdings were beyond the individual's
capacity to develop, and the need to deal with this problem gave rise to the
establishim2ent of FELCRA. FELCRA's original mandate was to rehabilitate or
develop State land schemes at the request or with the approval of the appro-
priate State authority, and to rehabilitate or develop privately-held lands at
the request of the owners on agreed terms. These functions were expanded
under the FELCRA Amendment Act of 1985, which provides for the Authority to:
(a) consolidate State and alienated lands; (b) extend its operational area to
East Malaysia; (c) implement additional activities for residential, transpor-
tation, financial, commercial, industrial and social development; and (d)
promote and assist corpor2ions and enter into business arrangements with any
entity for the purposes of the Act. The focus of FELCRA is now on the rehabi-
litation of idle lands especially those with potential for tree crop produc-
tion. In July 1987, FELCRA was transferred to the Ministry of National and
Rural Development, which has a strong orientation to the qualities and upgrad-
ing of rural life, promotion of cottage industry skills and opportunities for
entrepreneurism. The Ministry is not, however, contemplating any change in
the basic direction or substance of FELCRA's idle land development program.
2.3       Since its inception, FELCRA has grown into an effective agency,
baving a major impact on the well-being of many rural communities. Its land
schemes are scattered and visible throughout Peninsula Malaysia. In Sarawak
it is involved in some special rehabilitation schemes and it has no presence
in Sabah. FELCRA supports the Government's Fifth Malaysia Plan (FMP) objec-
tives of (a) adding to national revenues through the production of export
industrial/food crops, and (b) countering urban drift by increasing rural
incomes and improving the quality of rural life.
2.4       Organization.  The organizational structure of FELCRA is depicted in
Figure 1. FELCRA, a fully budgeted agency of the Ministry of National and
Rural Development, operates as a statutory body under a Board of Directors,
consisting of 15 representatives of various Central and State government
agencies and FELCRA's Director-General. The Board determines operational
policy and management to meet the Agency's objectives as set by Government.
FELCRA's administrative structure was modified substantially in 1986 to meet
the challenges of its expanding role, particularly in respect of Government's
rehabilitation of idle land program and to further improve its management
capacity. Under the Director General and his Deputy, there are seven divi-
sions, each headed by an executive director and assisted by deputy and princi-
pal assistant directors as required. The divisions function at the three
operational levels of Head Office (Kuala Lumpur), State offices and scheme



-7-
clusters with 17%, 12% and 71% respectively of total staff in 1986. The seven
divisions consist of (i) Planning and Development; (ii) Technical Services
(for agriculture and civil works); (iii) Implementation; (iv) Marketing and
Processing; (v) Social Services; (vi) Management Services (for finance,
personnel, procurement and training); and (vii) the Trans-Perak Area
Development Project. The functions and organization of these divisions is
described in Annex 5. FELCRA maintains eleven offices in the States, (includ-
ing Sarawak and with Kedah and Perlis combined as one unit), each under a
State Director assisted by professional and support staff with duties matched
to the seven head office divisions. At field level, there is a hierarchical
system of scheme managers and supervisors spread over three staff grades, with
the number and grades of these personnel varying with cluster area. The total
number of FELCRA staff at end 1986 was about 2,900 persons including about
1,100 persons (38%) for scheme management and supervision at the field
level. FELCRA has upgraded all scheme management positions by bringing
salaries more in line with the estate sector, so as to increase its recruiting
competitiveness for qualified staff. As a large proportion of academically
qualified potential recruits lack field experience, the Training Division both
organizes technical courses and seconds trainees to estates for specific work
experience. Staff turnover within FELCRA is very small (1% in 1985). Staff
are typically dedicated to the Authority's aims and exhibit good interrela-
tionships. Senior management has a long in-house service record and is well-
experienced to support the proposed levels of project implementation.
FETCRA Land Development Program
2.5       Several kinds of schemes have been implemented by FELCRA at various
times to rehabilitate unproductive agricultural lands. These include blocks
of titled smallholdings, sometimes with inclusion of some State land to
increase farm sizes, State Government fringe schemes and special purpose
schemes. Ali. involve a group farming approach under FELCRA management, which
continues indefinitely into the production years. The rehabilitation program
involving titled smallholder lands was originally concerned with unproductive,
senile or overgrown tree crops lands, in most cases originally planted with
rubber. Since 1985, however, the program has increasingly involved idle
agricultural lands including old padi areas suitable for oil palm. In situa-
tions with poor farmers owning very small holdings as their only or principal
source of livelihood, FELCRA has endeavored, where feasible, to incorporate by
consolidation, nearby or occluded State lands into the schemes in order to
increase minimum individual farm size to 2.43 ha (6 acres). Consolidation is
not part of the recent idle land rehabilitation program. The fringe schemes
consist of the rehabilitation by replanting of blocks of land, often large,
originally opened up by State governments for and in the vicinity of land-poor
villages to incr ase their land resource base. Most of these had failed
either because villagers had been left responsible to develop the land without
adequate technical and capital resources or the State's management and techno-
logy inputs were weak. Until 1985, much of FELCRA's program had involved
taking over the development of many of these areas at the request of States,
with the lands being first covenanted to FELCRA, but with the introduction of
the idle land program FELCRA has withdrawn from operating further fringe
schemes. Another type of rehabilitation has been the direct consolidation
scheme of which three have been implemented. In these, FELCRA provided a



-8-
total development package to one or more adjacent villages consisting of both
agricultural rehabilitation and village restructuring. None of these schemes
are scheduled for the project period. FELCRA also continues to be involved in
a number of special type group land development schemes, sometimes involving
cooperation with other agencies and special Government funding. These include
youth settlement schemes, now being phased out of FELCRA's development
program, schemes for aborigine lands and others for farmers in very remote
areas including Sarawak.
2.6       In all rehabilitation schemes, FELCRA's operations have involved the
planting, mostly as replanting, of areas with improved high-yielding varieties
of tree crops under a strategy of group farming. The group farming unit is a
melding of small farms into a single production and management unit. In the
schemes for alienated smallholdings, the participants covenant their land to
FELCRA. The States have done similarly for the fringe schemes. The shared
costs of developing the crops and infrastructure of the schemes, but excluding
access roads, utilities, office and staff housing, are charged as a loan to
each participant which is for recovery by FELCRA from the new crop revenue
(para. 2.10(c)). In return for the covenant, titleholders benefit from FELCRA
management and receive a pro rata share of the value of net production
income. Generally, a scheme will be formed only if there is a prospect of
forming a unit of at least 50 ha, not necessarily all contiguous land but it
may be initiated with a lesser area providing an existing management unit is
available nearby. Further all schemes must show an estimated economic rate of
return of least lOX before approval. The average area of rehabilitation
excluding fringe, schemes is about 100 ha. Fringe schemes are several times
larger. Schemes in the same general area are grouped into clusters for
management purposes. At end 1986, there were 630 schemes and 137 clusters,
with an average area of 260 ha and 880 ha respectively. The management
structure depends on cluster size. Scheme participants are encouraged to work
both in maintaining the crop during its immature stage and in harvesting
(FELCRA arranges land clearing and planting under contract). Currently, about
50X of all participants are actively involved in scheme work as daily rated
labor. Contractors may also use outside labor, but they must give employment
priority to scheme participants who want to work. Most participants are
traditionailly tree crop farmers familiar with the production routines for
rubber and to a lesser extent oil palm. Even for the idle padi lands, all
outside rice bowl areas, the farms mostly include areas of tree crop on higher
ground thus ensuring the farmers of tree crop experience.
2.7       In all types of schemes, the group farming approach involves the use
of FELCRA management over an extended period of up to 25 years from the initi-
ation of planting into the crop production years, and continuing at least un-
til participant development loans have been repaid. This close and cohesive
management involvement will put increasing pressure on Government and FELCRA
in the coming years to provide the levels of manpower and budget required to
maintain this system, particularly in view of FELCRA's now rapidly expanding
program. Thus it is envisaged that eventually, as loans approach full repay-
ment, FELCRA would progressively initiate a transfer of responsibility for
scheme operations and management to the members through installation of appro-
priate group management structures.  It is expected that the initiative for
this management devolution would be developed by Government in the coming



- 9 -
years within the framework of its national agricultural policy of ensuring
strong socio-economic development of the smallholder sector and its production
efficiency.

Bank (ADB)).
In the aggregate, about 36,000 participant families have benefitted from the
164,000 ha thus far developed. About 951 of the total development area has
been planted with oil palm and rubber with the remainder in padi (6,700 ha in
Trans Perak project), cocoa and pepper. The proportion of oil palm to rubber
has risen rapidly in recent years from about 20% up to 1980 to 90% in 1986.
By late 1986, there were 73 oil palm schemes and 54 rubber schemes in produc-
tion; their performance is sunmmarized in Table 2.2.

/a   Production averages of the early 15 oil palm and 20

yield phase of the crops.
The average yields are about 25% lower than those of good private estates
where technology and management inputs are more intensive, but only slightly
lower than those of FELDA's schemes. Compared with the individual rubber
smaliholder sector however (the equivalent oil palm sector is very small and
unmonitored), the FELCRA yields are about 25Z superior for replanted rubber
(1,400 kg/ha dry rubber) and several times better than unimproved rubber (300-
400 kg/ha dry rubber). FELCRA's average performance is improving.
2.9       Farmer Income.  The average net monthly incomes paid to FELCRA
participants in 1986 by crop and type of scheme, are shown in Table 2.3.
Although it was a year of low commodity prices and schemes were mostly in the
early years of harvest and well below full production levels, the incomes are
generally above the government poverty benchmark of M$360/month. The dramatic
fall in world palm oil prices in 1985 caused income for oil palm scheme
participants to drop sharply compared with earlier years, to a level margin-
ally lower than that for rubber growers. Youth schemes show higher incomes as
they provide 4 ha/farmer compared to the average farm unit size of 2.5 ha in
rehabilitation schemes. However, many participantR supplement their farm
incomes by daily wages for scheme work (averaging M$165/month over all schemes
and participants in 1985) and other outside sources.

2.10      Training and Farmer Development.  FELCRA provides comprehensive
training opportunities for staff to upgrade their iob skills, and for scheme
participants and their dependents for improving skills and inculcating disci-
pline and self-reliance. Training courses for farmers provide the technolo-
gies of growing tree crops; supplementary agricultural pursuits such as
vegetables, livestock, poultry and bees; business skills, leadership and
religion. About 1,100 farmers received training in the period 1982-85, about
the same number aS in the previous 15 years. Programs for family members
include training in cottage industries and vocational training for youths.
The main training establishment is administered by the Management Services
Division, through a sub-unit under the Deputy Director for Administration and
Personnel, with operations carried out under the direction of the Principal
Assistant Director of Training. Training of scheme participants and depen-
dents in the skills of rural industries and cooperatives is included in the
portfolio of the Settlers Affairs Division. The Training Advisor, who has
made an important contribution to the development of FELCRA's training policy
and program, interacts closely with the training network but to preserve an
independent status, reports to the Director-General.
FELCRA Funding and Financial Condition
2.11      Funding.  FELCRA operations are funded by Government grants and
loans, and, to a limited extent, by internal fund generation from interest on
advances for land development, marketing service charges and fees, and
interest on deposits. The distribution of FELCRA's sources of funds during
1984-1986 is shown in Table 2.4.

- 12 -
(a) Government Grants. The bulk of FELCRA's capital account is derived
from two types of Government grants: development grants for capital expendi-
tures and scheme infrastructure, and administrative grants for staff salaries
and administrative expenses. All grant receipts and corresponding expendi-
tures are recorded in the form of income and expense statements and are
incorporated into the FELCRA Consolidated Statement of Accounts. As of end-
1986, the cumulative outstanding balance on development grants was M$95.4 mil-
lion representing the unexpensed or unamortized value of assets, such as fixed
assets, work in progress, working capital, etc., financed by the fund, while
that on administrative grants was M$21.7 million representing surpluses on
salary and administrative expenses, which FELCRA uses to supplement its land
development activities.
(b) Government Loans. FELCRA borrows from the Government for agricul-
tural development, settler housing, and mill construction. Total outstanding
borrowings as of end 1986 were M$441.3 million, comprising M$356.6 million for
agriculture, M$14.1 million for housing, M$36.6 million for mill construction
and M$32.9 million of current dues on earlier Government loans. New
Government loans for agricultural development and settler housing ultimately
convert to settler loans and are, in principle, the only source of financing
for FELCRA's agricultural investments. In practice, however, by end-1986
spending for these purposes exceeded Government loan disbursements by M$50.8
million and this was reflected as a deficit in the land development loan
account. Financing for such additional development activities comes from
advanced loan collections from settlers which are not yet due for repayment to
the Government. Repayment beyond the amount collected is determined primarily
by FELCRA's actual and projected liquidity position. There are no interest or
penalty charges on due Government loans regardless of the initial interest
rate.
(c) Settler Loans. FELCRA onlends Government loans to settlers on the
same terms and conditions that it borrows from Government. These terms and
conditions, summarized in Annex 3 Table 1, vary with the time of loan approval
and range from 0-6.5% annual interest rate, and with a 15 to 25-year repayment
period. Total participant loans for land development including interest
totalled M$451 million at end 1985. Because FELCRA does not have a good
computerized loan accounting system, statistics on loan collection are not
readily available. Based on the ratio of cumulative collections from settlers
to cumulative loans due, loan recovery up to end 1985 amounted to M$52.0
million while the outstanding amount due was about M$69.0 million. Despite a
substantial improvement in loan collection, from 35% in 1980 to 57% in 1986,
the present rate remains low. This stems principally from the mismatching of
the terms of earlier Government loans during 1967-76, which carried a 15-year
repayment period, and the longer time required for oilpalm and rubber develop-
ment to generate sufficient revenue. The Government has been requested to
consider restructuring these earlier loans, stretching their repayment periods
to 25 years, which would substantially reduce arrears until these loans are
fully amortized over the new 25-year terms.
2.12      Financial Condition.  FELCRA's financial condition is sound.  Based
on their Fifth Malaysian Plan budget and development program, expected parti-



- 13 -
cipant loan recoveries, and palm oil mill results,the 5-year proforma cash
flow demonstrates adequate short term liquidity and projected long-term
solvency (Annex 3, Table 3). At end 1986 total assets of M$685.4 million had
more than doubled since 1981. Land development inclusive of settler housing
comprised 84Z of fixed assets while mill accomints, consolidated on a net
assets basis, accounted for M$21.4 million or 4%. Assets were financed by 72%
debt and 28% equity, represented by the development, administrative revolving
and reserve funds and accumulated mill profit and loss. Liquidity has
improved greatly since the 1981-83 period when there was a combination of
over-budget land development expenditures, a large amount of due land develop-
ment loans and low loan recoveries, which resulted in FELCRA arrears to
Government climbing from M$6.7 million to M$61.9 million.  From that time
Government increased its annual budgetary support and the proportion of grant
monies over loan monies from 50% to 64%, FELCRA slowed its land development
program, and loan recoveries improved substantially. Arrears at end-1986 had
been reduced to M$35.3 million. Further, to reduce the M$50.8 million land
development deficit (para. 2.09 b), FELCRA is negotiating with Government for
supplemental financing to offset the M$21.7 million surplus administrative
grant against the deficit. Annex 3, Table 2 gives further details of FELCRA's
financial situation including the Consolidated Statement of Accounts to end
1986.
2.13      FELCRA's financial auditing is satisfactory.  FELCRA has an internal
auditing unit and there is an annual independent external audit by the Auditor
General who maintains an office within FELCRA. The main tasks of the internal
unit, with a current staff of 22 and reporting directly to the Director
General, are to: (i) verify and audit the imprest cash accounts at State and
scheme offices; (ii) verify and audit the stock and inventory held at state
offices and issued to schemes; (iii) audit, to the extent possible, contracts
up to M$25,000 granted by state offices; and (iv) audit of the procurement
division of FELCRA. A quarterly report is prepared for the Board.
Bank Experience with FELCRA
2.14      The Bank has two loans with FELCRA to assist in its land development
program. The first, for which FELCRA took over implementation responsibility
three years after the project had commenced, is the Trans-Perak Area
Development Project (Loan 1960-MA). The loan of $50 million was approved in
1981, but reduced to $30.65 million in 1987, to reflect lower than expected
costs of contracting and reduced village development. It finances about 8,850
ha of rice and 7,500 ha of tree crops (oil palm and cocoa). Implementation
was slow initially, with the change in implementing agency, poor performance
of early land development contracts and problems of impeded drainage.
However, progress is now very satisfactory and the project is expected to be
completed on target by mid-1989.
2.15      The second loan of $37.0 million for the FELCRA I Project (Loan
2013-MA), was also approved in 1981. It finances the rehabilitation of about
34,000 ha of smallholdings with rubber and oil palm through group farming
schemes, scheme infrastructure such as access roads, staff quarters and
offices, and the construction of three palm oil mills. Start-up was slow with
a change in the type of rubber planting material used and severe government



- 14 -
budgetary constraints of 1983/84, but the project has since made very strong
progress. Area under development has reached 157Z of target. Scheme infra-
structure, principally access roads and offices, which is developed 2-3 years
after planting, has been necessarily postponed, and only two of three planned
palm oil mills were completed on schedule. The third mill and much of the
delayed scheme infrastructure is now scheduled for construction under the new
project. Loan disbursement has been slow and lags behind commitments as a
result of the declining value of the US dollar and loan procurement and
withdrawal procedures inappropriate to numerous small land development
contracts and extensive force account work. The total of eligible accumulated
and committed project expenditures are, however, sufficient to more than fully
disburse the loan. Total disbursements were US$35.0 m as of February 11,
1988, and full utilization is expected shortly.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Origin and Preparation
3.1       The volume of FELCRA's future land development activities is expec-
ted to grow rapidly over the next decade, as the agency endeavors to play its
leading part in the Government's ambitious idle land rehabilitation program,
which has a national target of some half million hectares by 1995. Both
Government and FELCRA had expressed interest as early as 1985 in securing a
second Bank loan to ensure adequate financing of FELCRA's program under the
FMP 1986-90, and the Bank has indicated its willingness, in principle, to
continue its financial support of FELCRA's operations.
3.2       FELCRA prepared and submitted a detailed project proposal (Annex 5),
to the Bank in March 1986. It was structured similarly to FELCRA I, i:icluding
a series of project specific works for land development and associated infra-
structure. The experience of FELCRA I has shown, however, that a project
consisting of a large number of small schemes is difficult to handle under
usual Bank procurement and disbursement procedures. In view of FELCRA's good
implementation record under Loan 2013-MA, particularly in recent years, and
its familiarity with Bank procedures and requirements, the Bank proposed
instead an expenditure time-slice type of project of agreed works, covering
most of FELCRA's development investment program for the remaining years (1988-
90) of the FMP period outside the works financed under the on-going loans from
the Bank and ADB. This approach would afford FELCRA greater flexibility in
implementation, facilitate faster disbursement of loan funds to Government,
and allow the Bank/FELCRA dialogue to concentrate on key strategic and tech-
nical issues. As the proposed works constitute most of FELCRA's total on-
going development program, their preparation for implementation is also on-
going as scheduled and is satisfactory.
Project Objectives and Content
3.3       The proposed project would assist the Malaysian Government to
increase the level and efficiency of agricultural production of the small-
holder sector and export revenues, raise smallholder incomes, and curtail



- 15 -
urban drift by providing more rural job oppcrtunities and improving the
quality of rural life. These objectives would be achieved by rehabilitating
idle and low-yielding smallholdings, which would be organized into group
farming schemes based mainly on improved tree crop varieties and scme diver-
sified crops, using modern technology and management systems. The formation
of group farms would be supportive of government policy to build an efficient
agricultural sector based on larger sized, economic farm units. Access roads
and other scheme infrastructure, palm oil processing mills and farmer training
facilities would be constructed. The project would continue to strengthen the
institutional capacity of FELCRA initiated under the FELCRA I project through
development of stronger management structures, including computer data banks,
further staff training and provision of other support services. Based on
Government's allocation of funds to FELCRA for 1988-90, the project would
include:
(a) rehabilitation of up to 45,000 ha of idle and unproductive lands
under group farming arrangements with oil palm, rubber and diver-
sified crops;
(b) maintenance of about 99,000 ha of crops, including some 69,000 ha
rehabilitated prior to the project;
(c) construction of access roads, staff quarters, offices, and associa-
ted utilities;
(d) construction of four FELCRA State offices;
(e) construction and commissioning of two palm oil mills;
(f) construction of a Central Training Center and upgrading of a sub-
training center for FELCRA staff and farmers;
(g) provision of vehicles and equipment; and
(h) strengthening of institutional support services and management.
IBRD Map 20270 shows sites of the State offices, palm oil mills and training
centers.
3.4       The project to be implemented over three years would involve most of
FELCRA's development program and include time-slice financing of agricultural
development. The volume of proposed project activities would be closely
related to the total budgetary allocation which FELCRA expects to receive
during this period. Total funds available for the three-year project are
about M$470 million, comprising some M$390 million of development budget funds
and a M$70-80 million pro rata share of FELCRA's total expected operational
budget. The development budget amount is derived from FELCRA's total develop-
ment budget allocation for the FMP of M$787.7 million, less estimated 1986-87
expenditures of about M$350 million and requirements in 1988-90 of about M$50
million for investments not included in the project. These are the Trans
Perak project (Loan 1960-MA), the ADB-financed Pahang Barat project and
FELCRA's small social development program.

Project Components
3.5       Agricultural Development.  The agricultural development program
consists of the rehabilitation of smallholdings through planting and mainte-
nance of new schemes and the on-going maintenance of schemes established prior
to the project. Program details are summarized by crops and areas in Annex 1,
Table 1, and total estimated component costs are summarized in Annex 1,
Table 2.
(a) New Rehabilitation: The project would develop up to 45,000 ha of
idle and unproductive lands by rehabilitation at the rate of 15,000 ha annual-
ly and involving some 18,000 families. The predominant crops used in rehabi-
litation would be oil palm and rubber, but other crops such as bananas, fruit
trees, vegetables, coffee, cocoa and other locally suited crops would also be
included in appropriate agroclimatic locations and according to farmer
interest. The crop target ratio is 6:3;1 of oil palm, rubber and diversified
crops respectively, but the actual mix will depend on farmers' relative
expectations of profitability, as influenced by commodity prices prevailing at
the time of planting. Details of the replanting program are shown in
Table 3.1.

Total                15.0      15.0       15.0            45.0
Although most areas for rehabilitation would be suitable for either oil palm
or rubber, oil palm would predominate on idle padi lands, usually with some
drainage works, and would be the expected crop for most old rubber areas of
gentle terrain and suitable agroclimatic conditions. Rubber would be the
choice for steeper and broken terrain, especially in Kelantan, and for the
comparatively dry northwest states of Kedah and Perlis. Diversified crops
would be generally sited on more fertile areas of easy topography. As costs
of development to production of oil palm and rubber are not dissimilar, small
changes in the ratio for the two main crops from target would not greatly
affect total component investments. The average costs of crop establishment
from land clearing to completion of planting are estimated at M$2,200/ha for
oil palm and M$2,500/ha for rubber.  Diversified crops are costed as for oil
palm. Total base development cost for new rehabilitation is estimated at
M$103.5 million.



- 17 -
(b) Crop Maintenance. The project would cover maintenance costs during
crop development for about 99,000 ha of rehabilitation consisting of the
30,000 ha planted in 1988 and 1989 and 69,000 ha planted prior to the project
and which would be in various stages of development during the project
period. Included in the 69,000 ha is some 13,000 ha from the 1987 maintenance
program, for which retroactive financing is proposed (para. 3.17). The
cumulative total area for maintenance over three years would be 211,000 ha.
The number of participant families benefitting in the pre-project planted area
is estimated at about 27,000. Details by year and crop type are shown in
Table 3.2.

7T   Established schemes are those planted prior to 1988.
7T   Includes 13,000 ha of 1987 program for retroactive financing.
Under FELCRA practice, the maintenance period in the development of each crop
extends from the time of completed field planting until the first year of net
operating profit. These periods, averaging five years for oil palm and nine
years for rubber, have been adopted for project costing. Five years has been
assumed for costing of diversified crops. The average field maintenance cost
over the full development period is estimated at M$1,050/ha for oil palm,
M$770/ha for rubber and M$1,050/ha for other crops. Total project maintenance
investment would be about M$198 million, comprising about M$127 million for
oil palm, M$63 million for rubber, and M$8 million for diversified crops.
Costs are detailed in Annex 1, Table 2.



- 18 -
Scheme Infrastructure
3.6       The principal project infrastructure works would include scheme
access roads, staff quarters, produce-loading facilities, offices, stores and
utilities. As these works are normally implemented just prior to an agricul-
tural scheme coming into production, they would be applied to schemes planted
prior to the project. The total estimated component base cost of M$39.0
million comprises M$20.0 million for roads, M$14.0 million for buildings, and
M$5.0 million for utilities, as detailed in Annex 1, Table 3.
(a) Scheme Access Roads. These roads link schemes to existing public
roads and may vary in length from a few hundred meters to several kilo-
meters. Many schemes do not require an access road. Within FELCRA's budget
allocation of M$20.0 million for roads, it is proposed to construct a total of
about 160 kms, comprising 100 km in the first year and 30 km in each of the
next two years. The bigger program in 1988 reflects a carry forward of
delayed 1986 and 1987 works due to constrained budgets at that time. Imple-
mentation priorities are set so as to ensure adequate scheme access by the
time production commences. Although roads in areas without difficult terrain
typically cost about M$100,000/km, a higher unit cost of M$125,000/km has been
used to allow for difficult terrain and the high cost of bridges. The 1988
program includes five bridges estimated to cost, in total, about M$1.5 mil-
lion. Up to 90Z of the road construction program would be the responsibility
of the Public Works Department (PWD), to whom FELCRA assigns all roads longer
than 2 kms and any shorter roads requiring major bridge construction. Con-
struction would be to PWD's standard specification for rural roads. FELCRA
would undertake the balance of roads of under 2 km in length. In exceptional
circumstances, such as terrain prone to erosion, sections of road may be
metalled with tar at an additional cost of about M$100,000/km.
(b) Scheme Buildings. Within each scheme cluster and in the larger
units of a cluster, provision is made for offices, stores, garages and staff
houses in numbers determined by the area of the cluster. The project would
construct some 460 units of staff houses and 60 units of offices, stores and
garages at a total base cost of about M$11.7 million. Scheduling of the
building program by schemes would be similar to that for access roads.
(c) Loading Facilities. Loading facilities comprising loading ramps for
the collection and transport of oil palm fresh fruit bunches to factories and
collection centers of raised storage tank facilities for rubber latex for
scheme clusters above 200 ha would be provided for a total base cost of M$2.36
million.
(d) Scheme Water Supply. All schemes with staff quarters and offices
would be provided with a treated water supply, preferably by direct connection
to a State PWD reticulation system or otherwise by construction of a scheme
system of pumping from a surface source or deep wells. The budget allocation
of M$2.0 million should provide for the installation of a mix of about 26
systems, costing on average about M$75,000 each.



- 19 -
(e) Scheme Electricity Supply. All staff quarters and offices on
schemes would be provided, where possible, with electricity by connection to
the national grid, or where not possible, through installation by FELCRA of a
diesel generator of 10-42 kw size, depending on scheme area, at a cost of
M$30,000-M$65,000 each. The budget allocation of M$3.0 million for electri-
city supply should provide for about 66 installations.
3.7       Some land would have to be acquired for the construction of scheme
access roads and buildings. In the case of most roads this involves alienated
smallholders' lands. As of appraisal, acquisition had been nearly completed
for about 80 km of the 1988 road program (which includes 100 km. total), and
applications for most of the balance are being processed. FELCRA endeavours
to obtain State land wherever possible and convenient for scheme buildings.
The total cost of acquisition is estimated at M$4.0 million, comprising M$1.5
million for 80 ha for roads (about 0.5 ha/km) and M$2.5 million for about 130
ha for buildings (about 2.5 ha/scheme).  The Bank would not participate in
financing these costs.
Palm Oil Processing Mills
3.8       FELCRA is expanding its capacity to process oil palm fruit bunch
production for the benefit of scheme participants. The project would
construct two mills. Both are approved components of ongoing Bank-financed
projects: Tanjong Batu of the FELCRA I project (Loan 2013-MA), and Seberang
Perak of the Trans-Perak project (Loan 1960-KA). The Tanjung Batu mill has
been delayed by budget constraints and the Seberang Perak mill by slow agri-
cultural implementation . Neither mill would be completed within the imple-
mentation period of the respective projects. Design works for both mills,
each of a rated capacity of 30 tons ffb/hr, are ongoing. Constructions are
scheduled to start by end-1988. Both mills should be ready for commissioning
about eighteen months later and for normal operations by early-1991. It has
been established that the fruit bunch supply from mill command areas should be
sufficient for full or near full capacity operat-ions at that time. Total base
cost of the mills, including electrical and water supply works and equipment,
is estimated at M$34.0 million (M$16.6 million for Tanjung Batu and M$17.4
million for Seberang Perak). The higher cost of t4e latter reflects the
difficulties of construction in a high water table, coastal clay area and
engineering of the effluent treatment system. Both mills are designed to
fully meet effluent treatment and smoke abatement control standards in accor-
dance with Government's strictly enforced environmental protection laws.
Costing details are given in Annex 1, Table 4.
Vehicles and Equipment
3.9       The estimated total base cost of vehicles and equipment is M$11.6
million as shown in Annex 1, Table 5.
(a) Vehicles. A large fleet of vehicles is required to service the
numerous and expanding number of agricultural schemes. Requirements, deter-
mined principally on the basis of scheme and cluster area, are approximately
one four-wheel drive vehicle for each 200 ha, one tractor with 5 ton trailer
for every 200 ha of oil palm and one tractor with 3 ton trailer for every 400



- 20 -
ha of rubber. FELCRA has purchased a considerable number of these categories
of vehicles under the FELCRA I project, but additional numbers are required to
cover new schemes during 1988-90 include 68 four-wheel drives and 107 tractors
with trailer, for a combined estimated total cost of M$6.1 million. Other
vehicle requirements include 10 mid-mounted graders for scheme roadworks and
maintenance, and eight cars or trucks for use in administration, training and
work related to the mills. Total base cost of vehicles would be M$7.6 mil-
lion.
(b) Equipment. Purchase would comprise weighbridges for palm ffb,
miscellaneous equipment and furniture for new schemes and offices, and com-
puter hardware. This last would upgrade facilities for data information and
processing at the Head Office, provide computers at State offices and, by the
end of the project, integrate all systems.
Training
3.10      The project would assist FELCRA in zontinuing to develop its compre-
hensive training efforts for staff and farmers to: (a) support the agricul-
tural development program; and (b) further upgrade FELCRA's institutional
capabilities and skills. Physical facilities would be expanded; the number of
training programs increased, including provision for some overseas study; and
the services of a training aiisor would be retained. The total base cost of
the program is estimated at M$3.5 million, as detailed in Annex 1, Table 6. A
full description of the objectives, achievements and proposals of FELCRA's
training program is included in Annex 5.
(a) Training Center Facilities: The project would construct a Central
Training Center at Tebing Tinggi, near Segamat in North Johore. The complex
would consist of a lecture hall, seminar rooms, administrative block, library,
hostel for 200 residentials and other social amenities. Construction of the
Center is estimated to cost M$1.6 million, with an additional M$0.1 million
for equipment and furnishings. Tenders for construction are expected to be
called in mid-1988 so that the Center would be ready for use by end-1990.
Land for the complex has been allocated to FELCRA by the Johor State govern-
ment. An access road to the site has been constructed and an on-site water
supply is available. Facilities at FELCRA's Lekir subcenter near Lumut in
Perak, would also be upgraded at a total cost of about M$80,000. The proposed
works, all relatively minor, would be implemented in 1988.
(b) Local Training. A sum of about M$1.2 million is provided to cover
the costs of student subsistence allowances and lecturers' fees for the local
training program for FELCRA staff, scheme participants and their families. In
the period 1988-90 these courses are expected to provide about 5,700 training
places for staff, 33,000 places for scheme participants and 30,000 places for
scheme dependants.
(c) Overseas Training. An overseas training program providing for
advanced training courses and seminar/workshop participation in management,
project planning, agricultural development and technical subjects of relevance
to FELCRA, is proposed for senior staff to upgrade operational skills and
broaden development perspectives. The provision covers about 20 training
places over three years at an estimated cost of M$280,000.



- 21 -
(d) Training Advisor. The services of a Training Advisor appointed in
1984 for the FELCRA I project have been successful in developing a vigorous
and well-focussed training program for staff and scheme participants, to the
benefit of FELCRA's agricultural development program. The project would
continue the services of this local appointee for a further three years to
ensure continuing strong direction and momentum of the training program. The
total cost of the advisor is about M$180,000.
Project Management
3.11      In addition to staff salaries and the costs of supplies and
services, there would be construction of four State administrative offices.
The total estimated base cost is M$70.4 million. Details are shown in
Appendix 1, Table 7.
(a) State Offices. Since 1986 FELCRA has embarked on decentralization
of scheme administration from the Head Office in Kuala Lumpur to the States.
Plans call for a new FELCRA-owned office in most States of the Peninsula. The
first will be constructed at Kuala Pilah in Negeri Sembilan and the other
three sites will be most likely from among the States of Johor, Perak, Pahang
and Terengganu. The estimated total base cost of M$4.9 million. Land for
three proposed offices is already available.
(b) Operations and Management. FELCRA has an annually allocated opera-
tional budget of about M$49 million, covering salaries, supplies and services
for its entire work program. Project-related costs, calculated on the basis
of the prorated share of the project to FELCRA's total land development area,
are estimated at about M$65 million.
Project Costs and Financing
3.12      The total project cost is estimated at M$470.0 million, or about
US$188.0 million exclusive of taxes and duties and with a foreign exchange
component of US$66.5 million (35S). Quantity estimates are based on FELCRA's
total approved development budget and its proposed allocation across develop-
ment categories. Unit costs are based on recent contract prices for similar
works, vehicles and equipment. Project base costs calculated from January
1988 in constant 1987 prices, include an addition of about US$2.0 million to
cover retroactive financing of agricultural development (maintenance) expendi-
tures since appraisal (para. 3.17). Physical contingencies of US$0.8 million
have been applied (5Z for civil works, palm oil mills, training center and
State offices) dqual to 0.4% of base costs. Price contingencies of US$3.0
million and equal to 1.61 of base costs have been calculated at the following
rates of projected increases, using constant purchasing parity exchange rates
(Table 3.3).

3.13      The proposed Bank Loan of US$66 million would finance about 35% of
total project costs, thc equivalent of the foreign exchange requirements of
the project. The Government's contribution through annual development and
operational budget allocations would be about US$122.0 million. Financing by
categ3ries of works, inclusive of contingencies, are summarized in Table 3.5
and detailed by total costs in Annex 1, Table 9.

- 25 -
(a) Works. The two palm oil mill works contracts, with a value of about
US$5.5 million each, would be procured through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures according to Bank guidelines. Local firms are
expected to be very competitive in view of their experience in the large
Malaysian oil palm industry. Works of agricultural development for an esti-
mated cost of US$91.7 million (land preparation to planting US$33.4 million,
field maintenance during crop development US$47.3 million and agricultural
inputs Us$11.0 million), scheme infrastructure (access roads and buildings)
for an estimated US$15.8 million, and other infrastructure (training centers
and State offices) for an estimated US$2.8 million, together totaling about
US$110 million and involving about 660 contracts would be procured by local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures satisfactory to the Bank. The contracts
for the agricultural development and scheme infrastructure works, grouped into
larger packages where practicable, would average about US$160,000 each while
those for other infrastructure works would average about US$600,000 each. All
would be under US$1.0 million in value. These contracts, all relatively
small, geographically widely dispersed and scattered in time over the project
period, would therefore be of little interest to foreign bidders who would
however be eligible to compete. Most of the US$22.4 million of works of
agricultural maintenance by other arrangements would be accomplished under
force account using scheme participants. The vemaining works, totaling about
US$8.4 million for the new rehabiliation of small schemes in remote areas and
representing only 6% of all scheme works, would be procured by limited tender-
ing involving at least five bid invitations, from local contractors of good
standing.
(b) Goods. The procurement of equipment estimated to cost a total of
US$6.8 million and comprising processing machinery for the two palm oil mills
(US$3.6 million), vehicles (US$2.8 million) and computer equipment
(US$0.4 million) would be awarded on the basis of ICB according to Bank
guidelines. Domestic manufacturers would receive a margin of preference equal
to 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of imported goods or the amount of the custom
duties and taxes, whichever is less. Purchase of trailers (US$0.3 million)
and miscellaneous equipment (US$0.9 million in the aggregate) would be by LCB
in which foreign suppliers are eligible to participate,. Small off-the-shelf
items dispersed in time and nature and costing less than US$50,000 each and
totalling not more than US$0.6 million would be purchased by government
procedures acceptable to the Bank. All goods procurement would be grouped to
the extent practicable.
(c)  Training.  The contract for the Training Advisor (US$72,000) estab-
lished under the FELCRA I project would be extended for the total period of
the project.
3.15      Contract Review.  All ICB and training contracts and any others
exceeding US$2.5 million would be subject to prior Bank review (14% of the
total value of contracts). Other contracts would be subject to selective
post-award review.



- 26 -
Disbursement
3.16      Disbursement of the proposed loan over three years would be against
suimmary Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) and contracts as follows: (a) 35% of
the costs of all agricultural development; (b) 60% of the costs of all civil
infrastructure works of roads and buildings; (c) 40Z of the costs of all works
for the palm oil processing mills but excluding equipment; (d) for vehicles,
equipment including that for the palm oil mills, and furniture, 100Z of the
foreign exchange cost of directly imported items, 100% of the ex-factory cost
of locally manufactured items net of taxes, and 75% of the cost of imported
items procured locally; and (e) 100% of the training advisor and overseas
training costs. Disbursement would be against summary SOEs for all agricul-
tural development works, the training advisor and overseas training, and for
vehicles, equipment and furniture in individual contracts up to US$200,000
equivalent. All other disbursements would be against normal documentation.
Documentation for all SOEs would be retained by FELCRA for possible Bank
review and scrutiny by auditors. The loan is expected to be disbursed over
three and a half years, through June 30, 1991, in accordance with the schedule
of disbursements shown in Annex 2. This is notably quicker than for the
standard profile for agricultural projects in Malaysia, as the project is an
expenditure time-slice of an ongoing operation.
3.17      Retroactive Financing.  The proposed project would provide up to
US$5.0 million in retroactive financing for disbursible expenditures incurred
from the start of appraisal on July 1, 1987 until the commencement of the loan
period, and which cannot be met out of Loan 2013-MA. These include expendi-
tures from January 1, 1988 which are part of the estimated costs of this
second project. Any unused amount would remain part of the total available
loan funds.
Accounts and Audit
3.18      Accounts.  FELCRA financial accounts are fully computerized and are
segregated by schemes as well as by category of expenditures. Project
disbursement categories are designed to coincide with FELCRA accounts which
eliminates the need for separate project accounting. FELCRA will, however.
maintain records on the uses of project funds which would trace and relate
project expenditures to its overall financial accounts.
3.19      Audit.  FELCRA as a budget agency is subject to normal government
control and audit procedures. Their accounts are audited annually by the
Office of the Auditor General, considered as an independent government auditor
acceptable to the Bank. Assurances would be obtained during negotiations that
FELCRA audited financial statements would be furnished to the Bank within nine
months of the close of the Government fiscal year.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Coordination and Organization
4.1       Coordination.  The project has been endorsed by the Federal Economic
Planning Unit as deserving of external financial support. The Government of
Malaysia would be the borrower, the Ministry of National and Rural Development
would be responsible for overall project performance, and FELCRA would imple-
ment the project. FELCRA would conclude a Project Agreement with the Bank
formalizing their obligations engendered under the Loan Agreement. The
Federal and State Public Works Departments would assist FELCRA through con-
struction of the larger road works and the connection of schemes to public
water supplies and an assurance on their capacity for the road program was
obtained (para. 7.1(c)). The National Electricity Board would connect schemes
to their grid.
4.2       Organization of Schemes.  The scheme development process from
selection to implementation is depicted in Figure 2. Potential scheme areas
may be proposed by State Governments, identified by FELCRA or offered by owner
groups. The Planning Division organizes dialogues with the land owners to
ascertain their interests for a scheme, arranges a development schedule,
initiates the land ownership verification process and prepares a feasibility
report. The Technical Division is responsible for the planning and design of
all scheme agriculture, engineering including utilities, and surveying works,
the preparation and specification of contracts, and the construction of the
palm oil mills. The Implementation Division is concerned with the organiza-
tion and implementation of scheme works. FELCRA maintains full management
responsibility of the schemes until at least participant development loans are
repaid (para. 2.7) and is also closely involved in organizing day-to-day
operations through field supervisors in association with scheme committees
comprising scheme member representatives.
4.3       Staffing.  FELCRA's projected staffing up to 1990 is summarized in
Table 4.1. FELCRA has pursued a progressive staffing policy with the aim of
securing sufficient approved posts for the planned development program. The
290 currently vacant posts are adequate to cover requirements for program
implementation including an estimated additional 100 staff for management and
supervision of new schemes. The number of new posts that can be filled in any
year is subject to Public Service Department agreement based on budget availa-
bility. The largest group of in-post staff by function, comprising about
1,800 people or 62% of all staff, is that of scheme management and supervi-
sion.  The Government would ensure sufficient establishment of staff posts and
budget during the project for timely implementation.

4.4       Overseas Training.  All overseas training using Government funds is
organized under the Public Services Department. Funds and places are severely
limited.  Any awards made to FELCRA staff would be reviewed by the Bank for
project relevancy before loan financing.
Palm Oil Mills
4.5       FELCRA has two palm oil mills at Nasaruddin in Central Perak and at
Bukit Kepong in North Johor, operated under the Division of Marketing and
Processing. These mills of 27 and 36 tons ffb/hr rated capacity, respec-
tively, were commissioned in 1983 and process fruits from FELCRA schemes in
their command areas. Additional fruits are bought from outside growers to
boost throughput. In 1986, Nasaruddin received 85Z of its fruit bunch supplies
from FELCRA schemes and operated profitably at about 67% capacity. Bukit
Kepong mill on the other hand, with a throughput of slightly under 50% capa-
city, largely because of insufficient fruit supplies including outside
sources, ran at a loss. Technically the mills are operating satisfactorily
and performance is reviewed in detail semi-annually by industry engineering
consultants.
(a) Processing Charges. FELCRA determines processing fees in the
context of a vertically integrated operation on a cost-plus basis with no



- 29 -
intended subsidy to participants. For schemes, the fees is determined perio-
dically from actual operating expenses, assuming a certain level of capacity
use. For non-scheme suppliers, it is subject to negotiations, fluctuating
widely between peak and non-peak seasons according to mill capacity and ffb
supplies.
(b) Price of Fruit Bunch. FFB prices paid to participants are based on
average industry CPO and palm kernel prices for the previous month. The
quality of the fruit arriving at the mills is graded by sight on average bunch
weight, type of ffb (palm variety), ripeness, freshness, etc., into five
categories. For the highest quality category, the price would be based on a
10OZ extraction rate. For each lower category there is a sequential deduction
of 52 from the scheduled extraction rate.
(d) Mill Profitability. As the full cost of mill construction was
financed by Government loans, FELCRA has no equity investment in the mills.
Consequently, mill debt:equity ratio is extremely high at 98% (1986), with the
22 equity made up of accumulated profit. This high leverage and the resulting
high interest burden caused a net loss of M$1.2 million in 1986, a year of low
palm oil prices (Annex 3, Tables 4 and 5). For 1987 a modest profit of M$0.4
million is expected despite the high debt burden as a result of improved
capacity use of Bukit Kepong. By 1989 the profit is projected to increase to
M$1.5 million. The proforma profit and loss for the mills for 1987-90 is
given in A;.ex 3, Table 6.  Projected cash flow of the proposed new mills
shows a financial rate of return on investment of 21Z and would contribute
further to mill profitability (Annex 3, Table 7). Mill cash surplus held by
FELCRA in late 1986 was M$16.1 million, sufficient to reduce mill liabilities
by about one-third.
Project Implementation Schedule
4.6       The project, which is an on-going program with an overall government
budget, would be implemented over three years, from 1988-1990, with a loan
closing date of June 30, 1991. For the first project year, some 7,000 ha of
agricultural development was tendered or ready for tender at the time of
appraisal for implementation from late 1987 and early 1988 and a further 8,000
ha is expected to be tendered by early 1988. Preparation and processing of
schemes for the 1989 and 1990 programs would be initiated up to one year
before field implementation. All maintenance work on immature schemes estab-
lished prior to the project would continue on a routine basis, using contracts
or force account labor. For scheme infrastructure, land acquisition is suffi-
cient to meet implementation targets for roads and scheme buildings in 1988.
Designs for the State Offices, Central Training Center and the two palm oil
mills are largely standard and well-advanced and proposed works are expected
to be ready for tendering as scheduled in 1988. The physical implementation
targets for the remaining two years of the project would be set by budget
allocations for those years. Assurances were obtained that Government and the
Bank would review and agree FELCRA's proposed annual work program and its
funding for each following year of the project (para 7.1(a)).



- 30 -
Loan Accounting System
4.7       FELCRA maintains a manual farmer loan accounting system, a record of
on-lent Government loans and payment dues by FELURA and by scheme participants
to FELCRA. Verification of repayments is based on the annual repayment sche-
dule issued by the Federal Treasury. FELCRA is now in the process of compute-
rising its loan accounting system, an operation which has become increasingly
necessary as FELCRA has expanded into idle land rehabilitaition and its accom-
panying larger numbers of small farmers. An expanded accounting system cover-
ing sources, costs and terms of the funds used for onlending, and the amount
and sources of loans, will enable FELCRA to more effectively analyze its on-
lending performance with regard to spreads, loan recovery and funding terms.
Assurances were obtained that FELCRA will develop such a Loan Accounting
System as a priority (para. 7.1 (b) (i)).
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.8       Monitoring and evaluation of the development program is the respon-
sibility of the Planning and Development Division and covers status of scheme
development, crop production and yields and most importantly, monthly payments
to scheme participants. Results are reported regularly to the Board and in
the case of participant incomes, to the Government as an indication of
FELCRA's development impact on alleviation of rural poverty. As a result of
the high volume of planning work in support of the expanding development pro-
gram, monitoring and evaluation has not been developed to the potential of
FELCRA's data base. Thus outdated land development costs are used for scheme
development budgeting and overall scheme and crop performance and levels of
settler participation remain inadequately evaluated for the benefits of
management. An assurance was obtained that FELCRA would monitor unit costs of
land development and generate updated standard development costs for more
effective program and budget planning, (para. 7.1(b) (ii)). FELCRA would
strengthen performance evaluation of their agricultural program, reporting
main findings to the Bank (para 4.9), and establish a cost effective stock
inventory management system in the near future.
Project Reporting
4.9       FELCRA would prepare and submit to the Bank a quarterly progress
summary report on project implementation and consolidated expenditure perfor-
mance, both actual and committed, for each main category of development work.
The report would also include, as available, sunmmary results of the Planning
and Development Division's monitoring and evaluation of scheme performances,
crop yields and monthly scheme participant incomes for Bank review. A project
completion report would be prepared by the borrower and submitted to the Bank
within six months of the loan closing date.
Operation and Maintenance
4.10      FELCRA would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
roads, buildings and palm oil mills and other facilities to be constructed by
FELCRA and financed under the project. Assurances would be sought from
Government that adequate funds would be made available for these purposes.



- 31 -
States and their PWDs however would be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of PWD-constructed project access roads.
Environmental Effects
4.11      The project would have no adverse environmental impact, as it would
involve only planting in older agricultural areas, mostly on gentle terrain,
with tree crops which are highly effective in protecting soils in equatorial
climates. Planted legumes and natural vegetation would provide adequate pro-
tection against erosion during early tree growth. Access roads to schemes
would pass through agricultural or scrub lands and FELCRA would avoid con-
structing roads through primary forest. Factory effluents would be treated in
conformity with the stringent government pollution control laws stric1yy en-
forced since January, 1984 through the Department of the Environment.- The
Bank's supervision missions will review the Department's monitoring reports
and also check the pollution managerial practices at the factories during site
visits.
V. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Oil Palm
5.1       Table 5.1 shows the phasing by rehabilitation year of the 59,000 ha
of oil palm included in project financing, comprising a targeted 27,000 ha of
rehabilitation in 1988-90 and the maintenance of 32,000 ha rehabilitated in
1983-87. The maintenance period for oil palm development is 5 years from
planting.

rh  For each year, based on total area rehabilitated in previous four years.
6/   The Department's independent on-site monitoring of factory effluent
systems is carried out four to six times/year and every factory is
required to send effluent samples monthly for analysis. Details are
included in Annex 5.



- 32 -
The 27,000 ha of rehabilatation would involve the formation of about 150 new
schemes (the average scheme area at end-1986 was 203 ha, but is declining with
the increasing focus on idle lands) and some 35 scheme cluster units (based on
an average cluster area of 800 ha).
5.2       Crop Establishment.  Palms of about one year of age, grown in FELCRA
nurseries from elite progeny seed purchased from major suppliers, would be
field planted during a favorable planting season at a density of about 148
palms/ha (10 m triangular planting). Replacement of planting failures would
not extend over more than one and a half years. Creeping legumes would be
sown in the field interrows to enhance soil and nutrient status and to protect
the soil, except in deep alluvia on flat terrain, where rapid growth of
natural vegetation minimizes the risk of soil erosion. Regular field manuring
programs would follow recomendations of the Palm Oil Research Institute of
Malaysia during the first year of production and would then be determined by
annual foliar analysis contracted through private sector laboratories.
5.3       Harvesting.  The first fruit bunches should be ready for harvesting
late in the third year after planting. Harvesting would continue for about 25
years, after which the crop would be ready for replanting. First fruit
bunches are small (about 5 kg in weight) and easy to gather. However, as the
palms grow higher and bunch weights heavier(20-25 kgs after 20 years), harvest
labor inputs at peak season double from about 0.15 man-days/ha to 0.3 man-
days/ha. Harvesting would be done by scheme participants or by contracted
outside labor, and the fresh fruit bunches transported to a FELCRA or private
palm oil mill for processing.
5.4       Yields and Production.  The assumed yield profile for project oil
palm is shown in Annex 4, Table 1. Production would start late in Year 3.
Yields would rise to a plateau of about 22 tons ffb/ha by production Year 8
and after about four years would start to decline slowly. Mean annual yield
over the production years of the crop is estimated at 16.8 tons/ha, about 10Z
under the national average. Total production would be about 420 tons ffb/ha,
giving some 80 tons of crude palm oil and 21 tons of dry kernels per ha over
an assumed 25-year productive life of the palms.
5.5       Processing and Marketing.  Apart from schemes supplying FELCRA's two
palm oil processing mills in Perak and North Johor, scheme fresh fruit bunch
would be sold mostly to the private sector or parastatal processing mills
under supply contracts of up to one yea: based on gazetted oil prices and
agreed oil and kernel extraction rates and transport charges. In remote
areas, the bunches may be sold ex-farm gate to traders by tender. Mill
facilities are generally adequate throughout the country.
Rubber
5.6       Table 5.2 shows the phasing by rehabilitation year of the targeted
36,500 ha of rubber for project financing, comprising 13,500 ha of rehabilita-
tion in 1988-90 and the maintenance of 23,000 ha rehabilitated in 1979-87.
Rubber rehabilitation would involve the formation of about 70 new schemes and
some 17 cluster management units.

7i   For each year, based on total area rehabilitated in previous nine years.
5.7       Crop Establishment.  Seedlings grown for six to eight months in
FELCRA nurseries would be budgrafted with clones recommended by the Rubber
Research Institute of Malaysia, and field planted three to four months later
at a density of about 500 trees/ha. Supply planting would extend over a
maximum of two years.
5.8       Field Maintenance.  Good maintenance in the early years after plant-
ing is critical to the growing of vigorous rubber stands. Weeding in the
first year would be at monthly intervals, decreasing to about three times/year
by Year 4, when the tree canopies close over and largely shade the
interrows. The fertilizer program for immature trees would follow industry
recommendations.  After tapping, fertiliser requirements for the local
conditions of each scheme would be determined by periodic soil and foliar
analyses.
5.9       Harvesting.  Young rubber would normally be brought into tapping in
Year 8, seven years after planting, when about 70Z of the trees have reached
standard tapping size. Tapping on FELCRA schemes is currently alternate
daily. In future years, however, labor constraints in a relatively high-cost
labor market are expected to encourage the use of latex stimulants for rubber
production in association with a reduced tapping frequency. In the farm cost
model, stimulant use has been assumed from year 15 of tapping (Annex 4,
Table Sb).
5.10      Yields and Production.  The estimated yield profile for rubber (dry
rubber basis) is given in Annex 4, Table 1.  Yields would rise through the
first 10 years to a peak of about 1,750 kg/ha/year, some 25% higher than the



- 34 -
average of replanted individual smallholdings, and then slowly decline to
uneconomic levels after about 25 years when the crop would be ready for
replanting. The mean annual dry rubber yield over an assumed 25 years produc-
tive life of the crop is projected at 1,220 kg/ha. Old rubber stands might
continue in low level production of about 400 kg/ha for up to 10 years after
which they would be no longer profitable to tap. This low yield represents
the upper yield limit that could be expected from old rubber in smallholdings
remaining unrehabilitated during the project.
5.11      Processing and Marketin.   In most schemes FELCRA sells the latex
and scrap rubber under contract to FARDEC (Malaysian Rubber Development Cor-
poration), which operates rubber processing factories throughout the
country. In remote areas scheme production is processed on-site into sheet
rubber, air or smoke-dried, and sold by tender to local buyers.
Diversified Crops
5.12      FELCRA would encourage planting of diversified crops in line with
Government's policy to reduce dependence on oil palm and rubber. These would
include bananas, fruit trees, cocoa, coffee, vegetables and other locally
suited crops. To be acceptable, new crops must offer prospects of sustained
cash return benefits at least as attractive as those of the traditional crops
and without undue risk or significantly higher labor requirements. Scheme
farmers must also assent to the use of their land for these crops. Table 5.3
shows the phasing by rehabilitation year of about 5,500 ha included for
project financing.

7T   For each year, based on area previously rehabilitated.
Negligible attention was paid to diversified crops until recently, but in 1986
and 1987 rehabilitation with diversified crops totalled some 1,000 ha (about
670 ha of cocoa, 200 ha of banana, 100 ha of orchards and 3n ha of cash crops,



- 35 -
the last being a highly diversified vegetable growing scheme close to Kuala
Lumpur). Banana production is aimed particularly at the sale of fruit bunches
to the Singapore fresh fruit market, but FELCRA is also exploring the
prospects for exporting bananas to other countries via the private sector.
Diversification is a relatively new direction for FELCRA. This program would
be cautious during the project period and scheme areas typically small, as
major efforts are required to develop suitable production technology in
respect of varieties (especially for fruits), agronomic practices and post-
harvest technology.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Benefits
6.1       The project benefits would be (i) incremental production of palm
oil, rubber and diversified crops; (ii) improved farm incomes for small
farmers previously earning less than the relative poverty level of M$360 per
month family income; and (iii) continued institutional strengthening of
FELCRA. At full development, the project would produce annually an
incremental of approximately 100,000 tons of palm oil, 15,000 tons of rubber,
and 10,000 tons of diversified crops, representing less than 3% and 1% of
national production of palm oil and rubber, respectively.
Farm Incomes
6.2       On the basis of 2.5 ha per farmer beneficiary in a notional scheme
planted with 70% oil palm and 30% rubber (based on the ratio of total area of
oil palm, including diversified crops, to rubber planted under the project)
under good management, and using the yield and price projections of Annex 4,
Tables 1 and 2, a working scheme participant could expect net farm income to
maximize at about M$850 per month in the tenth year after full payment to
FELCRA of agricultural loan dues (Annex 4, Table 4). This amount includes
some M$200-300/month for wages. Thereafter, income would start to decline
with yields but not lower than to about M$680/month after a 28 year cropping
cycle. These total farm incomes are notably higher than present scheme income
levels which, however reflect recently low commodity prices and are for
schemes which are still mostly in their early years of production (para.
2.8). FELCRA scheme participants not working on the schemes would be able to
earn about M$500 per month as a dividend net of the labor charges. Without
project participation however the farmer might earn only about M$100 per month
from tapping old rubber trees for a limited number of years but would then
need to supplement income with off-farm work, if available. In all cases,
these incomes could be supplemented by other sources 6f farm household
income. If income realized from scheme participation is less than that
indicated by the model parameters because of price or yield shortfalls, it
should still provide sufficient incentive to compensate for loss of control
over land during the development phase. The impact on household incomes, as
distinct from farm incomes, depends on farm location and individual employment
opportunities.

Economic Evaluation
6.3       The rate of return (ERR) for the project is estimated at 14Z
(Annex 4, Table 3) under the following assumptions: (a) only incremental
plantings are included; prior plantings being maintained would have a higher
return (20-30%) depending on assumptions about sunk costs; (b) income forgone
is considered only for rubber replanting as other crops are expected to be
planted mostly on presently idle land; (c) costs are estimated in 1987
constant dollars, benefit estimates are based on the Bank's price forecasts
(September 1987) adjusted to 1987 constant dollars using the MUV index
(details of economic price derivation are given in Annex 4, Table 2), and
border prices are converted at the official exchange rate; and (d) labor is
converted at its market wage rate under the assumption that labor markets are
functioning without impediments. The estimated crop rates of return range
from 12% for rubber replanting (Annex 4, Table 5b) to 25% for oil palm planted
on idle land (Annex 4, Table 5a); returns for oil palm replacing rubber and
rubber planted on idle land would be intermediate. Despite its less favorable
rate of return, rubber would be the crop choice for certain areas (para.
3.5(a)). The rate of return for the palm oil mills is an estimated 21% (Annex
3, Table 7). Although the project re,turn is sensitive to price, cost and
benefit stream assumptions, it is comparatively robust. It would require
either a 20% decline in the price of both rubber and oil palm, or a 25% rise
in project costs (or a combination of these) for the project ERR to fall below
10%. Alternatively, the project can withstand almost a three year delay in
the benefit stream without the ERR going'below 10%.
Cost Recovery
6.4       FELCRA policy is to recover the full field costs of agricultural
development excluding costs of scheme infrastructure and management, through
loans. These loans are recovered through deductions from FELCRA settler
accounts before paymencs are made to settlers for their crop production, all



- 37 -
of which FELCRA markets. Recovery rates have been variable because of the
unsatisfactory terms of early loans (para. 2.10(c)), but have improved as
payments on later loans have become due. With the expected Government
restructuring of these early loans, FELCRA should ultimately achieve 100%
recovery of all agricultural development loans. Recovery rates should also be
enhanced during the project through introduction of computerized loan
accounting. Further, the estimated debt service coverage throughout the life
of the loans is in excess of five, a ratio sufficient to cushion the effects
of unfavorable price and yield fluctuations.
Project Risks
6.5       The project imposes a continuing obligation on Government to fund
and maintain infrastructure estimated to cost about M$50.0 million in total in
areas planted under the project. FELCRA also carries a risk of having to
finance scheme operating costs after development, should more than a few
participants leave schemes for work elsewhere. The extent of FELCRA's
continuing role with its financial implications depends on market determined
incentives, the market outcome of the commodities being planted with their
attendant price risk, and the long-run success of the developmental approach
being taken. At appraisal Government affirmed its commitment to necessary
funding while the projected long-run prices are high enough to attract
sufficient scheme applicants to sustain the momentum of the land development
program.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1       During negotiations, assurances and agreements were obtained on the
following:
(a)  Government and the Bank would review and agree FELCRA's proposed
annual work program and its funding for each following year of the
project (para. 4.6).
(b)  FELCRA, in the strengthening of its management capacity and
financial situation, would:
(i) develop by December 31, 1988, a settler loan account system
independent of FELCRA's financial accounts (para. 4.7);
(ii)  monitor unit costs of land development and update standard
development costs used in program and budget planning by
December 31, 1988 (para. 4.8);
(c) Government would ensure that PWD has sufficient physical and staff
capacity for the design, construction and engineering supervision of
the agreed program of FELCRA scheme access roads (para. 4.1).
7.2       With the above assurances, the proposed project wuould be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$66.0 million to Malaysia. The loan would have a
repayment period of 15 years, including a grace period of three years at the
standard variable interest rate.
