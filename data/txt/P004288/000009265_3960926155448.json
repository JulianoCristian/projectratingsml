The project aims to\n            replant some 45,000 ha with oil  palm, rubber and other\n            crops and maintain during the development phase a further\n            69,000 ha replanted prior to the project.  In addition, the\n            project seeks to construct scheme access roads and\n            buildings, two palm oil mills and a Central Training Center,\n            provide vehicles and equipment and strengthen FELCRA's services."}, "docdt": "1988-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
