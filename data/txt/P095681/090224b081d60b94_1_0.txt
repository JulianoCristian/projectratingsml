                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Good progress has been made towards end-of-Project targets with eleven of the 14 end-of-Project intermediate outcome indicators already achieved. The number of trainees
                         enrolled in training is 912 (compared to the revised end-of-Project target of 800), and the coverage of training in sectors other than tourism has exceeded the end of project target by
                         over 20 percent. Efforts to engage with the private sector have led to a significant increase in the number of private sector companies taking on trainees to 241 compared to an
                         original end-of-Project target of 90. In addition, the Project continues to have a strong impact beyond tourism with the percentage of trainees in sectors other than tourism now at 69
