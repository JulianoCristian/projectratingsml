                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With support from the Project, the Government, through the National Training Agency (NTA), has continued to issue national vocational qualifications (NVQs) for graduates from
                         different programs. The NTA has successfully finalized a pilot with Grenada's Community College, T.A. Marryshow Community College (TAMCC) , to jointly issue NVQs as well as
                         TAMCC diplomas. The NTA is working with TAMCC and other training programs to adjust the training curriculum to reflect the competency-based approach that is supported by the
                         Project. In addition, the Ministry of Education has formally submitted a request to CARICOM requesting permission for the NTA to issue Caribbean Vocational Qualifications (CVQs)
                         which will facilitate regional and international labor mobility.

                         The total number of trainees (in all stages of training, including graduates) has increased to around 492 (as of October, 2012), and the number of youth successfully completing the
                         program increased 7 in March 2012 to 125 by October 2012, while an additional 100 are expected to complete it by November 2012, reflecting a significant increase in coverage.
                         Overall, it appears that more program graduates are finding permanent employment; while 2.4 percent of the first cohort of trainees received permanent employment 15 months after
