                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The first cohort of trainees have completed their life skills and technical training. They are currently at their apprenticeship placements and should be finishing by the end of August/
                         September 2011. The second Call for training proposals was completed and 15 courses were approved for technical soundness. The next batch of training should commence with
                         10 courses by the end of July 2011. The National Training Agency has greatly advanced the drafting of the quality assurance documents. The Assessment Guidelines and NTA
                         Procedures Manual have both been finalized. Challenges with attracting employers to participate with the training and take trainees for a 3 month apprenticeship continues due to the
                         economic fragility especially in the tourism and hospitality sector.
