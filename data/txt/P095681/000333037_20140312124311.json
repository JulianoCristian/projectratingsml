Some lessons learned\n            included: all government-sponsored internship programs\n            operating in Grenada should have consistent sets of\n            incentives. As originally conceive, internships under the\n            project required employers to pay for the stipend. This\n            requirement, together with the fact that it targeted less\n            educated, unemployed youth, obviously put the project at a\n            disadvantage with respect to other publicly sponsored\n            internship programs, such as the one from the community\n            college, which seeks to place college-educated trainees in\n            internships at no cost to employers. There are opportunities\n            to eliminate duplications and ensure the most effective and\n            efficient use of the country's limited institutional\n            and technical resources. For example, career counseling\n            under skills development programs could be strengthened by\n            utilizing the already installed capacity within the Ministry\n            of Education, or MoE and individual schools. Likewise,\n            performance under the project by individual training\n            providers could be used as selection criteria under other\n            skills development projects."}, "docdt": "2014-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
