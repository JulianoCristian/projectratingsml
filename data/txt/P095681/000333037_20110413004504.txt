1. The first Category of Expenditure has been revised as follows:

      Current                     Revised

TOTAL AMOUNT                                              2,100,000



2.       The Project completed its first year of implementation, and is moving towards
achieving its Project Development Objective. Grenada successfully completed two calls
for training proposals. The first cohort of trainees is currently engaged in technical skills
training. The second call for proposals resulted in 13 applications submitted in
November 2010. There are spaces for potentially 240 more disadvantaged youth to enter
training in skills areas that are in demand in the marketplace. The Competency-based
Framework for Skills Development has advanced substantially. Industry Advisory
Bodies were established, trained, and they have already vetted 40 competencies in
various skill areas within the hospitality and construction sectors. The National Training
Agency had drafted guidelines for skills assessment and a quality assurance manual to
ensure training, verification of skills, and certification meet with the Caribbean
Vocational Qualification standards. Under institutional strengthening, the Grenada
Project has been working closely with a similar project in St. Lucia (CR4300-SLU to
build a joint management information system not only for monitoring and evaluation, but
also for stakeholder access and use of labor market information.

3.     The first Category of Expenditure has been revised to allow for explicit
recognition of Non-consultant Services as eligible expenditures under the proceeds of the
Credit. While the Project Appraisal Document makes clear reference to Non-consultant
Services (Table 5.5, page 49), the inclusion of this type of expenditure was inadvertently
omitted from the Financing Agreement dated March 19, 2009. The Financing Agreement
was amended to reflect this change and to also include a definition of Non-consultant
Services and make reference to them in the Procurement Section.
