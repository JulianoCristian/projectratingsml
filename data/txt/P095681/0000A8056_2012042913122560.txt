                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Grenada has made significant progress in Establishing an Occupational Standards Framework to Improve the Quality and Value of Training (Component 2), including the vetting of
                         occupational standards, the establishment of quality assurance processes, the issuing of NVQs and the preparation to issue Caribbean Vocational Qualifications (CVQs). Skills
                         Training for Unemployed Youth (Component 1) remains slow due to weakness in the economy and the Project has not met its quantitative targets for the number of youth trained.
                         Likewise, the job market has been difficult for trainees and few have found employment.
