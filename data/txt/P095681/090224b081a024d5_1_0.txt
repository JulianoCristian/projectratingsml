                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has successfully engaged with the private sector, and there are now 90 private sector companies taking on trainees compared to an original end-of-Project target of 45.
                         In addition, the Project has had an impact beyond tourism with the percentage of trainees in sectors other than tourism at 48 percent exceeding substantially the 30 percent original
                         end-of-Project target. There are currently 92 pre-qualified training providers, including an innovative partnership with the Community College and a large NGO.

                         There have been significant achievements in developing a policy framework for skills training under Component 2, which has not been directly affected by the economic downturn.

                         The quality assurance system is now in place and all the five key documents that serve as a foundation for it have been completed. These documents include: i) Learner’s Handbook,
                         ii) Center Approval Guidelines, iii) Assessment Guidelines, iv) Quality Assurance Manual, and v) Accreditation Manual. In addition, sixty-eight standards for National Vocational
                         Qualifications (three more than the original end-of-Project target) have been purchased, validated, adopted and approved by the National Training Agency (NTA) at a significantly
                         lower cost than budgeted. With this framework in place and the October 2012 positive assessment by the Caribbean Association of National Technical Training Agencies (CANTA),

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured to make changes to (i) the scope of Project activities, (ii) the Results Framework, and (iii) Project costs and financing in response to the current
                         economic downturn that has affected activities in the key sectors of the economy and both Government and private sector financial capacity. In addition, the PDO indicator has been
                         revised to a stronger measure of employability over the long term.
