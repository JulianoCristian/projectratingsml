                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objective is to support the Government program to increase sustainable access to potable water supply in rural areas, while promoting
                         improved wastewater management and hygiene practices.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of works under component 1 is progressing well. The number of water standpoints (SPs) constructed has reached 87.5% of the end-of-project target. Under the
                         IBRD funding, 1117 SPs have been built, 539 (48%) of them are in completed systems and are therefore operational (service provision is possible). 489 (91%) of these operational
                         SP have a "SP manager" ("gardiens-gérants" in French) contracted and provide potable water to the population. As a result, about 244,000 people now have access to water service
                         through a project-funded SP (about 30% more than in October 2013). Concrete measures are being implemented to finalize works and put the remaining SPs into operational service
                         provision.

                         Activities under component 2, namely the development of water distribution systems through house connections, are also progressing. Detailed design studies have been delivered
                         for 11 villages in the Safi provinces where the environmental and social screening performed by the TA determined it was a priority to distribute water to households through house
                         connections. Set up arrangements for revolving fund allowing to prefinance a portion of the household contribution to the cost of its connection are now validated. Over 700

                         households have already signed their commitment form for a house connection. Most of them requested an advance under the pre-financing mechanism.

                         Under component 3, the project implementation support TA contract is providing satisfactory support to ONEE in implementing the project.
