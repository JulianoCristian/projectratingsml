                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project development objective is to support the Government program to increase sustainable access to potable water supply in rural areas, while promoting
                         improved wastewater management and hygiene practices.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of works under component 1 is progressing well. The number of water standpoints (SPs) constructed has reached 85% of the end-of-project target. Under the
                         IBRD funding, 1025 SPs have been built, about 40% of them are in completed systems and are therefore operational (service provision is possible). About 87% or the operational SP
                         have a "SP manager" ("gardiens-gérants" in French) contracted and provide potable water to the population. As a result, over 171,000 people in the project areas have now access to
                         water service through a project-funded SP.
                         Activities under component 2, namely the development of water distribution systems through house connections, are underway. The consulting firms hired is preparing detailed

                         Each study will also look into the need to develop wastewater collection systems, in areas where individual sanitation facilities are not technically or environmentally suitable.
                         Under component 3, the project implementation support TA contract is providing satisfactory support to ONEE in implementing the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         ONEE is taking the necessary actions to achieving the project objectives. It needs to maintain this momentum to continue increase the number of SP built, and, at the same time, the
                         proportion of SP built which provides service to the population in project areas. ONEE has also taken clear steps to prepare the development of service provision through house
                         connections in rural villages or 'douars' in the project provinces. ONEE will pilot new management models for the sustainable management of the areas where service will be provided
                         though house connections, through small-scale PPP contract with performance-based subsidy (Output-Based Aid approach). ONEE is also establishing a revolving fund allowing to
                         prefinance a portion of the household contribution to the cost of its connection.
