                                       14
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. Country background. In 2005, when the project was approved, Morocco was on a
steady path to growth and rapid urbanization, and absolute poverty was declining. Yet more
than two-thirds of the 15 percent of Moroccans (4.5 million people) living below the
national poverty line were concentrated in rural areas. Their average income was half that
of city dwellers, and inadequate access to basic services was the norm.
2. To address rural poverty, the Government of Morocco (GOM) adopted the 2020 Rural
Development Strategy in 2003. One of its priorities was to increase access to basic
infrastructure and social services. In addition, in May 2005 GOM launched an ambitious,
multisector national program to enhance human development, l’Initiative Nationale pour
le Développement Humain (INDH), aimed at reducing poverty by targeting poor rural and
periurban areas and vulnerable people, including women.
3. Sector and institutional context. Morocco faced persistent urban-rural disparity in
access to potable water. The average access rate in rural areas was only 14 percent in 1995,
due to the limited capacities of local governments, or communes rurales (CRs), responsible
for water and sanitation service provision. Access to standpipes (SPs) was limited, and
house connections (HCs), rare. People relied on local resources and vendors, of unregulated
quality and spent considerable time fetching water often at high costs. Access rates to
sanitation were also very low and there was no institutional framework for sanitation.
4. In 1995, GOM launched a rural water supply (RWS) program known as the
Programme d’Alimentation Groupé en Eau Potable des Populations Rurales (PAGER).
The General Department of Hydraulics (Direction Générale de l’Hydraulique, DGH) and
the National Potable Water Authority (Office National de l’Eau Potable, ONEP) shared
responsibility for the implementation of PAGER. In remote rural areas, DGH developed
standalone systems tapping groundwater resources, managed by water user associations
(WUAs). ONEP supplied larger rural centers close to its regional water conveyance
systems through SPs operated by caretakers trained by ONEP.
5. PAGER successfully raised RWS access rates from 14 percent in 1995 to 61 percent
by 2004, mostly through SPs in thousands of villages. Despite such achievements, progress
was unequal across provinces. First, autonomous water systems could not work in areas
with scarce good-quality groundwater resources, such as along the Atlantic coast and in
the Rif and Pré-Rif regions. Second, WUAs received only limited post-construction
support to properly operate such systems. In 2002, GOM decided to accelerate the pace of
investment in rural areas to achieve a 92 percent access rate by 2007, with a new strategy
for overcoming existing constraints.
6. In 2004, GOM made ONEP responsible for a new national program for universal
access to potable water supply (Programme de Généralisation de l’Eau Potable, GEP).
ONEP’s experience in water production, transmission in bulk to large urban utilities, and
provision of water services to secondary urban centers was key to expanding piped water
in rural areas. This shift entailed huge challenges in terms of: (i) financial sustainability, as
recovering the high cost of infrastructure development and operations in rural areas was an




                                               15
issue; and (ii) capacity, as ONEP needed to develop cost-effective management models to
ensure sustainable services to local communities.
7. Rationale for Bank intervention. The World Bank had for long been successfully
involved in Morocco’s water sector, 1 and the PAGER project carried out interesting
lessons. 2 Improved water and sanitation to address rural poverty and enhance women’s
empowerment was a priority of the 1997 and 2001 Country Assistance Strategies (CASs).
The 2005 CAS enlarged the scope for Bank support to “improved water management and
access to rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) services.” 3
8. With its global experience in RWSS and involvement in Morocco’s sector dialogue,
the Bank was in a unique position to support the new national program by (i) advising
GOM and ONEP on ways to enhance the sustainability of RWSS investments through
demand-driven and participatory approaches; (ii) strengthening ONEP’s capacity in
hygiene education and solutions for rural sanitation; and (iii) promoting local private
operators in RWSS. In the context of the 2005 Paris declaration on aid effectiveness, the
Bank was also open to working in synergy with other donors on rural water in Morocco.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
9. As per the Loan Agreement (Schedule 2), the objective of the project was to assist the
borrower in supporting the guarantor’s program in the project area aiming at increasing
sustainable access to potable water supply in rural areas, while promoting improved
wastewater management and hygiene practices. This wording was consistent with that of
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). 4 The PAD Results Framework proposed three
outcome indicators to monitor the achievement of this twofold objective:
     1. Access rate to potable water supply in the five provinces increased by about
        18 percent of their rural population (or about 465,000 additional people);
     2. At least 90 percent of the water supply and wastewater facilities built under the
        project have well-functioning and sustainable management structures;
     3. At least 20 percent of users have adopted improved hygiene practices.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators
10. The PDO was not revised. The key indicator #1 (as listed above) was aligned in 2010
with the core sector indicator: Number of people in rural areas provided with access to

  The borrower, the National Potable Water Authority (Office National de l’Eau Potable, ONEP [now
Office National de l’Eau potable et de l’Electricité, ONEE]), is an autonomous, profit-making public
corporation subject to the sector oversight of the Ministry of Land Use Planning, Water, and Environment.
The Government of Morocco (GOM) is the loan’s guarantor. The PDO in the PAD was to support GOM’s
program to increase sustainable access to potable water supply in rural areas, while promoting improved
wastewater management and hygiene practices.


                                                   16
improved water sources under the project. Its end-target value was reduced to the target
population in IBRD-funded provinces (see paragraph 17 and section 1.7).
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11. The project targeted about one-third of a rural population of 1.6 million without access
to potable water in five provinces: El Jadida, Safi, and Essaouira on the Atlantic Coast, and
Taounate and Taza in the Rif and Pré-Rif regions. 5 The access rate in these provinces was
40 percent in 2004, below the national 60 percent average in rural areas.
12. The PAD also identified as target groups: (i) women, to promote their participation
in project activities; and (ii) ONEP as the borrower and implementing agency. Extensive
technical assistance (TA) support would strengthen its capacity to implement GEP.
1.5 Original Components
Component 1. Water Production and Conveyance (US$94.35 million)
13. This component involved implementing a program of subprojects to deliver water
supply to villages through the construction of lateral mains from existing or planned ONEP
regional trunk lines (piquages), storage tanks, public standpipes (SPs), and, in limited
cases, water production facilities (treatment stations, intake structures, pumping stations,
etc.). The PAD targeted 12 to 15 subprojects taken from the GEP Provincial Master Plans.
The Loan Agreement detailed eligibility criteria, including the financial contributions from
local governments (15 percent) and beneficiaries (5 percent).
Component 2. Water Distribution and Wastewater Management (US$13.49 million)
14. This component included (i) the design, construction, and supervision of village
distribution systems providing house connections (HCs); and (ii) the mitigation measures
required to handle the resulting increased wastewater flows. The project envisioned that
communities (villagers and local governments) be given the choice to opt for HCs instead
of SPs, based on their willingness to pay for and operate this level of service. ONEP would
offer beneficiaries a credit facility of up to DH 2,500 as an incentive to connect.
Component 3. Institutional Strengthening and Project Implementation Support
(US$4.63 million)
15. Activities under this component aimed to reinforce ONEP’s capacity to implement
the project and provide support to the local organizations responsible for operation and
maintenance (O&M). It included: (i) implementation of an inclusive, participatory
approach responsive to community demands in terms of service level and management
models; (ii) training to local organizations responsible for O&M; and (iii) hygiene
promotion related to water supply and wastewater. The costs covered the TA for project
coordination and Social Mobilization Teams (SMTs).
16. The PAD also stated that in parallel to the project, two to three pilot public-private
partnerships (PPPs) involving output-based aid (OBA) schemes were envisaged to leverage

Morocco according to the national data (INDH) and poverty maps established in 2007.


                                                 17
private investments, especially to finance HCs and wastewater management facilities. The
project planned to solicit grant financing for the proposed schemes with the Global
Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA).
17. Project costs and financing. The project cost totaled US$112.47 million, including:
(i) an IBRD loan of €49.5 million (US$60 million equivalent); (ii) financial contributions
from ONEP, the CRs, and households; and (iii) a loan of €20 million (US$24 million
equivalent) from the French Development Agency (Agence Française de Développement,
AFD). AFD prepared and appraised the project jointly with the Bank. IBRD would support
subprojects in El Jadida and Safi and AFD in Essaouira, Tanouate, and Taza, using their
respective procurement rules. The TA was the only co-financed activity, with a share of
70 percent from IBRD and 30 percent from AFD.
18. Institutional setting. ONEP’s new division in charge of the national program
(Département pour la généralisation de l’accès à l’eau potable, DEP) would implement
the project and coordinate internally. The TA would support this division. The financial
division (Direction Financière, DFI) would represent ONEP as borrower and remain
IBRD’s main contact for the loan management.
1.6 Revised Components
19. The components were not revised. The costs per component and expected
contributions from ONEE and local communities were not modified to reflect the delinking
with AFD loan in 2014 (see section 1.7).
1.7 Other Significant Changes
20. Extension. Initially designed for a seven-year implementation period, the project was
granted a 23-month extension from December 31, 2012 to November 30, 2014, through a
Level 2 restructuring approved on September 9, 2011. This extension was deemed
sufficient to compensate for initial delays and recurrent issues slowing down some
activities (see section 2.2) and allow for the full achievement of the PDO.
21. Change in project scope. Given the slow implementation and lack of recordable
progress in AFD-funded areas, ONEP and the Bank agreed in 2011 to track key indicators’
progress in IBRD-funded areas separately. After AFD announced the extension of its loan
in early November 2014, a final Level 2 restructuring (approved on November 25, 2014)
confirmed the delinking from the AFD-funded operation and the preparation of separate
completion reports. As a result, the present ICR will assess achievements in IBRD-funded
areas only, and efficiency based on a reduced total project cost (without the AFD’s US$24
million).
22. Results Framework. Following the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in June 2010, ONEP
and the Bank agreed on explicit definitions for initial indicators to address difficulties in
interpreting and reporting these indicators. The 2011 restructuring acknowledged the
proposed changes annexed to the borrower’s request (Annex 3, paragraph 6). In particular,
the key indicator #1 target value was broken down to track the population in IBRD-funded
areas only, then estimated at 323,600. Other adjustments were made through the 2014
restructuring (see details in the ICR datasheet).
23. Use of funds. Reallocations of loan proceeds between disbursing categories resulted
in an increased share of funding to support Component 1. See Annex 1 for details.


                                             18
24. Definitions. The 2011 restructuring updated the definition of project areas following
administrative changes. 6 A restructuring dated May 9, 2013 reflected the new name of the
borrower and implementing agency, ONEE. 7 In this report, we use ONEE or ONEP
depending on the context, or simply “the Office”.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
25. Background analysis and alternatives. The team during preparation drew lessons
from earlier operations, which are captured in the 2003 PAGER ICR (see section 1.1). 8 A
“PAGER II” was discarded as this model could not provide sustainable access nationwide,
and an alternative—to combine rural roads and water—was considered too complex to
implement. The institutional shift of engaging ONEP in rural water was a game-changer.
The GEP Provincial Master Plans developed by ONEP provided relevant information to
scope potential activities in rural areas with low rates of access.
26. Sustainability of access. ONEP aimed to ensure sustainable access at the village
level. As illustrated in Figure 1, this involved (i) reliable supply in quantity and quality
through the regional trunk lines already supplying urban centers and high-quality design 9
and construction; (ii) sharing with local communities the investment costs up to the village
access points, or SPs—HCs downstream would rely on communities’ investments; and (iii)
developing sustainable management structures for the distribution systems to supplement
ONEP’s O&M capacity. The PAD introduced an indicator on WUAs’ cost recovery, but
provided limited information on tariff levels that would be both affordable to users and
attractive to operators.
27. Cost recovery and financial sustainability. Given that costs to provide water in rural
areas were higher than sales revenues, the model relied on ONEP’s capacity to cross-
subsidize operations with revenues from urban operations. To be financially sustainable,
the rural model had to develop cost-effective management models for the local systems,
including through O&M delegation to local private firms. Although no supporting activity
was directly funded by the project, it planned (see paragraph 16) to test OBA models in the
project areas. Another pillar (see PAD, p. 9) relied on the intended adjustments to ONEP’s
tariffs for bulk water. The Framework Contract between ONEP and GOM was the key
instrument governing such strategic issues 10 and the overall success of the national
program—and the rationale for the Bank’s engagement in the sector dialogue.

  Safi Province was split into Safi and Youssoufia; El Jadida was split into El Jadida and Sidi Bennour.

  ONEP was merged in 2012 with the National Electricity Utility ONE. ONEP became the so-called Water
branch, and ONE the Electricity branch of ONEE.”

  Systems were designed for a full domestic service based on a 50 liters/capita/day supply.

   The Framework Contract (Contrat Programme) defines, among others, the respective share of
investments between ONEE, the CRs, and the beneficiaries as well as tariff levels.

28. Participatory approach. Community participation was a third pillar of
sustainability. To foster ownership, match actual demand, and build local capacity, the
TA’s tasks included awareness-raising and communication activities to mobilize
beneficiaries and CRs responsible for service provision. Consultations were planned to
help these stakeholders jointly determine the level of service and the management model
they wished and were ready to pay for. Training sessions for operators were also planned.
Indicators measuring participation included the level of CRs’ and beneficiaries’
contributions and the involvement of women in water associations.
29. Sanitation. Introducing sanitation to mitigate environmental and social risks linked
to increased wastewater flows from HCs made good sense from a technical viewpoint. At
appraisal however, responsibilities and funding for rural sanitation were not clear and
ONEP was reluctant to engage in this area given costs and capacity limitations. The project
would only fund a few pilot sewerage systems. Elsewhere, users opting for HCs would
implement mitigating solutions on their own, through on-site or collective facilities.
Hygiene education would be included in the participatory approach.
30. PDO and components. The PDO included two dimensions: (1) increased sustainable
access to potable water supply in rural areas; and (2) improved wastewater management
and hygiene practices. PDO1 mirrored ONEP’s national mandate and focused on selected
provinces and poor rural areas. Achieving PDO2, in contrast, relied on progress in PDO1,
in particular increased water consumption through HCs. This was rather ambitious, given
the lack of a clear institutional framework for rural HCs and sanitation, even with a pilot
approach proposed for Component 2. Meanwhile, HCs were crucial to reach the targeted
population. In addition, issues relevant to sustainability required clearer definitions and
measurable indicators. The sustainable management structures in the key indicator #2 (see
section 1.2) referred mostly, in the PAD, to operators for HCs while caretakers’ ability to
make a living from SPs was not really discussed. How TA support would help build
ONEP’s capacity remained vague and was not captured by Component 3 indicators.
31. Risk and mitigation measures. The PAD considered the overall project risk modest.
Two risks were addressed: (i) the Agreements signed with CRs mitigated the risk of not
recovering their contributions; (ii) the financial covenant requesting that 15 percent of
annual investments be self-financed would help monitor ONEP’s financial viability and


                                                   20
coverage of operational deficits. Yet, in hindsight, some risks that hindered implementation
and PDO achievement were underestimated. First, TA support was planned to mitigate the
risk of “rushed implementation to increase the access rate, due to political pressure” (PAD),
and improve project sustainability through extended support to operators. Despite several
amendments to increasing its resources, TA proved insufficient to fully control those risks.
Second, contrary to the PAD assumptions, beneficiary financial contributions were not
easy to collect despite the high demand for water, and the HC pre-financing mechanism
was not ready for implementation. The MTR noted that the interest in the SP level of
service or preference for HCs would have deserved more attention during preparation, as
did the feasibility of the pre-financing mechanism. Third, risks related to land acquisition
had not been anticipated. ONEP had limited experience in this area at such a scale, which
became a real implementation challenge.
32. Quality at Entry Analysis (QEA). The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) performed
a QEA just after the project went into effect (see section 5.1). 11
2.2 Implementation
33. The project was implemented over nine years between effectiveness in January 2006
and closing in November 2014. The MTR in June 2010 was important to take stock of
progress and point out implementation issues. Progress toward the Development Objective
(DO) was rated between satisfactory and moderately satisfactory over the nine years,
suggesting a positive balance between progress and recurrent issues.
34. The project delivered on building SPs in villages but implementation delays
affected results. The project maintained an overall scope of 11 subprojects covering
almost 1,200 villages. A massive production and conveyance infrastructure and 1,141 SPs
were constructed. Several factors, however, delayed progress, preventing many of these
facilities from becoming functional: 762 were technically ready to provide water, and only
654 provided commercial service 12 to villagers at completion. After initial delays preparing
standard bidding document templates acceptable to the Bank, the project experienced
delays in procurement, including to recruit a firm for TA services. The actual duration of
works contracts took on average 2.8 times longer than planned, due to the complex
packaging and sequencing of contracts, issues related to land acquisition and at times the
firms’ limited capacities. Securing authorizations from other public entities to work on the
public domain, notably road crossings or interconnections with power lines, also affected
results (see Annex 7): at closing, over 200 SPs were not functional due to this problem.
35. Oppositions to land acquisition became a major implementation issue.
Oppositions to land acquisition were a major reason for delayed implementation and actual
results (see Annex 7 and ONEE’s completion report). ONEE had to acquire a large number




11
  QEA8, FY2006–07, Report 44714: Panel Report dated September 9, 2007.
12
  Facilities could provide commercial service only once a caretaker was selected by the communities,
appointed by the local government, registered as ONEP’s subscriber and took over operations.


                                                   21
of plots (almost 2,000 representing about 100 km2) to install water infrastructure. 13 In many
cases, claimants did not have proper documentation (land titles, deeds for customary land
rights, etc.) to inform the procedures for land acquisition and access to compensation. In
the first years, ONEP moved to start the works quickly, but encountered a lot of oppositions
from landowners. Though most issues were resolved quickly, some cases remained
pending for years and affected work completion. Meanwhile, the level of paid
compensation remained low. Following MTR recommendations, ONEP enhanced efforts
to better document the list and status of plots acquired and related compensations. Due to
limited resources and adequate skills, carrying out this task manually proved daunting (see
section 2.4). In 2013, ONEE’s Steering Committee agreed on measures to facilitate, as per
the Constitution, the implementation of landowners’ rights—such as using simplified
decrees for temporary occupation of public domains and provisioning funds for
compensation without jeopardizing works and service provision to the population.
36. A participatory approach was implemented, with mixed results. The project
enabled ONEE to improve its level of engagement with citizens and customers. The SMTs
followed a standardized protocol including several field visits. They started by identifying
villages’ interest in the project and continued with conducting participatory diagnostics and
facilitating the selection and appointment of a reliable caretaker. Yet, the underlying
objectives of this approach—to respond to local communities and authorities’ preferences,
and to address an increased demand for HCs—were not fully achieved. First, works in the
initial subprojects started before the TA and SMTs were in place: in some places,
consultations took place after the construction of SPs, and at times villagers did not want
to pay for them. Second, this expertise was outsourced: SMTs were qualified, but
temporary resources constrained by the TA budget. Overall, the time spent on each
village/subproject was modest to ensure communities’ full ownership of systems.
37. Local governments. CRs played an important role in project implementation as the
parties primarily responsible for service delivery. At completion all CRs had signed the co-
financing agreements with ONEE and paid their share of the conveyance system costs,
sometimes with delays. For ONEE’s provincial representatives and the TA, taking into
account local interests, political agendas, and citizens/beneficiaries’ expectations required
careful communication and continued coordination. It took time to mobilize the CR
officials to facilitate land acquisition and approve the appointment of caretakers, while
clarifying the constraints associated with distribution networks. These delays also
contributed to the late operationalization of many SPs at project closing.
38. Beneficiaries. Compared to the CRs, the financial contributions paid by beneficiaries
remained low. On average, less than 20 percent of household contributions were collected
across subprojects. ICR consultations confirmed findings from participatory diagnostics
and the MTR: some villages did not want SPs, either in areas with free sources of good
water or when more affluent residents wanted to move directly to HCs. The messages
delivered during initial consultations regarding the feasibility and timeframe to develop




13
  As per agreements signed with ONEE, the CRs had to provide ONEE with the land needed to install
access points and distribution networks, in a process that sometimes entailed lengthy negotiations.


                                                  22
village networks may, in retrospect, have been optimistic or misunderstood (see Annex 7).
Meanwhile, the slow or inadequate progress of works affected villagers’ willingness to
contribute and raised frustration in some areas. Post MTR, ONEE noted that the cost of
collection exceeded the expected revenues from SP fees, and pragmatically decided that
the DH 500 contribution would serve as a down payment for HCs applications.
39. Progress on HCs service delivery has prepared the ground for results. The
extended implementation period was not sufficient to remove the structural obstacles
affecting Component 2 activities (see section 2.1). Facing staff and revenues limitations,
ONEE initially focused on its primary contractual objective: extending access through SPs.
Yet it maintained the objective to develop HCs. First, in June 2011 a restructuring request
pointed out progress made in the rural HC cost-sharing arrangement, which was boosted
during the preparation of the Bank-funded Regional Potable Water Supply Systems Project
(P100397). 14 The project needed (i) additional time to fine-tune communication and
implementation mechanisms, and (ii) a reduced target below the initial 265 targeted
villages (240 in IBRD areas) for distribution networks and HCs. A 23-month extension
was granted, and the target revised to a range of 50–100 pilot villages. Scoping studies to
identify eligible villages started soon. Second, although too late to be used in this project,
ONEE and the Bank clarified fiduciary procedures to operationalize the pre-financing
mechanism for subsidized connections (see section 2.4). Lastly, with Bank support, ONEE
streamlined its sustainable management models through pilot projects and evaluation
studies. 15 Standard bidding procedures and documents for private sector participation
operations were prepared, evolving from traditional works contracts into properly
delegated management contracts (see section 2.5).
40. Sanitation. Throughout implementation, ONEE reiterated its reluctance to invest its
own funds in sanitation facilities without a clear mandate and financing options. It put the
sanitation pilots under Component 2 on a definite hold in mid-2012, as GOM announced
the launch of its National Rural Sanitation Strategy. This was acknowledged in subsequent
supervision reports, but did not trigger a restructuring request. ONEE limited activities on
sanitation/wastewater to the environmental assessments under the HC scoping studies.
41. Changes in the Moroccan political economy. Stakeholders during ICR
consultations stressed that since 2011—the Arab Spring triggered social turmoil in
Morocco and a new Constitution reaffirmed the country’s dedication to human rights



14
   To adjust to more realistic distribution costs and reduce the risk of insufficiently covered investments, in
2009 the Ministry of Interior agreed to change the level of contributions required from the CRs (from 30 to
50 percent of distribution costs) and beneficiary households (from DH 2,500 to DH 3,500 for at least
70 percent of villagers, to cover the other 50 percent of the costs).
15
   In 2011, ONEE launched a pilot PPP operation developed with GPOBA grant support in Sidi Kacem
province in northwest Morocco. A 10-year lease contract using output-based performance subsidies has
been successfully implemented since then. In 2012, with Bank support under the Regional Potable Water
Supply Systems Project (P100397), ONEE performed a comprehensive evaluation of private sector
participation models including individual operators or small local firms (“micro-entreprise”), with or
without transfer of risk (“sous-traitance” or “sous-délégation”). An important finding was that only
30 percent of the WUAs managing distribution systems were able to operate after a couple of years;
conversely, a PPP was the most efficient management model in terms of cost and benefit.


                                                      23
principles, inclusion and social participation, and transparency and accountability of
political power—, citizens and project beneficiaries had higher expectations for modern
public service provision, land rights, and compensation for land use.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
42. M&E design. In the PAD, ONEP’s M&E unit was to have overall responsibility to
monitor data that would be collected (i) at the village level, by SMTs and beneficiary
surveys, and (ii) internally, by DEP in coordination with other relevant units. Tools to
collect operational data at the subproject level were to be developed after effectiveness, as
per the Loan Agreement (Article 4, Financial Covenants, section 4.04). Indicators were
uneven: some were quite specific (e.g. measuring O&M recovery through tariffs applied
only to WUAs), while others were rather unclear (e.g. on sustainable management
structures or on ONEP’s operational deficit). How the M&E system would inform decision
making was not explicit in the PAD.
43. M&E implementation. The TA, once in place, developed simple tools like Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets to monitor implementation progress in the various subprojects. It
actively coordinated with construction firms and provincial units to aggregate data on civil
works, SPs, and financial contributions and submitted detailed quarterly reports. In support
of the participatory approach, M&E was discussed at kick-off in 2006, and the household
surveys were included in the TA’s TORs. The first survey was carried out to inform the
MTR in 2010 (year 4 of implementation), a second survey took place in 2012, and the final
one before closing, when several subprojects started to operate. The sample focused on
villages supplied by operational SPs for at least one year. Data collection included both
qualitative (observations, focus groups) and quantitative approaches.
44. M&E utilization. The MTR stressed that several indicators of the Results Framework
were confusing and should be reviewed. Changes agreed upon between ONEE and the
Bank were limited, though: indicators remained largely focused on local counterparts’
contributions and included no clear measure of sustainability. 16 Also, existing information
systems, 17 informed by local units and consolidated centrally, do not provide information
at subproject level (i.e. project or donor specific), and are sometimes limited by ONEE’s
local capacity to input data. As a result, though substantive data are available, it is difficult
to aggregate or disaggregate them according to needs. Reconciling information could have
helped articulate progress or bottlenecks and provided the rationale for a more
comprehensive restructuring. The beneficiary surveys, on the other hand, were useful in
assessing beneficiaries’ perceptions, but provided limited quantified data needed to inform
the RF (e.g. hygiene practices) or the economic benefits induced by the project (e.g. on
time saved by using SPs). Also, the sampling method did not include a control group,
undermining any assessment of the project’s effective role in observed changes. 18



16
   The Results Framework in the ISRs did not fully reflect the PAD indicators.
17
   ONEE’s existing digitized platforms include operational data management (gestion des données
d’exploitation), the commercial system, the accounting system, and so on.
18
   Without a counterfactual scenario, one cannot conclude if (cause) and to what extent (attribution) the
project triggered some changes. For instance, the survey would help determine whether people using


                                                     24
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards
45. The project was approved as a Category B, with limited adverse environmental and
social impacts linked to civil works and increased wastewater flows from HCs. The PAD
did not foresee resettlements, only expropriations and temporary use of land. Operational
Policy and Bank Procedure (OP-BP) 4.01 and OP-BP 4.12 were triggered.
46. Compliance with OP-BP 4.01. An Environmental Management Framework was
published in 2005 and further implemented, although sometimes with delays. ONEE
performed required environmental screenings for each subproject and monitored
contractors to ensure security compliance at the construction sites. It also conducted
environmental screenings required for Component 2 together with other technical studies
and social mobilization to select villages eligible for HCs.
47. Non-compliance with OP-BP 4.12. A Resettlement Policy Framework was
published in 2005, but its implementation proved difficult. The Loan Agreement explicitly
stated (Schedule 5, section 4) that land acquisition measures should be carried out and their
application monitored in years 3 and 5. These evaluations were not found in the project
files. The MTR urged ONEE to document activities undertaken to comply with Moroccan
law and OP-BP 4.12, and to reduce delays in compensating affected people. Thereafter,
supervision missions systematically recalled the mitigation measures discussed with the
teams of the Regional Safeguards Advisor and Quality Assurance and Compliance Unit
(QACU). These measures were as follows: all potentially affected landowners should be
informed about the acquisition process, including procedures and timelines for assessing
and accessing compensation; a judicial procedure (expropriation) is foreseen in an
amicable settlement is not reached; and works should be authorized only when adequate
provision for compensation is secured.
48. The safeguards performance was rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory until
mid-2013. Bank reports noted progress toward the better documentation of acquisition and
compensation processes, and ONEE submitted a land acquisition monitoring report before
closing. Yet, at the end of 2014, only around 10 percent of expected compensations had
been paid in El Jadida subprojects and none in those of Safi and Youssoufia. 19 This
represented a major deviation from both Moroccan legislation and Bank requirements.
ONEE will have to perform an audit on land acquisition processes and regularize all
pending procedures. It is fair to stress that obstacles to the swift completion of land
acquisitions in accordance with OP-BP 4.12 provisions are beyond ONEE’s sole control.
The institutional framework governing land acquisition and compensation is complex, and
the widespread absence of official land titles remains an overarching obstacle to the
claiming and receipt of compensation.

Fiduciary Compliance
49. Procurement. No major procurement issue was raised during implementation, except
for some delays in the awarding of contracts: ONEE performed procurement in accordance
with Bank standards and successfully handled more than 40 different contractors, including
several contract amendments, to adjust to implementation constraints and actual needs.
50. Financial management (FM). FM performance was rated satisfactory until 2012, as
there were no major deviations from the FM policy, and audit reports did not contain any
qualified opinions. However, the performance was downgraded to moderately satisfactory
in the last four ISRs. Recent interim unaudited FM reports and annual audit reports were
submitted late, and did not include the level of detail requested (such as of cumulated
disbursements by loan and by component). Despite a Loan Agreement’s covenant to
upgrade the existing accounting system, the contract to implement a module able to process
this information automatically was terminated in 2013, and ONEE did not set up an
alternative plan. The audit report and internal control letter for 2013 and 2014 were also
submitted after some delay. 20 Conversely, ONEE complied with the financial covenant 21
to meet an annual 15 percent self-financing ratio of its investment program, a key indicator
of its ability to support deficits in rural operations.
51. Disbursement. As of November 30, 2014 at project closing, disbursements reached
a total of US$52.07 million, or 87 percent of the US$60 million Bank loan. They increased
to 57.27 million, or 95 percent, when the loan closed on June 5, 2015 after a six-month
grace period. Procedures for the submission of disbursement requests were revised during
the project to speed up disbursements, which were sometimes delayed by incomplete
documentation. Reallocations of funds allowed ONEE to incorporate a new subproject in
2011, to be financed with initially unallocated funds (2011), and lately (2014) to use the
undisbursed pre-financing category to partially finance with project funds some works
initiated with ONEE’s own funds and consistent with the PDO (see section 2.5 and Annex
2). This contributed to increasing the final disbursement ratio. It was clarified in end 2012
that disbursing funds earmarked for the pre-financing mechanism needed a revised
Disbursement Letter to authorize advances through a designated account and had to be
justified by actual subsidized connections. The amendment request could not be
implemented since HCs pilots could not be physically installed before project closing.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
52. ONEE’s post-completion plan includes resources and institutional arrangements for
each subproject. Section 4 provides more details on the structures and mechanisms in place
or those ready to be developed to maintain the systems built and ensure cost recovery.




20
   The agreement during Negotiations was that audits were to be approved by ONEP’s Board before being
submitted to the Bank; however, ONEE’s Board did not meet on a regular basis during the project.
21
   This covenant was aligned, through the final restructuring in November 2014, with the calculation
formula applied in other IBRD projects after ONEP became ONEE.


                                                 26
Incomplete activities will continue with ONEE’s or other funds. TA support will continue
on a partial basis to follow up on pending activities in the IBRD areas. 22
53. In addition, the Bank remains involved through other ongoing projects with ONEE,
in particular the Regional Potable Water Supply Project and the Rural Water Supply Project
(P100397 and P145529), which partially intervene in the same or adjacent CRs. For
instance, the Lanouaate subproject benefited from funds from this project and will be
completed under P100397, while other areas under P145529 will take advantage of the
now-ready pre-financing mechanism to enable the shift to HCs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives: Substantial
54. The project objective has remained relevant throughout implementation given the
lagging rates of access to water and sanitation services in Morocco’s poor rural areas. It is
aligned with the Government’s ongoing (i) National Initiative for Human Development to
reduce poverty, (ii) National Program to Generalize Access to Water Supply in Rural
Areas, which achieved a 93 percent access rate in 2013 (up from 61 percent in 2004), and
(iii) National Program for Rural Sanitation, which addresses the implications of climate
change and pollution on scarce water resources and people’s health. The project objective
also supports Result Area 3 of the CPS FY14-17 (strengthening governance and institutions
for improved service delivery to all citizens) and its Strategic Outcome 3.4 (expanding
access to basic services), which support the Bank’s corporate goals to ending poverty and
boosting shared prosperity while ensuring sustainability.
Relevance of Design and Implementation: Modest
55. The project design, reflecting a national policy shift that gives ONEP a mandate to
improve access to water supply in rural areas, attempted to balance infrastructure
development and institutional strengthening. The approach was bold and supported by
good principles of participation, cost recovery, and sustainability—both at the village level
and at ONEP’s level. However, as discussed in section 2.1, some risks were underestimated
or not anticipated, including rural residents’ willingness to pay for or acceptance of the
service level provided, which was the backbone of the project design. Developing HCs
together with appropriate sanitation measures to mitigate potential adverse impact was a
sound strategy. Yet the lack of a clear institutional framework and financial incentives was
a limiting factor and this pilot component weighed a lot on the achievement of the two-fold
PDO—20 percent of the initial target population were expected to access HCs and have
adequate sanitation solutions in place.
56. The PDO and components were not restructured to adjust to the evolving situation,
even when ONEE confirmed that this project would not finance the sanitation pilots or

 From December 1, 2014 to June 2016, AFD is financing 100% of the TA’s contract (Amendment 5). It
was agreed that some time could be spent in IBRD areas.


                                                27
when the risk of not implementing the HC pilot (due to delays in scoping studies and
difficulties in establishing the pre-financing mechanism) was acknowledged in 2013.
Given the TA/SMTs’ limited resources, and their focus on more pressing issues such as
the selection of caretakers and negotiations with CRs, hygiene promotion and behavior
change did not get the attention and time needed to achieve substantial outcomes.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
PDO1: Increase Sustainable Access to Potable Water in Rural Areas: Modest
57. The target of 323,600 people provided with access to Improved Water Sources under
the IBRD loan was achieved at a rate of 59 percent. At project completion, the project
provided 191,754 people access to potable water through SPs. Comparatively, in the AFD-
funded areas, major difficulties prevented any single SP from becoming operational during
the same duration. This additional population contributed to the steady increase in access
rates in the provinces supported by the project between 2004 and 2014 (see table below).
There is a reasonable likelihood that the project would provide access to water to up to
237,000 people (73 percent of target population) in the near future, with over 100
additional SPs already technically functioning at completion becoming commercially
operated.
 Provinces      Access Rate 2004      Access Rate 2014       Increase 2004–14       Project’s contribution
 El Jedida            34%                    99%                   +65%                      26%
 Safi                 29%                    82%                   +53%                      42%
 Youssoufia           34%                    94%                   +60%                      58%
 Source: Access rates are provided by ONEE. The project contributions to the increased rates are estimated
 based on populations actually benefiting from operational SPs.
58. The target of 90% of the water supply and wastewater facilities built under the project
with well-functioning and sustainable management structures was achieved at 64%. At
closing, out of the 1,141 SPs built, 654 (57 percent, or 64 percent of the 90 percent target)
were well-functioning (with water running) and in commercial use, managed by a caretaker
with a subscription policy with ONEE. ONEE made important efforts to resolve pending
technical issues and get caretakers ready to operate the SPs; yet at completion, three of the
11 systems (27 percent) had SPs built but not functioning.
59. It is fair to mention the production and conveyance infrastructure developed: though
it is not accounted for by the project indicators, such infrastructure will help serve more
beneficiaries in the medium and long term. The 11 subprojects cover 1,162 villages and
come with a total of 2,474 km of new pipe networks installed (86 percent for distribution);
45 new storage tanks providing a capacity of 12,525 cubic meters (m3); 20 pumping and
booster stations; three remote monitoring systems, and 11 power lines.
60. The project achieved mixed results in collecting financial contributions from local
counterparts. The target of 100 percent of local governments paying the requested share
was fully achieved in El Jadida and by 80 percent in the Safi and Youssoufia provinces. In
contrast, the target of 95 percent of beneficiaries paying their share of the investment cost
was not achieved: 8 percent of households contributed in El Jadida and 28 percent in
Safi/Youssoufia, and amounts collected in Safi/Youssoufia were 16 percent of those
expected. ICR consultations confirmed that the issue was not affordability: in most cases,


                                                   28
beneficiaries’ unwillingness to pay for SPs increased together with demand for HCs. ONEE
decided to pay with its own funds that missing part of the financing plan to avoid blocking
other investments to extend access. But it reflected limited achievement of the principles
of participation and demand-responsiveness.
61. As discussed earlier, conditions to deliver HCs in villages were not met during the
project. Nonetheless, the project clearly supported the implementation of the National
Program to Generalize Access to Water Supply in Rural Areas, and it provided ONEE and
GOM with guidance to address constraints in an evolving context. First, ONEE made
important progress over the project implementation period, in articulating a solid HC
service delivery policy. The Guidebook for House Connections, published 23 in 2014,
summarizes all the criteria and procedures to apply (see Annex 2). Bank support has been
instrumental in strengthening ONEE’s operational knowledge on a range of management
models for village networks, including using performance-based incentives for small PPP
operators. Second, at the project level, ONEE maintained the momentum toward HCs. At
closing, design studies were available for 11 villages meeting the eligibility criteria, and
over 1,700 households had signed commitments to apply for HCs in the project areas.
These and other households will be able to benefit from the pre-financing mechanism now
in place under the Rural Water Supply Project (P145529).
PDO2: Promote Improved Wastewater Management and Hygiene Practices: Negligible
62. As discussed earlier, conditions were not met during the project to deliver wastewater
pilots and to enhance on-site or off-site facilities for managing wastewater. Regarding
hygiene practices, the PAD (p. 24–25) proposed two standardized 24 indicators to assess
progress of the hygiene education activity under Component 3: (i) undertaking hand
washing at critical times (20 percent of the target population) and (ii) safe water storage at
home (80 percent of households with adequate water quality). How these two might be
combined to measure the key indicator for PDO2—at least 20 percent of users have
adopted improved hygiene practices—was unclear. Awareness-raising activities on water
and hygiene took place once the SPs became operational and people started to use them.
These included practices related to environmental hygiene (cleanliness around the facility,
gray water disposal practices, etc.) and personal hygiene (hand washing and adequate
storage to preserve water quality). But the limited evidence could not confirm that the
project improved hygiene practices.
63. The TA’s beneficiary survey in 2012 reported that 98 percent of the respondents
washed their hands with soap after using the toilet (only 10 percent did not have one). From
then on, monitoring reports used this figure as a significant achievement of the project;
however, the actual explanation in the report (p. 40) provides a different perspective. First,
the figure of 98 percent does not come from the quantitative survey but from focus groups:
while it reflects a consensus among participants; it is doubtful that people would publicly

  They are used in national health surveys such as the UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
(MICS) and the USAID’s Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).


                                                  29
declare they did not wash their hands. 25 Second, the report states that “this performance is
not related to the project because these practices were ordinary practices for adults before
the project.” Third, the final survey, at completion, noted that around 90 percent of toilets
were equipped with soap but that only 50 percent of the respondents 26 “used soap” after
using the toilet (p. 57), which contradicted the previous statement. Water storage at home
was not included. No other data 27 could be found to understand how the initial baseline
(5 percent) and target (20 percent) were established, or corroborate the reported results.
Certainly, health indicators have increased in Morocco over the past decade and access to
ONEE’s water, compliant with safe drinking water standards, has contributed to it. Despite
the efforts made under the project, the quality of evidence strongly undermines the results
reported and the rating of this PDO2.
3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest
64. Economic rates of return (ERRs) were estimated ex-ante and ex-post. An ex-ante
cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was carried out for a sample of 13 RWS subprojects, and for
the project as a whole (see section 1.5 and Annex 3 for details). The conservatively
estimated benefits stemmed from time saved on fetching water and health benefits. The
main costs used in calculating the ERR on investments were: (i) the costs of construction,
feasibility studies, and works supervision; and (ii) costs associated with project
management, implementation, and O&M of water supply and wastewater systems. For the
entire project, including both IBRD and AFD loans, 28 the ex-ante ERR was estimated at
13 percent, with a positive net present value (NPV) of DH 229 million (equivalent to about
US$ 25 million) at a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital and benefiting 526,672 people.
ERRs of the 13 proposed subprojects (in El Jadida, Safi, Essaouira, Taza, and Taounate
provinces) ranged from 6 to 34 percent. The ERRs of the subprojects proposed for the
IBRD financing ranged from 10 to 34 percent. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken that
confirmed the robustness of the model to deviations from the base case assumptions.
65. The ex-post economic analysis used the analytical framework established by the ex-
ante model and updated the CBA with current values based on the actual implementation
scope of the project, reflecting significant changes in subprojects eventually implemented,
and important variations of ERRs across subprojects (see section 1.7 and Annex 3). The
project supported by IBRD implemented a total of 11 subprojects (five in El Jadida and six
in the Safi and Youssoufia), whose ex-post ERRs ranged from 2 to 23 percent, with an
overall project ERR of 12 percent and a positive NPV of DH 49 million (US$4.5 million)



25
   The ICR did not have access to the surveys’ TORs and the questionnaire tool.
26
   The report does not say if this figure resulted from the quantitative survey or focus group discussions.
27
   Neither the last DHS available for Morocco (2003–04) nor the last MICS (2006–07) reported any
specific result on hand washing or water storage at home. The recent National Survey on Population and
Family Health (2011) and statistics of the Ministry of Health are also silent on these issues.
28
   Since the project followed a framework approach, in which actual subprojects were not known in
advance, the economic analysis considered a sample of subprojects based of the financial envelope to be
provided by IBRD and AFD. No specific ERR and NPV were calculated for IBRD-financed subprojects.


                                                     30
at a 10 percent opportunity cost of capital and benefiting 191,754 people. The ex-post ERR
is only slightly lower than the ex-ante value despite a significantly lower number of
beneficiaries since: (i) overall project cost was reduced in the ex-post analysis to reflect the
delinking from the AFD-financed project, and (ii) the subprojects assigned to receive AFD
financing (Taza and Taounate provinces) had ex-ante ERRs significantly lower than the
average of other subprojects, and their exclusion had a positive impact on the ex-post ERR.
For the subprojects included both ex-ante and ex-post, the ERR is in most cases lower ex-
post, due to late operationalization of SPs and the absence of benefits associated with HCs.
66. The ex-post assessment confirmed that project investments per capita exceeded the
cost-effective limit of DH 2,371 (US$247) set at inception, as many systems were mostly
implemented but could not be put in operation before project closing. The ex-post cost per
capita was DH 2,834 (US$295) for the overall project, DH 2,985 (US$310) for El Jadida
subprojects, and DH 2,725 (US$284) for Safi/Youssoufia subprojects. International
benchmarks for rural water schemes (at an average of US$50/capita) usually refer to
simpler systems without all the conveyance infrastructure of the Moroccan design, making
any comparison difficult.
67. The methodology used in both ex-ante and ex-post analyses gives the lower bound of
the benefits of rural water investments due to the conservative nature of the assessment.
Yet, only 57 percent of the SPs built were fully operational at completion and accounted
for in the analysis. The overall ERR over 10 percent shows that investments were justified
to increase rural access to potable water supply in three provinces of Morocco, but
benefited fewer beneficiaries and hence were not as cost-effective as expected.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
68. The rating is Unsatisfactory. It results from an “averaging split sub-ratings
assessment” of the various dimensions impacting the overall outcome, lowered by modest
design and efficacy. First, the relevance of objectives is substantial. Relevance of design,
in contrast, is modest as weaknesses in the risks assessment and the Results Framework
affected implementation and performance assessment, and adjustments were too limited to
turn around implementation progress. Second, the project accomplished less than expected
and its efficiency is modest, even if the ERR shows that the investments were justified.
Third, the overall efficacy of the project is modest, despite ONEE’s progress over the
decade to generalize access to potable water in rural areas. The core part of the PDO, which
aimed to increase the sustainable access to potable water in rural areas, achieved limited
success in terms of sustainability and number of beneficiaries, and mixed performance on
participation and demand-responsiveness. While the project contributed to increased
access rates in the project areas, infrastructure able to serve more people in the future, and
consolidation of the HCs service delivery model, these results were not captured in the
Results Framework. Achievement of the second part of the PDO is negligible, with no
physical output on sanitation and limited evidence on hygiene practices. In total, both parts
of the PDO were not fully achieved, and several indicators had low achievement rates.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                              31
69. The project targeted some of the most underserved areas in the poorest provinces and
CRs in Morocco, and contributed to increased access rates there. But no evidence links
progress in access to water supply through this project to reduction in overall poverty.
Improved access to electricity and changes in agricultural activities and revenues also
triggered economic and social changes, including improvements in housing materials and
household appliances, as noted in the beneficiary survey.
70. The project achieved mixed results in engaging women in water management. Only
one-third of the SMT members and 6 percent of the caretakers were women. Although an
indirect outcome, during the project ONEE signed memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) with the ministries in charge of health and education to extend water connections
to health centers and schools in rural areas, enhancing the potential for human development
in the beneficiary communities.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
71. In 2005 ONEP was the most credible candidate to push forward the rural water agenda
and took up that challenge over the years of the project. Evolving from an urban water
utility with recognized experience in water production, transmission in bulk to large urban
utilities, and provision of water services to secondary urban centers to one also embracing
rural water supply using a decentralized approach was by no means an easy transition in
mindset. Yet the implementing agency expanded its customer base and its capacity to work
in various geographic and social contexts. This is an important institutional achievement
for ONEE and the country.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N.A.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
72. Beneficiary Survey. As discussed above, the final beneficiary survey planned under
the TA contract was performed at completion; therefore no separate survey was carried out
for this ICR. Despite flaws in the methodology, findings are consistent with previous
surveys and field visits conducted during the ICR missions. On average, people using SPs
were satisfied with the improved convenience and water quality, and fair rates. Despite low
individual consumption levels, people progressively seemed to rely more and more on this
improved source of water (see Annex 5 for details).
73. Stakeholder Workshops. Stakeholder consultations were held during the second ICR
mission, at the provincial level and at ONEE’s headquarters. The key takeaways that
emerged include the satisfaction of people benefiting from SPs and also the frustration of
years of delays and high expectations for HCs; constrained implementation capacity at the
local level, and heavy internal procedures from the project and program centralized
supervision; the overarching issue of land acquisition and compensation; and difficulties
in dealing with an ambitious national program and multiple projects’ monitoring,
safeguards, and fiduciary requirements (see Annex 6 for details).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Modest



                                            32
74. Structures in place are flexible enough to limit adverse effects on the outcomes.
Existing Agreements signed with CRs for each subproject remain in place, mandating
ONEE to develop infrastructure and provide sustainable access to water at an agreed level
of service and cost. For SP service delivery, caretakers are appointed by the CR based on
villagers’ proposal. They purchase bulk water from ONEE at a subsidized rate of DH
2.5/cubic meter, and sell to villagers at a maximum price of DH 10/cubic meter. Caretaker
does not earn much, and the job is not a full-time position, as is made clear in the “job
description.” 29 This might encourage the turnover of caretakers. In the medium run, the
development of HCs may lead more professional operators to take over the systems. But
in scattered villages, the SP will remain the only option for some time.
75. To reduce its O&M costs in project areas, ONEE has already set up small PPPs under
classic subcontracting arrangements in Ouled Frej (2011), and Sidi Smail, Sidi Abed, and
Mouley Abdellah (2014). Two other contracts for Chemaia/Youssoufia and Mazagan will
be procured in mid-2015. Replicating the successful GPOBA pilot in Sidi Kacem (see
section 2.2), sub-delegations (with risk transferred to the private operator and incentives
based on performance) under a 10-year lease should be tendered in 2015 for Safi Sud and
Safi Nord-Saadla. 30 Ultimately, the sustainability of project outcomes will largely depend
on ONEE’s capacity to scale up viable models for domestic service delivery models. Key
policy features to support a progressive shift toward this level of service were confirmed
in the 2014–17 Framework Program between ONEE and GOM. These include measures
to (i) recover debts from local governments and value added tax (VAT) refunds from GOM,
and (ii) to increase tariffs. Their implementation will be critical to allow ONEE to pursue
its mandates without threatening its financial viability.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Unsatisfactory
76. The project was prepared over FY04 to FY06, mobilizing 82 staff weeks and
$540,000 to perform due diligence in the context of a new rural water program. Building
on ONEP’s Provincial Master Plans, criteria to support the PDO achievement (poor
underserved provinces, areas with no good quality groundwater resources) were relevant
to equitably select project areas. Promoting sustainability, users’ participation and a
demand-responsive approach was an overall bold and innovative approach.
77. In retrospect however, the QEA rating of highly satisfactory appears over-optimistic
given the design shortcomings that affected implementation and results: (i) the
underestimated risks of land acquisition and compensation issues, and strong reliance on
the TA for major project features while its recruitment was not ready; (ii) compared to




29
   From a sample of standpipes in Safi (ONEE), the average margin was found to be around DH 700
monthly, from which the caretaker has to pay for routine maintenance and small repairs (ONEE covers
more important repairs).
30
   Tenders are pending confirmation of African Development Bank (AfDB) financing.


                                                  33
similar Bank projects appraised at the same period, an insufficient level of effort in the cost
estimate to implement a demand-responsive approach; (iii) the lack of sound institutional
framework to develop HCs and promote wastewater solutions; and (iv) the loose M&E and
Results Framework that undermined the assessment of crucial aspects of the project,
including sustainability.
(b) Quality of Supervision: Unsatisfactory
78. Over the nine years of implementation, the Bank undertook regular supervision
missions, prepared aide-memoires with the client, and produced 18 implementation support
status reports. The MTR in 2010 was a critical milestone to document issues faced and to
enhance implementation support. The Bank was also actively engaged in the sector
dialogue on sustainable management models, the enabling environment needed to develop
HCs, as well as the implementation of the Framework Contract. The sheer contrast in terms
of project achievements between IBRD- and AFD-funded subprojects (which had not
delivered any operational SP by November 30, 2014) largely reflects the amount of
implementation support provided to ONEE. A strong sector presence in the field,
materialized after the MTR by the relocation to Morocco of the project Task Team Leader,
was critical to help ONEE deal with complex implementation challenges. However, severe
shortcomings affect the Bank supervision rating.
79. The Bank’s enforcement of the Operational Policy 4.12 requirements has not been
consistent throughout implementation, putting both the Bank and the Client in a difficult
situation of non-compliance. Though oppositions delayed works throughout the project
period, the issue of land acquisition and compensation only surfaced in ISRs in 2009, when
the CMU requested that a safeguards specialist join the team for the MTR. Post MTR, the
issue was thoroughly dealt with and systematically raised in each supervision report, with
advice from the Regional Safeguards Advisor and QACU. Yet, proposed measures were
insufficient to reverse the situation before project closing.
80. Positive ratings of the PDO over the nine years of implementation contrast strongly
with the ICR assessment of the project outcomes: in hindsight, these ratings did not shed
enough light on the risks to PDO achievement and on the need for a stronger shift in the
project approach. The DO was rated satisfactory for most of the implementation period,
except in the time from MTR to the 2011 restructuring approval and in the last year of
implementation when it was rated moderately satisfactory. While this was consistent with
the continuous progress in the disbursement ratio and progressive construction of water
infrastructure, it did not reflect the recurrent issues that were reported (nonpayment of
users’ contributions, oppositions to land acquisition, delays in Component 2 activities after
2010, financial reporting issues after 2012) and affected DO achievement. Implementation
progress was downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory only in the final ISR. Component
2 was rated moderately unsatisfactory after the MTR and in the last two ISRs, and
Safeguards got this rating in the last four.
81. Stronger proactivity measures were needed to make up design weaknesses and
address implementation issues. The decision to extend the project was justified to
overcome implementation delays and adjust to the progress of the household connection
delivery model. However, there was room for a more substantial restructuring of the loan.
Reallocations of proceeds increased the disbursement rate. Yet, revising the components’


                                              34
consistency or even the PDO could have resulted in refocusing available time and resources
on more realistic or better measurable outputs and outcomes. Despite some changes along
the road, the Results Framework at completion does not properly capture the level of
commitment by both the Bank and ONEE, and some of the project’s achievements.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
82. The Bank performance is considered Unsatisfactory based on the combined
dimensions of quality at entry and quality of implementation.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance: Moderately Unsatisfactory
83. The Government of Morocco, as loan’s guarantor, was not directly involved in
implementation. Yet, GOM mandated ONEP to implement an ambitious rural water
program, which needed an environment conducive to successful outcomes of the different
projects and partners supporting this program. While a key pillar of sustainability for this
project was for ONEP to fulfill its operational and debt commitments, the implementation
of the successive framework contracts fell short of the adjustments to the water tariff
structure and other types of financial support from GOM that were envisioned at appraisal.
This affected ONEE’s financial situation and capacity to hire staff to address increased
needs. Similarly, improved coordination mechanisms among public agencies and the
implementation of fast-track procedures related to works in the public domain could, in
some cases, have smoothed implementation progress.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Moderately Unsatisfactory
84. This project supported ONEE’s first steps as implementing agency of the national
program to generalize access to water supply in rural areas. Given the challenges faced
since 2005, its continuous commitment to progress toward the objectives is commendable.
Indeed ONEE implemented the project in an environment that could have been more
conducive to its success and deployed significant efforts to address issues under its control.
More flexibility on tariff setting could have helped ONEE increase its sales revenues and
diversify staff and skills for O&M of rural water systems. Clearer institutional and
financing policies slowed down the implementation of sanitation pilots under the project.
85. ONEE’s Completion Report also candidly acknowledges achievements below
expectations, and the difficulties faced and areas of improvement, from procurement and
project management, at the core of its business, to participatory and social safeguards issues
that arose as new challenges for the organization. First, ONEE needs to continue
strengthening its planning and monitoring tools to better manage data at the project level:
a smooth plan for land acquisition and better sequencing between participation and works
would have enhanced implementation progress, and a dynamic dashboard could have eased
the monitoring of tasks. Second, ONEE relied a lot on the TA provided by the project;
however, some activities should remain the implementing agency’s responsibility, and
some tasks need to continue once the project is over. Building more internal capacity and
strengthened coordination within ONEE’s units could have streamlined supervision and
enhanced results. Third, after the merger of the water and electricity branches, measures to
optimize synergies could have avoided lengthy discussions and sped up the water systems’



                                             35
operationalization. Fourth, streamlined procedures would have expedited disbursements
and helped perform financial management reporting requirements more timely.
86. Finally, ONEP then and ONEE now, did not comply with national regulations on land
acquisition and compensation to affected people. Applying the provisions set forth in the
safeguard framework documents (including documenting processes, informing affected
parties, and paying or at least provisioning funds for compensation before starting work)
and reporting on such activities remain critical areas. Efforts undertaken under the other
Bank projects (P100397 and P145529) and the land acquisition audit that ONEE will
perform on this project are positive sign in this regard.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
87. The overall borrower performance is considered Moderately Unsatisfactory, which
reflects the combined performance of the Government and the implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned
88. Understanding the institutional sector context and country’s political economy is key
to design and implement transformative projects with sustainable impacts for the sector,
and to support implementation agencies, especially in a context of sector reform. While
such elements are usually present in project appraisal documents, they may be strengthened
to better capture (i) the overall sector strategy, the maturity of institutional and regulatory
frameworks of the different policy areas included in the project design, the robustness of
associated financial strategies to support them, as well as (ii) who the main stakeholders
are, and what their interests and incentives are. This, in particular, allows to assess the risk
to project implementation and achievement if the framework in place at appraisal does not
evolve as expected.
89. Indeed, Investment Project Financings alone may not provide sufficient leverage on
the institutional and regulatory environment to ensure that sustainability conditions
envisioned at appraisal materialize during project implementation, especially when the
service delivery model depends to a large extent on upgraded sector financing mechanisms.
Some policy areas, such as sanitation in Morocco, may need clear and agreed prerequisites
for utilities to engage in, and some time before they are conducive to implementation and
can deliver results. Strong engagement in policy dialogue is needed to foster tariff,
institutional and regulatory reforms. In such contexts, a combination of infrastructure
financing and technical assistance on sector policy reforms is critical to help effectively
trigger sector-level measures and tighten the implementation of Government commitments.
90. A stakeholder assessment at preparation is also recommended to understand the
various stakeholders’ potential opposition or support to the project. Such as ONEE, utilities
may face issues with many stakeholders (local officials, contractors, decentralized
agencies, other public agencies, and final beneficiaries): their support is often taken for
granted since the project would bring water and sanitation. Although the overall
development objective may be fully relevant and attractive, projects have to deal with local
socio-economic situations; political agendas and changing counterparts, other agencies’
own priorities, constraints, and timeframes.

91. Obstacles to handling land acquisition in accordance with national regulations and
safeguards provisions are often beyond the implementing agency’s control and can
jeopardize infrastructure development programs. In many countries, land ownership is
extremely fragmented, especially in rural areas where customary rights apply, and the
widespread absence of official land titles remains an overarching obstacle for affected
people to claim and access due compensation. It is recommended that: (i) project
preparation assesses in detail the potential scope of land acquisitions; the borrower’s
capacity to manage and monitor land acquisition and compensations to PAPs; and the
bottlenecks stemming from land regulations that could affect the implementation of
safeguards instruments; (ii) when appropriate, digitized monitoring tools—customized to
needs—be implemented from the beginning to carry out related tasks and help better
review the project sequencing and implementation; and (iii) land issues be addressed at the
country portfolio level as they cut across sectors and project teams’ mandates.
92. Besides the important focus on sector context and political economy during project
design, it is crucial to ensure readiness of implementation and fiduciary arrangements to
avoid delays at kick-off. Standard bidding documents should be prepared and agreed upon
with the Bank before effectiveness, the TA procurement be initiated, and the
implementation unit be in place and fully staffed. A plan to develop project management
tools to address specific monitoring and reporting requirements may be developed as
needed, as well as a clear mapping of responsibilities between the implementing unit, the
overall structure hosting it and the proposed TA. Such as the overall context and sector
constraints, resources and tools for project management should be reviewed periodically
to allow for mitigation measures to be proposed to prevent the project from delaying its
development objectives.
93. A project-specific TA is instrumental for efficient and effective project
implementation, and for building capacity within the implementing agency if strategically
used. Even in utilities with recognized experience like ONEE, a shift in scope and mandate
requires strengthened capacities to perform and sustain progress. A TA team needs to bring
specialized skills, and has to work from the very start of project implementation. Despite
staff limitations, it should not become a substitute for internal coordination or staff. Instead,
TA is an instrument to improve project coordination and to develop new skills, methods,
and dashboard and steering tools—and translate “on the job” operational knowledge into
streamlined approaches to address business needs.
94. Recommendations regarding TA and capacity building are that: (i) project design
specify how TA activities contribute to project implementation and to the supported
entity’s increased capacities, with specific results or outputs; (ii) depending on the scope
of work and roles for coordination, M&E and reporting, having the TA in place could also
be a condition for effectiveness; (iii) for national programs supported by several donors
and projects, digitized tools (able to reconcile data collection, processing, and use between
decentralized and centralized levels) and project dashboards (able to provide disaggregated
information to address stringent reporting requirements from donors) would simplify both
project and program management and monitoring while freeing staff and TA’s time for
other purposes; (iv) to address specific recurring tasks (social mobilization, local
intermediation, land surveying in acquisition processes, etc.) even once projects are
completed and the tenure of TAs ended, appropriate procurement mechanisms could speed


                                               37
the mobilization of short-term expertise (for instance, through a roster of trained and
certified social mobilization consultants or land survey technicians) avoiding the delays
and transaction costs linked to specific project resources.
95. Identifying and highlighting issues and obstacles in project monitoring reports is
important to address them in a clear and constructive way with the Client. Achieving
successful outcomes is the common objective of the Client and the Bank. Difficulties that
may arise during implementation should be addressed as soon as possible. ISR ratings need
to objectively reflect progress on key output indicators, rather than incremental
improvements in implementation overall. As specified in the Bank’s ISR guidelines,
significant under performance on any important output indicator should trigger at least an
MU rating which can drive more determined actions by Bank, including on the country-
level issues such as safeguards which require determined and effective CMU and Regional
attention as well as sectoral support. Overall, candid statements on project ratings should
be considered an opportunity to revisit project design or foster implementation support,
and to learn from implementation, both within the Bank and between the Bank and the
Client. These are essential principles in order to maintain good quality portfolios and to
prepare the ground for other operations in the same country or in similar contexts.
96. Decentralized management models involving the local private sector are effective to
reduce O&M costs of rural water systems. Addressing the aspiration toward a HC level of
service calls for a long-term engagement, clear institutional settings and financial
strategies, and consistent messages on options available to beneficiaries. Recent
experiences in Haiti, Benin, and Senegal show that, as in pilots developed in Morocco,
innovative arrangements to incentivize operators’ performance help transitioning to higher
standards of service delivery and scale up access to water services in rural areas.

Notes:
(1) The project cost estimate at appraisal included a US$24 million co-financing from AFD.
The final project cost does not take into account AFD’s disbursements as the project was
de-linked before closing. In addition, the Borrower’s and Local Communities’ expected
contributions were not modified when the AFD loan was delinked from this operation,
even though part of their contributions were planned to cover investment or tax costs for
AFD-financed activities and areas. This complicated the estimate of the final project cost.
(2) The latest project cost estimate is based on original data received from the Borrower in
DH; the US$ amount equivalent is based on the exchange rates for the years each payment
was made. Exchange rates variations over the project duration were important.
(3) ONEE’s contribution is higher than appraised; several factors must be taken into
account:


                                             39
-   ONEE bore most costs than anticipated, in particular as it covered the households’
    contributions that could not be collected;
-   ONEE’s financial input to the project includes an estimate 85% of taxes (VAT). ONEE
    had to support the imbalance between the 7% VAT billed to Local Governments and
    the 20% VAT due on many of its investments for works, goods and services for
    consultants. Delays in recovering VAT refund has affected ONEE’s cash flow and
    financial forecasts during the project period, as reported in some ISRs and in ONEE’s
    latest financial audit. Existing data at project level do not allow to fully assess ONEE’s
    “net” contribution to the project, i.e. the taxes that were paid but not (yet) refunded;
    such uncertainty in the timing of tax refund was not taken into account at appraisal.
(4) The local communities’ actual contributions are below what was planned at appraisal;
however, these contributions only reflect local contributions collected in project areas
supported by IBRD, while the appraisal estimates also included project areas supported by
AFD. The amounts collected from communities under this project represent 17% of the
investments in Component 1, instead of the expected 20%.

   (c) Component 2: Progress toward a rural house connection delivery model

   Due to a late start of Component 2 activities, including due to the time to mature the
   financing plan and procedures to enhance the implementation of house connections in rural
   areas, the expected targets set for the project could not be reached.
   However, since 2012, the project has initiated several studies (financed under the Bank-
   funded Regional Water Supply Systems Project) and campaigns (undertaken by the TA) to
   progress toward the development of distribution networks and house connections in the
   project areas.

        From 2009 to the project closing in November 2014, social mobilization teams conducted
        a total of 59 campaigns to support the project on social matters:
            • Communication on the project to mobilize communities around the project’s options
               (standpipes/house connections) and associated constraints, and their willingness to
               financially contribute;
            • Participatory diagnostics to collect socio-economic data on the communities and their
               environment, draw ‘social maps’ including existing water sources;
            • Facilitating community decisions regarding the selection of the caretaker;




                                                    48
   • Focus groups during the beneficiary surveys to assess uptake of the project and use
      of existing, operational standpipes, changes in the communities and household
      practices regarding water uses, satisfaction of service provided, etc.

In total and in addition to the household surveys (see Annex 5):
   • 11 participatory diagnostics (one per system) were conducted, even though some in
       El Jedida subprojects were held only once the TA was in place and works were
       already well advanced in some villages;
   • 7 campaigns (in Safi/Youssoufia) focused on supporting standpipes implementation;
   • 7 focused mainly on supporting ONEE in household contributions;
   • 18 focused on supporting the selection of caretakers and/or his/her appointment by
      the CRs;
   • 6 were directly related to the ongoing studies to identify villages eligible to house
       connections, including diagnostics on sanitation;
   • 24 of the 59 campaigns (field visits) included issues with oppositions to land
       acquisition issues, sometimes to facilitate discussions in cases of reported conflict;
The TA also provided:
   • 25 quarterly progress reports;
   • Several specific reports: household surveys (4); Methodology notes for social
      mobilization; Reports on eligible villages for house connections; Reports on
      existing sanitation facilities in villages requesting house connections and proposed
      solutions for onsite and semi-collective facilities;
   • 35 reports from the mobilization teams.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

(a) Scope and Methodology.

A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was undertaken ex-ante, at appraisal and ex-post, during
the ICR preparation for the following three project components:
Component 1. Water Production and Conveyance—mainly standpipes (ex-ante: El Jadida,
Safi, Essaouira, Taza and Taounate; ex-post: El-Jadida and Safi/Youssoufia)
Component 2. Water Distribution—including household connections and small wastewater
and collection system (ex-ante: planned; ex-post: not undertaken); and
Component 3. Project Implementation Support and Institutional Strengthening (ex-ante
and ex-post: Technical Assistance provided)


The analytical frameworks used for calculating returns on investment ex-ante and ex-post
are similar to allow for necessary comparison. A list of the key parameters used in the ex-
post CBA exercise is given in Table 7 below, along with the data sources and estimation
approach (followed by details in the next sections).
In summary:
The main costs included in the CBA were:
1. Costs of feasibility studies, works, and supervision of works linked to the construction
of water production, conveyance and distribution infrastructure and wastewater
management measures for villages served by HCs.
2. Costs of O&M and replacement of the infrastructure mentioned above.
3. Costs of project management including social mobilization, hygiene education,
formation and training of management structures for village water distribution systems and
wastewater management systems.
The main benefits accounted for in the CBA were:
1. Time savings arising from reduced time spent collecting water, especially among women
and girls. They are likely to translate into increased time allocation to productive activities
and hence increased household incomes. For children, especially girls, this will enable an
increase in time spent attending school.
2. Increased household water consumption, together with improved drinking water
quality and improved hygiene practices, resulting in decreased morbidity and mortality
rates, especially among children under 5. This is expected to result in reduced medical
expenditures and improved labor productivity.
3. Increased sustainability of RWS services through the adoption of a participatory
approach, focusing on what people want and are willing to pay and prolonged support to
operators managing the water systems.

The water investments supported by the project may also have a number of other important
positive externality benefits, which have not been quantified at inception due to lack of
data and/or complexity of modeling these effects. These benefits include: (i) other
socioeconomic benefits such as psycho-physical stress while fetching water, higher school
attendance, increase household level of education etc.; and (ii) non-quantifiable positive
externalities of having access to water resulting in overall well-being of individual and
family.
Therefore, the CBA methodology used in both ex-ante and ex-post analyses gives the
lower-bound of the benefits of the water and wastewater investments made by the project.
In addition, several sensitivity tests were performed in the ex-post CBA exercise assuming
different scenarios (for e.g. investment costs increases, further decrease in accrued benefits,
benefits delayed due to project implementation delays and reduction in the household size
etc.) to assess the robustness of the returns on investment under these different
assumptions.

Scope of work. The ex-ante analysis is based on scope of work which changed somewhat
during implementation, which included:
     1. Household connections (HCs) and mitigation measures to handle resulting increase
in wastewater flows planned under Component 2 did not materialize under the project;
      2. AFD financing in the amount of US$24 million was delinked from the project,
resulting in a reduced project total cost and a revised geographic targeting scope.
The geographic targeting scope was modified as follows:
    •    Five provinces were targeted during appraisal based on a list of subprojects
         identified from the GEP, Priority Program (13 subprojects in three provinces were
         assessed as part of the project’s economic and financial analysis);
    •    AFD-funded interventions targeting Taza and Taounate were delinked from the
         IBRD operation; and
    •    IBRD-funded interventions took place in El Jadida and Safi, the latter split with the
         new Youssoufia province, and subprojects identified in Essaouira were found not
         eligible.

(b) Ex-post economic analysis
The ex-post economic analysis was carried out based on actual 11 water supply schemes
or subprojects (5 in El-Jadida and 6 in Safi/Youssoufia provinces) and for the project as a
whole. Main assumptions used were the same as proposed by the PAD (p. 58) for ex-ante
model.
Costs. Two types of costs are included in the CBA: investment costs (without VAT and
contingency) for water production and conveyance (including civil works, equipment,
pipes and special parts) and O&M/recurrent costs.
         1. Project costs: The project costs were provided in local currency (DH) by the
client, covering every year payment for each category of investment with and without taxes.
Contingency allocation in ex-post model was omitted. Component 2 investment costs were
assumed to be zero based on actual. Component 3 project implementation support costs
were also based on actuals provided by ONEE.
        2. Exchange rate variation: The ex-ante and ex-post CBA use local currency (DH)
based on actual utilization. Actual average exchange rate for DH to US$ conversion was
used in the ex-post assessment for each year to accommodate exchange rate movement.
       3. Real value adjustment: Investment costs in the ex-ante CBA are expressed in
2005 currency, while in the ex-post CBA, they are expressed in actual for each year
provided in 2015. Since the consumer price index in Morocco increased by 19 percent
between 2006 and 2015 (assuming the base year to be 2005), investment costs at
completion would seem smaller if expressed in 2005 terms.
        4. Economic Cost Factor: A conversion factor ranging between 0.83 and 0.9 (14-
20 percent for VAT and 17 percent for average import taxes) was applied to calculate
economic costs of equipment, goods, and infrastructure. This is in line with what was used
in the ex-ante CBA as well as in the ongoing Rural Water Supply Project in Morocco
implemented since 2014. 31 The project investments are already netted from taxes for use
in the ex-post analysis.

Benefits. The benefits of these investments are:
        1. Conservative assumptions were made on future water consumption: In
particular, no population growth has been taken into account and average consumption was
estimated conservatively at 10 liters/capita/day (lpcd) for standpipes (SPs), and tested
sensitivity at 20 lpcd. 32
        2. Time savings. The ex-post analysis maintained the assumptions used ex-ante.
Two types of information were used at that time: the average distance between household
and the water source and the average time spent fetching water every day, both derived
from household surveys. In the “with project” scenario, it was considered that in the case
of HCs, the time spent fetching water was zero, and in the case of SPs, the distance would
be reduced to 500 meters. This was consistent with the information collected from field
visits during ICR preparation. The time spent fetching water was valued at 80 percent of
the minimum wage for farm workers to take into account the unemployment in rural areas.
The ex-post analysis updated the ex-ante minimum wage to current value (ex-ante:
DH 50/capita/day; ex-post: DH 59/capita/day) and it tested sensitivity based on current
wage rate used in the recent project. 33
        3. Health benefits. The ex-post analysis built on the ex-ante assumptions. The
approach to value health benefits used a variant of the cost of illness approach and values
current health expenditures on waterborne diseases as well as the loss of output due to
related morbidity and premature death among the population. Morbidity and mortality rates
as well as direct health expenditures of households on waterborne diseases were estimated
on the basis of provincial statistics assembled by the Ministry of Health and estimates from
WHO. Output lost as a result of morbidity is calculated on the basis of the number of days
lost valued at the minimum agricultural wage. The value of statistical life (VSL) approach
was used for the valuation of mortality risks. Due to lack of specific studies in Morocco,
the economic value of one year of life lost was estimated on the basis of studies conducted
in the European Union, corrected by the ratio of GDP (purchasing power parity) between
Morocco and the EU. One case of mortality was considered as equivalent to 10 years of
life (and corresponding value-added) lost. Ex-post, the cost of value of life was converted
to 2015 current DH and all other necessary adjustments to populations were made.

  Ex-ante aggregated results (NPV, ERR, population):
     - The ex-ante total project summary includes all water supply systems or subprojects that were
         assessed ex-ante (see Table 8);
     - The ex-ante summary of El Jadida includes all the 8 subprojects assessed ex-ante, though
         individually they are not reported above. The ex-post includes the 5 subprojects implemented;
     - The ex-ante summary of Safi includes the 2 proposed water supply schemes or subprojects, though
         individually they are not reported above. The ex-post includes the 6 subprojects implemented in
         Safi/Youssoufia.
2
  A subproject covering rural areas around the city of Safi was identified in the GEP Priority Program, but not
included in the subprojects that were assessed ex-ante. During implementation, this large subproject was
divided into four different ones, namely Safi Sud and Safi Nord, the latter including 3 systems: Saadla, Hrara
and Moulbergui.

  The Youssoufia subproject, identified in GEP, Priority Program was incorporated through the 2011
restructuring.


 Beneficiary Population. The ERR is assessed based on the actual population for the 654
 standpipes commercially operational, benefitting 191,754. An additional 108 technically
 were completed or “functional” (as worded in the Results Framework) at project
 completion, and have already been cleared for operational use by ONEE. In all likelihood
 they would benefit an additional 45,200 people in the near future or a total of 236,955

people. The sensitivity analysis provided later in this annex discusses the implications of
considering these additional standpipes on the economic analysis.
Economic Rate of Return. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) calculated ex-ante and
ex-post is given in Table 10 above. The ERR for most of the subprojects is lower ex-post
(2-23 percent) than ex-ante (10-34 percent), due to late operationalization of SPs and the
absence of benefits associated with HCs. The ERR for the overall project is lower ex-post
(12 percent) than ex-ante (13 percent).
The ERR presented here is an underestimation due to conservative calculation of benefits,
as whole universe of benefits (all possible environmental, public health, and social) of
these investments have not been quantified, owing to lack of data and the complexity in
measuring some of such benefits.

Sensitivity Analysis.
The ex-ante CBA exercise incorporated robustness checks, which confirmed that the ERR
was fairly robust to deviations from the base case assumptions at appraisal. Ex-post, the
sensitivity was re-run based on actuals to affirm the robustness of the model. The results
confirm that the calculated ERR is still fairly robust for actual implementation as base
scenario. Ex-ante and ex-post, ERR was estimated under different scenarios - a few high
and mostly low-case scenarios – to assess whether the ERR would remain positive under
even the most conservative scenarios. As seen in Table 11 below, the ERR was positive in
all these scenarios (but lower than the 10% discount rate in some cases).

Some of these alternative scenarios tested include:
1. Investment costs: An assumption was made to increase investment costs by 10% and
20%, respectively, while all other variables remained constant. This may account for any
misjudgment call on investment at ex-ante and misreporting investment for actuals at ex-
post. Under both these scenarios the ex-post model performed well (ERR 10%/9%).
2. Benefits: An assumption was made to decrease benefits by 10% or 20%, respectively,
while other variables remained constant. This was to check for over inflation of benefits
and calibrate it to a lower level at both ex-ante and ex-post. Under both these scenarios the
ex-post model performed well (ERR 10%/9%).




                                                    57
3. Benefits time delayed: An assumption was made at ex-ante for one-year, or two-year
delay (e.g. due to construction delays) in accruing project benefits. In reality this did
materialize, but was countered as the timeline of the project also got extended (2011 versus
2014). At ex-post this assumption was used to check how delayed operationalization of
standpipes built would affect benefit to the beneficiaries. Under both these scenarios the
ex-post model performed well (ERR 10%/9%).
4. Household size: Sensitivity tests also checked household size, which was an assumption
at appraisal as the model used a number of households as targets, while indicators and
actual data were the total population. 34 Tests were run for increasing or decreasing
household size from 5.6 to 8 in rural areas in Morocco. The model showed that the project
would remain feasible for up to household size of 7, at which point it would equal the cost
of capital. The ERR and NPV would improve for households of less than 6 people. ERR at
a lower household size of 5.5 improves to 13% and decreases to 11% for a household of
6.4. 35
5. Per capita consumption. The ex-ante model used 10 lpcd as consumption for standpipes
and ONEE’s data confirmed this level was still valid. The economic assessment for the
ongoing Rural Water Supply project (see PAD 2014) used 20 lpcd consumption for
standpipes. Sensitivity of the model was also checked for this adjustment, and overall
project ERR decreased to 11% with NPV decreasing to DH 38 million.
6. Minimum agricultural wage rate. The ex-post analysis uses the wage rate used ex-ante
model (DH 5.9 per capita per day) to the current 2015 value. The CBA for the ongoing
Rural Water Supply project PAD used DH 6.7 per capita per day. Sensitivity of the model
was also checked for this adjustment. The increase in minimum wage rate has positive
effect on the ERR (goes up to 13%).
7. Beneficiary population. The model was also checked for its robustness for variations in
beneficiary population. Taking into account the standpipes technically completed or
“functional” at completion on the premises that they would likely benefit an additional
45,200 people in the near future (for a total of 236,955 project beneficiaries) gave a positive
ERR of 14 percent and NPV of DH 129 million. Furthermore, as all planned investments
under the project have been made (all assets (standpipes) have been procured and installed),
the model also checked the assumption that 100 percent of standpipes built under the
project were technically functional and in commercial use, operated by a caretaker. In this
highest bound scenario, investments would benefit 345,210 people and gave a positive
ERR of 18 percent with NPV of DH 268 million.

(c) Cost Effectiveness.
The cost effectiveness criterion set for selection of subprojects at appraisal stated (PAD,
p. 12 and p. 38) that the investment cost per capita for eligible subprojects should not

  Based on 2004 Census data

  The CBA of the ongoing Rural Water project approved in 2014 used a 5.5 household size and noted:
“Household members were estimated to drop from 5.5 to 4.0 over the 2015-2034 periods.”


                                                 58
exceed DH 2,000 (in 2005). Across subprojects and provinces, this baseline varied due to
several factors, including the kind of village settlement prevailing in the different areas
(grouped or scattered), the nature of soil, on so on. The proposed DH 2,000 limit was
converted to current 2015 value, amounting to DH 2,371 (US$247) for ex-post comparison.
The ex-post analysis showed that the per capita investment made under the project overall,
and for the different subprojects implemented under the project was above the DH 2,371
limit (see Table 12) and therefore was less cost-effective than calculated ex-ante.

Notes: as in other tables above, calculations ex-ante were based on the 13 subprojects that were assessed,
including 8 were in El Jedida province and 2 were in Safi province; the ex-post results are based on the 5
subprojects implemented in El Jedida and the 6 implemented in Safi and Youssoufia.

(d) Financial analysis.
Ex-ante, the PAD included (i) a presentation of ONEP’s overall financial situation,
including assumptions for forecasted tariff increases that would help maintain its
operational revenues and service its debts, and (ii) financial and cost recovery projections
based on planned implementation of both standpipes and house connections service
delivery, and loan repayment of both IBRD and AFD loans. Ex-post, due to the delinking
with AFD operation and lack of adequate data at subproject level, it was not possible to
perform a meaningful financial analysis.

(e) Overall efficiency.
Based on the discussion in preceding sections, a comparison overall projects ERRs is
complicated by the difference in the scope of subprojects between the ex-ante and ex-post
analyses. The project overall ex-post ERR is at 12 percent, which is only slightly less that
the overall ex-ante ERR of 13 percent, despite that fact that the project only reached 59%
of the expected number of beneficiaries. This stems largely from the fact that three
subprojects with lower ERR (11 percent in Essaouira province and 8 percent in Taza and
Taounate) were part of the ex-ante economic analysis, but eventually funded by AFD and
therefore excluded from the ex-post analysis.
Subprojects both foreseen at appraisal and later implemented generally show lower ex-post
ERR and NPV. This decrease in economic efficiency at subproject level stems from two


                                                    59
main reasons: (i) in several subprojects, all standpipes were not operational at project
completion; and (ii) due to project implementation delays, benefits accrued later than
planned at appraisal.
As mentioned before, the methodology uses the lower-bound of the benefits of the rural
water access investments. Some benefits may not have been quantified - owing to the lack
of data and complexity of modeling these effects.
To conclude, the ex-post ERR, despite a slightly lower value than ex-ante, confirms the
viability of the undertaken investments. However, the project accomplished less than
expected and the investment per capita was less cost-effective than calculated ex-ante. This
justifies an overall rating of modest for the efficiency dimension of the project.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results – Summary of selected findings


Preambule and objectives. The final Beneficiary Survey undertaken by the project’s TA,
as per contractual provisions, was performed at the end of the project’s implementation
period to assess the initial impacts of increased access to water supply through standpipes
on beneficiaries and collect their views on this service. The global objectives of the survey
was to assess the project’s achievements and its main effects and impacts at completion.
The specific objectives were to assess household satisfaction once standpipes became
operational; and to identify the difficulties encountered to develop access in the project
areas.


Methodology. The baseline survey was performed in 2010 when the first standpipes built
under the project became operational (“before the project” in the results below means
before 2010). While this initial survey covered all stakeholders (technical units,
contractors, associations, local governments, populations), the second survey (July 2012)
and the final one (November 2014) focused strictly on populations, especially households
who got access to standpipes and used them for at least one year. The number of villages
included was higher in the final survey to reflect the growing number of subprojects and
standpipes that had become operational: it reached 90 villages (51 in the initial survey) for
a total of 880 households randomly selected. The questionnaire used was the same across
the surveys and villages. In addition, the surveys reflected on focus groups held with
villagers and qualitative information on operation and management of standpipes (water
uses, tariff, users’ perceptions of service quality parameters, etc.). The 6 subprojects
covered by the survey include: Safi Sud in Safi province, Chemaia in Youssoufia province
(formerly included in Safi province) and Mazagan, Mouley Abdellah, Ouled Frej and Sidi
Abed in El Jedida province.


Background about the survey areas.
     El Jedida: the project areas are located along the Oum Rabiâa River and canal, which
enables irrigation of agricultural activities and market gardening as sources of income.
Near towns, building construction and industrial activities also provide revenues for rural
households. The area benefitted from many water projects in the past; those still in
operation provide water for free or monthly expenses around DH 30 per households.
       Safi Sud: the main economic activity is fishing in the coastal areas and livestock
farming in inland areas where soil fertility is limited. People in this area are relatively poor,
but limited water resources increase their participation to the project. The area benefitted
from standpipes from other projects in the past, still partly operational and accessible for a
tariff of DH 7 per cubic meter.
     Chemaia: populations in this area are very poor. Recent years of drought have
negatively impacted agriculture and livestock, their main source of revenues. Water
resources are scarce in this area.



                                               63
Main findings regarding access to water, the use of standpipes and beneficiaries’
perceptions about the service provided:


Before the project, 35% of the households used existing standpipes and 49% relied on
wells. After the project, 93% used standpipes for drinking purposes.
Standpipes are primarily used for domestic purposes (drinking, cooking), and use is
increasing when people cannot rely on alternative sources such as wells and boreholes (El
Jedida and Chemaia) developed for irrigation purposes, or “matfia”, traditional system to
collect and store rainwater underground (Safi Sud). Both can dry up during hot season
while the standpipe provides water in all seasons. In many areas, water from the wells is
brackish and once people have started using the standpipe, they usually consider that water
from the pipe is of better quality. In some areas, people also use the standpipe to water
livestock when the wells dry up – and have reported positive impact of the livestock health.
      El Jedida: situations differ according to the subsystems and local governments, but
on average, the uptake of standpipes built by the project (mostly in its early phase) is mixed.
Some villages don’t want to use the existing standpipes because they can rely on private
wells of good quality and want to have house connections. In some others, not all
standpipes are operational because no caretaker was appointed yet/anymore. Sometimes,
people are not using them because they prefer other water systems that pre-existed or have
developed in parallel to the project, for instance house connections implemented by a
village association or by the local government – and in such cases, at a cost lower than the
standpipe.
       Safi Sud: in the villages surveyed, all standpipes are operational (with a caretaker in
place) and are the main sources of water for drinking and cooking. They complement the
matfia that 80% of households use for other purposes until they dry up. Sometimes, they
fill the matfia with water from the standpipe with plastic hoses, but they don’t use the
matfia anymore for drinking purposes. People from other villages without standpipes come
there to fetch water.
      Chemaia: people in these villages rely on the standpipes provided by the project as
other resources (and matfia) are scarce and of poor quality. People use carts with 100 or
200-liter containers and fetch water once or twice a day. Standpipes are also used by people
from other villages.


The project reduced time to fetch water and changed storage practices.
Before the project, 4% of the respondents spent more than two hours, and 16% spent
between one and two hours a day fetching water. After the project, only 10% spent between
one and two hours a day fetching water and 90% (+10%) spent less an hour a day.
Meanwhile, more people (61% after vs 46% before) went to fetch water “upon demand”
and did not have to store anymore because it was close and convenient to go to the
standpipe, while those storing water for more than two days increased from 3% to 11% -
representing those households farther away from the water point. In total, 87% of the
respondents were satisfied with the distance/time to get water after the project (65%
before). The same proportion was satisfied with opening hours or the waiting time at the


                                              64
standpipes, considering the efforts made by many caretakers to respond to requests from
users.
The project introduced a standardized rate to access to standpipes.
The tariff for water at the standpipes, agreed between ONEE, the CR and caretakers, is in
principle capped at DH 10 per cubic meter (20 cents per cubic). The disparity of responses
across the surveys and areas show that people used to pay different tariffs, due to different
systems in place from vendors at costs above DH 100/m3 to free standpipes from other
projects or industrial complexes. On average, the selling price suggested by ONEE has
played an important role in “averaging” the access price to water: 84% of respondents
declared they paid between DH 5 and 10/m3 after the project for 47% before the project.
Those paying more than DH 10/m3 after the project dropped from 29% before to 9% after
the project while the 24% paying less than DH 5/m3 before the project were only 7% after
the project. Now implemented by most caretakers, the average rate of DH 10/m3 is
considered fair by 90% of the respondents, especially when caretakers accept to give water
for free to poorer families that may still have difficulties to pay.
The service provided under the project is considered satisfactory.
In the survey, 100% of respondents (survey) declared that water quality was good, much
higher than the 65% at the beginning of the project. Results in the focus groups were a bit
more nuanced with a 91% satisfaction on water quality thanks to the project, with lower
rates in El Jedida areas. Supply at the standpipe is considered sustainable by 80% of the
respondents, especially when compared with wells and matfia drying up during hot seasons
or droughts (61% before the project). Some areas experienced shortages – with identifiable
technical reasons according to ONEE’s technical units. Vandalism of works/standpipes,
occasionally, also resulted in service interruptions, usually for limited periods.
Water consumption at the standpipes remains low, around 10 liters per capita per day.
The survey, based on standpipes’ water meters, points out water consumption levels that
vary between 8 and 50 liters per capita per day (lpcd) in the surveyed areas, arguing that
livestock consumption could explain the higher levels noticed in Chemaia and Safi Sud.
By contrast, data provided by ONEE for a sample of standpipes funded under the project
in Safi province show a quite consistent individual consumption of 8.2 lpcd - from 2 to 13
lpcd depending on standpipes and areas. This is consistent with data in the PAD that noted
the low level of domestic consumption and other date found in the project files. The
infrastructure is designed for an average consumption of 50 lpcd for house connections –
knowing that consumption at standpipes would average 20 lpcd.




                                             65
Main conclusions and recommendations:

On the service provided under the project:
   • Using standpipes means using good water quality water: even if consumption
      remains low because it is mostly used for drinking purposed, this is a great
      achievement;
   • Standpipe development was constrained by existing alternative sources of water,
       including standpipes from previous projects; at the same time it has helped phase
       out some unsustainable local sources;
   • Locations chosen for some standpipes did not respond to the populations’
      expectations in very scattered villages;
   • Reflecting the overall socioeconomic progress in rural areas and difficult to attribute
      to the project’s effects, improvements in housing materials, settings and equipment
      support the increased demand for house connections in many areas, especially when
      villages are grouped and people can afford this level of service ;

On the implementation of the project and its social component:
   • Land acquisition issues should be resolved before works contractors start work in
      the field, to avoid delays and expropriation conflicts;
   • To better integrated target populations’ needs and requests in the project design,
      especially in terms of service level and location of access points, the technical and
      social teams should coordinate very closely; the participatory approach is deemed
      to better empower beneficiaries and local governments and get their buy-in;
   • Standpipe locations need to be proposed by the populations and then cleared by other
       stakeholders;
   • Water projects need to take into account settlement features, topography, evolving
      socioeconomic conditions, populations’ and CRs’ own agendas, etc.): projects need
      more social background analyzes and a continuous support, adjusted to very local
      situations;
   • The TA needs to be better involved in the communication with local governments
      and “crisis management” with local stakeholders;
   • The baseline situation has to be established as soon as populations agree with the
      project and before works start to better monitor results and have more time to
      measure impacts;
   • Design and indicators for a given project or program have to reflect the
      results/deliverables expected.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


Field visits were conducted during the first ICR mission (November 2014) just before
project closing, and completed by interviews with ONEE’s coordination and TA, including
the social mobilization’s coordinator. Stakeholder consultations were held during the
second ICR mission (May 2015), at decentralized level, including representatives of
standpipe caretakers, local authorities and ONEE agents at local level in the project areas,
as well as at ONEE’s Headquarters. They were complemented by interviews with the social
mobilization team leaders and additional data collection from ONEE.
The objectives were to collect feedback on the project and the context in which it was
implemented, issues faced, roles and relations of various stakeholders, results achieved and
potential lessons learned that would all further inform the Bank’s completion report. The
first consultation took place in El Jedida on May 27, 2015, the second one in Safi on May
28 (limited to a meeting with ONEE’s representatives). The third consultation took place
at ONEE’s Headquarters in Rabat on June 1st, 2015.


The key messages that emerged of these consultations include: the satisfaction of the
people benefitting from standpipes but the frustration of years of delays and high
expectations for house connections; constrained daily implementation at local level, in a
context of tight human and financial resources and heavy internal procedures from the
project and program centralized supervision; the overarching issue of oppositions to land
acquisition; difficulties to deal with an ambitious national program and multiple projects’
monitoring, safeguards and fiduciary procedures and requirements.


Main topics of discussion:

The caretakers and standpipes: a community management
Caretakers from El Jedida, who have held these positions for several years (first systems
that became operational), related similar stories about their role and relations with
communities. They accepted the assignment and managed the standpipes in full trust, for
the good of the communities. They live near the standpipe, know all the families around.
They usually don’t impose strict opening hours so that people can come and fetch water as
they need, and can unlock it and accommodate people even at night. They also know which
families are really poor and cannot afford to pay the yet modicum amount they should to
fill their buckets or drums with water. In such cases, they would give them water for free
and pay from their own pockets. Other families, on the contrary, would pay more than their
due, and sometimes in advance.
All know that the caretaker cannot default on paying his bill, which would affect everybody
should the standpipe be cut off. ONEE agents confirmed that bills were paid regularly by
caretakers. They only reported limited claims, usually related to the fixed fee added to the
amount of water billed and that caretakers sometimes did not understand. The case of an
important water shortage that affected on of the systems a couple of years ago demonstrated
caretakers’ dedication to their job: technical agents were under pressure to fix it because


                                            67
they got many calls from the caretakers until the system and related standpipes could be
operational again.
Such a case remained an exception, and on average, continuity of water supply is greatly
appreciated. Caretakers also mentioned the positive changes for people, who progressively
let their private wells to turn to the standpipe and use it for all domestic purposes – and in
areas with wells only far from the village, drastically reduced time spent fetching water,
even if they still have to walk to one of the standpipes built under the project. Quality of
water also reduced diseases – in some places, better health of donkeys or horses was also
noticed and this was attributed to water from the standpipe.
Most of the caretakers don’t have another full time job or regular, in any other job revenues.
Earnings from selling water at the standpipe depend on the season (consumption increases
in summer) and on the number of families using the standpipe – which varied between 25
and 40 in the cases mentioned in the consultation, a figure converging with findings from
field visits and translating into a ratio varying from 150 to 300 people per standpipe. Small
maintenance costs appear to be limited – they have to change the taps on average once a
year and repaint the stand post every now and then. For other maintenance issues such as
dysfunctional meter (which happened when ONEE encountered problems with the
systems’ reservoirs upstream), they call ONEE and technicians will come and fix the
problems. For caretakers, they consider this job as a contribution to the community, which
could not be enough to maintain a living without family and community support. That is a
reason why, in some cases, it may have taken some time to select the person “qualified”
for the job, who would at the same time be trusted by the population and accept the
responsibilities and limited associated income.


From standpipes to house connections: waiting for the next stage
Beside the positive experience in villages with standpipes already operational for some
years, consultations highlighted underlying issues that affected stakeholders, project
implementation and intended beneficiaries. The main one is the long-lasting expectation
for a higher level of service, namely house connections.
Representatives from local governments insisted that the country situation had evolved
over the last ten years, especially since the new Constitution in 2011 that guarantees
people’s rights, including the right to a “modern” (sic) level of service. Standpipe delivery
service does not alleviate people’s burden of fetching water and is not sufficient to really
support local development. House connections should not be considered a luxurious asset,
but a solution to health problems.
ONEE’s representatives reminded the various prerequisites needed to consider developing
a village distribution systems and house connections, including financial contributions
from both end users and the Local Government. The overall strategy in rural areas was
clearly to move forward house connections, but also to ensure equity, i.e. that all villages
in the country should be able to access water supply. That is why this project, as others
supporting ONEE implementing its mandate throughout the country started with building
the conveyance systems needed to supply water to villages and offered the standpipes as
the first level of improvement, while house connections would follow.



                                             68
A common view from local stakeholders was that transition should have been handled with
more care, as it had generated a lot of expectations first, then frustrations with villagers and
local governments. Some claimed they were not fully involved in initial discussions on the
level of service to be implemented and had had limited contacts with social mobilization
teams in the early stages. In some areas, participatory diagnostics were clear on the
population’s call for house connections rather than standpipes. People were asked to pay
their contribution even before they could see effective progress in works, and were
discouraged to pay once they received standpipes and were told they would have to wait
more time and contribute more for house connections.
The role of social mobilization teams, in this regard, was questioned. Local stakeholders
noted they all in all did not spend much time with each project/communities. Local agents
noted that sometimes, there was confusion between people visiting the villages to collect
contributions and social mobilization teams. In hindsight, that messages to the population
and local governments regarding the financing plan and phasing of works did not fully get
through, and delays in implementing works did not help manage expectations in the field.
This contributed to delays in getting the Agreements with local governments signed and
important backlogs in household contributions for the “access” part (DH 500 per
household), not to mention the contributions for house connections (another DH 3,000
since 2009).
On ONEE side, in addition to low consumption level at standpipes, this was a major issue
that further delayed consideration for distribution networks. While the expectations
regarding house connections was fully legitimate, and also in line with ONEE’s
competence and experience in water systems’ operations, the issue of financing was critical
and initial conditions, when the project started, were not fully in place. They are now much
clearer, due to all experience gathered, including through the difficulties in this particular
project. Technical, financial but also environmental criteria have been clarified and
summarized in the House Connections Guidebook, which is now a key instrument to
communicate with local stakeholders. The latter have to understand that ONEE is facing a
major challenge to serve water to more than 40,000 villages and deal with over 1,200 local
governments that all want house connections. Equal access to water supply at country level
goes with difficult choices at local level and the need for a pragmatic and sustainable
approach. That is ONEE’s mandate and proud to work towards achieving this vision and
contribute to social development.

Decentralized management faced with capacity constraints
Another issue related to the project implementation was ONEE local units’ capacity to deal
with internal procedures and “negotiations” with local counterparts, in a context of
stretched human resources. Technicians provided by the Technical Assistance under the
project was welcome to support project-related issues. However, it could not replace
additional staff that would have been needed to better perform. For instance some units
were short in staff tasked to distribute and collect bills; sometimes even unit managers had
to help in this matter. They could not afford to collect financial contributions from
prospective project beneficiaries in addition.




                                              69
Similarly, they were in direct relations with local governments and project areas’
beneficiaries, but not always able to take immediate action due to lengthy procedures and
back and forth exchanges with Headquarters and the project coordination. In the
discussions around distribution networks and house connections, some claimed that these
internal delays were as much a problem as the financial issue. The procedure established
to select eligible villages, for instance, was criticized for its delays and complexity. In some
places, studies started more than five years ago.
Managing land acquisition was another time-consuming issue, for which local units were
not rightly skilled; it is only late in the project some could get support from land survey
technicians for a task that should have been done even before works started – procurement
for works was processed centrally and local units had to engage with local governments,
owners or people living on affected land and firms to solve potential conflicts only once
they appeared. The process of compensations was beyond their direct leverage and they
did not have the monitoring tools and trained staff to ensure proper monitoring.

ONEE as implementing agency and as borrower
Consultations with ONEE’s central units pointed out bottlenecks in project implementation
that were already developed in its Completion Report (see Annex 7), in particular
procurement and difficulties with contractors; relations with other public agencies to get
needed authorizations to work on the public domain – especially administrations in charge
of Public Works, Transportation and Electricity (ONEE water branch); and the overarching
issue of land acquisition and compensations.
This one particularly affected implementation and the project results. While ONEE
acknowledged some responsibilities, it also stressed (i) the complex regulatory framework
and lengthy procedures related to compensations that were way beyond its control; (ii) the
pressure to move forward in works to comply with the national program’s objectives and
political expectations at highest level to increase access to water supply; (iii) the lack of
clear requirements from the Bank in the early stages of the project regarding land
acquisition and payment of compensations, followed by more guidance at mid-term to at
least provision compensation funds before starting works, but too limited support to
implement adequate mitigation measures. The ongoing Rural Water Supply Project has
benefited from this experience, as a Land Acquisition Report was prepared and approved
by the Bank. Strict monitoring of its implementation will also help overcome some of the
problems faced during this operation.
Another important lesson to reduce delays pertains to project planning and sequencing:
social mobilization should come first and without delay, planning should better involve
various units to ensure all needed tasks are thought through in advance (requesting
authorizations, surveying land, etc.) and procurement of works is well prepared and
contracted firms well equipped to deliver. Discussions also stressed that part of
implementation success also relied on local government partners (parts of the oppositions
to land acquisition actually involved plots under CRs’ responsibility) and on a trustful
relation with populations. ONEE made progress to provide more articulate messages and
information to them, but this took time and resources that lacked in the last years, both
centrally and at local level.


                                              70
More broadly, consultations touched upon ONEE’s internal structure and multiple
mandates country-wide, including the rural water program to generalize access to water
supply. While the various divisions cover all needed functions corporate-wide, challenges
remain huge to coordinate a specific program, especially when it is more contributing to
global operational deficit than generating revenues in an organization deemed to be profit-
making. The program’s coordinating unit may not have sufficient leverage internally to get
the support needed and relies much on the various projects’ technical assistance teams,
when provided.
Another issue discussed during consultations related to the monitoring requirements for
this and other projects supporting the rural water program, which some participants
considered time-consuming and sometimes cumbersome. While the Bank was probably the
most involved in its projects’ supervision, its requirements were also more constraining
than those from other external donors. In addition, donors needed information at detailed,
subproject level, which was not easy to provide due to the decentralized implementation of
projects at business unit levels. Some participants also noted that loan restructurings were
mostly focused on reallocations of proceeds, which may not lead to significant changes in
the projects’ approaches.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


ONEE’s Completion Report was submitted to the Bank in February 2015. The document
was coordinated by the Directorate (Direction de la Généralisation de l’Eau Potable, DEP)
in charge of the national rural water program implementation and overall coordination of
projects contributing to this project (Division of Development and Coordination), with
inputs from the whole TA Team.
The Report includes a Chapter (i) presenting the project, contextual background, internal
consistency, geographical scope and financing, as well as the various changes introduced
during implementation; and a Chapter (ii) on project implementation. This chapter (over
50 pages) reports in detail activities procured and implemented, physical outputs, social
mobilization campaigns, issues with operationalization of works and related delays, as well
as costs and committed amounts and other information relevant to the project.
This Annex presents a summary of ONEE’s Completion Report concluding sections,
including (i) a recap of challenges faced during implementation; and (ii) lessons learned
and recommendations for future operations.


Oppositions to land acquisition; working with Local Governments and other public
entities; procurement and issues with contractors:
     • Uneven implementation readiness and delays in preparing Standard Bidding
        Document templates for works, goods and consultant services acceptable to the
        Bank, drafting clear TORs to hire the TA as soon as possible and enough resources
        to implement its objectives;
     • Oppositions to land acquisition (or temporary occupation) by populations living on
        plots that ONEE/technical studies planned to acquire for production and
        conveyance pipes and facilities (works contractors cannot intervene, works are
        stopped 36);
     • Oppositions from landowners who accepted to sell their plot but won’t accept any
        works to be started as long as they don’t get their due compensation, or at least any
        information on the process (amount, timeline); in some cases, such oppositions take
        place on plots for which the Local Government is responsible 37 for paying
        compensations, but they may take time to consider the issues even if it can be
        detrimental to the project;




36
   The ‘SPA’ Pumping Station in Ouled Frej (El Jadida) is a case in point. An opposition pending since
2008 resulted in full stop of the then-ongoing works. The distribution system including 28 SPs downstream
of the station could not be completed. The case was finally solved in 2014, prompting the contractor to
repair the damaged infrastructure built before 2008.
37
   As per agreements signed with ONEE, the CRs have to provide ONEE with land needed to install the
access points and distribution networks.


                                                   72
   • Difficulties to secure authorizations on time to work on, or cross the public domain
      (roads, water channels, railroads, etc.) from other public entities – Public Works
      provincial offices, Water Basin agencies, National Railroad office, etc.); visa
      procedures are long and bureaucratic: sometimes works contractors have to stop
      working for weeks or months;
   • Similarly, delays in securing key infrastructure interconnections with power lines,
       even within the sister company ONEE Electricity branch;
   • Reluctance of some larger urban centers to authorize works on surrounding access
      roads; same for industrial complexes;
   • Unexpected difficulties in excavating works due to more rocky soils than anticipated;
   • Contracted firms unable to deliver in due time when they are awarded several
      contracts at the same time and have to split resources between various contracts and
      construction sites;
   • Issues of procurement sequencing and lot packaging: completion of civil works may
       depend on progress in other contracts (e.g. lying of pipes) or delayed/ongoing
       procurement processes;
   • ONEE’s delayed payments to contractors: may impact their sometimes weak
      financial capacities (low cash flow, increased bank fees, etc.);
   • After completion of civil works, standpipes must be technically tested and be cleared
      for operationalization in the best possible delays, otherwise it may (i) generate
      maintenance issues; (ii) raise anger from surrounding populations and lead to acts
      of vandalism; (iii) in all cases, this is a risk of additional cost for the contractors;
   • Delays in operationalization of standpipes may stem from (i) ‘technical’ reasons:
      delay or problem with interconnection of the supplying system to electricity,
      availability of lab staff to perform the water quality tests, available stock in water
      meters, etc.; and from (ii) ‘social’ reasons: time needed for a consensual decision
      to select caretakers in the community, delays in securing his/her appointment letter
      from the Local Government and signature of his/her subscription policy with
      ONEE.

Main mitigation measures implemented
   • Stronger involvement of TA through (i) more time (technicians) allocated to
       supervision of works, possibly to facilitate discussions with the populations; (ii)
       more interventions from the SMTs in “conflict management” to facilitate difficult
       discussions between ONEE and the populations (due to temporary occupation of
       land, expropriation or delayed payment of compensations); and (iii) more time
       dedicated to involve the various representatives of local governments and better
       work with them;
   • TA’s additional support through the recruitment of an specialist in land acquisition
      procedure to provide expertise and support to topographical and land related tasks



                                             73
      in the different regional units (expert based at HQ within the Division in charge of
      Sanitation);
   • Technical meetings and high level discussions proposed by ONEE water branch to
      other public entities to suggest streamline procedures for infrastructure works on
      the public domain;
   • Improved procurement planning and contract management to anticipate
       authorizations needed and prepare documentation and paperwork for visa with
       sufficient time before the expected works (support from TA technicians at
       provincial level);
   • Increased consultations between ONEE electricity and water branches to discuss
       methods and solutions to reduce delays and simplify procedures to connect electric
       lines and water systems soon after the completion of civil works.

Notes on project achievements:
   • Too many standpipes could not be operationalized (after being built and declared
      functional) – for technical reasons mentioned above, and limitations in a real
      convergence between the technical and the “social” approaches: (i) existence of
      alternative water resources and strong demand for house connections can be real
      issues to get the population’s buy-in; (ii) in scattered areas with very low densities,
      it is difficult to attract standpipe caretakers because revenues (following
      consumptions) are too low; (iii) delays between the caretaker selection and his/her
      taking over may be very long due to procedures with both ONEE and the local
      government, and a factor discouraging candidate caretakers;
   • It was not possible to start works for distribution networks and implement the house
        connection pilot project;
   • The TA scope of work was very broad and team members intervened in 3 different
      provinces for IBRD areas (and another for AFD), which complicated supervision
      of works and other activities, and affected the overall quality of project
      coordination, monitoring and reporting;
   • Despite the amendments to its initial contract, the TA did not involve engineers who
      could have played a motor role if directly based at local level to strengthen ONEE’s
      local units and direct supervision of activities in the different subprojects;
   • 5 project indicators could not be monitored (lack of financial data at subproject level
       for instance) or became obsolete (indicators related to water users associations); 6
       indicators did not achieve the expected targets, despite the loan extension;
   • At completion, signed contracts represented 95% of amounts allocated to the works
      and TA disbursing categories, respectively; remaining funds will be returned to
      IBRD.

Lessons and Recommendations

The present project was a pioneer in the implementation of the national rural water project.
Some lessons learned in this project have already be implemented in other operations,
including the two other IBRD projects supporting the same program; some may need more
time to become actionable but are shared here to be further considered in suitable contexts:
   • All studies should be completed before effectiveness and build on both the technical
      and “social” components (people’s actual practices and constraints to get water,
      preferences grounded in good information of available options and capacity to pay
      for the such options) to suggest standpipe locations; bidding documents for works
      should also be ready or well advanced to really start the project at effectiveness;
   • Project areas should be selected considering supervision costs and coordination
       constraints when sites are dispersed and implementation requires strong
       engagement with local counterparts;
   • Project/Technical assistance teams would benefit from additional expertise such as
       engineers to be directly responsible for local coordination and works supervision at
       subproject level; and specific expertise to address specific needs, for instance in
       land surveying tasks and legal expertise for land and safeguards issues;
   • Works should not start before temporary uses of land or expropriations be clearly
      identified and addressed in compliance with national regulations and Bank
      procedures; funds for compensations must be at least secured in case actual
      payments to affected people are delayed;
   • Establish framework agreements with other public agencies and entities from which
      authorizations to work on the public domain will be sought, to ensure streamlined,
      pragmatic procedures and easier planning and updating during implementation;
      consultations even before implementation to discuss the big picture, project areas
      and works options may help screen potential problem spots;
   • Social mobilization teams should work closely with decentralized units and get more
      resources to ensure a continuous, long term engagement with beneficiary
      populations and local governments.

Summary of the comments on the draft ICR

As set of comments on the draft ICR was received from ONEE on September 30, 2015.
Below is a summary of the main comments:
   - In ONEE’s opinion, the project was satisfactory. Indeed, almost all planned water
     systems were implemented by project closing date, and according to ONEE, putting
     all SPs in operation will only depend on actions and procedures that are sometimes
     time-consuming but always succeed eventually.
   - With regards to Component 2, ONEE wished to nuance some of the ICR’s
     assessments. Even though the entire scope of grey water management activities may
     not have been carried out as planned, the Technical Assistance did conduct through
     its social mobilization activities information awareness campaigns in beneficiary
     villages. Preparatory studies for the implementation of HCs have been carried out
     and ONEE was ready to launch the bidding procedures. However the Bank clarified
     late during project implementation that these HCs would not be eligible for pre-
     financing as they would not be completed before project closing date.
   - Also, in view of certain divergences with the ICR conclusions on the effectiveness of
     social mobilization activities and on the assessment of project outcomes, ONEE
     recommends the organization of a workshop to further discuss these points with the
     Bank. It will also be useful to further discuss the cases of delayed or lengthy
     procurement processes, and to identify jointly recommendations for future
     operations.
   - Finally, ONEE provided some clarifications on the timing of submission of past
     financial audits.
The Bank has agreed to the organization of a post-ICR discussion workshop, to be held at
ONEE end-2015 and inform the design and management of other projects in the rural
water sector.
