modest,\n            Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: understanding the institutional sector\n            context and country\u2019s political economy is key to design and\n            implement transformative projects with sustainable impacts\n            for the sector, and to support implementation agencies,\n            especially in a context of sector reform. Obstacles to\n            handling land acquisition in accordance with national\n            regulations and safeguards provisions are often beyond the\n            implementing agency\u2019s control and can jeopardize\n            infrastructure development programs. Besides the important\n            focus on sector context and political economy during project\n            design, it is crucial to ensure readiness of implementation\n            and fiduciary arrangements to avoid delays at kick-off. A\n            project-specific technical assistance (TA) is instrumental\n            for efficient and effective project implementation, and for\n            building capacity within the implementing agency if\n            strategically used. Identifying and highlighting issues and\n            obstacles in project monitoring reports are important to\n            address them in a clear and constructive way with the\n            client. Decentralized management models involving the local\n            private sector are effective to reduce operation and\n            maintenance (O and M) costs of rural water systems."}, "docdt": "2015-09-27T00:03:03Z"}
