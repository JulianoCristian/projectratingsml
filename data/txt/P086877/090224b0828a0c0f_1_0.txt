Implementation Status and Key Decisions

Major progress has been achieved under component A: all water supply systems but two are operational; above 60% of standpipes (SPs) built under the
Project have a caretaker in place and supply water to local populations. Nevertheless, a few remaining implementation issues still affected, as of mid-
November, the technical ability of many SPs to provide services. Based on existing surveys carried out during the project, the population that actually
accessed to SPs expressed a strong satisfaction and got clear benefits in terms of time saved and health impact; however, due to the lagging number of
SPs still to become operational, the population effectively benefitting from SPs is more limited than expected;
In total, the beneficiary population under the project in the provinces targeted by the IBRD loan reaches, as of November 15, 244,000 people out of an
objective of 323,600; or an achievement rate of 75% based on most recent assessments and data collected. Additional SPs are expected to become
operational in the last two weeks of Project implementation.

Under Component B, namely the development of water distribution systems through house connections, detailed design studies have been delivered for
11 villages where the environmental and social screening performed by the Technical Assistance determined it was a priority to distribute water through
house connections. Over 700 households have signed their commitment form for a house connection. Most of them requested an advance under the pre-
financing mechanism. However, it was recently clarified that the pre-financing mechanism will not be allowed to pre-finance any house connection under
the project, because of the requirement to link these disbursements to the actual implementation of the corresponding house connections, which will not
be built before the closing date. The pilots planned under Component B have therefore not been implemented.
  Over the 10-year implementation period, ONEE has gone through impressive achievements in increasing production, conveyance and distribution
  capacities to reach rural areas in targeted provinces and in strengthening its own capacities and operational knowledge on a range of management
  models for village standposts and household connections. The Project will leave a strong legacy to build on as ONEE carries on its efforts towards the
  generalization of access to rural water supply services and the development of service delivery through house connections, including with continued
  Bank financial support.
