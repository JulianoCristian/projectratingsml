"abstracts": {"cdata!": "This report is the Framework\n            Environmental Management and Social (CGES) Project Emergency\n            Urban Infrastructure (PUIUR). This program aims to assist\n            the Ivorian government to upgrade access and quality of\n            infrastructure and urban services in two (2) major cities,\n            namely Abidjan and Bouake. Achieving this goal will support\n            the efforts of the government of Cote d'Ivoire to\n            improve in a visible and tangible the lives of its citizens,\n            to maintain political and social stability and economic\n            recovery of the country. The grant will help finance the\n            costs associated with the following activities: (i) urban\n            water supply; (ii) urban sanitation (sewerage); (iii) solid\n            waste management; (iv) urban roads rehabilitation; and (v)\n            municipal contracts. The project is also intended, at the\n            same time, to carry out urban and financial audits of 10\n            cities in the country in order to jumpstart management\n            improvement and needs assessment in these cities. The\n            operations of PUIUR activities consist of rehabilitation of\n            infrastructure (construction and rehabilitation works of\n            art, books evacuation of solid waste and liquid waste,\n            water, roads, sanitation, roads school urban) in both cities\n            (Abidjan and Bouake). The operations and techniques of work\n            on these sites are well known so as to minimize their impact\n            on individuals and their property. However, negative impacts\n            could be caused by the activities of PUIUR on these three\n            levels: loss of land, acquisition of land for carrying out\n            the arrangements of the crossroads and bridges, installation\n            of a temporary site during the work and eventual\n            resettlement of displaced persons; loss of assets\n            (infrastructure, equipment, means of production), demolition\n            of homes, closing workshops, crops, schools and so on; loss\n            of resources, loss of income for those engaged in informal\n            employment etc."}, "docdt": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
