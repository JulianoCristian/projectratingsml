                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase access to and improve the quality of urban infrastructure and services in the country#s two largest cities,
                         Abidjan and Bouak#. The achievement of this objective would support GoCI#s efforts to demonstrate visible and tangible improvements in the lives of its citizens, a
                         critical step for sustaining social and political stability and economic recovery in the country.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         is also satisfactory, with a disbursement rate that went from 96.8% to 100% for the initial grant and from 84.74% to 94.18% for the additional financing grant.

                         The project achievement has contributed to improving access and quality of urban services in the cities of Abidjan, Bouaké, Agboville Man and some secondary centers within the
                         country (Mayo and Tinhou). The interim results of the project can be summarized as follows:
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Increase of drinking water production for more than 53,000 m3/day in Abidjan, Korogho and Bouaké, extension of the water distribution network and connecting suburban areas
                         under-equipped and low-income households to the drinking water network. Due to the project, about: (i) 2.55 million additional people have access to improved drinking water service
                         provision in the targeted cities; (ii) 0.48 million additional people have access to improved sanitation; (iii) 430,000 people have access to drivable roads in all seasons in selected
                         cities; the risk of flooding is reduced in Abidjan with the construction of approximately 4.7 kilometers of drainage of rainwater and treatment of the Guru basin and; (iv) about 4.5
                         million people of the District of Abidjan have regular solid waste collection service.
                         Overall project components are executed and completed except the sanitation component. The activities foreseen in the initial financing to eliminate various illegal dumping sites of
                         solid waste in Abidjan in order to safeguard public health and environment were successfully completed.
                         With regard to the additional financing, all activities are successfully completed except for the consolidation centers (Centres de groupage) which were planned to be the first step to
                         receive garbage from pre-collectors. The mission noted the unsuccessful efforts made by the Ivorian Government to find appropriate sites that meet environmental, social and safety
                         criteria for the development of consolidation centers. Four sites were initially identified of 25 targeted, but they were not equipped for the following reasons: (i) the one located in Port
                         Bouet in the airport area and has been rejected because it may eventually formed a hazard to aviation with the presence of birds; (ii) the site of the Williams ville is dedicated by the
                         Government for the construction of the bus station in Abidjan and; (iv) the population of Abobo Baule has not agreed to release the site identified in their neighborhood. Only the
                         fourth site in Bingerville could meet the criteria but was abandoned in view because of the short time remaining before the end of the project. With the above difficulties, the mission
                         and the Ivorian Government have decided to use the funding for the consolidation centers for more roads and water. The GoCI will continue to explore other possibilities to find other
                         sites that could be equipped to and be financed from its own resources once the administrative problems are resolved.
