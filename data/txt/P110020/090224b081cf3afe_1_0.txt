                         (i) Increase of drinking water production for more than 53,000 m3/day in Abidjan, Korogho and Bouaké, extension of the water distribution network and connecting suburban areas
                         under-equipped and low-income households to the drinking water network. Thanks to the project about 1.25 million additional people have access to improved drinking water service
                         provision in the targeted cities; (ii) thanks to the rehabilitation of more than 100 kilometers of roads and the construction of more than 13 kilometers of roads in Abidjan, about 380,000
                         people have access to drivable roads in all seasons; (iii) about 483,000 additional people have access to an improved sanitation system with the rehabilitation of the existing sewage
                         network and the construction of about 38 kilometers of new sewage networks; the risk of flooding is reduced in Abidjan thanks to the construction of approximately 4.7 kilometers of
                         drainage of rainwater and treatment of the Guru basin and; (iv) about 4.5 million people of the District of Abidjan have regular solid waste collection service.
