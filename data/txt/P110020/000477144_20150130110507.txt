F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to increase access to and improve the
quality of urban infrastructure and services in the country's two largest cities, Abidjan and

                                                 vii
Bouaké. The achievement of this objective would support the Government of Côte
d’Ivoire's (GoCI) efforts to demonstrate visible and tangible improvements in the lives of
its citizens, a critical step for sustaining social and political stability and economic recovery
in the country.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Project Development Objective was changed to capture the expanded project scope to
include additional cities so as to support the general development of the country. The
revised PDO was to increase access and improve the quality of urban infrastructure
facilities and services in Abidjan, Bouaké, and other selected cities. The achievement of
this objective would support the GoCI's efforts to demonstrate concrete improvements in
the lives of its citizens, a critical step for sustaining social and political stability in the
country.

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.       Côte d’Ivoire is one of the largest economies in West Africa, previously a beacon of high
economic per capita growth and political stability. At appraisal in 2008, however, the country was
just beginning to recover from almost two decades of political-military crisis that had destabilized
the country’s economic model. A coup in December 1999, triggered by a rebellion led by the Forces
Nouvelles (FN), was brought about by a range of socio-economic issues around civil and economic
rights, land-ownership, national governance, and access to power, and led to a period of open
hostilities between September 2002 and January 2003. A breakthrough was achieved with the signing
of the Ouagadougou Peace Accord of March 4, 2007. The Accord resulted from direct dialogue
between the two main protagonists, President Laurent Gbagbo, and the leader of the rebel forces,
Guillaume Soro. The accord led to the formation of another transitional Government with a first time
power-sharing arrangement between President Gbagbo and Guillaume Soro as Prime Minister.

2.     In August 2007, following progress on the peace process after Ouagadougou, the Bank began
to support Côte d'Ivoire with an emergency Post-Conflict Assistance Project (PCAP) of US$120
million. Subsequently, on April 1, 2008, the Board approved a new Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
FY08-09. The ISN revolved around three pillars: (i) Support stabilization and peace-building; (ii)
Assist war-affected populations through provision of basic services; and (iii) Further economic
recovery and governance reform.

3.     One consequence of the crisis had been a mass exodus of people, mostly out of rural areas
in the north of the country to urban centers in the south, in search of stability and economic
opportunity. As a result, urban poverty and overcrowding increased dramatically, especially in
Abidjan and Bouaké which were home to nearly half of the urban population of about 20 million at
the time of appraisal. This large influx of refugees strained basic municipal services (water,
sewerage, garbage collection, public transport) to the breaking point, exacerbated by municipal
services infrastructure in disrepair due to the lack of maintenance and investments during the crisis.
4.      Recovery Strategy. In support of the three pillars of the ISN, the Bank reactivated the existing
portfolio of US$104 million in education, rural development and transport. In addition, the Bank
planned to provide US$428 million to Côte d'Ivoire in FY08 comprising (i) an Economic Governance
and Recovery Grant (EGRG, US$308 million), (ii) an HIV-AIDS project of US$20 million, (iii) a
Governance and Institutions Technical Assistance (TA) grant of US$13 million, and (iv) the
Emergency Urban Infrastructure Project of US$94 million.

5.      The Emergency Urban Infrastructure Project (PUIUR) would address the large scale
infrastructure needs of Abidjan while at the same time improve the conditions in other secondary
cities across the country, including Bouaké. The country was still divided, with the North controlled
by the rebels and the South by the Government in Abidjan. The inclusion of Bouaké as capital of
the North was therefore important both for peace-building and relieving the growing socio-political
pressures on the urban center. In addition, the introduction of municipal contracts in ten urban
centers would mitigate the risk of over-centralization of resources on the largest cities and help
build up capacities across the urban fabric of the country.

6.     Eligibility for processing under OP/BP 8.00. The project was a critical first step in the
Bank's carefully sequenced emergency response in support of the post-conflict recovery. It was

                                                   1
consistent with the ISN, which provided for application of the emergency response policy for all new
Côte d'Ivoire operations in support of the interim recovery period of FY08-09. Under OP/BP 8.00 -
Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies, emergency support can be provided in response to a
request by the Government for urgent assistance in response to an event that has caused, or is likely
to cause, a major adverse economic and social impact.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase access to, and improve the quality
of, urban infrastructure and services in the country’s two largest cities, Abidjan and Bouaké. The
achievement of this objective would support GoCI’s efforts to demonstrate visible and tangible
improvements in the lives of its citizens, a critical step for sustaining social and political stability and
economic recovery in the country.

8.      Key Indicators. The achievement of the PDO would be measured by the following outcome
and intermediate results indicators:

        Outcome indicators: (i) number of additional people getting access to potable water; and (ii)
        number of people benefitting from improved sanitary conditions in targeted areas.

        Intermediate results indicators, by Component:

        Component I: Water Supply: (i) number of constructed service connections and standposts;

        Component II: Urban Sanitation: (i) number of additional people connected to the interceptor;
        (ii) number of rehabilitated pumping stations; and (iii) reduced waste water flow being
        discharged to the Abidjan lagoon;

        Component III: Solid Waste Management: (i) 50% of the quantity of solid waste produced in
        Abidjan is collected and dumped to the Akouedo disposal site in 2008; and, (ii) the percentage
        increase respectively in 2009, 2010, and 2011 to 60%, 65%, and 70%;

        Component IV: Urban Roads Rehabilitated: (i) number of kilometers of roads rehabilitated;
        and

        Component V: Municipal Contracts: (i) number of completed audits and municipal contracts.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and Justification

9.      The Project Development Objective was changed to capture the expansion in the project
scope, benefitting other selected cities and supporting general development across the country. The
revised PDO was to increase access to, and improve the quality of, urban infrastructure facilities and
services in Abidjan, Bouaké, and other secondary cities. The achievement of this objective would
support the GoCI’s efforts to demonstrate concrete improvements in the lives of its citizens, a
critical step for sustaining social and political stability in the country.

10.    Revised Key Indicators. The achievement of the revised PDO would be measured by the
following revised outcome and intermediate results indicators:

        Outcome Indicators: (i) number of people in urban areas provided with access to “Improved
        Water Sources” under the project; (ii) average number of hours of water supply services per

                                                     2
       day in utilities targeted by the project; (iii) number of people in urban areas provided with
       access to “Improved Sanitation” under the project; (iv) number of people in urban areas
       provided with access to all-season-roads within a 500-meter range under the project; (v)
       number of people in urban areas provided with access to regular solid waste collection under
       the project; and (vi) number of direct project beneficiaries, and the percentage of whom are
       female.

       Intermediate Results Indicators by Component:

       Component I: Urban Water Supply: (i) number of improved community water points
       constructed or rehabilitated under the project; (ii) number of new piped household water
       connections that are resulting from the project intervention; and, (iii) volume of water
       production (m3/day).

       Component II: Urban Sanitation (Sewerage): (i) number of new sewer connections
       constructed under the project; (ii) number of rehabilitated pumping stations; (iii) volume of
       reduced waste water flow being discharged into the lagoon; (iv) number of people trained to
       improve hygiene behavior or sanitation practices under the project; (v) volume of collected
       wastewater that is treated at primary level before being discharged to the sea (m3/day); (vi)
       water quality monitoring system established and functioning (Yes/No); (vii) volume dredged
       to clean lagoon (m3); and (viii) Km of water drainage constructed.

       Component III: Solid Waste Management: (i) percentage of waste collected and dumped to
       the disposal site compared to total waste produced; (ii) number of waste grouping/transfer
       stations built; and, (iii) number of waste collectors with permanent jobs in the sector.

       Component IV: Urban Roads Rehabilitated: (i) kilometers of urban roads rehabilitated; and
       (ii) kilometers of water drainage constructed.

       Component V: Municipal Contracts: (i) number of municipal audits and municipal contracts
       prepared.

11.      Rationale for revising the PDO - Additional Financing. The GoCI requested an Additional
Financing (AF) to scale up basic urban services in some of the country's poorest communities. The
Government was facing difficulties financing priorities identified in the 2009 Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), including basic urban services. These difficulties were due in part to the
impact of the global recession on economic recovery and because of the increased crisis-recovery
spending following turmoil around the postponement of elections. The fiscal situation had
deteriorated in 2010 causing revenue shortfalls further aggravated by the electricity crisis which
required increasing subsidies. Moreover, the country remained effectively split in two with services
deteriorating particularly in the North (Bouaké) and close to collapsing. The AF included US$15
million from the Crisis Response Window Resources to protect core spending for essential basic
services during this period of severe fiscal difficulties. In addition, the AF was necessary to enhance
the development impact of the original project by further strengthening management capacity and
extending coverage of basic urban services in Abidjan and Bouaké and other selected cities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     At appraisal in 2008, the original project was estimated to reach three million beneficiaries
across the country in both the rebel and government controlled parts. One million people, as well as
schools and hospitals in Abidjan and Bouaké, would obtain access to potable water. An estimated
                                                   3
700,000 people would benefit from improved sanitary conditions including access to sewers. An
unidentified number would benefit from rehabilitated roads and restored public transport. In addition,
municipal governments of ten cities would benefit from organizational and financial audits that would
help improve municipal services. In 2010, the AF was estimated to extend the benefit of potable water
to another 300,000 people in the cities included in the project, as well as extend the availability of
water to 20 hours per day. An estimated 100,000 additional people would benefit from improved
sanitation. Those benefitting from access to passable roads were estimated at 83,000. The total
number of direct beneficiaries of the original project and the AF was estimated to reach 4.0 million,
of whom 52 percent would be female.

Williamsville transfer station to enable solid waste storage and transportation to the landfill site with
appropriate means; (iii) a mass media campaign to sensitize communities about health and
environmental risks associated with inappropriate management of solid waste, including a component
on HIV-AIDS; (iv) institutional support to improve the institutional environment and capacity of all
stakeholders, including local governments, for the supervision of service performance in their
respective jurisdictions; and (v) improvement of living conditions of communities living in the
vicinity of the disposal site of Akouedo, including the construction of a health center and an extension
to an existing school (6 additional classrooms).

Component IV: Urban Roads Rehabilitation - US$28 million equivalent

16.    The activities under this component included: (i) rehabilitation of seven roads on which
transportation lines had ceased operation, including road surface and drainage networks

refurbishment, and treatment of two particularly critical areas routinely flooded during the rainy
seasons; (ii) works including: (a) the construction of a footbridge extending pedestrian walkways in
two underserved neighborhoods; (b) construction of a 120-meter bridge and a road to improve
accessibility of new residential areas; and, (c) the conversion of one of the most congested spots at
Rivera 2 into an interchange; (iii) horizontal and vertical signage, including installation of standing
road signs, and painting of road-surface markings on as many roads as possible, and; (iv)
rehabilitation of six heavily degraded roads totaling 7 kilometers in Bouaké, supplementing the 5-
road, 11-kilometer rehabilitation program already funded by the European Commission.

Component V: Municipal Contracts - US$7 million equivalent

17.    The activities under this component included: (i) urban, organizational, and financial audits
of the 10 selected municipalities to carry out a needs assessment of services, infrastructure,
management, organization and finances and determine, through a participatory process, a Priority
Investment Program (PIP), a Priority Maintenance Program (PMP) and a Municipal Adjustment
Program (MAP); (ii) accompanying measures which will be identified during the audits and serve to
support and motivate local governments.

1.6 Revised Components2

18.     The AF would finance activities in four of the five initial components to scale up basic urban
services in some of the poorest communities and strengthen project sustainability. The fifth
component (municipal contracts) would not be resourced with additional funds, as the municipalities
were still in the process of using the amount allocated to this component under the parent project.

Component I: Urban Water Services - US$12 million equivalent

19.     The Additional Financing would enable: (i) the protection of ground water resources of the
North Zone in Adjame and Nord Riviera in Cocody, and establishment of a network for ground water
monitoring in Bonoua; (ii) the reinforcement of water supply in Abidjan through construction of
boreholes in Anyama and extension of water distribution facilities; (iii) reinforcement and
rehabilitation of water production and distribution facilities in Bouaké and other selected cities, and
power supply improvement to the water production facilities in Bouaké; and (iv) implementation of
a program to increase water supply in selected cities.

Component II: Sanitation - US$12 million equivalent

20.     The Additional Financing would support treatment of more wastewater and contribute to
restoration of the deteriorated environmental condition of the Abidjan lagoon and low-lying areas of
the hydrological basin of Gourou. Particular focus will be given to water drainage under the Indenie
and Cocody bays, which constitutes a serious health hazard for the population around the Gourou
basin.

Component III: Solid Waste Collection and Disposal – US$7 million equivalent

21.     The funds would be used for (i) improvement of the solid waste collection infrastructure,

component activities are presented.

                                                         5
including rehabilitation, construction and equipment of grouping and triage centers, and (ii)
improvement of working conditions of waste workers.

Component IV: Urban Roads Rehabilitation – US$19 million equivalent

22.    The Additional Funds would finance works in the rehabilitation of mass transit routes in
Abidjan and other selected cities, including rehabilitation of dilapidated road segments and
construction of urban roads and bridges. Around Abidjan, the works would contribute to restoring
more reliable public transportation services in the seriously disadvantaged municipalities of Abobo,
Yopougon, and Cocody that were no longer served by public transportation due to road degradation.

1.7 Other significant changes

23.     In addition to the Additional Financing and scaling up of urban services to reach poor
communities, the Board approved changes in the PDO reflecting the expanded project scope and a
12-month extension of the initial closing date, from September 15, 2012 to September 15, 2013. A
second extension was approved on February 27, 2013, following IDA’s 6-month suspension during
the post-election crisis, to allow the project to complete implementation of the ongoing activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     In light of the still fragile post-conflict situation in 2008 and the dire state of urban
infrastructure and services, the project was prepared in five months pursuant to OP/BP 8.0 Rapid
Response to Crisis and Emergencies. No economic or financial analyses were done given the
emergency situation. The rapid response was justified in view of the crisis situation in urban services.
For instance, in Abidjan, water service was regularly interrupted and in most neighborhoods, the
sewer system was not working, with reflux of wastewater in bathrooms and sewage overflowing into
the street. As a result, sewage from approximately 600,000 people discharged in the lagoon. The solid
waste collection rate had declined to 46 percent in 2008. In addition, 60 percent of the roads had
degraded, routinely flooding during the rainy season, and becoming impassable in critical areas of
the city. In Bouaké and other secondary cities, similar conditions prevailed. The ensuing poverty,
health and environmental risks, and diminished access to basic services contributed to the continuing
social and political instability at the time.

25.     The proposed activities to improve water service, increase access to the sewer network, restore
solid waste collection, and rehabilitate urban roads correctly addressed the most urgent deficiencies
in municipal services that affected the poor in both the North and South of the country. They were
identified in close consultation with all parties. Rehabilitation of basic infrastructure was considered
the first requirement towards normalization of the situation. The Bank had long experience and
involvement in basic infrastructure before the onset of the crisis in the late 1990s. The design of the
project was grounded in those long-standing interventions and the continuous dialogue between the
Bank and the GoCI even during the long crisis period. Existing available studies were used during
project preparation and were quickly updated before project effectiveness. The implementation
arrangements were kept simple and coordination and execution of the project relied on a Monitoring
and Steering Committee, a Coordination Unit and the relevant Technical Departments. The main risks
identified were the lack of political stability, corruption, deteriorated governance, and the weak
control environment. Mitigation measures included strengthening of the existing Coordination Unit,
updating the existing computerized accounting system, annual technical and financial audits, regular
supervision missions together with national authorities, and agreement on special procedures that
                                                   6
would allow project funds to bypass cumbersome national procedures. There was no formal quality
at entry review, but the fact that implementation commenced shortly after effectiveness at a steady
pace suggest that the activities selected and implementation arrangements put in place were relevant
and effective.

2.2 Implementation

26.     Additional Financing. Implementation progress was rated Satisfactory throughout the life of
the project and in 2010 the task team was awarded the “Africa 2010 Excellence Award”. The project’s
successful implementation was due to the strong commitment by the Government as well as the close
supervision and timely advice extended by the task team. This was notwithstanding the on-going
turmoil around the elections in 2010, the North-South split, and the difficult fiscal situation. In 2010
the GoCI requested the Additional Financing (AF) from the Bank. The AF of US$50 million was
approved on June 17, 2010 and made it possible to scale up basic municipal services in the poorest
communities as well as improve project sustainability. The AF helped improve the situations in cities
across the country and citizens, including the poor, recognized that the Government wanted to bring
about tangible improvements in their lives to improve the precarious social and political stability.

27.     Mid-Term Review (MTR). The mid-term review was conducted jointly with the Borrower in
October 2010 as planned. The tense political situation ahead of the proposed 2010 elections and the
unresolved issues related to the solid waste management and wastewater infrastructure management
were the issues discussed. The review concluded with the recommendations that the GoCI complete
the study on the solid waste collection system and improve the maintenance of the existing wastewater
system. Solid waste management and arrangements for the maintenance of the waste water system
were put in place in 2014 near project closing.

28.      Government contributions and actions. The project was a grant in view of the GoCI’s dire
fiscal situation at appraisal. No counterpart funding was required from the central or local
governments in line with the provision of OP. 8.00. However, the Government contributed significant
funds from its own budget to cover the cost of unanticipated additional works, extension of project
activities to non-project communities also facing urban emergencies, and a 12-month extension of
the Clean City program. Moreover, the GoCI, because of the continuing political instability and the
North-South split, wanted to demonstrate its commitment to the project’s higher-level objective of
sustaining social and political stability. This became another reason for the Government to contribute
funds from its own budget.

29.     At completion, the Government had contributed US$36.07 million of the total project cost of
US$175.2 million. It paid the subsidies for water system connections (US$0.16 million), the cost of
the sewerage connection works (US$0.04 million), a 12-month extension of the Clean City program,
and the on-going construction of three pre-collection stations (US$13.37 million), around 45
kilometers of road rehabilitation in Abidjan, Bouaké and other secondary cities (US$16.96 million),
a study of the municipal contract program (US$0.03 million), and project management costs including
salaries of civil servants serving the project and taxes not eligible for IDA financing (US$5.52
million).

30.     Other Donor Contributions. Complementing the project’s improvement of the sewage system
in Abidjan (Component 2), the European Union (EU) was to finance the rehabilitation of five
pumping stations and the ocean outfall and loading tower at Port Bouet. However, EU funds were
insufficient to finance the work on the loading tower. Moreover, local citizens objected to the
rehabilitation of the tower because it emitted bad smell and noise. To address this situation, the GoCI
financed a study to come up with a solution for the loading tower acceptable to the local citizens. It
                                                   7
approached the French Development Agency (Agence Française de Développement, AFD) to provide
the funds to complete the works. The loading tower and ocean outfall financed by AFD were
commissioned in October 2014.

31.      Extensions of closing date required by implementation changes and Bank’s suspensions of
activities post-election. The original closing date of September 15, 2012 was extended twice. In 2010,
the closing date was extended to September 15, 2013 to provide additional time to implement the
scale up activities financed with the AF. In 2011, the closing date was extended to March 31, 2014 to
allow time to recover from the six-month Bank suspension (December 2010 – April 2011) following
the post-election crises. During this period, all Bank projects were suspended and the project staff
moved to Dakar for safety reasons. However, the task team stayed in contact with the implementing
agencies during this period and systematically reestablished working relations upon their return to
Abidjan so as to limit the implementation interruption and recommence project activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     Annex 2 (Results Framework and Monitoring) of the 2008 Emergency Project Paper provided
key indicators and specified frequency and responsibilities for data collection and for monitoring
reports. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was to compile the data and information collected by
the executing agencies for distribution to the Monitoring & Steering Committee (MSC), which
provided implementation oversight for the Government, and to the Bank and partners. Semi-annual
supervision missions discussed monitoring information with the agencies and ways to improve the
information, as necessary. The design of the M&E system was relatively simple, with two indicators
for the PDO and one each for the components. However, the indicators for access to water and sewer
connections and the number of beneficiaries were based on outdated studies and several ministries
involved in component implementation lacked the capacity to monitor indicators. This necessitated
capacity building by the supervision missions and short-term consultants. Despite these initial
shortcomings, however, the M&E framework allowed the Government and the Bank to maintain an
adequate picture of progress and issues, and allowed the MSC to alert the Government to take action
to keep implementation on schedule (e.g., when customers were unable to pay the cost of water supply
and sewerage connections and when citizens objected to rehabilitation of the loading tower at Port
Bouet). The M&E was rated satisfactory throughout the life of the project.

33.     The 2010 Emergency Additional Financing Project Paper noted that the PCU had collected
and consolidated implementation data, including key indicators, in a satisfactory manner to monitor
progress and that supervision missions had closely monitored the data collection. The results
framework was, however, adjusted to reflect the AF and comply with the new core indicator
requirements. Three key indicators were added to monitor the achievement of the revised PDO and
three intermediate indicators added to monitor component progress. This generally improved the
quantitative nature of the results framework, although the Government’s Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) noted that, as mentioned above, some of the base data was weak, based on outdated
studies, and some of the data in the aide memoires imprecise. To correct this, in 2013, the GoCI
initiated a number of studies to correct the base data. Though not required under OP/BP 8.00, the ICR
mission undertook an analysis of the benefit streams at completion and a cost-benefit analysis of the
four project components. In addition, the Government provided limited data on the economic impact
of the improvements of the road network and conducted interviews with beneficiaries to obtain a
sense of their satisfaction with the project results. The summaries of these surveys are discussed in
Sections 3.3 and 3.6. Overall, at completion, the results framework provided a comprehensive picture
of project results.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.     The project was classified as Environmental Category B, as the potential environmental and
social impacts were considered to be minor and reversible. It triggered two safeguard policies: OP/BP
4.01 (Environmental Assessment); and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). The Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were
prepared and published in 2008. To ensure compliance with the frameworks, the PCU recruited a
safeguards and a social expert in January 2009 who would work closely with the National
Environmental Agency (Agence Nationale de l’Environnement). Together with the Bank’s safeguards
specialist based in Abidjan, the PCU staff processed Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for four
project sites: the footbridge at Williamsville; the underpass at Riviera 2; the road at M’Badon; and,
the bridge and connecting road over the ravine in Cocody. The RAPs provided compensation to all
639 persons affected by temporary closures causing loss of income due to works at these sites. No
other safeguard actions were required and the rating of safeguards had been satisfactory throughout
the project.

35.     Given the high fiduciary risks identified at appraisal, the GoCI and the Bank agreed to select
the Support Mission for the Conduct of Municipal Operations (Mission d’Appui à la Conduite
d’Opérations Municipales, MACOM), which had experienced procurement and accounting staff
familiar with Bank procedures, as the implementing and coordinating agency. In addition to requiring
quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) and annual audits, the Bank recommended in 2011 that the
MACOM/PCU recruit an internal auditor to strengthen the control environment. These measures,
reinforced by the Bank’s procurement and financial management staff, who conducted random checks
on transactions during semi-annual supervision missions, resulted in satisfactory ratings of
procurement and financial management throughout the project. In addition, the three post-
procurement reviews conducted showed full compliance with procurement rules and procedures. The
opinions of all external annual audit reports were unqualified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.     One activity of the original project - the reduction of wastewater flow into the Abidjan lagoon
- was transitioned to post-completion operations. The associated loading tower and ocean outfall at
Port Bouet, though not identified at appraisal but found necessary during project implementation, was
also moved to post-project operations. The work to dredge the canal to improve the flow of
wastewater and clean the lagoon is being financed from the follow-up IDA Emergency Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project (EIRP). This work is expected to be completed in February 2015. The loading
tower and ocean outfall will be completed with funds from AFD and are expected to be commissioned
in October/November 2014.

37.     While the urban infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion results of the project led to the
achievement of the original and revised PDO, it also made the citizens, municipalities and the GoCI
realize that much more remains to be done. This led the Government to approach the Bank in late
2011 for additional grant funds for infrastructure, well before the closing of the project. In September
2012, the Board approved a Grant of SDR 64.5 million (US$100 million equivalent) for the follow-
up Emergency Infrastructure Renewal Project (EIRP). The PDO of the EIRP is to improve access to
basic infrastructure in targeted urban and rural areas. The EIRP will rehabilitate: urban infrastructure,
including roads, schools, health centers and public buildings; urban water supply; sanitation, drainage
and flood prevention infrastructure; and electricity infrastructure. It will also rehabilitate rural
infrastructure, including rural roads and basic social infrastructure. These investments support both
the 2014-2016 National Development Plan (NDP), which has basic infrastructure as one of the three
pillars to improve stability and reduce poverty, and the updated 2009 PRSP. Further urban

                                                   9
infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion are also in line with the Bank’s 2010 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) which has renewing infrastructure and basic services as one of its pillars.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

38.     The project objectives of increasing access and improving quality of urban infrastructure and
services countrywide was highly relevant in 2008, given the crisis in urban infrastructure, financing
and delivery of services, widespread poverty, instability, the North-South split, and deteriorated
governance situation. It remained relevant at project completion, as reflected in the current NDP,
PRSP and CPS. In addition, the design focus on improving access to potable water, sewerage, garbage
collection and roads and transport in poor neighborhoods was appropriate in view of the poverty and
instability in these communities. The prevailing conditions necessitated the selection of activities that
could be implemented with reduced municipal staff and services and with weak construction and
service companies. Moreover, the selection of MACOM as an experienced implementation
implementing agency with proven ability to work with the technical departments responsible for
water, sewerage, solid waste, roads and transport, contributed to effective project implementation.

39.     Social and political stability and economic recovery – the higher-level project objective - has
improved and the project was certainly designed to make a contribution to that high level objective
by meeting the country’s urgent urban infrastructure needs. Project crisis spending for water supply,
sanitation, urban mobility and governance in the country’s major cities was a first step to reduce
poverty and improve governance and stability. The Bank was the only donor at the time willing to
work with the Government to commence a recovery from decades of conflict, instability, economic
decline and urban deterioration. IDA’s experience with infrastructure in the country, the team’s
approach to work with all partners and keep implementation arrangement simple, and reliance on an
experienced and proven implementing agency familiar with Bank procedures, together resulted in
efficient project implementation. PDO and Implementation Progress (IP) ratings in the semi-annual
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) have been satisfactory throughout the life of the
project as have those for fiduciary, environment, and monitoring and evaluation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives3

40.    By June 2010, at the time of the Additional Financing, after 18 months of implementation,
urban infrastructure and services were substantially improved and an additional 136,000 people had
access to improved water services for Abidjan and Bouaké. In the city of Abidjan, neighborhood
sewerage services had been improved and all unsanitary informal solid waste dump sites had been
removed. Some 23.5 kilometers (17 in Abidjan and 5.5 in Bouaké) of degraded roads had become
passable, with improved safety for public and other transport and for pedestrians. In addition,
organizational and financial audits were completed in two communities to develop plans to improve
municipal services..

41.     These results in Abidjan reflect a collection of achievements. Construction work was
completed on 18,300 new household water connections and 50 standposts at schools and health
centers. Work to improve sewerage included the rehabilitation of 15 waste water lift stations and

  The 2010 revision of the PDO and indicators and the AF requires a split evaluation with the assessment of the PDOs
achievement at restructuring and closing.

                                                         10
provision of new equipment at 21 pumping stations. Solid waste management works included the
collection of about 845,000 tons of solid waste and dumping this at the disposal site as part of the
Clean City program. Twelve kilometers of urban roads were rehabilitated and five kilometers
resurfaced, 445 traffic lights were installed along with and road safety markings along 157 kilometers
of roads. In the city of Bouke 58 kilometers of water network had been realized in peri-urban area,
27 standpost had been constructed, 3 standpost rehabilitated and Some 5.5 kilometers of degraded
roads had rehabilitated. To finance these works about sixty percent of the grant proceeds had been
committed at the time.

42.     Although the achievement of the higher-level objective could not directly be attributed to the
impact of project activities, tangible improvements in urban services were becoming visible for the
population. The expectation that more citizens would benefit from further improvements made a
contribution towards improved social stability despite continuous turmoil around elections. The
Government perceived that crisis spending on urban services and subsidies for electricity had
beneficial effects on stability and economic recovery. Although it was not possible to demonstrate
causal links between spending and stability, people became aware that the Government was intent on
improving their lives and was willing to invest in improving urban services to do so. The achievement
of the PDO at restructuring is rated as Satisfactory.

43.     At project completion in March 2014, access to quality urban infrastructure and services had
been achieved for an estimated 5.4 million beneficiaries – exceeding the target of 4.0 million – in
Abidjan and Bouaké as well as in seven secondary cities (Korhogo, Man, Agboville, Assinie, Attiguei,
Mayo and Tinhou). About half (52%) of these beneficiaries were female. More than 2.6 million
people obtained access to uninterrupted water supply services for 20 hours a day; 3.6 million people
gained access to Improved sanitation , including 200,000 who did not have access before. Some 4.0
million people in Abidjan now have access to regular solid waste collection services, including 1.5
million who had no collection service before. An additional 400,000 people obtained access to year
round passable roads equipped with signaling and safety markings as well as to public transport.
Finally, initial improvements in municipal technical services and staffing have been accomplished in
selected municipalities.

44.     These overall project achievements in water supply are the result of: (i) construction of 400
kilometers of primary and secondary water supply networks and 35,586 new connections; (ii)
installation and rehabilitation of 103 standposts in poor communities and new water connections for
38 schools; (iii) drilling and equipping five boreholes and the construction of five water towers; and
(iv) rehabilitation and expansion of the water treatment plant at Abatta. New and expanded access to
sewerage services was achieved through: (i) rehabilitation of 21 pumping stations and construction
of two new ones; (ii) construction of 36 kilometers of sewers connecting three communities to the
main interceptor; and (iii) construction of 4.7 kilometers of surface drains and a surface water
treatment and outflow plant. In addition, a mass-media program informed 1.5 million people about
proper hygiene. Improved and expanded access to roads was the result of: (i) rehabilitation and
construction of 230 kilometers of roads in Abidjan, Bouaké, Man, and Agboville; (ii) construction of
183 kilometers of drains to prevent surface water build-up and flooding; (iii) construction of a bridge
to connect zones 7 and 9 in Cocody; and (iv) the construction of the Riviera 2 underpass. People have
improved mobility and road safety following the rehabilitation of road markings, the installation of
traffic lights and signs on 157 kilometers of main roads in Abidjan, and the construction of a
footbridge to link the neighborhoods of Williamsville and Bracodi. Improvements in municipal
government and services are the result of the financial and organizational audits conducted in 10
municipalities, the preparation of priority investment plans for these communities, and the training
and recruitment of technical staff.


                                                  11
45.      The increased access to and improved quality of urban infrastructure and services in Abidjan,
Bouaké and other selected cities achieved through the project have helped bring about tangible
improvements in the lives of the people living in those cities. Streets are relatively clean with smooth
traffic, including public transport, and there is potable water even in poor neighborhoods, as compared
to 2008 at the time of appraisal, when there were water trucks and garbage and sewage everywhere,
and many streets inundated or impassable with limited public transport. It is more difficult to give
evidence of the project impact on sustained social and political stability in the country. The few
surveys conducted by the PCU only report higher levels of satisfaction with urban services and
infrastructure and fewer traffic jams and delays on city roads. Also, increasing both access to water
and sewerage was intentionally done first in poor and underserved areas of the cities as was the
rehabilitation of roads and the restoration of public transport. These activities improved the lives of
the poor citizens in these areas, creating neighborhood jobs and also allowing children to go to school
instead of searching for water and adults to go to market and work. Together these achievements
contributed to social stability in the cities. Moreover, activities around the municipal contracts
engaged citizens in local government and made elected officials accountable, thereby not only
improving municipal services but also political stability. Taken together, the achievement of the PDO
and revised PDO at completion is rated as Highly Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

46.     Economic Analysis. Although no economic or financial analysis was done at appraisal, an
analysis of the economic and financial costs and benefits was done as part of the ICR to estimate
project efficiency. The analysis computed three indicators: Economic Rate of Return (ERR), Net
Present Value (NPV) and the Cost/Benefit ratio (C/B). It captures both direct and indirect costs and
benefits, and converts financial prices in economic costs through shadow pricing. Six sets of benefit
streams were considered: (i) revenue generated by a water supply tariff; (ii) fee paid by households
to connect to the sewerage network; (iii) health benefits accruing from sewerage investments; (iv)
fees paid by households for waste collection; (v) income benefits from works and solid waste
collection; and (vi) road-users’ cost savings. Several benefits such as environmental, tourism, trade
and other expected health benefits were not included due to lack of usable data.

47.     The assumptions are: (i) water supply billing and collection rates and related operating
expenses will be sustained at 90 and 75 percent respectively; (ii) rise of the minimum monthly wage
from 36,000 CFA Francs (US$75) to 60,000 CFA Francs (US$120) effective 2014; (iii) expected
vehicle operating and travel-time costs savings sustained through 2032; (iv) traffic volume of 75,000
vehicles per day at the Riviera 2 junction sustained through 2032; (v) the maintenance cost of urban
services and infrastructure constructed/rehabilitated estimated at 13 percent of capital expenditure
and sustained through 2032; and (vi) rehabilitated sewerage pumping stations and infrastructure will
benefit from adequate maintenance funding through 2032.

48.     Based on these assumptions, the project economic viability as measured by NPV and ERR
over a period of 25 years at a 12 percent discount rate are estimated at 26 percent and US$25.3 million
respectively (see Annex 3).

49.     Financial Analysis. The financial analysis substantiates the financial effectiveness of the
water supply, solid waste management and road rehabilitation investments based on direct costs and
benefits over 25 years and 19 years of projected costs and benefits (2014-2032). Results of this
analysis in terms of Internal Rates of Return (IRRs) and Net Present Values (NPVs) at 12 percent
discount rate are respectively 23 percent and US$44.5 million with a Cost/Benefit ratio of 2.5. The
rates by components are given in Annex 3. Overall, the rating of project efficiency is High.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating4

50.      Rating: Highly Satisfactory. The final outcome rating is based on the fact that the
improvements in urban services and infrastructure brought about significant improvements in the
lives of citizens in the two largest cities and seven smaller cities in the country. That such
improvements continue to be relevant to the Government and the citizens is confirmed by the NDP
and PRSP, as well as by the latest CPS and the follow up IDA - Emergency Infrastructure Renewal
Project. Globally, the project exceeded the number of beneficiaries envisioned to be reached with
improved urban services. While its impact on poverty reduction has not been analyzed because of the
emergency nature of the project, it did contribute to creating employment and economic recovery and
growth. Also, implementation was efficient as a result of the strong commitment by the Government
and the Bank. Overall, these results are highly satisfactory given that implementation took place in a
fragile post-conflict situation and that the implementing agencies and the Bank faced long periods of
social and political turmoil, and violence around the presidential elections that took place during the
life of the project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

51.     While poverty alleviation was not an explicit objective of the project, the incidence of poverty
was taken into account in the selection of communities for the restoration of water, sewage and road
services. The selection was informed by consultations launched by the Government in 2008, with
religious and traditional leaders, and associations of women and youth, as part of the preparation of
a strategy for development and poverty reduction. More directly, the project was expected to help
reduce poverty by creating short-term work opportunities associated with the works contracts. An
estimated 12,000 jobs at some 100 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were created as part of the
various construction works. In addition, a total of 7,000 workers are employed by the five
cooperatives that have been created in municipalities to undertake street cleaning and garbage
collection. These workers support an estimated 69,900 people living in their households.

(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

52.     The audits conducted as part of the Municipal Contracts component included an analysis of
the institutional capacity of municipalities. This was essential as staff in many municipalities had fled
those cities, to the point where the central government was forced to take over most municipal
functions and services. Given the weakness of municipalities, the audits took longer than expected.
However, after the two pilots in Yopougon and Korhogo, another eight municipalities participated.
Two results likely to contribute to strengthening municipal capacity are: (i) priority investments plans
have been prepared for the 10 cities, and (ii) based on these, the Government has increased annual
minimum fiscal transfer per municipality from FCFA 28 million to FCFA 100 million, a substantial
contribution to the financial viability of municipalities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

53.    The project included the sub-objective of improvements in the living conditions of the
communities in the vicinity of the Akouedo disposal site which released gas, leachate and odors that
had a negative impact on the health of these communities. An unintended part of these improvements

    The overall Outcome Rating is calculated to be 5x0.4+6x0.97=7.76 Highly Satisfactory

                                                          13
was the administration of a total of 10,800 vaccinations against tetanus, yellow fever, typhoid and
hepatitis to the inhabitants.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

54.     The PCU in 2012 surveyed 3,867 people in Abidjan about their satisfaction with the extended
and improved water supply. Almost all households reported to have water each day and 60 percent
attributed that to the project’s improvements in the water supply system. In addition, 14 percent of
the interviewees reported improvements in health and 2 percent in hygiene. Interviewees also noted
that the early morning search for water by women and girls is no longer required. Two hundred
questionnaires were handed out to people and shop owners along five roads rehabilitated under the
project. Globally all expressed their satisfaction with the roads commenting on the increased mobility,
reductions in travel time, and restored public transport, although half expressed concern about the
increased potential for accidents as a result of the higher speed of traffic.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

55.     Rating: Substantial. At completion, the final supervision mission aide memoire of June 2014
rated financial risks as substantial. This is based on the continued difficult fiscal situation in view of
subsidies, crisis spending on infrastructure and services rehabilitation. The tight fiscal situation could
pose a risk to project outcomes, in particular the financing of maintenance of the water, sewerage,
solid waste and roads rehabilitated and constructed under the project.

5 Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance.

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

56.     Rating: Satisfactory. The appraisal team was comprised of 8 technical and 11 country team
staff with specializations covering every aspect of the proposed project. Several were based in-
country and familiar with the prevailing conditions in the cities and close to governmental agencies
and their staff. This made it possible to combine preparation and appraisal in January 2008 and Board
approval in June that same year. While some of the studies used at appraisal to define components
were old and possibly outdated, the Bank team worked closely with expert staff, consultants and
implementing agencies to update and correct data and information and make corrections in order to
reach the poorest communities and serve the hardest hit crisis areas. There was no formal quality-at-
entry review, but given that implementation did commence quickly and was kept up even during
periods of political upheaval suggest that the project activities selected responded to the needs of the
population and that implementation arrangements were well-designed and effective.

(b) Quality of Supervision

57.     Rating: Satisfactory. The semi-annual supervision missions were staffed with experienced
and technically qualified staff (water, transport, procurement, financial management, M&E,
safeguard, and social) most of whom stayed with the project throughout implementation. Aide
memoires were detailed, reflecting discussions and agreements with the Government, implementing
agencies, donors and partners, and clear action plans to keep implementation on schedule. Staff coped
effectively with weak local construction companies and municipalities, and consulted community
representatives and traditional village chiefs regularly. These efforts were rewarded with the “Africa
2010 Excellence Award”. With procurement staff in-country and the task team leader in-country after

                                                   14
2010, the task team was able to oversee implementation closely and communicate with governmental
and implementation agency staff whenever required. While political and social stability remained
fragile and government actions on contract arrangements and payments slow, the team, working
closely with the PCU, was able to keep works, procurements and payments on schedule utilizing 97
percent of the available grant funds by completion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

58.    Rating: Satisfactory. Throughout preparation, appraisal, supervision and completion, the
Bank performed effectively in a difficult, fragile post-conflict situation. Cooperation with the
Government, implementing agencies, local authorities, donors and partners was also effective. The
Bank contributed to the achievement of the original and revised PDOs which have been achieved,
exceeding targets in some areas with minor delays in others.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

59.     Rating: Satisfactory. While the Government was committed from the start to improving
urban services and addressing the crisis situation in many cities, it was slow in deciding about funding
and contract renewal or renegotiation. This was the case early on in implementation with the late
payment and arrears with solid waste collectors, and arrears in payments for water consumed by the
Government. The Government was also slow in setting up a viable system for maintenance of the
water supply system as well as waste/surface water infrastructure management until well into 2012.
In part, this was the result of the political turmoil and instability and the weakening of municipal
administrative capacity as a result of the crisis, and took continuous efforts by Bank staff and
consultants to remedy in the early years of implementation. On the other hand, the Government made
considerable efforts during implementation to assure available funding to expand project activities.
The additional contributions of the Government covered the cost of additional works, which became
necessary after updating the studies that had served for appraisal purposes, and the extension of
project activities to additional poor communities at the Government’s request. Also the Government
paid for a 12-month extension of the Clean City program with daily collection of waste, and paid the
salaries of civil servants assigned to the project. Further, the Government stepped in to subsidize new
water supply and/or sewerage connections for poor families when this became an obstacle during
implementation. The Government was also sensitive to complaints of citizens at Port Bouet who
objected to the rehabilitation of the loading tower, paying for a study to come up with an alternative
design. In general, however, implementation support and agreements to settle and pay services
contracts has been slow throughout the project, and the PCU and the Monitoring and Steering
Committee had to compensate and come up with solutions for these inactions to keep implementation
on schedule.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

60.     Rating: Satisfactory. The Project Coordination Unit was quick to recruit staff for safeguards,
social and M&E activities and later an internal audit to strengthen its capacity in these areas.
Improvements in the accounting system and procurement further helped to make the PCU into an
effective unit that oversaw and managed the many activities, procurements, payments and reporting
in a timely manner. The PCU organized regular meetings with the agencies that implemented the
water, sewerage, garbage and roads components, local governments, contractors and donors. These
agencies in general executed the works they were responsible for in a timely manner, providing
oversight over the work done by contractors and finding solutions for problems and delays that
occurred. Finally, the PCU and the implementing agencies maintained close contact with the Bank
                                                15
and produced the required project reports in a timely manner. The performance of the PCU and
implementing agencies is rated Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

61.    Rating: Satisfactory. Despite some delays with payments and maintenance contracts, the
performance of the Government and the implementing agencies was satisfactory overall as is evident
from both the achievement of the PDO and the satisfaction with the project by the millions of
beneficiaries.

6. Lessons Learned

62.     Emergency Projects benefit from simple implementation arrangements and having the Task
Team Leader (TTL) in-country. The achievement of the PDO was made possible by the fact that the
team that worked with the Government at appraisal made the decision early on to keep
implementation arrangements simple (Emergency Project Paper of May 29, 2009, page 11). This
meant that no new agencies were created. Instead, existing governmental agencies responsible for
water, sewerage, solid waste and roads were engaged in the selection of project activities in these
areas, ensuring that project activities responded to emergency need, and were within their capacity to
implement and manage. Although there were some initial difficulties due to outdated reports and base
data, this approach turned out to be highly effective for emergency operations and should be
considered for similar projects. Also, the task team members who were involved in the appraisal
stayed with the project throughout implementation as members of the supervision missions.
Moreover, the TTL and the staff responsible for roads, procurement, financial management and
safeguards were in-country for most of the life of the project. They were aware of the impact the
rehabilitation activities had on their neighborhoods and the city at large and could and did get in touch
with the Government and the implementing agencies directly when issues arose that required their
attention. Having the task team in country for an emergency project is an important component of
achievement of the PDO.

63.      Keeping cities clean requires continuous efforts and not just a single campaign. The project
helped remove an enormous amount of garbage in Abidjan and reached a large number of people in
the mass campaign promoting hygiene and the link between a clean city and health. At completion,
streets and sidewalks in Abidjan are indeed relatively clean. However, the completion mission noticed
that even in nice neighborhoods (Cocody, Treichville, Adjame, Port Bouet) that have been visited
during the mission, people were throwing garbage on the streets and sidewalks and paid little attention
it seems to the small garbage dumps that were forming again. Also, many of the garbage containers
that may have been installed along the sidewalk as part of the clean city activity were either
overflowing or had fallen into disrepair. Three lessons need to be drawn from this situation. One is
that citizens need to be reminded regularly and continuously, not once only, that throwing garbage in
the street poses a hazard to their health and that of others. This should be done not only in schools
and media, but also with street signs. Secondly, communities should be asked to pay for the emptying
and maintenance of garbage receptacles in their neighborhoods so that they realize that they have a
stake and responsibility for keeping their streets clean. Third, behavior change is a major part of
improved solid waste management services and should be supported by a long-term strategy
combining awareness-raising and economic incentives.

64.    Keep citizens engaged in further municipal reforms and the on-going decentralization
program. Under the project’s municipal contract activities, citizens were successfully engaged in the
management of municipal services and were able to press elected officials to improve services and
their management of municipalities. This suggests that this approach should be applied systematically
                                                   16
in the broader effort underway to decentralize government services and investments. Such citizen
participation could help the transparency and effectiveness of the decentralization program where the
Government is slowly trying to return district and municipal management responsibilities to locally
elected officials and administrators. It would also help to further the improved political stability
achieved under the project and more generally the democratization of the country.

65.      Conduct field surveys to establish baseline data and to raise the M&E capacity in the country.
In post-conflict situations, baseline data is not readily available while the demand for targeting project
support to the population most in need is high. While the Government decided to undertake additional
studies to obtain or improve baseline data, the experience with implementation showed that the on-
going M&E activities were hampered by faulty and out of date information. The experience also
showed that the capacity for M&E in governmental agencies that have been affected by conflict and
loss of technical staff tends to be weak in post-conflict and emergency projects. The project did
promote an improvement in M&E capacity within the government as a result of training and guidance
by consultants and mission staff. It would be more effective, however, to overcome a lack of basic
statistics and M&E capacity in the implementing agencies future operations by placing more
emphasis on field surveys (including to establish baseline), whenever local conditions allow for it,
real-time monitoring and evaluation, clarification of institutional aspects, and data quality control.

66.     Improving the management and benefits of standpipes. To improve the functioning of
standpipes in poor communities without home connections, the rehabilitation and construction of
standpipes should be accompanied by awareness-raising campaigns about illegal water sellers and
managers. These campaigns should inform the local population about the need to deal only with the
designated standpipe managers. Also, the financial situation of standpipe managers requires
continued improvements, e.g., through proper pricing policies and the construction of kiosks for these
managers. The experience under the project suggests that it is essential to use managers that are well-
established in the neighborhoods.

67.    Addressing the high costs of sewerage connections. The need for subsidies to help poor
families to pay for their new sewerage connection showed that while there is a need for sewer
connections, the real costs of such connections are too high for the potential beneficiaries. It should
be considered in similar projects to defer payment of connections over several years. Also, requiring
households to connect to sewers when they are connected to the water supply may encourage more
households to request and pay for sewerage connections.

68.    Strengthen cooperation among government staff. The project has prompted sector experts
from different agencies to work together, which turned out to be a gain in the effectiveness and
performance of the Ivorian administration. To sustain this, however, intra- and inter-sector
coordination needs to be strengthened further to maximize efficiency and increase the beneficial
impact of investments by including training and staff development program in project financed by
donors and by government.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

69.    The Borrower’s completion report (summary in English attached as Annex 7) produced by
the PCU on behalf of the Ministry of Infrastructure (Ministère des Infrastructures Economiques) is
comprehensive, detailed and accurate. It does not raise any issues that require comments from IDA.
There are no separate reports from implementing agencies or partners.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction

1.      The Project Development Objective was to increase access to and improve the quality of urban
infrastructure facilities and services in Abidjan, Bouake, and other selected cities. The project total
financing was US$144 million equivalent (including initial and additional financing) allocated to five
components: (i) Urban Water Supply; (ii) Urban Sanitation; (iii) Solid Waste Management; (iv) Urban
Road Rehabilitation; and (v) Municipal Contracts.

Assumptions of the Analysis

2.       The economic and financial analyses capture the combined quantifiable benefits and costs of
activities related to the above-mentioned project components. Total costs include all actual
investment expenditures from IDA and the Government, as well as annual operations and
maintenance (O&M) costs throughout the 25-year period, from 2008 through 2032. The analyses
were not conducted at appraisal due to the emergency nature of the project. The actual data were
collected from diverse project implementation and government reports covering most of the project
intervention areas. Missing data were provided by the Project Implementation Unit or completed by
the Bank Team in charge of conducting the economic analysis, looking at similar projects in the
region or using data furnished by models such as the Road Economic Decision Model (RED) in Sub-
Saharan Africa or studies carried out as part of the project preparation or implementation, such as the
Strategic Study for Solid Waste Management in the District of Abidjan.

Quantified Benefit Streams

3.      The main benefits arising from the project have been estimated under the following
assumptions: (i) water supply billing and collection rates and related operating expenses will be
sustained at 90 and 75 percent respectively; (ii) The rise of the minimum monthly wage from 36,000
CFA Francs (US$75) to 60,000 CFA Francs (US$120) will be effective from 2014; (iii) expected
vehicle operating and travel-time costs savings which are an indication of efficient national resource
allocation, will be sustained throughout the remaining 19-year period through 2032; (iv) the traffic
volume of 75,000 vehicles per day generated by the completion of the Riviera 2 junction will be
sustained as an indication of the project’s ability to help create wealth, and will drive follow-up new
governmental and private sector investments in many subsectors, including: tourism, manufacturing,
real estate, and trade; (v) the overall maintenance costs of all urban services provided and
infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated under the project estimated to 13 percent of capital
expenditure, will be sustained through 2032; and (vi) all rehabilitated sewerage pumping stations and
infrastructure aimed at connecting secondary sewers to the main interceptor in Abobo and Marcory
will benefit from adequate maintenance funding through 2032.

4.       Six main sets of benefit streams were considered: (i) revenue generated by water supply
tariff5; (ii) supplement fee6 paid by households connected to sewerage network; (iii) health benefits
accruing from sewerage investments (only direct health expenditures avoided and convenience time

    Waste water surcharge: US$0.03/m³

                                                  25
savings are considered); (iv) fees paid by households for waste collection, treatment and disposal; (v)
income benefits generated by project construction works and solid waste collection; and (vi) road-
users’ costs savings (vehicle operating cost and travel-time savings) expected from roads
rehabilitation investments. On the other hand, several benefits were not quantified or applied in
determining the Economic Rates of Return (ERR) due to the lack of usable data. These include mainly
environmental, tourism, trade and other expected health benefits (i.e. income gained due to avoided
days lost from work, avoided days of school absenteeism, income gained due to avoided days lost
from work as a result of child illness, or value of loss-of-life avoided). These non-quantified benefits
represent returns of significant value for the project. The total benefits calculated in the cost-benefit
analysis should thus be interpreted as conservative lower bound estimates.

5.      Benefits from Water Supply Productive Investments. The benefit stream of the project’s
water supply interventions was estimated under the following assumptions: (i) during project
implementation, 136,000 additional people were provided with access to improved water supply by
the project water supply investments; (ii) water users’ fees (US$0.79/m³) cover all operating expenses
related to water network management, including water production and distribution, routine
maintenance, water quality monitoring at the plan level, tariff collection, network rehabilitation and
the like; and (iii) subsidies specifically for network connections were provided to a limited number
of households. Only direct benefits from home connections were considered in the analysis and
derived from the difference between revenue from water sales and estimated O&M costs over the 25
year life span of the project related investments.

6.     Benefits from Urban Sanitation Activities. In addition to the waste water surcharge fee
(US$0.03/m³) paid by each of the additional 21,000 households for sewerage services, the analysis
has taken into account the following expected health benefits:

7.      Direct Health Expenditure Avoided. The calculation of this benefit is based on WHO’s
estimated burden of environmental diseases and, more specifically, the estimated share of diseases
that can be attributed to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) risks. The analysis takes into account
only diarrheal diseases. The burden of diseases attributable to diarrhea caused by lack of WASH
services (at 16 percent 7 of the total diseases) combined with the estimated annually health
expenditures per household, results in about US$80 of annual health expenditure per capita for all
WASH-related diseases. The project team estimates that about 20 percent of the total incidence of
WASH-related disease is being prevented as a result of the project sanitation interventions (based on
global WHO estimate). As a result, each targeted urban dweller is expected to save about US$16 of
annual health expenditures. Applied to the total additional population with access to sewerage service
(200,000 people), the total annual benefit of the proposed operation in this category is US$3,200,000.

8.       Convenience Time Savings. The additional health benefit quantified for the cost-benefit
analysis is the convenience time savings accruing as a result of project sanitation investments. Time
savings occur as a result of, for example, closer access to latrines and shorter waiting times at public
latrines. These time savings potentially translate to more productive activities or more leisure time.
The value of convenience time savings is estimated by assuming a daily time saving per individual
for access to sanitation facilities and then multiplying these by the estimated opportunity cost of time
(in this case the minimum wage). A 2004 WHO study estimates that time saved per day due to less
distant sanitation facilities and less waiting time is about 30 minutes per person. For our analysis, a
more conservative estimate of 15 minutes per day per person was used, resulting in about 2.5 day

equivalent of sanitation access time saved per person per year as a result of the project implementation.
This estimate, when combined with the total targeted working age population, results in almost
165,000 productive day’s equivalent saved per year in the entire targeted population. In combination
with the opportunity cost of capital (daily minimum wage), this leads to annual savings of about
US$990,0008 in this category. The table below summarizes measurable health benefits accruing to
local populations from project sanitation interventions.

Benefits from Solid Waste Management Activities

9.       The analysis focuses essentially on the costs and benefits related to the removal and disposal
of solid waste in the city of Abidjan. Estimation of the net monetary benefits deriving from these
activities was based on the following: (i) 1.5 million additional people had access to solid waste
collection services during the six years of project implementation; (ii) annual population growth rate
is expected to be around 3 percent beginning from 2015 through 2032; (iii) annual solid waste
production per capita is estimated to 0.27ton/year 9 ; (iv) average waste collection rate during the
project implementation period was 60 percent and is expected to be 100 percent 10 during the
remaining project life span; (vi) combined collection, disposal and treatment cost is expected to be in
average US$22/ton; and (vii) each beneficiary of solid waste services is expected to disburse annually
US$70 for that service. The analysis does not integrate expected health benefits from project HIV-
AIDS activities because of lack of usable data.

Economic Benefits from Roads Rehabilitation

10.     Economic benefits under this category consist of savings in recurring costs relative to the
situation prevailing before project implementation. Because of the lack of usable data, only road-
users’ costs (vehicle operating costs and travel-time savings) are captured in the analysis, using data
from the Road Economic Decision Model (RED) in Sub-Saharan Africa and from Côte d’Ivoire
Ministry of Transport. Savings accruing from vehicle operating cost (VOC) are determined based on
the combination of vehicle characteristics and operating costs, and on road surface and topographical
travel conditions. Travel-time related cost savings on the other hand are estimated based on travel
time savings (in this analysis, 30 minutes/vehicle/day), unit cost per hour, passenger occupancy per
vehicle class, vehicle composition of the traffic, and the total traffic volume (75,000 vehicles per day
at the level Riviera 2). Annex Tables 3.2 and 3.3 below provide a summary of unit and total cost
savings benefits estimated in these categories.

11.     Results of the Financial Analysis: The financial analysis conducted as part of the ICR
focuses on a cost-benefit analysis and zeroes-in on the productive water supply, sanitation, solid waste
management and roads rehabilitation investments of the project. The main objective of the analysis
is to substantiate the financial effectiveness of individual project investments at the level of each sub-
sector, taking into account only related direct costs and benefits. The analysis covers 25 years,
including six years of project implementation (2008-2013), and 19 years of projected costs and
benefits (2014-2032). Internal Rates of Return (IRRs) and Net Present Values (NPVs) at 12 percent
discount rate are summarized in Table 3.4 below.

12.      Results of the financial analysis indicate that productive water supply investments exhibit a
great financial viability and effectiveness as exemplified by: (i) the resulting high IRR (30%) which
is 2.5 times the 12 percent opportunity cost of capital; and (ii) the very positive NPV (US$36,111,000)
and the associated high benefit-cost ratio (7.0 > 1). Water supply investments’ higher financial
performance is mostly explained by their potential to generate revenue through a well-established
rising block tariff structure and the reliability of the private water utility (Côte d’Ivoire Water
Distribution Company, SODECI in charge of urban water services management. SODECI has
excellent performance indicators, both on technical issues (good water quality, low leakage) and on
financial issues, with 90% billing and collection rates, strong investment capacity, and sustained good
maintenance policy of water infrastructure including those put in place under this project.

13.     The project’s urban sanitation investments also appear to be financially viable as illustrated
by the associated IRR of 25 percent, which is twice the cost of capital, the positive NPV of
US$8,297,000, and the benefit-cost ratio above 1. The B/C ratio reveals that direct benefits being
generated by urban sewerage investments outweigh the related costs. The analysis indicates, on the
other hand, that roads rehabilitation activities are financially efficient when judged as stand-alone
investments with a positive NPV of about US$2,409,000 and an IRR of 19 percent. The relatively
low financial efficiency of roads infrastructure as compared to project water supply and sanitation
investments, is explained by a 25 percent increase in roads maintenance costs projected from 2014
by the Government Road Transport Authority Agency and which is caused by an important traffic
diversion toward new roads constructed under the project. Finally at the time of the ICR, results of
the cost-benefit analysis show that the solid waste investments are not financially viable as
demonstrated by the related IRR of 10 percent, less than the 12 percent opportunity cost of capital,
the negative NPV of about US$2,289,000, and the benefit-cost ratio below 1. However, solid waste
investments prove very cost-effective, as exemplified by the substantial 43 percent reduction in waste
collection and treatment costs in the District of Abidjan, from US$46 million per year in 2007/2008
to US$26 million in 2013. Likewise, solid waste activities implemented under the project have
contributed to a 46 percent reduction in street sweeping costs in the District of Abidjan, from US$10
million in 2007/2008 to about US$5.4 million per year in 2014. It is anticipated that if this good
performance in terms of cost-effectiveness is sustained, project solid waste management investments
would become also financially viable.

14.    Results of the Economic Analysis: The economic analysis aims at authenticating the
economic justification of the overall operation at the level of the country, through the computation of
three main indicators: Project Economic Rate of Return (ERR), Net Present Value (NPV) and the
Cost/Benefit ratio (B/C). The analysis captures both direct and indirect costs and benefits (including
income generation for people involved in road construction and rehabilitation works, solid waste

collection and street sweeping) and converts financial prices in economic costs through shadow
pricing aimed at eliminating the effects of government interventions and market distortions.
Depreciation charges, expected changes in the general price and direct transfers such as taxes, direct
subsidies, and credit transactions including loans, principal repayment, and interest payments are thus
excluded from the cost-benefit analysis. Results of the project overall economic viability as measured
through NPV and ERR over a period of 25 years at a 12 percent discount rate are given in the table
below.

Annex Table 3.5: Results of the Economic Analysis

  Overall Project Economic Viability          26%              25,262,000                 2.3

15.     The three economic performance indicators confirm the overall project economic viability
and macro-economic justification. The analysis also indicates that the project has created
approximately 13,000 new jobs (12,000 in construction works and 1,000 in the solid waste subsector
between 2008-2013), demonstrating the project’s strong contribution to social reinforcement of many
families living in its intervention areas. Most of these jobs are expected to sustain, notably not only
because of the necessity of an adequate and sustainable maintenance of infrastructure constructed
under this project, but also because of the potential of this latter to induce similar follow investments
by the government, private sector and other partners to development.

Sensitivity Analysis

16.    An analysis was conducted to test the sensitivity of the above estimated project financial and
economic indicators to a combined 10 percent increase in variable costs and 20 percent reduction of
expected benefits. Results of this analysis are summarized on table 3.6 and 3.7 below.

 Financial Efficiency

17.     The sensitivity analysis reveals that if such situation were to occur, the project overall
financial efficiency would significantly decline. Project overall internal rate of return (IRR) would
decrease from 23 to 14 percent and the associated NPV from US$44,528,000 to US$8,510,000 (39%
and 80% respectively). Under such a scenario, road investments would become financially
unattractive while the sustainability of solid waste services and Williamsville rehabilitated transfer
station would require either substantial subsidies from the Government or a great increase of waste
removal fee paid by households. On the other hand, this analysis shows that for the country’s
economy as a whole, the project would remain viable under this hypothesis, as exemplified by its
anticipated 16 percent ERR above the opportunity cost of capital and a positive NPV estimated at
US$10,756,000. This analysis uses actuals for the years 2008-2013 so these figures are not subject to
the hypothetical increases/decreases in costs and/or benefits.

population living in neighborhoods receiving drinking water component in Abidjan, and a light
survey on impacts and perception of the rehabilitation of roads and solid waste management activities.

Drinking water
2.      A survey of 3,867 people living in the North-West area of Abidjan was conducted in June
2012 after finalization of the urban water supply component. The survey showed that enhancement
of the water supply network and construction of individual connections resulted in a significant
increase in the population receiving large amount of water from SODECI. Prior to this project, 56%
of households were already connected to the water supply network but did not really benefit due to
tap water scarcity. The other 44% of households were not connected to the water supply network
because of the excessive costs of subscription, lack of distribution network near to their homes and
subscription issues with their technical operator. After project implementation, the rate of
subscription rose by 22 percent, to 78 percent of households. In parallel, purchased water supplies,
e.g., in the neighborhood, outside the neighborhood, or in the courtyard, have decreased from 41
percent of households before the project to 18 percent, representing a drop of 23 percent.

3.     In general, the survey results show improved water distribution in the concerned localities.
Nearly all households receive water every day. Over 60 percent of the households highlighted
improvements in the supply of drinking water over the past year.

4.      Improvements in the drinking water supply system have led to positive changes and reduced
inconvenience in households. Indeed, according to the survey, 14 percent of the population is in better
health and 2 percent have better hygiene. Furthermore, 2 percent of the commercial activities related
to drinking water result from network improvement works. Moreover, women and school-aged girls
in these communities no longer need to rise early or go after school to look for water.

5.     During the survey, the population was called upon to voice its opinion on the project regarding
drinking water supply. One observes that, globally, about 96 percent of households are very satisfied
with works carried out on the water supply network, against four percent of partially satisfied
households. Such partial satisfaction of a portion of the households is justified by the fact that they
receive water intermittently and at different times during the day.

6.      The survey also focused on satisfaction with the roads component. In total, 200 questionnaires
were sent out to the population, traders from eligible areas, and carriers operating in the areas, to
provide a pre- and post-project evaluation. The survey considered five major road works, three in the
municipality of Cocody and two in Abobo. In Cocody, the subject roads serve M’Badon and M’Pouto
villages, as well as the section connecting Mahou high school with the road to the zoo. In Abobo,
access roads to Akeikoi and PK18-N’dotré villages were surveyed. Overall, all respondents expressed
their enthusiasm regarding roads asphalting, agreeing that circulation is now flowing smoothly. Such
roads are currently the main traffic arteries of served and surrounding neighborhoods, which reduced
time spent by users on the roads. Through this project, Akéikoi, M’Badon, and M’Pouto villages are
now served by public transport (SOTRA, mini-buses and local cabs, etc.). Populations express their
satisfaction and reveal that the road asphalting opened up their area. However, accidents, once rare,


                                                  34
are now more frequent due to speeding. Nearly 50 percent of respondents highlighted a higher risk of
accidents due to bad driving and traffic violations from drivers.

7.      Carriers are also satisfied with the paved roads, which enable fluid traffic movement and allow
drivers to drive without having to worry about frequent breakdowns resulting from rough road
conditions (e.g., shock absorbers and dials), as was the case before the works.

8.      Traders surveyed are satisfied with the asphalting works. Asphalting led to creation of new
businesses on newly paved road sections. On each new section, traders emphasize the creation of over
ten new businesses due to the good condition of the road and easier supply. Goods deliveries by
wholesalers to traders’ shops and stores constitute additional new satisfaction. In the recent past,
wholesalers refused to go to these neighborhoods. Regarding the impact on the activity, nearly 65
percent of respondents claim to experience improvement in their revenue, compared to 30 percent
reporting a drop in revenue due to the proliferation of businesses and greater competition.

9.     Uncontrolled increase of rental and land costs in areas served by these roads result from
improvement of roads and has inflated the cost of living for the local populations. Over 60 percent of
respondents highlight rent inflation as a result of the road asphalting. The rise in housing rents is more
modest than for stores, where costs have been increasing more sharply.

10.     Other concerns of the beneficiary populations vary depending on the neighborhoods. They
relate to the need for public lighting along some asphalted roads to improve safety and to project
maintenance, in particular improper use of gutters along roads by neighboring populations. Residents
discharge waste waters and household waste in these gutters, generating unpleasant odors and
blockage. As a result, rain water is not correctly evacuated, backs up, and generates pollution. In the
served areas, the populations hope the Abidjan Transport Company (SOTRA) will create new bus
lines as well as traffic lights in order to help control drivers’ speed. The latter concern was taking into
consideration by the Renaissance Emergency Infrastructure Project in Côte d’Ivoire (PRICI).

Solid waste management
11.    A part of the light survey concerned household waste collection in Akouédo village and in the
neighborhoods within municipalities such as Abobo, Cocody and Marcory. The achievements of the
solid waste component have met with mixed reactions by the population surveyed. Akouédo villagers
claim that they do not see any improvement regarding waste collection, due to the proximity of the
garbage station. However, villagers surveyed were unanimous in their belief that the expansion of the
primary school and health center has positive impacts. They argue that the new buildings have enabled
increased school enrollment rates of village children and offer a better work environment for teachers,
as compared to the past.

12.     These claims are borne out by the principal of the new school built with this project. The new
school welcomed 503 pupils for the year 2013-2014, and the total number of students increased from
1,100 to 1,700. Similarly, the pass rate went up from 50-60 percent before the project to 60-75 percent
after the project.

13.    Regarding the health center, its extension and provision of health care on which the population
depends, were greatly appreciated. However, nearly 50 percent of surveyed deplore its partial
functioning due to the lack of security in the area.



                                                    35
14.     In the municipalities of Abobo (Belleville, Dokui, Anador, Habitat), Cocody (Angré,
Palmeraie, Riviera 3) and Marcory (Champroux, Sicogi), all surveyed agree that household waste
collection has improved. The frequency of collection has increased but varies with the neighborhoods
and the situation regarding the main roads. Daily collection is carried out along major roads and in
some sectors. However, in other sectors, frequency varies from one to four collections by week. Such
collection is carried out by packers or trucks along the main roads. Collection is effectuated by pre-
collectors within neighborhoods subject to the payment of costs ranging from 1,000 FCFA to 7,000
FCFA per month, depending on the neighborhoods.

Introduction

1.      The present summary of the project completion report of the Emergency Urban
Infrastructure Project (PUIUR) contains the principal elements of the full report, with focus
on relevance, results, analytical aspects and lessons learned.

2.      The Initial Financing (IF) was approved on June 12, 2008 for SDR 57.1 million
(US$94 million) and declared effective on September 9, 2008. An Additional Financing
(AF) of SDR 33.1 million (US$50 million) was approved on June 17, 2010 and declared
effective on October 10, 2010.

Project Objectives
3.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the IF was to increase access to and
improve quality of urban infrastructure and services in the country’s two largest cities,
Abidjan and Bouaké. With the approval of the AF, certain secondary cities were included,
especially in the Center-North-West (CNW) region. The higher-level objective was to
support the government’s efforts to demonstrate visible and tangible improvements in the
lives of its citizens, a critical step for sustaining social and political stability and economic
recovery in the country.

Relevance of objectives at appraisal and closing
4.      The PUIUR aimed at supporting the government's efforts to deal with the crisis that
had divided the country in two in 2002, disorganized the administration, and led to decline
in the level of services, especially in Abidjan and in the CNW region. It was also one of
the key elements of reengagement of the World Bank in Côte d'Ivoire. Indeed, the exodus
to the cities in search of greater security and economic opportunities had resulted in
overcrowding and acceleration of urban poverty.

5.      The lack of maintenance of existing infrastructure and absence of new investments
resulted in a lower quality and level of access to services. In Abidjan, the situation had
caused a decline in water services to the point of service interruption in some
neighborhoods. Lack of maintenance and renewal of sewage facilities had resulted in the
continued discharge of sewage (from approximately 600,000 people) in the Abidjan lagoon.
In the solid waste sector, the collection rate declined from 75 percent in 1989 to 46 percent
in 2008 due to lack of payment of private operators, the instability of the institutional
framework, and the inefficiency of the collection system. The Abidjan roads were
deteriorating due to lack of regular maintenance; 60 percent of the roads were degraded
and critical areas routinely flooded during the rainy season.

6.       The inclusion of these four areas in the PUIUR was therefore fully justified and
activities were consistent with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which focused on: (a)
reducing the deficit of water production and extending water service in unserved areas
(shantytowns); (b) reducing discharges in the Abidjan lagoon and improving sewerage
connection rate; (c) restoring the household waste collection and treatment system in
Abidjan; and (d) rehabilitating roads to improve urban mobility, with the direct objective


                                               39
of supporting economic growth. Component 5, municipal contracts, was included in the
project to lay the foundations of local governance by strengthening the capacity of local
governments to revitalize municipal functions, widely re-assigned to the State during the
crisis. PUIUR activities were also developed to comply with the pillars of the Interim
Strategy of the World Bank.

7.      Apart from the initial program, the PUIUR has received many requests by the
Government to resolve urgent urban problems including floods of the Indénié intersection,
daily collection of solid waste beyond the period foreseen in the project, repairs to roads
and structures destroyed during inclement weather in June 2010, repairs to drainage and
sanitation, filling potholes, etc. Parts of these expenses were supported from the AF and
supplemented by an additional contribution by the Government.

8.      The objectives and project indicators remain highly relevant at closing. The
National Development Plan (NDP) adopted in 2012 retained the sectors covered by the
PUIUR as key elements of the national development strategy. With the support of PUIUR,
access to clean water reached a level of 78 percent in 2013, against a target of 82.5 percent
in 2015. The project has helped to improve household access to sanitation service, to
project a target of 81 percent access in 2015, compared to the baseline of 57 percent in
2008. The PUIUR also helped to make the solid waste management system participatory,
transparent and efficient (NDP objective) by improving the collection rate from 46 percent
in 2008 to 75 percent in 2014 and establishing participatory management of the sector. In
the transport sector, the project supported the NDP target to resurface at least 1,100
kilometers of roads annually. Thus, even though the sector indicators have improved,
investing in the sectors covered by the PUIUR remains relevant.

9.      The vision of the President of the Republic to give a new impetus to local
development in the fight against regional disparities fits perfectly with the preparation of
municipal contracts in 10 cities, undertaken by the project. The Government is seeking to
continue this initiative in view of the interest shown by the municipalities and constituents
for the implementation of municipal contracts.

10.    It is thus clear that there is strong correlation between the PUIUR objectives and
government policies, which is all the more evident when considering that the PUIUR
served to facilitate additional government investment in project areas from its own
resources in the amount of FCFA 19 billion.

Design, Project Components, and Implementation

Preparation
11.     The project was prepared in five months, based on the Operational Policy 8.00
procedures for rapid response to crises and emergencies. Project activities focused on key
sectors in five components, namely: (a) Urban Water Supply (US$28.0 million); (b)
Sanitation (US$15.2 million); (c) Solid Waste Management (US$12.0 million); (d) Urban
Roads (US$28.0 million); (e) Municipal Contracts (US$7.0 million); and (f) Management


                                             40
Fees and Contingencies (UD$3.8 million - of which US$2.0 million for management and
US$1.8 million for contingencies).

Project Effectiveness and Initial Implementation

12.    The Procedures Manual was prepared in June 2008, before the signing of the
financing agreement on July 25. The Environmental and Social Management Framework
and Resettlement Policy Framework were published December 30, 2008 (before
disbursements).

Component 1 – Water
13.     This component was designed to increase the coverage and improve the availability
and quality of drinking water services. The outdated nature of feasibility studies used for
appraisal made the launch of activities difficult, since studies needed to be updated prior to
the development of detailed designs. Additional studies were conducted to reduce the
distances between people and water supply points. Of the 61 water standpipes constructed,
38 initially had no water supply, pending the completion of the "zone Niangon" water
production facility. In the interim, to avoid demobilization of trained standpipe managers,
it was agreed to pay a minimum monthly income of FCFA 25,000 per standpipe, paid from
the Water Fund, until the completion of work (June 2013).

Component 2 – Sanitation
14.     The objective of this component was to improve access to the sewer system and
limit the discharge of raw sewage into the lagoon of Abidjan. Activities included the
rehabilitation and construction of pumping stations by SODECI, also responsible for
connecting households. These works were to complement those funded by the European
Union (13 pumping stations, ocean outfall and Port-Bouët loading tower), but insufficiency
of funding from the EU, together with resistance of residents, prevented the tower from
being finalized and operationalizing the outfall. The Government initiated studies on an
alternative technical solution acceptable to the residents and sought and obtained funding
from AFD for the rehabilitation of the tower.

Component 3 – Solid Waste Management
15.      This component was designed to improve the collection and disposal of solid waste
from households in the city of Abidjan, and thus contribute to the protection of public
health and the environment. Activities started by the Clean City program, which was
initially conducted from March to June 2009, included activities to improve the living
conditions of the local population in the vicinity of the Akouédo landfill. The program was
extended to December 2009 to prevent the reconstitution of illegal dumps, and again until
December 2010 with governmental funding to sustain the achievements of the project
pending finalization of a strategic study of solid waste management in the District of
Abidjan (PPIAF funding).




                                             41
Component 4 – Roads
16.     The objective of this component was to assist the government in improving urban
mobility and restore access to public transport by improving the road network. The choice
of the treated roads was made from the compilation by the Road Management and
Maintenance Agency (AGEROUTE) and requests for intervention from transport operators,
local communities and populations. The activities began with the updating of existing
studies and development of bidding documents, with start-up of works in early 2009.

Component 5 – Municipal Contracts
17.     The objective of this component was to methodically address urban problems in the
medium- and long-term and revitalize certain municipal functions reassigned to the central
government during the crisis. A linked objective was to include urban residents more in
priority-setting. The component focused on the towns of Port-Bouët, Yopougon, Kumasi,
and Adjamé Abobo (Abidjan) and Divo, Daloa, Korhogo, Bouaké and San Pedro
(secondary cities). These cities were selected to complement the planning activities funded
previously by the EU. The main activities were: (a) urban sector review (January 2010);
(b) seminar on municipal contracts (May 2010); (c) finalization of urban, organizational
and financial audits and municipal contracts for two pilot municipalities, Yopougon and
Korhogo (July 2010).

Additional Financing and Mid-Term Review
18.      The global economic crisis of 2008-2009 also had an impact on the economy of
Côte d'Ivoire, which requested an Additional Financing (AF) from the World Bank, partly
through the Crisis Response Window and still using the simplified procedures of
Operational Policy 8.00. After five months of preparation, an AF of US$50 million was
approved on June 17, 2010 and declared effective on October 10, 2010. The good
performance of the Initial Financing (IF) (with disbursement level above forecasts) helped
justify the AF.

19.    The AF activities were focused on four components plus management cost: (a)
Urban Water Supply (US$11.4 million); (b) Sanitation (US$11.4 million); (c) Solid Waste
Management (US$6.7 million); (d) Urban Roads (US$18.1 million); and (e) Management
Fees (US$2.4 million). The municipal contracts component had been slow to start, and did
not receive additional funding. The scope of the project was expanded to include other
secondary cities, especially in the CNW region.

20.     The mid-term review was held in October 2010, as foreseen when the IF was
approved. At this time 93 percent of IF funds were committed and 64 percent disbursed,
and the project was on track to close by the foreseen date (September 2012). The mid-term
review recommended launching studies in all sectors (on top of the ongoing solid waste
study) to have a sound basis for programming investments.

Component 1 – Water
21.    For the AF, the component objective was modified to take into account the
increased water production capacity in Korhogo and secondary cities (Assinie, Attiguéi,


                                            42
Mayo, and Tinhou). The component activities were completed without noteworthy
incidents.

Component 2 – Sanitation
22.    The objective of this component did not change for the AF, but special emphasis
was placed on rehabilitation of the degraded environmental conditions of the Abidjan
lagoon (dredging and cleaning of parts of the lagoon). Activities continued with the launch
of awareness campaigns and technical and environmental studies for works in the lagoon.
This activity was ultimately not implemented because the work on the upstream watershed
(ADB financing) took more time than expected. The component also faced reluctance of
households to pay sanitation connection fees; this was resolved by agreeing that the PUIUR
pay materials and the Government pay the cost of work to minimize the cost to households.

Component 3 – Solid Waste Management
23.     The overall objective of this component did not change for the AF, which was to
fund 25 waste transfer and sorting centers. The Clean City program was extended to
December 2010 (government funding). The number of transfer centers was reduced from
25 to three first because of the scarcity of sites meeting design criteria and then due to the
availability of suitable sites identified. In addition, the Williamsville transfer center,
scheduled for rehabilitation on PUIUR IF, was allocated to the construction of a bus station.
An alternative solution was proposed to replace the transfer centers by 100 underground
containers, which was ultimately rejected pending more detailed studies. The three transfer
centers were removed from PUIUR to be financed by government funds and are nearing
completion.

Component 4 – Roads
24.    The overall objective of the component did not change, but additional activities
were included for Abidjan and secondary cities. At the time of the MTR, the activities of
the road component were running well except the Riviera 2 junction, which had been
considerably delayed due to finalization and implementation of safeguard instruments,
network relocation, and changing the design of the main structure to allow the execution
of works under traffic.

Component 5 – Municipal Contracts
25.     Component implementation was slow because of the 2010 elections and the post-
election crisis. After finalizing the pilot audits, as the framework for the monitoring of
contracts and the new local authorities were not yet in place, it was decided to postpone
updating these audits and to carry out those of other cities only towards the end of the
project, to coincide programming of investment activities with the installation of new
municipal authorities. A scoping report was prepared in March 2012, followed by pilot
audit updates and preparation of municipal contracts for other secondary cities (December
2013).




                                             43
Project Closing
26.      Project closing, originally scheduled for September 15, 2012, was extended initially
to September 15, 2013, following the approval of the AF. A second extension was granted,
pushing the date to March 31, 2014, to recover six months of suspension of Bank-funded
activities due to the post-election crisis in 2011. At the end of the project, the IF and AF
have been 100 percent disbursed. Almost all investments are put into operation. At the
Riviera 2 junction, the underpass was inaugurated on March 29, 2014 and the ramps on
September 30, 2014. Construction of three transfer centers is being funded by the
Government. Reduction of discharges into the lagoon will be effective after the
commissioning of the Port-Bouët tower on October 30, 2014.

Project Achievements and Impacts

Achievement of PDO
27.     The project has achieved the PDO. All the PDO indicators have been reached or
exceeded, demonstrating satisfactory contribution of the four major components to the
achievement of the PDO. The total number of beneficiaries was exceeded, with a total of
over 5 million project beneficiaries of (52 percent women) against a target of 4 million
beneficiaries. Contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals has been
substantial in the areas of drinking water and sanitation and more generally in improving
the living conditions of the population.

28.     In the targeted urban areas, the project helped to expand access and improve the
quality of drinking water to 2.6 million people, well above the component target of 1.3
million. This result was made possible by: (a) increasing the production capacity of
drinking water by 77,800 m3/day and the average period of drinking water supply from
16 to 20 hours/day in beneficiary neighborhoods of Abidjan; (b) the construction of over
400 kilometers of networks; (c) the connection of more than 35,500 new households (of
which 35,000 were subsidized for poor households); and (d) the rehabilitation or
construction of 103 standpipes in poor neighborhoods and connection of 38 schools to the
water network. The PUIUR contributed not only to increasing the level of access, but also
to improving the quality of service for large parts of the population, which were connected
to the grid before the project, but who enjoyed a very poor quality (irregular access or low
pressure).

29.     Health conditions have improved through access to improved urban sanitation for
over 600,000 people (including 200,000 additional persons and 400,000 people getting
better quality of service) due to (a) the rehabilitation and construction of 23 sewage
pumping stations, and (b) the construction of 21,000 sewer connections and 4.7 kilometers
of drainage systems, with buffer basins to reduce flooding at the Indénié intersection.
Before the project, in most beneficiary neighborhoods, the sewer system was not working
(reflux of wastewater into bathrooms and sewage overflowing into the street). As for the
water component, project activities have helped to raise the level of access, but also to
improve the quality of access for large parts of the population.




                                             44
30.     Solid waste collection has been improved for about 4.5 million people in Abidjan,
including around 1.5 million who did not have regular collection before the project. The
collection rate reached approximately 75 percent against a target of 80 percent. The project
has placed particular emphasis on monitoring by independent consultants, local monitoring
committees and a platform for regular dialogue with all stakeholders in the sector. The
performance obtained is also due to the creation of collection points in inaccessible areas,
better organization of the pre-collection, and establishing payment per ton instead of the
flat rates used previously. The results could have been more significant with the
construction of transfer centers and the rehabilitation of the Williamsville transfer center.

31.     Collection and landfilling of 1.4 million tons of waste during the Clean City
program (of which 560,000 tons were collected under the initial operation for a target of
500,000 tons) and removal of 341 illegal dumps of 343 identified contributed to averting
serious health risks following the floods of June 2010. Sweeping and cleaning of drainage
structures, interrupted in 2007, resumed all over Abidjan, ensuring longer service life of
roads and drainage infrastructure. The solid waste component also contributed to the
improvement of education service for the villagers in Akouédo, where the construction of
school facilities contributed to increasing the pass rate in the local school from about 50-
60 percent before the project to 60-75 percent after the project and increasing the number
of students from 1,100 to 1,700.

32.     More than 400,000 additional people have access to the all-season roads and better
transit services due to: (a) rehabilitation and construction of 230 kilometers of roads in
Abidjan, Bouaké, Man, and Agboville; (b) construction of 183 kilometers of drainage
infrastructure; (c) construction of a bridge to connect zones 7 and 9 in Cocody and making
these accessible to significant amount of traffic generated there; and (d) construction of the
Riviera 2 junction. Mobility and road safety have also been improved as the result of the
rehabilitation of road marking and installation of signs on 157 kilometers of main roads in
Abidjan and the construction of a footbridge to link the neighborhoods of Williamsville
and Bracodi, facilitating the crossing of the northern motorway.

33.      For Component 5, the decentralization financing review of the 2000-2010 period
showed that only three percent of the national budget is allocated to local developments.
As a result, the Government has decided to increase the minimum annual grants to
municipalities from FCFA 28 million to FCFA 100 million, which is a substantial
contribution to the financial viability of municipalities. Conducting audits in 10 cities has
led to the identification of a priority investment program of about FCFA 30 billion. This
initiative confirms the Government’s willingness to use a contractual formula to better plan
and coordinate public investment in major cities and regions of the country. It also creates
conditions for capacity building of local authorities – particularly in terms of investment
planning, maintenance of infrastructure, improvement of financial resources, operation,
and especially the involvement and participation of the population. Initial improvements
have been noted in governance in some municipalities, especially with regard to budget
allocations for investment and strengthening municipal technical services and the staff
recruitment process.



                                             45
Achievement of higher-level objective
34.     The project’s higher-level objective, supported by the PDOs, was to support
governmental efforts to demonstrate visible and tangible improvements in the lives of its
citizens, a critical step for sustaining social and political stability and economic recovery
in the country. In terms of economic activity, the PUIUR has injected more than FCFA 80
billion into the national economy and more than FCFA 50 billion were paid to nearly 100
small and medium enterprises, with creation of 12,000 temporary jobs in construction for
local unskilled labor. An approximate total of 69,600 people benefited from this injection
of capital by improving the household budget. The PUIUR was also a lever for the
Government to continue to invest in infrastructure during the crisis.

35.     The most urgent challenge facing the Ivorian Government is reinforcing security,
particularly in the West. Decentralization is presented in the NDP as a way to increase the
involvement of people and reduce regional disparities. The PUIUR has helped advance this
NDP goal by demonstrating the usefulness of the process of urban, financial and
organizational audits, by bringing local youth, women, and the media into to consultations
and bolstering accountability by local elected officials and revere the trend of weak
accountability of local elected officials towards the local constituents.

36.     The satisfaction surveys demonstrate the revival of economic activity. The access
to water has facilitated the introduction of new economic activity for 2 percent of
households in the beneficiary districts. Most traders along the roads rehabilitated by the
project confirm an increase in revenues, goods delivery is easier and new businesses have
appeared.

37.      The macro-economic performance of Côte d’Ivoire is impressive with economic
growth of 8.7 percent in 2013 and the socio-political situation is stable. Thus, even if the
counter-factual situation is not known with respect to the higher-level objective (i.e. the
imagined situation without PUIUR activities) and that the current economic and social
stability in the country may not be entirely attributed to the PUIUR, it is clear however that
the PUIUR contributed to maintaining this stability, particularly if one accepts that
improvements in the lives of citizens is an essential step towards this goal.

Beneficiary Satisfaction
38.     Several surveys were conducted during the implementation of the PUIUR. These
include an investigation of the impact and satisfaction of the population in the areas
benefiting from the Water Component in Abidjan and a “light” evaluation of impact and
perception of road rehabilitation activities and solid waste management.

Component 1 – Water
39.     With regard to drinking water, the main conclusion of the survey conducted in June
2012, with 3,867 people representative of the project area, is that the household connection
rate has increased to 78 percent after the project, against 56 percent before - or an increase



                                             46
of 22 percent. It is found that overall around 96 percent of households are satisfied with
the work done on the water network.

Component 3 – Solid Waste Management
40.     Part of the evaluation concerned waste collection in the Akouédo village and the
Abobo, Cocody, and Marcory neighborhoods. Akouédo villagers have not felt an
improvement in garbage collection. However, all respondents in the village are unanimous
about the positive impacts of the expansion of the village primary school and health center.
In the other parts of Abidjan surveyed, all respondents report that the waste collection has
improved.

Component 4 – Roads
41.     Overall, all 200 respondents express their satisfaction with the roads rehabilitation.
All users report that traffic is now more fluid, resulting from the opening up of previously
isolated areas, with resulting time savings, improved service by public transport, and
reduction of vehicle breakdowns. However, accidents that were previously rare are now
more frequent due to higher vehicle speeds and rents have increased, especially for
storekeepers. The latter are satisfied with the works and stress the creation of more than a
dozen new businesses along each rehabilitated road because of the good road conditions
and the ease of supply; wholesalers now supply their shops directly, which was not the case
before. Nearly 65 percent of respondents claim to have increased revenues against 30
percent who say they suffer a decline in revenue. They explain the declined revenue by the
increased number of shops and resulting competition.

Economic Analysis
42.     The completion of the Riviera 2 junction allows over 75,000 vehicles per day to
achieve time savings of over 30 minutes each. The road component has reduced the time
and cost of travel of the population by over 60 percent at the Cocody Zone 7 and 9 bridge
and the port road. Road works have also enabled the SOTRA to reduce operating expenses
by about 80 percent and create new transport routes to serve new neighborhoods.
According to surveys, all transport operators confirm a decrease in travel time on the
various road sections of the project and reduced passenger waiting time, although this
aspect has not been quantified.

43.     More than half of transport operators surveyed say fuel savings amount to FCFA
1,000 to FCFA 7,000 per day; for others there is no significant change because their new
strategy is to often run empty in search of customers. However, some operators have seen
their profits fall (e.g. on the M'Badon road: revenue of FCFA 30,000 before rehabilitation
against FCFA 15,000 currently), which is explained by a rapid increase in vehicles on these
roads. For example, on the Akeikoi road, the number of vehicles has increased from ten to
over sixty on the line according to the head of the transport operators.

44.    The solid waste collection system set in place generally performs well, especially
in terms of cost-effectiveness. Indeed, the cost of service for collection and treatment of
household waste from the District of Abidjan was about US$46 million per year between


                                             47
2007 and 2008, for a collection rate of around 46 percent. With the arrangements put in
place by the project, these costs were reduced to US$26 million and US$5.4 million per
year, respectively, for solid waste collection and street sweeping in 2013. It can be
concluded that the cost of collection per ton has decreased substantially with a near
doubling of the number of tons of waste collected at half the cost to the Government
(without taking into account the fees paid by households).

Project Management
45.     Project management was built on three pillars: (a) the Monitoring and Steering
Committee (MSC); (b) the coordination unit; and (c) the technical services of the ministries
involved in the project. Meetings of the MSC, composed of agencies representing sectoral
ministries involved in the project, were held quarterly to validate the annual work program
and activity reports. A coordination unit was established from national and
multidisciplinary expertise housed within the MACOM and a convention signed with the
Government through the Ministry of Economic Infrastructures. The various activity reports
were provided on time and recommendations implemented from adopted action plans.

46.     The coordination unit relied on sector agencies to implement project activities
(Component 1: Department of Human Hydraulics (DHH) - replaced by the National
Potable Water Agency (ONEP) after the institutional reform of the sector in June 2009;
Component 2: Department of Sanitation and Drainage (DAD); Component 3: National
Urban Sanitation Agency (ANASUR); and Component 4: Road Management and
Maintenance Agency (AGEROUTE)). Component 5 was implemented in collaboration
with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry responsible for cities. To overcome the
difficulties encountered by these agencies, the designated focal points were trained in the
procedures for awarding and monitoring of contracts, and on project financing.

Procurement
47.    The procurement team in the coordination unit has effectively led the process of
procurement in accordance with the financing agreement. The procurement plan has been
updated as necessary. A total of three post-procurement reviews were carried out during
project implementation. They have not revealed any cases of non-compliance with
procedures or cases of fraud or corruption. A total of 191 contracts were signed for a total
amount of FCFA 68,329 billion. Additional non-contractual engagements of FCFA 286
million were paid for project management expenses.

Financial Management
48.    In accordance with the Procedures Manual, the coordination unit issued 23 financial
monitoring reports on time, the content and form of which was satisfactory to the World
Bank. The project accounts have been subject to financial audit for all years (2008-2013)
in accordance with the financing agreement. Audit reports have been made available on
time. The audit report on the financial year 2012 included a qualified audit opinion due to
non-compliance with the principle of intangibility of opening balances, caused mainly by
the non-maintenance of the accounting software contract during the period of crisis. The




                                            48
audit report for the year 2013 has certified the project accounts. The conduct of the closing
audit is expected before the end of 2014.

Environmental and Social Safeguards
49.    The ESMF and RPF were prepared and published in the country and the Public
Information Center on December 30 2008. The Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment (ESIA), ESMPs and RAPs were developed, validated and implemented as
appropriate. An environmental and social review mission recruited in 2012 confirmed
compliance with project safeguard instruments.

50.     Unforeseen impacts to local residents occurred during the rehabilitation of the
M’Badon road (restrictions on access to shops) and construction of the Cocody zone 7-9
bridge (for damage to third parties during the opening of a site access road). For these cases
the coordination unit has ensured that Project-Affected Persons (PAPs) were duly
compensated. A total of 629 PAPs have been compensated to the amount of FCFA
857,568,478 for a total of 639 PAPs identified. It remains to reimburse the salaries of 10
store employees affected by the Riviera 2 constructions due to technical unemployment,
for whom salaries were pre-financed by employers, who have however failed to produce
documentary evidence of this pre-financing to justify their refund.

Monitoring and Evaluation
51.     The implementing agencies were in charge of collecting information at the sectoral
level, with data consolidation by the coordination unit. Monitoring and evaluation
experienced some weaknesses early in the project, mainly due to the absence of some data
(such as the rate of collection of solid waste) and lack of knowledge of managing for results
by agencies. These weaknesses were gradually corrected.

52.     Changes to the results framework in conjunction with approval of the AF were
appropriate to incorporate expected additional activities and to better capture the results of
all components. However, some modifications and adjustments of value and wording of
the indicators during negotiations have not been properly reflected in the project documents,
which led to inconsistencies between the main text and annexes, and to changing
interpretations of indicators. However, these problems have not substantially impacted the
monitoring of project results. The Results Framework can be found in the full report, with
analysis of the achievement of expected results for each indicator.

53.     Results data were actively used. When there was a risk of not achieving the
objectives, the sector Minister addressed the Cabinet to draw attention to actions to
overcome difficulties. These include the governmental efforts made to find a more
acceptable solution to rehabilitate the Port-Bouët tower and getting households to connect
to the new sewer system built by the project. Also, the satisfactory performance of PUIUR
and demonstrated absorption capacity prompted the Government to request the AF from
the World Bank.




                                             49
Risk to PDO and Sustainability of Results
54.      At project closing it is recommended to work towards better identification of needs,
for efficient investments planning in the infrastructure sector and to mobilize resources for
their financing. It will be necessary to carry out more strategic studies in the various sectors
of urban infrastructure (in addition to the solid waste management study), to identify the
real needs and plan investments on a reliable and analytical basis. It is also recommended
to increase communication and awareness-raising for the sustainability of investments.

Component 1 – Water
55.     The functioning of standpipes remains threatened by water theft and vandalism.
The Government has initiated a program to professionalize the standpipe managers and for
the moment it is recommended to provide subsidized connections for low-income
beneficiaries in the project areas. The operation of other equipment financed by the project
is assured by SODECI in accordance with the governmental management contract.

56.     There is recurrent flooding of water wells (wells predating the PUIUR) during the
rainy season. This is due to demographic pressure on the environment of water catchment
areas. The PUIUR conducted diagnostic studies to protect catchment areas, but pending
completion of the works, and even if no wells funded by the PUIUR were flooded, the risk
to the proper functioning of the water system is real. The diagnostic studies on the water
network in Abidjan, Bouaké and Korhogo have been finalized and the results approved.

Component 2 – Sanitation
57.     The PUIUR activities are complementary to those funded by other donors and their
operationalization depended in part on the implementation of PUIUR activities. To sustain
the gains of the PUIUR, the Government currently enjoys the support of development
partners. The audit of the SODECI management contract made recommendations on
strengthening the institutional framework, control (particularly of environmental issues),
involvement of municipalities and improvement of the financing of the sector. The audit
also recommended better planning of maintenance and operations by including a detailed
annex to the management contract. The recommendations have been adopted and
monitoring the implementation entrusted to the Office national d’Assainissement et de
Drainage (ONAD), created to mobilize resources, and finance and monitor the maintenance
of the works. A total of 105 sanitation committees are operational in Abidjan to ensure the
continuity of awareness of local populations.

Component 3 – Solid Waste Management
58.     The system implemented is operational. The construction of three transfer centers
is underway. The strategic solid waste management study presents proposals for the future
of the sector, including the establishment of an integrated management comprising all of
the collection chain: pre-collection, collection, transfer, transport and disposal. Under this
approach, actions are underway to recruit an operator, who will also be responsible for the
construction of transfer centers. The not-yet organized pre-collectors are being formalized
to further increase the efficiency of the sector. Financial viability depends on an adjustment
to the current fee for the collection of garbage, set at 2.5 FCFA/kWh. The current


                                              50
government subsidy is very high, about FCFA 12 billion per year, while the levy on
electricity bills yields FCFA 3 billion per year.

Component 4 – Roads
59.     To sustain the results of the road component, investments have been included as
assets of AGEROUTE, which has a team in charge of repairing potholes and maintaining
drainage infrastructure. The Road Fund has raised FCFA 130 billion; part of the funds
should be allocated to maintenance of the roads of Abidjan and other PUIUR cities. Some
roads are toll-roads and the Government will introduce tolls on other roads in the future to
secure funding for road maintenance.

Component 5 – Municipal Contracts
60.     The establishment of municipal contracts will contribute to better management and
maintenance of cities’ infrastructure assets. The Government plans to set up an agency to
manage municipal contracts, to support and complement governmental investments made
in cities. The success of this approach has inspired other mayors to prepare for audits.
However the lack of funding for the quick implementation of investments may demobilize
the people who have placed hope in these projects. It is expected that in the coming months,
the World Bank will provide the green light to launch preparation of a project to take over
after the PUIUR, which will promote the municipal contract approach.

Evaluation of Performance

The Government
61.     The Ivorian Government was fully involved in project implementation and has met
the commitments of the financing agreement and ensured consistency of project
interventions with government policies. The design of the President's Emergency Plan,
based on the PUIUR setup, also testifies to this. The Government has also managed to
optimize results by providing parallel financing (not expected at the time of evaluation),
especially for road components and solid waste management, and is fully committed to the
sustainability of the project. The Government could have ensured greater involvement of
stakeholders concerning the waste sector (strategic review, assigning the Williamsville
transfer station to a bus station). The Government has taken some time to decide on the
management contract with SODECI to properly analyze the options.

The Project Coordination Unit
62.     The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has played a pivotal role in the overall
management of the project, and was able to effectively compensate for some shortcomings
of the implementing agencies. The unit has managed risks, as delays in procurement were
gradually reduced to a minimum and financial management strengthened through a
computerized accounting system and improved internal control system. All work financed
by the project were fully implemented and accepted before the end of the project.




                                            51
Implementing Agencies
63.      At the outset of the project, the implementing agencies generally struggled to fulfill
their role in the absence of staff incentives, which resulted in delays in the processing of
activities. Following the appointment of project focal points, collaboration improved. The
implementing agencies have been able to reinforce their ability to plan, schedule, and
monitor investments.

Companies and Works Supervisors
64.    Companies have generally had great difficulty in meeting deadlines and works
supervisors have struggled to get companies to comply with their contractual obligations.
The coordination unit could have been stricter in the application of penalties for delay, but
did not hesitate to terminate the contracts of two companies that proved incapable of
meeting the terms of their contracts.

The World Bank
65.     The supervision and control of the World Bank project team was conducted in
collaboration with the Ivorian Government’s agencies. Twelve missions were carried out,
including the mid-term review, with more intense supervision activities at the beginning of
the project in order to strengthen the capacity of the coordination unit and other
stakeholders. Meetings were held with the Task Team Leader, based in Abidjan, whenever
the need presented itself. The positive collaboration with the World Bank team has helped
to significantly reduce the time to process some reviews and non-objections. The three
Task Team Leaders have not always had the same understanding of the project, and the
consequences are most visible in relation to the results framework.

Lessons Learned
66.     The design and implementation of the project in a context of crisis, with summary
and outdated technical studies and financially weak companies, led the project to introduce
a target of 21-day payment maximum and adjusted contract maximums to FCFA 1 billion.
Beyond this level, the local companies did not have the ability to execute works.

67.     The project was a lever for improving sectoral monitoring and evaluation. To
overcome a lack of basic statistics and M&E capacity in implementing agencies, future
operations should place more emphasis on field surveys (including to establish baseline),
real-time monitoring and evaluation, clarification of institutional aspects and quality
control of data.

68.    To improve the integration of standpipes, their installation should be accompanied
by campaigns for awareness-raising and against water rackets, coupled with continued
improvement of the financial situation of standpipe managers (e.g. through pricing policy
and the construction of kiosks) and use of managers that are well-established in the
beneficiary neighborhoods.

69.    For Component 2, subsidies have demonstrated that there is a need for sewer
connections but the real cost is too high for the potential beneficiaries. Deferring payment


                                              52
of connections over several years and requiring connection to sewers when households are
connected to the water supply could encourage more households to connect.

70.     The municipal contract approach was effective in facilitating collaboration between
people and their elected officials and encouraging local officials to improve municipal and
urban management. Access of municipalities to this new type of contract will allow them
to capture the support needed to underpin this process and to clarify governmental
obligations vis-à-vis the municipalities.

71.     The project has prompted sector experts from different agencies to work together,
which is a gain for the Ivorian administration. Intra-and inter-sector coordination must be
further strengthened to maximize efficiency and impacts of investments.

Conclusion

72.     The project was a positive experience for the Government. Based on the evidence
presented, it can be concluded that the project has achieved its objectives and that these
objectives remain valid for the country's policies to reduce poverty and improve the living
conditions of citizens. One can also note that the PUIUR has been implemented efficiently.
The Government is integrating results and lessons learned from PUIUR into current and
future policy and priorities.
