"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Emergency Urban Infrastructure\n            Project in Cote d'Ivoire received a highly satisfactory\n            outcome with substantial risk to development outcome. Both\n            the Bank and the Borrower\u0092s performance was satisfactory.\n            The Project Development Objective was changed to capture the\n            expanded project scope to include additional cities so as to\n            support the general development of the country. The revised\n            PDO was to increase access and improve the quality of urban\n            infrastructure facilities and services in Abidjan, Bouake,\n            and other selected cities. The achievement of this objective\n            would support the Governmetn of Cote d'Ivoire\n            (GoCI's) efforts to demonstrate concrete improvements\n            in the lives of its citizens, a critical step for sustaining\n            social and political stability in the country. This revised\n            PDO was part of the first restructuring of this project\n            which also included an extension of the closing date by one\n            year. The second restructuring of the project extended the\n            closing date another six months for a total of 18 months due\n            to the suspension during the post-election crisis.\n            Additional financing was awarded to components one through\n            four. The purposes for each are as follows: Component 1: (i)\n            the protection of ground water resources of the North Zone\n            in Adjame and Nord Riviera in Cocody, and establishment of a\n            network for ground water monitoring in Bonoua; (ii) the\n            reinforcement of water supply in Abidjan through\n            construction of boreholes in Anyama and extension of water\n            distribution facilities; (iii) reinforcement and\n            rehabilitation of water production and distribution\n            facilities in Bouake and other selected cities, and power\n            supply improvement to the water production facilities in\n            Bouake; and (iv) implementation of a program to increase\n            water supply in selected cities. Component 2: The Additional\n            Financing would support treatment of more wastewater and\n            contribute to restoration of the deteriorated environmental\n            condition of the Abidjan lagoon and low-lying areas of the\n            hydrological basin of Gourou. Particular focus will be given\n            to water drainage under the Indenie and Cocody bays, which\n            constitutes a serious health hazard for the population\n            around the Gourou basin. Component 3: The funds would be\n            used for (i) improvement of the solid waste collection\n            infrastructure, including rehabilitation, construction and\n            equipment of grouping and triage centers, and (ii)\n            improvement of working conditions of waste workers. The\n            Additional Funds would finance works in the rehabilitation\n            of mass transit routes in Abidjan and other selected cities,\n            including rehabilitation of dilapidated road segments and\n            construction of urban roads and bridges. Around Abidjan, the\n            works would contribute to restoring more reliable public\n            transportation services in the seriously disadvantaged\n            municipalities of Abobo, Yopougon, and Cocody that were no\n            longer served by public transportation due to road\n            degradation. The following lessons were learned: (1)\n            Emergency Projects benefit from simple implementation\n            arrangements and having the Task Team Leader (TTL)\n            in-country. (2) Keeping cities clean requires continuous\n            efforts and not just a single campaign. (3) Keep citizens\n            engaged in further municipal reforms and the on-going\n            decentralization program. (4) Conduct field surveys to\n            establish baseline data and to raise the monitoring and\n            evaluation capacity in the country. (5) Improving the\n            management and benefits of standpipes. (6) Addressing the\n            high costs of sewerage connections. (7) Strengthen\n            cooperation among government staff."}, "docdt": "2015-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
