        1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative):
1.1     Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance):

       Context. Although Mali has achieved notable progress in the health status of the population, its
       health indicators remain among the worst in Africa, characterized by a heavy burden of disease
       and inadequate systems for delivery of services. Three Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
       conducted in 1995-96, 2001, and 2006 provide comparable information at various stages of
       program preparation and implementation.

       A 10-year national health and social development strategy (PDDSS) was formulated for the period
       1998-2007 and a medium term development program (or PRODESS I) was prepared for the first
       phase 1998-2002. The resulting strategy and program were fully consistent with the 1998 CAS
       objectives in the health sector, which aimed at: (i) improving access to quality health care and (ii)
       reducing the population growth rate to a level commensurate with GDP growth. Formally adopted
       by the Government in 1998, the PDDSS and PRODESS I constitute the essential reference
       documents for external contributions and private sector participation.

       In the IDA financed Health Sector Development Program (HSDP), IDA is a lender of last resort:
       (i) financing both investment and recurrent expenditure gaps in the overall financing plan; and (ii)
       complementing resources pledged by other donors.

       Rationale. In opting for a Sector Investment Credit, IDA recognized the need to: (i) continue to
       promote Government's leadership role and its capacity for donor coordination; (ii) consolidate the
       achievements of the two previous IDA operations by confronting a range of critical issues not
       sufficiently addressed; and (iii) ensure full support for high priority program areas. Adopted as a
       SIC, the project nevertheless comprised elements to support a future SWAP.

        1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and key indicators
        (as approved):

       The overall development objective is to improve the health outcome of the population, with a focus
       on meeting the health needs of the underserved segments of the population, as well as accelerating
       the country's demographic transition toward slower population growth. The PDO will be achieved
       through a program of sector wide activities aimed at:

       · expanding access to sustainable quality health care, including reproductive health and nutrition
           services;
       · strengthening the institutional capacity for health system management; and
       · developing sustainable financing schemes for health sector development with safety nets for the
           poor.

       The following key indicators for development outcome/impact by 2003 were identified in the PAD:




                                              1

      · increased health facilities utilization rates, from 0.3 to 0.5 visit per year per inhabitant and per
          facility;1
      · reduced infant mortality rate, from 123 to 90 per 1000 live births;
      · reduced under-five mortality rate, from 131 to 86 per 100000 live births; and
      · reduced total fertility rate from 6.7 to 5.8 per women of reproductive age.



       1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
       Indicators, and reasons/justification:

      Though the overly ambitious PDOs were frequently noted, and there was an apparent consensus
      among all stakeholders concerning the need to revise the indicators (including after the MTR),
      modifications were never formally done.
      · In mid 2002 when the Implementation Status Report (ISR) #9 initially changed the PDO rating
          from S to U and the project was flagged as a problem project, the TT was advised to organize a
          Quality Enhancement Review (QER) prior to the Mid Term Review (MTR);
      · In November 2002 following the MTR, a reverse supervision mission proposed to modify four
          key performance indicators based on: (i) the results of EDSM-III (of 2001), (ii) the objectives
          of the Country's Poverty Reduction Strategy, (iii) the MDGs, (iv) the closing date of the credit,
          and (v) existing sector constraints. There is no indication that subsequent steps were taken to
          amend the DCA to reflect this decision; and
      · In November 2003, the PDO ratings were again changed from S to U and remained either U or
          MU through December 2006. Subsequent ISRs (#12 and #13) cited the overambitious targets
          but indicated the difficulties of changing them at such a late stage and suggested other measures
          (ESW, procurement assistance, etc.) to remedy the problems.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "the primary target group" identified in the
PAD and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations
expected to benefit from the project):

      Women and children, who are often the main users of PHC and first level referral facilities, and the
      poor and underserved segments of the population were to benefit most from improved availability
      and quality of services. Benefits included: improved health status of women and children, reduced
      reproductive health risks for adolescents, reduced incidence of endemic disease and related
      disabilities, and reduced fertility.



       1.5     Original Components (as approved):



1Though Section A.1 and Annex A of the PAD list utilization rates as PDO's, Annex 1A
and the DCA (as well as the ICR format) more properly list it as a health service
indicator.



                                              2

As indicated in the Section C.1 of the PAD, the original project components comprised: (i)
expanding access to affordable quality preventive, social, and curative services; (ii) strengthening
the health system management capabilities; and (iii) exploring and developing sustainable
financing schemes for the health sector. As presented in Annex 2 of the PAD, the components
were as follows:

· Component 1 ($20.8 million): Expanding access to affordable quality preventive and curative
    services;
· Component 2 ($18.0 million): Strengthening the health system management capabilities and
    implementation of health reforms; and
· Component 3 ($1.2 million): Developing sustainable financing schemes for health sector
    development with safety nets for the poor.

However, it should be noted that the Schedule 2 of the DCA describes the parts of the program as
follows: Part A: Access to health care and social services; Part B: Improvement to the quality,
efficiency and effectiveness of health care and social services; and Part C: Strengthening
institutional capacity, and that there is no reference in the DCA to sustainable financing schemes.

 1.6     Revised Components:

No formal revision of components was ever proposed. It should be noted that, though intended to
support PRODESS I (1998-2002/2004) and PRODESS II (2005-2009), the project's components
never entirely coincided with those of either phase. As indicated in the comparison below, the
project comprised three components over the entire period 1998-2006, while HSDP I (1998-2002
but valid through 2004) comprised five components and HSDP II (2005-2009) comprised twelve
components:

            HSDP                            PRODESS I                          PRODESS II

    (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and
    funding allocations):

   Implementation arrangements. At the inception of the project, the Ministries of Health and Social
   Development comprised a single Ministry. In 2004, the Ministry of Social Development was
   established as a separate line ministry. Though certain functions were subsequently carried out
   separately by each ministry, the MOH/DAF remained responsible for overall procurement and
   financial management for the two ministries, but the MSD was never entirely satisfied with this
   arrangement.

   Schedule. Given the very low disbursement rate during the initial 2+ years of implementation, a
   first request to extend the original closing date (from June 30, 2004 to December 31, 2005) was
   granted on December 24, 2003. A second request to extend the closing date (from December 31,
   2005 to December 31, 2006) was granted on August 29, 2005.

   Financing.    Counterpart funding requirements were cancelled in August 2005, based on the
   arguments that: (a) the project was prepared as a SWAP and the other partners were providing their
   funds without any counterpart requirements; and (b) IDA's contribution constituted 18%, while the
   Government was already financing about 70% of the total program budget.


2.  Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    2.1      Project Preparation, Design Stage, and Quality at Entry
    (including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks
    and their mitigation identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as
    applicable):

   Soundness of the background analysis. The background analysis was deficient in two major
   respects. First, the PAD cites neither the experiences of previous projects (IDA-financed or other)
   nor the evidence of any preparatory studies as the basis for addressing the issues related to system
   performance and sector reform. In particular, as pointed out by the Mid-Term Review, the PAD
   does not effectively address the effects of: (i) poverty on health service utilization; (ii) geographical
   expansion on the quality of health service delivery; and (iii) urban and rural disparities on health
   outputs and outcomes. In addition, it virtually ignores the difficulties (based on past efforts) of
   improving the management of human resources and strengthening the pharmaceutical sub-sector.

   Second, the PAD's analysis of the institutional arrangements and administrative capabilities
   required to implement the project was insufficient for addressing the complexities of the proposed
   roles: (i) within the Ministry (particularly the roles of DAF and CPS, which is not even mentioned
   in the implementation arrangements in Annex 2 of the PAD); (ii) between ministries (with little
   mention of the importance for successful program implementation of the ministries responsible for
   finance, civil service, and decentralization); and (iii) at different levels, with no real consideration
   of the implications for health of the existing legislation for the transfer of certain health
   responsibilities to local communities under decentralization.

   Further, lessons learned, cited in the PAD, were not effectively incorporated into the final design.



                                          4

Consequently, these lessons (involving the linkages between quality improvements and increased
utilization, the need for increased coherence among donors in implementation procedures, the need
to sustain political commitment to address broad issues, and the difficulties of retaining staff at
community levels) remain as key issues for which solutions are still being sought.

Assessment of the project design. In lieu of detailed analysis, the preparation served to generate
support among partners for basic principles and summary arrangements to be determined at a later
date. Project preparation benefited from: (i) the Government's commitment to and leadership of the
strategic planning process, (ii) the appropriation of the SIP implementation framework by the
Ministry, (iii) the active participation of all key stakeholders (communities, NGOs, the private-for-
profit sector and professional associations); and (iv) the collaboration of health sector partners.
The importance of the Bank's active participation in the conception of PRODESS and its
commitment to fund the resulting program were cited as absolutely crucial by both the Government
and the sector partners.

The resulting PAD: (i) overestimated the potential benefits (a) to be derived from the project by
MOH, its partners, and the implementing units (through better coordination and planning and
streamlined implementation arrangements) and (b) for the intended target populations (through
improved service delivery); and (ii) underestimated the complexity of the arrangements needed to
coordinate annual program financing from more than 25 sources to an average of some 80 different
implementing units nationwide.

Finally, contrary to the PAD's assertion of project readiness for implementation: (i) nine significant
documents were mentioned in the PAD to be discussed at negotiations, of which most were
insufficiently prepared drafts; and (ii) a number of conditions for effectiveness took longer than
anticipated. As a result, there were initial delays between Board approval (December 1998) and
effectiveness (July 1999); and subsequent delays between effectiveness and real implementation,
since disbursements for the 18 month period ending in December 2000 totaled approximately $1.6
million (or 5% of the credit).

Assessment of risks. With respect to the program output/PDO risks, the PAD neither stated the
risks with precision nor proposed appropriate minimization measures. With respect to the program
components/outputs risks, the PAD: (i) ignored several critical risks (e.g., human resources and
drug availability), (ii) systematically underestimated others (e.g., government capacity and demand
generation); and (iii) proposed only general principles rather than practical measures for
minimizing these risks. No overall risk rating for the project is presented in the PAD.

No quality at entry assessment was carried out.

 2.2     Implementation
 (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk
 status, and actions taken, as applicable):

The early stages of project implementation were characterized by problems resulting from attempts
to fulfill conditions for credit effectiveness, including the adoption of significant institutional
changes for the Ministry and delays in the approval of the Project Implementation Manual (which



                                        5

was not approved until July 25, 1998).

Project implementation was characterized throughout by problems (well-described in the mid-term
review) resulting from the mechanics of HSDP management within the overall program approach,
and particularly: (i) the numerous steps and resulting delays in the approval of the annual plan and
budget for some 80 implementing units at all levels; (ii) the inability of CEPRIS and DAF to
organize the various procurement procedures in a coordinated and expeditious manner; (iii) the
difficulties of mobilizing financing from multiple sources, transferring funds to the various levels
and units, and justifying expenditures in a timely manner; and (iv) the production and aggregation
of information in the periodic reports.

While the mid-term review provided a useful summary of the experience and issues involved in
implementing the program (PRODESS), its conclusions and recommendations were less relevant
for and do not seem to have had any particular impact on the subsequent implementation of the
project (HSDP).

In August 2002, the project was categorized as a problem project and measures were introduced to
accelerate the procurement process. However, these were not sufficient to make up for the initial
delays and the project had to be extended.

 2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
 Utilization:

M&E design. Design of the M&E system was weak, as evidenced by:

· the large number of poorly defined indicators among the 55 process and 24 results indicators
    identified by PRODESS I (1998-2002), most of which were not reported on systematically
    during program implementation;
· the large number of poorly defined indicators among 11 program output indicators, and 34
    process indicators identified in Annex 1 of the PAD, most of which were not drawn from the
    PRODESS I indicators and were not reported on systematically during implementation; and
· the availability of the performance indicator data, given that the PDO indicators require DHS-
    type surveys, the health service indicators must be based on a quality HMIS, and the financial
    indicators must be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance.

Given the project's particular emphasis on human resources, hospital reform, and nutrition, it is odd
that none merited a performance indicator in Annex 1A.

M&E implementation. From 1999-2004, the ISRs do not present a systematic monitoring of the
key performance indicators, with only occasional, partial results, often undated (or incorrectly
dated), un-sourced, and without comment; from 2005 to project closing, the ISRs attempted to
collect missing data on these indicators from previous years to establish a more complete picture of
progress.

M&E utilization.      Though joint Ministry/Partner/Stakeholder supervision missions have been
conducted annually from 2001, they do not seem to be based on a common set of indicators. The



                                       6

      most complete set of indicators may be found in the regional reports prepared for the annual
      CROCEPS meetings and regional informants indicate that these standardized tables are prepared
      and discussed at these meetings. The results are not systematically aggregated for the sector as a
      whole, and their use in future resource allocations is not known.

       2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
       (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable):

      As initially foreseen, no safeguard issue came up during project implementation.

      Lack of and delay in compliance with fiduciary arrangements and covenants have not really been
      addressed. The project closed with only 18 out of the initial 32 covenants fully complied with, and
      there has been no real improvement in the quality and timeliness of reporting as evidenced by the
      audits.

       2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
       (including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments
       financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements,
       sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation,
       if applicable):

As part of the second phase of PRODESS, Mali sought increased harmonization of procedures
among its partners, and the Bank (together with the Dutch, the Canadians and the Swedes) initiated
a health budget support working group to prepare an MoU to provide health sector financing under
a pooled financing mechanism to complement any ongoing general budget support, such as the EU
budget support. The proposed SIC was seen as a transition phase towards a full-fledged PRSC,
both technically (by helping the Health and Social Development sectors strengthen their
management capacity and cope with the decentralization process), and financially.

Subsequently, this interim phase was abandoned by the Bank in favor of a full-fledged PRSC with
assurances that the health sector would receive the equivalent amount of funding as initially
envisaged by the proposed follow-on operation. This shift to PRSC was not well received by the
MOH and some of the Bank's partners who expressed their fear that: (i) under PRSC, dedicated
amounts for health might not be honored by the Government; (ii) partners that are funding sector
budget support through PRODESS II might not continue in the absence of the Bank; and (iii) full
budget support would require additional strengthening of existing arrangements to ensure timely
availability of resources at decentralized levels and adequate financial and program results
reporting (a strong M&E system will be essential).


3.     Assessment of Outcomes

       3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
       (to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

      The relevance of the project's objectives, design, and implementation modalities is rated high,
      based on their consistency with the country's development priorities and the Bank's corporate goals



                                             7

and sector assistance strategies, as evidenced by:

· the continuing pertinence of: (i) the PDOs and key indicators, especially in view of the
    anticipated final results of the 2006 DHS and the importance accorded to the MDGs; (ii) the
    disease burden addressed; and (iii) the key constraints on improving the quality of services (and
    especially, human resources);
· Government's commitment to: (i) implementing poverty reduction and pro-poor policies; (ii)
    promoting decentralization; and (iii) harmonizing procedures for planning, mobilizing, and
    disbursing health sector resources from all sources; and
· Ministry's capacity to manage program implementation (planning and budgeting, procurement
    and financial management, and monitoring and evaluation).




 3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
 (including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with
 details on outputs in Annex 2):

Preliminary DHS results for 2006 show that achievement of the PDOs has to be rated negligible,
since none of the -very ambitious- impact indicators was achieved:

                                                                 Objectives
                             Indicator           Baseline    PAD      Actual (05)
                     Infant mortality rate         123         60         96
                     Child mortality rate          258        180        191
                     Total fertility rate          6.7        5.8        6.6
                     Maternal mortality rate       577        405      582 est.

Taking other key performance indicators into account, there are a number of positive developments
in both the process indicators and the health service indicators:

· Access to PHC at CSCOM level was expanded considerably (from 34 to 50%) over the period
    1998-2006 (though IDA financed less than 10% of this expansion) and met its targets;
· Immunization rates (DTCP3) for children under 1 year have reached 68%. Prenatal coverage
    has virtually met its target since 2004;
· Utilization rates for curative and antenatal consultations are far from their overly ambitious
    targets but have improved by more than 40%, from 0.18 in 1998 to 0.26 in 2005;
· Prenatal coverage increased from 40% in 1998 to 70.4% in 2006; and
· Medically assisted childbirth increased from 40% in 1998 to 49% in 2006.

In addition, the project contributed a number of important inputs for: (i) strengthening the National
Public Health Laboratory, the National IEC Center, and several regional hospitals; (ii) equipping
57 CSCOM, including access to water; (iii) establishing a regional nurse training school in Kayes;
(iv) financing basic training in Mali and specialist training outside Mali for more than 75 persons;
and (v) conducting studies in health financing (health expenditures, health insurance), the
establishment of referral systems, contracting, etc. Finally, the project spent large amounts on the



                                         8

purchase of mosquito nets and of flour for nutritional purposes.

 3.3     Efficiency
 (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate
 norms, least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return):

Despite cumbersome procedures and project management weaknesses, the project's efficiency is
rated moderate. Lengthy initial delays, slow procurement and disbursement, qualified financial
results, and multiple extensions of the closing date all denote an inefficient project implementation.
But the project succeeded in: (i) financing more than 100 different implementing units (and an
average of some 80 per year between 2001-06) involved in implementing PRODESS; (ii)
increasing the proportion of project resources to the district (cercle) from 6% in 2001 to 26% in
2005; and (iii) increasing the average amount allocated to a district from 3.8 million FCFA to 22.2
million FCFA.

Given the inefficiencies of decentralized spending (particularly using government procedures), the
project made significant progress. The sustained investment in strengthening capacity for health
system management is shown in the following table:

                            2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      Total

         Management        75.5%     87.7%     52.7%     65.5%     82.4%     68.7%      68.7%

The capacity of districts to handle increasing amounts of financial resources is shown in the
following table of average district-level expenditures (through 2005):

                                 2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005

 3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
 (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency):

Rating:     Moderately Unsatisfactory

The overall outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory based on high relevance (i.e., consistency
with the country's development priorities and the Bank's corporate goals and sector assistance
strategies), negligible to low efficacy (i.e., lack of achievement of the impact indicators) and
moderate efficiency (i.e., improved ability to spend greater amounts at more decentralized levels).

 3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above):

 (a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty. The PAD established specific objectives for utilization of services by the poor and for



                                       9

supporting health financing schemes with safety nets for the poor. Based on the Bank's analysis of
socioeconomic differences in HNP in Mali, these objectives were certainly justified. Also, based
on the increases in: (i) the number of CSCOM in the rural areas where most of the poor reside and
(ii) the immunization rates, it can be concluded that coverage for the poor has improved. Progress
on utilization and on financing was marginal at best (particularly on financial accessibility, since
prepayment schemes are still embryonic for virtually the entire population).

Gender. The PAD addressed gender from: (i) a medical perspective with respect to maternal and
reproductive health; and (ii) an empowerment participation perspective with respect to participation
in the community health associations. Important progress has been made on (i) with passage of a
law on reproductive health, adoption of a policy for free caesarian sections, and organization of
referral services in 51 of 55 districts. The rate for assisted deliveries has increased from 31% in
1998 to 53% in 2005. A small study (2001) and the joint annual review (2004) show more limited
progress on (ii). The PAD mentioned female genital mutilation, but there is no indication that it
was addressed by the project. As noted previously, progress on family planning has been slow.

Social Development. Because health and social affairs were combined in a single ministry at the
beginning of PRODESS I, the project provided a possibility of linking them. Unfortunately, the
slow start-up and subsequent split of the ministries in 2004 created friction as well as synergy, but
MSD was especially active on the health financing component (through mutuelles and the
development of an insurance scheme). PRODESS II comprises a health and social development
components, and partners are committed to financing both.

 (b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to
 impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development):

Slow progress and partial successes have been achieved on the agenda announced in the PAD.
Institutional restructuring comprised: creation of a Directorate of Pharmacy, autonomy of the IEC
center, the National Health Laboratory, and the Public Health Research Center. In addition, (i) a
revision of the regulatory framework and organization of the pharmaceutical sub-sector was
proposed in 2003; (ii) studies and proposals for the organization of health financing, through a
national insurance scheme, have been carried out and a regulatory framework is being prepared;
and (iii) recommendations have been proposed for the current regulatory and statutory framework
for Community Health Workers.

Special units were established to oversee institutional development in the areas of: human
resources, hospital reform, nutrition, and decentralization. The hospital unit had distinct success
and has been transformed into a national agency for evaluating hospitals (ANEH). The human
resources unit was disbanded without significant accomplishments and its mandate is currently
being reconsidered in light of a Government-wide focus on human resources. Similarly, the
nutrition unit has had difficulties resulting from a multisectoral nature of its interventions. The
decentralization unit was only recently created, but given the nature of the issues it must address, it
seems more likely to follow the path of HR and nutrition units rather than the hospital unit.

The HIV/AIDS Unit of MOH was transformed into a more focused unit, and its inter-sectoral roles




                                      10

     were given to a new agency (National HIV/AIDS Council, under the Presidency).

     While the expansion of the number (from 347 in 1998 to 753 in 2005) and coverage of the mostly
     private, non- profit, and community based health centers has been a noteworthy achievement, there
     have been institutional problems associated with such growth: (i) inadequate managerial capacity
     of the ASACO members (who may lack education, training, and motivation); (ii) disagreements
     between ASACO leaders and health staff over management of the CSCOM; and (iii) insufficient
     professional authority and supervision over the health staff resulting in unresolved internal
     problems.     Given the accelerating transfer of responsibilities to the local communities, such
     problems are likely to continue.

     On the positive side, donor efforts (including IDA) to promote common concerns among
     community health associations through support for regional and national federations (FERASCOM
     and FENASCOM) and for alternative forms of health financing (UMM) have begun to increase the
     influence which users/beneficiaries of health services can put on both providers and governmental
     authorities to adopt more beneficial policies and practices.

       (c)    Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):



       3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
       Workshops
     (optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
     Rating:      Substantial

The risk that the expected development outcomes will not be realized or maintained is rated as
substantial for three principal reasons:

· While institutional capacity has been strengthened and some procedures have been streamlined,
  institutional arrangements among ministries (especially concerning decentralization and human
  resource management) and implementation arrangements within MOH (particularly with
  respect to the differences among the various partners) remain problematic and in some respects
  have become more complicated as decentralization progresses; as a result expected efficiency
  and effectiveness gains from the program approach may be further delayed;
· Though gains in health status customarily lag behind gains in management capacity, MOH's
  inability to influence certain indicators (e.g., family planning, utilization rates) suggests that: (i)
  it has not adequately appreciated and/or integrated the various determinants of health-seeking
  behavior and health status; and (ii) the current PDOs may be considered over-ambitious for the
  foreseeable future; and
· Sector financing will remain a significant problem for two reasons. First, spending on health
  from internal sources has not kept pace with expected increases: MOH spending, as a portion of




                                            11

   total public spending, has been virtually stable2 while poverty and the slow development of
   alternative financing mechanisms hinder cost recovery.         Second, ongoing dependence on
   external support for an important portion of its funding will continue to encounter difficulties
   both for implementing the budget support approach under PRODESS II and for reconciling the
   differing approaches of its partners on sector financing.



5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
       (relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

       5.1      Bank Performance

       (a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
       (i.e., performance through lending phase):

      Rating:      Unsatisfactory

      Though the PAD reflects a strategically relevant approach, identified a critical set of issues, and
      established a pertinent agenda for policy reform agenda, the project preparation seems to have
      relied more on broad participation in the process than on a detailed analysis of the sector. The
      PAD: (i) overestimated the possibilities for achieving the PDOs; (ii) seriously underestimated the
      complexities of the proposed implementation, fiduciary, and M&E arrangements; and (iii) did not
      adequately assess several potential risks or propose appropriate risk minimization measures.

      Each of these constitutes a major shortcoming in the preparation with repercussions during
      implementation:

      · The difficulties with the PDOs and related key outcome indicators (overly ambitious, internally
          inconsistent, etc.) have previously been mentioned. It is perhaps worth noting that, as late as
          May 2005, the minutes of a QER highlighted the "unrealistic Development Objectives set at the
          beginning of the project" and anticipated "a possible disconnect with the ICR (since) arguments
          can be made against the MU rating of the PDOs and for a MS rating because, inter alia, 10 out
          of 14 output indicators are progressing in the right direction and 3 of those indicators have
          surpassed the project's objectives."
      · The difficulties related to implementation are indicated in part by the project's inability to

    comply with the dated covenants in the DCA with respect to (i) the organization and approval
    of the AWPB; and (ii) the preparation of semi-annual program management reports and annual
    audits. Joint annual reviews were held and reports were submitted but not usually in the time
    frames indicated in the DCA.
· In addition to omitting the overall risk rating, the risk assessment overlooked at least two
    critical risks: (i) the importance of human resources for the increased number of CSCOMs; and
    (ii) the financial access of the poor to PHC. These unaddressed risks certainly contributed to
    the low utilization rates.

Given: (i) the time between identification and negotiations (24 months) and the insufficient quality
of the PAD; (ii) the time between Board approval and effectiveness (8 months); and (iii) the very
low level of disbursements during the first two years, the Bank's performance in lending is rated
unsatisfactory.

 (b)      Quality of Supervision
          (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating:      Moderately Unsatisfactory

Supervision, which was carried out by four different TTL alternately based in Washington and
Bamako, can be separated into three periods:

· July 1999-June 2001, is characterized by a focus on starting project implementation through
    stepped-up supervision. ISRs during this period comprised a number of unsatisfactory ratings
    related to project management and procurement. Disbursements totaled about 7% of the credit;
· July 2001-November 2004, is characterized by the growing disconnect between the mostly
    positive (and often verbatim repetition) evaluations and ratings from the field and management
    concerns about: (i) unsatisfactory achievement of the PDOs in view of the 2001 DHS results;
    (ii) inaccurate ratings of implementation progress and components given the significant
    disbursement lags; and (iii) lack of attention by the TTL to key project management issues (the
    problem project rating begun in August 2002), including qualified audits, organization of the
    MTR, need for a QER, and recruitment of additional supervision support (an architect and a
    procurement specialist). Monitoring of key performance indicators improved, but there is no
    indication that compliance with the DCA was being monitored systematically. Disbursements
    during this period totaled about 49% of the credit;
· December 2004-December 2006 is characterized by: (i) an admission that the PDO would not
    be achieved and could not be changed; (ii) an intensive effort to disburse the remaining amount
    of the credit; and (iii) uncoordinated (with government and partners) change in IDA's proposed
    financing instrument (from a SIM to a PRSC). Specific measures were taken to provide TA, to
    approve new and appropriate activities, and to follow up regularly with high level MOH
    officials. The remainder of the credit (44% of the total) was disbursed during this period.

On balance, the quality of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory, based on unsatisfactory
quality during the initial 5-6 years and satisfactory quality during the last 2 years. It should be
noted that throughout implementation, there were communication problems between the TTLs,
Bank management, government and partners. This communication issue might well be the main



                                       13

    reason why the project was never restructured despite consensus on the inadequacy of the PDOs.

     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

    Rating:        Unsatisfactory

    Based on the Bank's unsatisfactory performance in ensuring quality at entry and its moderately
    unsatisfactory performance in supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated
    unsatisfactory.

     5.2       Borrower Performance
     NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide rating and
     justification only for Overall Borrower Performance.

             Click here if the Government and the Implementation Agency is the same or
             indistinguishable



     (a) Government Performance:

    Rating:        Moderately unsatisfactory

Government's performance varied considerably:

· MOH's ownership of the sector development process, the active involvement of the partners,
  stakeholders, and beneficiaries, and the collective commitment to achieving the development
  objectives constitute significant achievements and a sound basis for future sector development;
· These advantages did not, however, necessarily translate into anticipated policy reforms and an
  improved implementation environment. Slow but significant progress was made on hospital
  reform and to a lesser extent on decentralization, but other institutional changes introduced
  during the project both within MOH and between MOH and other ministries / institutions (to
  strengthen health interventions, the pharmaceutical sub-sector, and health financing were much
  less significant. In particular, HSDP promoted the establishment of the Commission on
  Human Resources (or MARH as a means for addressing the issue of health human resources)
  and the Food Security and Nutrition Division (or DSSAN as a means for addressing the
  intersectoral nature of nutrition), but neither structure proved to be effective.
· While significant progress was made on procedures for planning and monitoring PRODESS,
  other implementation arrangements were far less successful: (i) delays, errors, and the poor
  quality of procurement were noted in the technical audit; (ii) financial management (with
  TOMPRO inadequately used) was weak and the annual audits often late and qualified; (iii)
  compliance with legal covenants was not monitored; and (iv) measures to remedy
  implementation issues often delayed for months;
· Government financing of the health sector did not increase sufficiently over the project period
  and could not adequately address the gap caused by the Project's closure in December 2006;
  this was particularly the case for operating costs which IDA financed increasingly from 2002
  to 2005 (from 32% to 44% of IDA's annual expenditures).

   Rating:

            Implementing Agency                                 Performance



    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

   Rating:      Moderately Unsatisfactory

   Despite success in promoting sector coordination, borrower performance is rated moderately
   unsatisfactory due to: (i) the lack of progress on certain key indicators; (ii) the inability to advance
   adequately the human resource agenda; (iii) the very modest progress in organizing sustainable
   health financing and nutrition interventions; (iv) the deficiencies in project management; and (v)
   the weaknesses in developing responses to the uncertainties surrounding decentralization and the
   future of IDA financing.

6.  Lessons Learned
    (both project-specific and of wide general application)

   First, the moderately unsatisfactory rating of this project is mostly due to the establishment of over-
   ambitious targets. Once again, over-promising proves not to be a good strategy.

   Second, whatever the financial instrument (investment project, program support, or other), there is
   no substitute for conducting the analytical work, which is essential for avoiding major design
   flaws. In this case, the lack of in-depth analytical work might explain why PDOs and many
   intermediate objectives were not discussed realistically.

   Third, though often agreed on in haste, the modalities for entering into and transitioning from
   program arrangements are complex and require careful study:

   · Entering is difficult because program support is inherently complicated, since any procedures
       must take into account arrangements for all potential implementing structures and all sources of
       financing, including those who are in, partly in, or even out. Further, because all participants
       need to see the benefits of the arrangements, there is an inherent tendency to over-promise on
       sector management results as well as health outcomes and impact;
   · Transitioning to different arrangements (from a SIL to a SWAP or a PRSC) is difficult because
       expectations are raised (particularly in IDA's case) for using increasing amounts of untargeted
       funding on current needs, with the consequence that any abrupt cessation of funding is keenly
       felt by the implementing units (in both the amounts and kinds of financing available) and by the
       Ministry and its partners (as a betrayal of the concepts of harmonization and integration).

   Fourth, project preparation must reach fundamental agreement on the determinants of health status;
   otherwise, as the MTR points out, funds are more likely to support activities which are easier to



                                          15

   implement rather than those which are more difficult, but also more strategically important (e.g.,
   human resources) or more broadly linked with improved health status (nutrition, water and
   hygiene, literacy, etc.). Despite joint MOH/Bank findings that low utilization of health services
   was due to inadequate professional skills and poor quality of services, the sector approach seemed
   no more apt to yield solutions than other approaches.

   Fifth, implementation of health sector support is easier when health sector decentralization (or at
   least deconcentration) is ahead of overall administrative decentralization. Once administrative
   decentralization begins to catch up, constraints on health sector management prerogatives become
   more problematic at all levels (community, district, region, and central). Community ownership of
   the CSCOM, debate about the responsibilities for first-referral facilities, and existing hospital
   autonomy at regional and national levels has prompted MOH, which has traditionally led the effort
   to decentralize service delivery, to reflect on the implications of these tendencies for its future role.

HSDP's principal output as lender of last resort was to finance different categories of
expenditures for different implementing units at different levels. By the end of 2006, the
project had disbursed virtually the entire amount of the credit, the amounts (in USD) by
expenditure category and by year are presented in the table below:

       NB. In all tables: (i) results for 1998-2000 are summarized in 2000 when TOMPRO
       became operational; and (ii) results for 2006 lack data from local level implementing units.

In terms of percentages, annual expenditures by category are presented in the following
table and show HSDP's contribution to operating costs of the implementing units:

Over the life of the project, a total of 107 different implementing units benefited from
HSDP financing in at least one year. The annual number of implementing units and the
proportion of funding by level is presented in the following table:

  Level          2000*          2001           2002          2003            2004          2005

Excluding the incomplete results for 2006, almost all of the districts (cercles) benefited
each year from HSDP financing over the last 4-5 years of the project, and the average
amount of expenditures per district rose from $4,000 in 2000 to $42,000 in 2005. Despite
such growth, two-thirds of project expenditures were carried out by central level
structures.

Also, HSDP financed a range of activities in each of the three components described in
the PAD. Project expenditures (in USD) by component and by year are presented in the
table below:

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Mali benefits from a stable and inclusive political environment. It has been a steady
reformer over the past twenty years, albeit a plodding one at times. In response to market-
oriented economic reforms and broad-based political reforms over the last 20 years that
spurred private sector activity and enhanced civil society participation, Mali's real GDP
growth has averaged above 5 percent a year since 1994 when the currency was devalued.
Gross national income per capita (atlas method) increased from US$240 in 1994 to
US$380 in 2005, a 4.0 percent average annual increase, translating into reductions in
poverty and inequality.
Despite the achievements over the past decade and half, Mali faces significant economic
and social challenges. Over 55 percent of Mali's population live below the poverty line,
and Mali's social indicators remain among the lowest in the world--it is ranked 175 out
of 177 countries in the Human Development Index compiled by the United Nations
Development Program. This partly reflects the fact that Mali is a vast landlocked country
with a relatively narrow natural resource and human capital base. But it is also a sign that
funds allocated to the social sectors might not be sufficient and/or are not used
effectively.
As with other low income countries, administrative capacity is also weak. A significant
social, structural and macroeconomic agenda remains for Mali to consolidate the gains of
the past to sustain broad-based growth, further entrench market-oriented forces in the
country, and advance the poverty reduction program.
The economic impact of high mortality and morbidity
High mortality and morbidity rates affect the economic activity in several ways. It leads
to decreases in productivity, increased absenteeism of the economic work force and
students, increased turn-over with its associated costs, and high fertility rates. Also,
increased out-of pocket expenditures for health reduce household's savings. At the same
time there is a high demand for government health services that can lead to reductions in
public revenues. This occurs essentially as the tax base decreases, through the negative
effects of the various diseases on long-run output. Hence, high mortality and morbidity
contribute to the persistence of poverty and put considerable strains on public finances.

Financial Analysis

Total health care expenditures in Mali amount to approximately US$26/person/year in
2005. Most of it, as can be seen in chart i, comes from patient's out of pocket. Health
expenditures structure (see table 1) shows a health sector that has yet to shift to more cost
efficient methods such as immunization, prevention of the most deadly epidemics
(malaria, HIV, TB), prevention of traffic accidents, and promotion of breastfeeding and
nutrition.

The share of the health sector in the government budget went from 6.6 % in 1998 to 7%
in 2006 (but reached 10.65% in 2005). This is much less than initially targeted: 12.1%.
As a result, the external donors and patients are contributing a higher amount to the
financing of the MoH annual plan of action (see table 2).



                                            21

    The logical conclusion is that the project has not contributed to strengthening financial
    sustainability. However, the lack of resources does not seem to be the main challenge
    faced by the health sector in Mali. More serious is the bad allocation of resources among
    providers and activities.

The HSDP thrust was on strengthening and expanding access to basic health care
because, as demonstrated in the WDR 1993 and in Better Health in Africa 1994, the
provision of a minimum package of health services by community-supported and
managed PHC facilities and first-level referral district centers is the least cost method to
achieve universal coverage and sustainable health gains. In addition, the HSDP aimed at
contributing to increase the use of low cost quality essential drugs and at improving both
the efficiency and effectiveness of health services leading to shifts in public health
spending in favor of prevention and primary health care, better targeting of public
subsidies to the poor and substantial savings to households on the amount of funds spent
on drugs.

The public funding of hospitals increased by four fold over this period (and reached
39.78% of the current budget in 2003, up from 31.66% in 1999). In the meantime,
preventive services went from 17.45% in 1999 down to 1.75% in 2003, and PHC from
1.5% in 1999 up to 3.6% in 2003. The objective of reallocating public funding to basic
health care has not been reached within the initial period covered by the project.

Further, the reallocation of public funding benefited mostly the less poor areas
(essentially Bamako) and not the poorest (see table 3), which is highly regressive (the
state contribution per capita has been multiplied by 1.77 -in current FCFA- in the poorest
areas from 1999 to 2004, and by 2.24 in the less poor areas). However, one must note
that the number of community health centers (CSCOM) has increased more in the poorest
areas (from 407 in 2002 to 498 in 2005, or 22%) than in the less poor areas (from 48 in
2002 to 52 in 2005, or 8%), and therefore that the physical coverage in the poorest areas
has significantly increased.

With regard to low-cost quality essential drugs, a target of the project to lower costs and
increase households savings, the results are mixed. If the Government's performance has
been quite good at purchasing drugs on the international market (in 2003 the `Pharmacie
Populaire du Mali' was purchasing drugs at the lowest possible price as compared to
international reference prices), patients did not benefit from these savings drugs were
sold at about 1.83 fold the reference (and not the purchasing) price, according to the 2006
WHO study. Further, the "official" tariff was not enforced, and patients were paying up
to 5 fold the reference price.
In view of what is preceding, one must conclude that progress in cost effectiveness has
been minimal.
