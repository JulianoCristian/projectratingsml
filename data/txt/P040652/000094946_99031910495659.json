outcome of\n            the population, with a focus on meeting the health needs of\n            the underserved segments of the population, as well as\n            accelerating the country's demographic transition\n            toward slower population growth. There are three project\n            components. The first component, expanding access to\n            affordable quality preventive, social, and curative\n            services, will improve coverage for primary health care;\n            improve services in selected secondary and tertiary\n            hospitals; improve overall technical efficiency, increase\n            initial stocks of drugs and medical consumable; and provide\n            support to nongovernmental organizations for health-related\n            activities and action against social exclusion. The second\n            component, strengthening the health system management\n            capabilities, will cover management training; recruitment\n            and redeployment of health personnel; reforms of\n            pharmaceutical sub-sector; logistic support for managerial\n            functions; and support to the Management Information\n            Systems. The third component, exploring and developing\n            sustainable financing schemes for the health sector, will be\n            done through expansion of cooperative cost sharing schemes;\n            policy reforms on benefits; community participation; and\n            cost recovery mechanism."}, "docdt": "1998-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
