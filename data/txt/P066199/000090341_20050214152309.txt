BACKGROUND 
 
The AZREP has been assigned environmental category B since its potential adverse environmental 
impact on human population and environmentally important areas (forests, grasslands) are site 
specific, reversible, and mitigatory measures are designed. The AZREP is not expected to raise 
major environmental issues, and would instead contribute to improved environmental conditions in 
the project  area. This Environmental Assessment provides the framework to address environmental 
considerations of the project activities, including infrastructure of the two national parks and micro-
projects (community and business development) financed under the AZREP. 
 
The overall AZREP project objective is to restore and protect regionally and globally important 
biodiversity areas and sustainable management of the mountain ecosystems, and to introduce and 
pilot an inclusive model of Protected Area management in Azerbaijan. The Project has four  
components
:
·
National Park Establishment and Management
:
creation of a new Shah Dag National 
Park in the Greater Caucasus mountains, expansion of the existing Ordubad National Park in 
the Zangezur mountains of Nakhchivan, starting the process restoring degraded forests and 
pastures, and building national capacity to manage these areas as multi-purpose national 
parks that conserve biodiversity while contributing to local and national economic 
development; 
 
·
Community-level investment in sustainable agriculture and natural resource 
management:
 assisting communities living inside or immediately adjacent to the two 
national parks to shift their agricultural and natural resource use practices towards more 
modern and efficient approaches that place less pressure on natural resources and natural 
ecosystems; 
 
·
Rural enterprise development:
 supporting local entrepreneurs to start up or expand small 
businesses in order to demonstrate possibilities for environmentally friendly commercial 
development in the project areas. Particular emphasis will be placed on encouraging 
investment in rural, cultural and ecotourism and value-added processing of the more 
abundant and resilient natural resources (within a context of sustainable use); 
 
·
Project Management, communication and monitoring and evaluation:
 cross-cutting 
activities such as awareness raising and outreach regarding the project as a whole 
(complementing component-specific outreach) and on-going monitoring of project 
implementation and impacts. This component will also encourage and support cross-sectoral 
coordination in specific activities such as the preparation of a tourism development plan for 
the Shah Dag area (including but extending beyond the park itself) and for project 
implementation as a whole.    
 
The environmental issues that have been identified under the environmental management plan are 
(i) the impact of rehabilitation of the existing administrative buildings located outside the proposed 
boundaries of the national parks, rehabilitation of some roads, construction of  checkpoints and 
Page  6
-6- 
guard stations, trails and tourism interpretation facilities; (ii) the potential increase in recreational 
use of the national parks; (iii) community projects involving minor construction.     
 
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT 
 
A. 
IBRD Safeguards Policy 
The World Bank requires environmental assessment (EA) of projects proposed for Bank financing 
to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus improve decision 
making (OP 4.01, January 1999).   
 
EA is a process whose breadth, depth, and type of analysis depend on the nature, scale, and 
potential environmental impact of the proposed project. EA evaluates a project's potential 
environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence; examines project alternatives; identifies 
ways of improving project selection, siting, planning, design, and implementation by preventing, 
minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive 
impacts; and includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse environmental impacts 
throughout project implementation. The Bank favors preventive measures over mitigatory or 
compensatory measures, whenever feasible. 
 
EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and safety; 
social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property); and 
transboundary and global environmental aspects. It also takes into account the variations in project 
and country conditions; the findings of country environmental studies; national environmental 
action plans; the country's overall policy framework, national legislation, and institutional 
capabilities related to the environment and social aspects; and obligations of the country, pertaining 
to project activities, under relevant international environmental treaties and agreements. The Bank 
does not finance project activities that would contravene such country obligations, as identified 
during the EA.  
 
The coverage and depth of the Environment Assessment (EA) process for AZREP is determined by 
the specific characteristics of the proposed project activities. It is anticipated that AZREP-funded 
national park infrastructure and community micro-projects, as a rule, will not trigger a full-scale 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) process. The EA is an integral part of the process of 
national park infrastructure design and identifying a potential micro-project, and of designing, 
appraising, implementing and evaluating it. 
Key considerations to be taken into account during the EA process include:  
·
Generic initial screening to determine appropriate environmental assessment;  
·
Compliance with existing environmental regulations in Azerbaijan; 
·
Linkages with social assessment; 
·
Analysis of alternatives;  
·
Public participation and consultation with affected people and organizations; and 
Page  7

·
Disclosure of information. 
 
B. 
Azerbaijan Environmental Legislation and Procedures 
 
Activities carried out under the project will conform to current laws in Azerbaijan and sound 
environmental principles. In general, project activities  will not contribute to the degradation of the 
physical and human environment.  
 
Environmental protection in Azerbaijan is governed by the Law on Environment Protection  (1999). 
The Law establishes the main environmental protection principles, and the rights and obligations of 
the State, public associations and citizens regarding environmental protection.  Clause VIII of the 
Law establishes the principles and requirements for the preparation of the State Ecological 
Expertise (SEE). The purpose of SEE lies in formal verification by the state authorities of all the 
submitted developments, regardless of their scale, sector and type of activities, for their possible 
environmental impact. According to the Law (Clause VIII, Article 54), environmental impact 
assessments are subject to the SEE, which means that the Ministry of Ecology is responsible for 
review and approval of EIAs submitted by project developers. The other key document forming the 
legal basis for EIA is the  Handbook on the Process of Environmental Impact Assessment in 
Azerbaijan (1996).  The EIA Handbook introduces the main principles of the ‘western’-type EIA 
process to the country, and details (i) the EIA process, i.e., the sequence of events, roles and 
responsibilities of applicants and Government institutions, charges; (ii) the purpose and scope of the 
EIA document; (iii) public participation I the process; (environmental impact review; and (v0 
environmental review decision. It defines EIA as a process aimed at identification of, evaluation of, 
mitigation of, or avoiding, possible negative impacts of development proposals, but also mentions 
principles of integrated approach of such assessment. It is acknowledged to introduce transparency 
in the process of decision-making through involving the interested public in the discussion of the 
proposed activities and taking the public opinion into account (Paragraph 1.1.) The EIA application 
may be submitted to the head office of the MENR or to a local branch office.  In the process of 
reviewing the EIA application the MENR evaluates the following criteria: 
·
Whether the proposed project envisions new technologies; 
·
The volumes and complexity of the proposed processes or technologies; 
·
The expected environmental consequences; 
·
Whether the proposed project would create significant changes for the local population; and  
·
Public response to the proposal. 
The major drawback of the EIA Handbook to date has been its non-binding nature (this document 
was acknowledged and approved by the former State Committee for Ecology and has never passed 
any formal ratification). Also, no changes have been made so far to the EIA Handbook to reflect the 
administrative changes related to the abolishment of the Stats Committee of Ecology in May 2001 
and establishment of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources. The EIA Handbook still refers 
to the fSCE as the ‘Environmental Authority’ which is one of the main parties to the EIA process in 
Azerbaijan. However, since presently this is the only document providing details of the EIA process 
which are accepted by the MENR, both applicants preparing EIAs and the Ministry of Ecology 
Page  8
-8- 
reviewing and approving EIAs follow the provisions of this document. The EIA steps and 
procedures described by the Handbook are consistent with the World Bank safeguard policies.    
Other laws governing specific issues such as sanitary-epidemiological welfare, land reform, energy, 
health, water, forests, cadastre and land use, industrial and domestic wastes, fauna, fish breeding, 
ecological safety, water supply and wastewater, atmospheric protection and specially protected 
areas have been adopted since 1992.  In addition, a large number (some 75+) of Decisions of the 
Cabinet of Ministers have been issued to help interpret the body of environmental legislation and 
related Presidential Degrees and Orders. 
Protection and preservation of natural areas in Azerbaijan are governed by the Law On Specially 
Protected Areas def
ined as ‘areas for protection of biological variety and ecology’ (Article 1). 
Depending on the purpose of natural areas, eight categories are envisaged by the Law: state natural 
reserves, national parks, natural parks, natural monuments, zoological parks, botanical gardens and 
dendrological parks, and recreational zones. Article 5 of the Law defines the status of all national 
parks as ‘nature protection and research institutions’. By Presidential Decree #532 the Ministry of 
Ecology and Natural Resources is assigned a governing body for all protected areas. In accordance 
with Article 8 of the Law, each protected area has to have a management plan stating that ‘regulated 
procedure of economic activity shall consider restrictions for utilization of natural resources in 
specially protected natural areas and objects and in other specially allotted areas’. This is of 
particular importance in the context of the proposed project which will support preparation of the 
management plans for both national parks. The Law does not provide any specific requirements for 
the SEEs or EIAs to be carried out for any activity in the park area. Any development activity in the 
SDNP and ONP  shall be governed by the Law On Environmental Protection and EIA Handbook.   
C. 
Potential Environmental Impacts of AZREP  activities
 
The AZREP infrastructure improvement and micro-projects may include rural roads, small bridges, 
small irrigation systems and construction of minor buildings.  
Mitigating measures that may be adopted for each impact are detailed in Annex 1 and summarized 
below. However, as the degree and scope of the impacts will vary according to their type and scope, 
the mitigating measures may vary too.  
Construction and General Impacts
.
In general the environmental considerations  will include one or 
more environmental impacts such as health and safety hazards for the construction workers and the 
public; noise; dust – leading to adverse air quality; soil and/or water pollution from fuel and oil, 
waste materials, surface run-off, etc; excavation of materials and disposal of surplus soil/earth and 
other materials, risks to environmentally sensitive areas, flora and fauna, etc.  
NP Infrastructure, 
including NP administrative buildings, visitor centers, guard stations, roadway 
gates, checkpoints, demarcation and marking of park and reserve boundaries, tourism shelters, trails 
and signage.  Impacts associated with the rehabilitation and construction activities will also be 
minor, and apart from any sanitation services provided and the disposal of any other wastes 
Page  9
-9- 
generated, they will also be relatively local. Annex 1 summarize the most typical impacts and 
measures that may be used to mitigate them. 
Rural and Suburban Roads
.
Impacts associated with the rehabilitation and construction of roads 
generally include noise, air quality and other such nuisances, vehicle and pedestrian safety, 
provision of improved drainage and other supporting infrastructure such as retaining walls, etc., and 
changes in drainage and traffic patterns. Annex 1 summarizes the most typical impacts and 
measures that may be used to mitigate them. 
Small Bridges and Footbridges
.
In addition to the effects associated with roads, the impacts 
associated with the rehabilitation and construction of small bridges and footbridges generally center 
on changes to the river regime and the riverbanks and on aquatic habitats and water quality around 
the bridge structures and downstream. Annex 1 summarizes the most typical impacts and measures 
that may be used to mitigate them.  
Small-Scale Irrigation
.
Impacts associated with the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation 
systems will generally be associated with effects on the water resources, water logging of the soil, 
discharge of the wastewater, especially if to a local watercourse, etc. Annex 1 summarizes the most 
typical impacts and measures that may be used to mitigate them. 
Both farming and agro-processing use chemicals that are potentially hazardous to soil and water 
resources. However, in this project use of agro-chemicals is not expected to represent a serious issue 
due to modest scale of the activities and since the mechanism of environmental screening of micro-
projects will not allow for the proposals requiring intensive use of agro-chemicals. The Project 
Implementation manual will provide details for the environmental screening procedure.  
Socio-Economic Impacts
The use of natural resources of the state-owned forests and pastures will be restricted due to the 
creation of the SDNP and expansion of the ONP. Park management planning and zoning to be 
carried out during the first project year will determine fully protected core conservation areas where 
any habitation or economic use is prohibited. However, this will not require any physical 
displacement or relocation, since only zones with no resident human population will be selected as 
core conservation zones. Much of the SDNP forest area will fall into high priority area for improved 
ecological and natural resource management, and thus, will require protection and restoration. Most 
of the pastures will be available for use, with limited number of animals allowed per hectare, and 
shortened grazing season . This pasture management pattern will be introduced gradually, beginning 
with the highest priority area.  
In general, the mitigation measures should relate directly to, or directly replace, the resource that is 
being restricted. For this reason, the emphasis under Component 2 are on: (i) increasing fodder 
production and improving grazing conditions on municipal lands, to replace reduced access to 
grazing in highland pastures, and (ii) re-afforestation of municipal forest lands and Forest Fund 
lands near villages, to compensate for improved enforcement on illegal cutting in the state forest. In 
some cases (e.g., hunting), there may be no acceptable alternative. And in other cases, the affected 
population may wish to undertake a completely unrelated activity which will compensate for lost 
income, although not necessarily for cultural values associated with the activity. Component 3 is 
Page  10
-10- 
aimed at providing assistance for this purpose, for example for activities such as tourism, value-
added processing of wild fruits and nuts, value-added dairy products, high-value wood parquet, 
tourism, handicrafts, production of fuel-efficient stoves, etc.). The emphasis will be on enterprises 
that directly  or indirectly contribute to environmental sustainability and conservation objectives 
and that are decided upon, and managed, by project affected persons. Tourism has been identified as 
a
n
area of particular promise and interests, because it is one economic activity for which these 
mountain areas have a comparative advantage, and because entry barriers for modest rural and eco-
tourism enterprises can be low. 
In accordance with the World Bank safeguard policies (OP 4.12), a Process Framework has been 
prepared. The Process Framework provides a detailed description of the mitigation measures which 
will also be included into the Project Implementation Manual. A full scale Social Assessment will 
be carried out in the first year of the project implementation. The Social Assessment will (i) identify 
potential social impacts; (ii) identify specific social groups requiring assistance under the project; 
(iii)  suggest patterns of delivery of the assistance; (iv) develop framework for social impact 
monitoring and evaluation framework, including M&E indicators. The results of the Social 
Assessment will be used to improve the project design.          
D. 
Environmental Assessment Implementation Steps 
 
The administration of each National Park shall be responsible for obtaining the required 
environmental permit before the construction of any NP infrastructure. Forest and pasture 
inventories and consequent zoning to be carried out in the first year of the project implementation 
shall assist in the determination of the siting of all infrastructure and trails to minimize the impact of 
the construction and associated human activity. The infrastructure will be designed to blend 
harmoniously with the traditional Azerbaijan landscape. Local communities shall be kept informed 
of all construction activities if it is determined that infrastructure will be placed in proximity to 
community settlements.  
 
In the case of community and enterprise projects/activities, Municipal Enterprises and small 
enterprises are to be considered project proponents and, therefore, shall be responsible for obtaining 
required environmental permits. Key steps for the applicants include initial environmental screening 
and assignment of the appropriate EA category, and preparation of relevant EA documents.  The EA 
documents would form part of the initial application package. 
 
Environmental Screening
.
The initial screening would identify potential adverse environmental 
impacts and determine the corresponding level of environmental assessment needed to address 
them.  
 
EA Categories
.
Based on the screening, each project activity would be assigned one of four 
environmental categories: 
 
·
None 
–
no
further environmental assessment. 
 
Page  11
-11- 
·
Environmental Review
(ER) 
–
a
standardized checklist of possible impacts and appropriate 
mitigation measures with minimal expected impact.  The ER may be prepared by activity 
proponent, and would be reviewed by the AZREP PIU assisted by Technical Advisor(s).  A 
generic ER checklist is provided in Annex 3. 
 
·
Limited Environmental Assessment
(LEA) – for activities likely to have some 
environmental impacts and which need to be reviewed by VC Planning team and/or an NP 
administration environmental specialist. A LEA form will be specific to the type of activity, 
and mitigation measures recommended by the environmental specialist would be 
incorporated at the design stage.  Annex 4 provides an example LEA form for a small scale 
irrigation micro-project.  If necessary, the NP environmental specialist would visit the 
proposed activity site to assess baseline conditions and potential site-specific impacts.  
Activities that require a LEA would require monitoring both during construction and 
operation, to ensure that mitigation measures are implemented and that no unforeseen 
negative impacts occur.  Recommended formats for preparing mitigation and monitoring 
plans are found in Annex 5 (A & B). 
 
·
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
–
for activities with significant direct or indirect 
impacts. Examples of projects that would require a full EIA include mainly construction of 
new roads and bridges. A full EIA usually requires a team of experts and some time to 
complete, involving several site visits, development of project-specific mitigation measures, 
and a detailed monitoring and supervision plan. The EIA would be prepared by specialists 
contracted by the AZREP PIU. 
 
The ER, LEA or EIA will be based on the environmental guidelines provided in the Annexes to this 
document, and will identify the potential environmental impacts for the project activities, both 
positive and negative.  
 
As part of the design process, NP administration and the micro-project designers will be required to 
mitigate any negative environmental impacts arising from the project activities and micro-projects, 
and to obtain any necessary legal permits. The documents produced will include preparation of an 
Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) in the format specified in Annex 5. 
AZREP PIU  will be responsible for monitoring the process to ensure that it complies with the 
procedures as set out in this document and Project Implementation Manual (PIM). Technical 
Advisors’ services will be requested as needed. The EMMP will have to be approved by the World 
Bank. The PIM will have provisions on specific roles of the PIU/Technical Advisors and the World 
Bank in the process of EMMP preparation and approval.  
 
Proponents will have to get an agreement of the PIU on identified specific negative environmental 
outcomes/impacts and mitigation measures. Those impacts and mitigation measures will be 
included into the NP Management Plans, contractual documents for infrastructure construction and 
rehabilitation, and contracts to be signed between the PIU and grant recipients under Components 2 
and 3. Te PIU will be responsible for regular monitoring of compliance with these agreements.      
To ensure compliance with procedures and to advise on any further measures required to mitigate 
impacts as much as possible, the World Bank will be supervising consistency of proposed activities 
with approved management plans. The World Bank will also seek assurance that an appropriate 
Page  12
-12- 
assessment of potential environmental and social impacts has been completed and an adequate EMP 
prepared. AZREP PIU staff will facilitate adequate consultations to be provided by MENR to 
responsible parties in environmental assessment, assist in preparation of LEAs, and evaluate 
environmental aspects of proposals, as well as on environmentally complex projects activities. The 
PIM will describe the procedures in detail.
 
E. Institutional 
Arrangements 
 
The AZREP has been assigned environmental category B since its potential adverse environmental 
impact on human population and environmentally important areas (forests, grasslands) are site 
specific, reversible, and mitigatory measures are designed. For a category B project, the Bank 
requires an Environmental Management Plan be prepared and made available for public 
consultations, as outlined in OP/BP/GP 4.01 “Environmental Assessment”.  In addition, general 
approval for the procedures and guidelines for environmental compliance, detailed below, will also 
be sought from the Ministry of Ecology and other concerned authorities prior to project 
effectiveness.  During implementation of AZREP, local MENR officials will evaluate and approve  
of micro-projects. 
 
As in the case of economic, financial, institutional and engineering analysis, EA is a part of project 
preparation and is therefore the project proponent’s responsibility. The actors involved in the EA 
are Administration of two National Parks, Municipal Enterprises assisted by VC Planning teams, 
and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources.  
 
Specifically for project components, the responsibilities for preparation and implementation of 
EMPs/EIAs and impact monitoring will be as follows:  
 
Component 1: National park administrations will carry out initial environmental screening (the 
screening checklist is attached as Annex 2), propose EA category and, if required by the category, 
prepare EMP/EIA. The PIUs, assisted by Technical Advisors, will approve the EA category, 
monitor preparation of EMPs/EIAs, endorse them and facilitate review and approval by the MENR. 
The PIU will ensure that the EMPs/EIAs are in compliance with approved NP management plans.  
 
Component 2: Municipal Enterprises will carry out initial environmental screening and propose EA 
category for each project identified by the VC planning process. MEs will be assisted by VC 
planning teams and/or local PCUs. The PIU will endorse the proposed EA category for each project 
and advise MEs on further steps. If required by the category, MEs will prepare EMPs/EIAs and 
seek PIU’s endorsement. After endorsing, the PIU will facilitate submission EMP/EIA to the 
MENR for review and approval. 
 
Component 3: Small Enterprises will carry out initial environmental screening and propose an  EA 
category. The PCU, assisted by Technical Advisors, will approve the proposed category. If required 
by the category, SE will prepare EMPs/EIAs and submit them as part of the project proposal 
package. The PIU will monitor the preparation of EMP/EIA, facilitate approval by MENR, review 
and select project proposal. 
 
Page  13
-13- 
Full scale EIAs prepared under Components 1, 2 and 3 will require World Ban
k’s prior review and 
endorsement. For all the other EA categories the Bank will carry out post-review.  
 
Component 4 will provide resources to contract Technical Advisors to assist the PIU and PCU in its 
monitoring and supervision functions. While NP administration and project proponents will be 
responsible for the implementation of the EMPs/ EIAs by relevant environmental requirements 
included into contractual documentation, the PIU will carry out regular impact monitoring. The PIU 
will regularly report to the Bank on the status of EMP implementation. The World Bank will review 
the implementation during the project supervision. The PIM will provide detailed description of the 
entire cycle of EMPs/EIAs preparation, implementation and monitoring.

ER = Environmental Review. LEA = Limited Environmental Assessment. EIA = Environmental Assessment Report. 
The suggested EA instruments are only recommendations; special circumstances in a given micro-project may impose use of 
a
stricter instrument, but it probably would never be appropriate to “downgrade” the recommended EA instrument or 
approach.
