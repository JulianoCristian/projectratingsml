A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Country andsector issues

Azerbaijan i s a mountainous country o f 86,600 km2and a population o f about 8 million people.
It lies on the western coast o f the Caspian Sea among the mountain ranges o f the Greater and
Lesser Caucasus and the Talish mountains. Mountains cover about 44% o f the territory, and
forests cover about 11%.

Azerbaijan i s facing many o f the same challenges as other CIS transition economies, including
an agenda o f policy and institutional reforms needed to redefine the role o f the state and create
essential underpinnings o f a market economy.            One o f the six strategic pillars o f the State
Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED) is an enabling
environment for income-generating opportunities. While the overall economy is improving as a
result o f oil development, this is not reflected in the mountain areas, where most people fall
under the poverty line o f US$24 per month (average income is $16 per month invillages above
2000 meters).       With the end o f reliable, highly subsidized gas and electricity following
independence, many rural households have turned to wood fi-om State forests for their energy
needs. This is resulting in rapid deforestation as demand for wood fuel exceeds sustainable
annual fuel wood yields by up to a factor o f ten insome areas.

ENVIRONMENTALMANAGEMENTAND NATUREPROTECTION

Environmental management is recognized as an important right and obligation in the
Constitution o f the Azerbaijan Republic (1995).             The National Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP), completed in 1998, identifies priorities relating to reducing pollution damage fi-om oil
extraction and industry; halting the decline o f sturgeon populations and water quality in the
Caspian Sea; protecting biodiversity and improving the management o f forests, pastures and
agricultural lands; preserving cultural heritage; addressing ecological problems with regional or
global impacts; and improving the institutional and policy fi-amework for environmental
management. The Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) was created in 2001 to
integrate all aspects o f environmental protection and management, including environmental
assessment and monitoring (including reporting on the state o f the environment),                   and
management o f forests and wildlife resources and o f specially protected natural areas'.

A National Strategy and Action Plan on Biodiversity Conservation (NSAPBS), currently under
preparation, stresses the preservation of key ecosystems and natural habitats through a well
managed system of Protected Areas (PA), by enhancing and efficient management o f protected
areas, and sustainable usage of biodiversity to contribute to economic and social objectives.
Currentlythe PA system covers about seven percent o f the count$,                but PASare small and the
system is fragmented and some important ecosystems are not well represented. The Government
o f the Republic of Azerbaijan (GOA) signed the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2001,
and has made a major commitment to protecting biodiversity, including maintaining and

'Therei s an independent Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources inthe Nakhchivan Autonomous
Republic, with similar responsibilities
 Comprised of 38 PAS: 14 Strict Nature Reserves, 20 sanctuaries, 4 national parks

substantially expanding the nation's PA system to include under-represented ecosystems.
Creation o f the Shah Dag National Park (SDNP) and expansion o f the Ordubad National Park
(OW) are among the highest strategic priorities. At the same time, management o f existing PAS
needs to be improved by building institutions, strengthening human resource capacity and
increasing resources, while at the same time addressing issues o f poverty and pressure for
economic development in rural areas. The Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas and
Objects (2000) includes provisions for taking into consideration social and economic factors and
interests o f local people, and for participation o f the population and social organizations in
preserving Protected Areas (PAS).However, the prevailing model for PASin Azerbaijan, as in
much o f the CIS, is based on centrally controlled Strict Nature Reserves (Zap~vedniks~).The
GOA has begunto diversify the national PA system, by creating the country's first six national
parks (NP) in 2003-2005. According to the Azerbaijan law, national parks include zones for
tourism and for other limitedeconomic activities.

NATURALRESOURCEMANAGEMENT

Forests: Almost all natural forest in Azerbaijan i s designated as Forest Fund land. Forest
management capacity i s weak due to lack o f staff training and experience and resources. Since
2003, all forest cutting, for either commercial or sanitary purposes have been suspended by the
MENR, and officially only forest residues are collected and sold. However, it is generally
recognized that large quantities o f standing trees continue to be cut illegally and forest cover
continues to decline. A National Programme on the Rehabilitation and Extension o f Forests
(established on 18 February, 2003) aims to restore 25,000 ha o f existing forest and plant some
44,700 ha o f new forest, mainly inlowland areas. Due to insufficient fimding, only about 3,000
ha o fplantingwere completed in2003.

Meadows and Pastures:               High elevation summer pastures and a large proportion of mid-
elevation winter pastures belong to the State. Some small pasture areas and hayfields belong to,
or are under the management of, local municipalities. Municipalpastures are free for use, while
grazing rights on State pastures are leased by the State Land and Cartography Committee,
together with Rayon Executive Authorities and Ministry o f Agriculture, to individuals or
companies on the basis o f grazing permits, usually with a duration o f 10-15years. While grazing
rights are in principle allotted on the basis o f numbers o f animals, there are no specific legal
provisions in the grazing contracts, and no monitoring on the part o f authorities, to ensure that
the official stocking rates are followed. In the Shah Dag area, it is estimated that the actual
stocking rates are as much as five times higher than the official norm (totaling 2.5 million
animals, as opposed to 500,000).




 The original terms "Zapovednik" and "Zakaznik" are used in this document because there is n o clear consensus on
the appropriate Englishtranslations. Zapovedniks are strict nature reserves where n o economic uses or other
disturbances are permitted. Zakazniks are nature reserves where specified economic and other activities maybe
prohibited or restricted as required to achieve the objectives of protectednature, ecological processes and species.
These prohibitions and restrictions are specified inthe charter of the Zakaznik

BIODIVERSITY SIGNIFICANCE AND THREATS

Azerbaijan's highbiodiversity results from its location at the convergence o f three biogeographic
regions (Europe, Central Asia and Asia Minor).               The Caucasus mountains area4, has been
identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as a Global 200 Ecoregion, and by
Conservation International as one o f the world's 25 biodiversity "hotspots" (the only one inthe
ECA region). It is believed to contain more than twice the animal diversity found in adjacent
regions o f Europe and Asia, and a flora which is notable for its large number o f endemic and
relict species and as one of the world's richest gene banks o f wild relatives o f important
agricultural andmedicinal plants. 4500 of the more than 7,000 plant species o f the Caucasus can
be found in Azerbaijan, and seven percent o f these are endemic to the country. A recently
completed ecosystem profile and five year investment strategy for the Caucasus eco-region5
identified 10 key corridors, five o f which were selected as top priority for conservation action.
The five include the Greater Caucasus (which encompasses the proposed SDNP) and the East
Lesser Caucasus (encompassing the 0").                 Both the SDNP and ONP include elements o f
important transboundary migratory corridors.

In addition to their significance as global, regional and national biodiversity assets, both the
SDNP and ONP project areas represent important economic assets, due to their rich natural
resources and tourism potential. Shah Dag i s Azerbaijan's second highest mountain and serves
as a watershed which provides much o f the water for Baku and the Absheron Peninsula, which i s
home to nearly 30% of the country's population. The proposed expanded ONP contains a large
proportion o f all highelevationpasture inthe Nakchchivan Autonomous Republic.

The Caucasus ecosystem profile identified deforestation, overgrazing and hunting as the three
greatest direct threats to biodiversity. Underlying causes include poverty in rural areas, energy
shortages following the end o f importation o f wood from other countries and decline in
availability o f natural gas supply in the area. Overgrazing o f pastures has become a serious
threat inthe project areas since the late 1 9 8 0 ' ~as~more people took up shepherding or increased
their herds inresponse to growing unemployment anddeclining economic opportunities inother
sectors, and there is clear evidence o f overgrazing at all altitudinal levels (montane, sub-alpine
and alpine). Traditionally, sheep were grazed inalpine meadows inthe summer, with subalpine
meadows reserved for fodder production and used during the winter months. However with
traditional grazing areas in the north Caucasus (Dagestan, Georgia) no longer accessible,
livestock is kept nearer to villages all year round, resulting in overgrazing and degradation o f
fragile subalpine woodland ecosystems.

RELATIONTO GEF OPERATIONALPROGRAMS

Biodiversity conservation is the key focal area for the project. The project addresses GEF
strategic priorities for biodiversity conservation through: (i)     catalyzing sustainability o fprotected
areas, (ii)  mainstreaming biodiversity in production landscapes and sectors, and (iii)              generating

and disseminatingbest practices for addressing current and emergingbiodiversity issues. Project
activities will directly support innovative practical approaches called for by the 7th Conference
o f the Parties (COP-7) o f the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in its Decisions VW1
"Forest Biological Diversity", VW11"Ecosystem Approach", and VW28 "Protected Areas".

The project follows the GEF Strategic Guidelines and incorporates elements o f several
OperationalPrograms:

        No, 3 (Forest Ecosystems): by supporting in-situ protection o f ecologically mature
        temperate forest ecosystems under threat, and combining strict protection and multiple
        use to achieve sustainable forest management. Among other things, it will support the
        first comprehensive forest inventory and status assessment since 1984, makingit possible
        to make soundmanagement decisions.

        No. 4 (Mountain Ecosystems): by supporting in-situconservation and sustainable use o f
        biological resources, expanding and improving connectivity o f the protected area system
        inthe Greater andLesser Caucasusmountains, andcombiningproductive, socioeconomic
        and conservation goals.

        No. 12 (Integrated Ecosystem Management): by emphasizing the creation o f an enabling
        environment for biodiversity conservation, forest and rangeland management, the
        strengthening o f institutional capacities at local, regional and national levels as well as
        investments insustainable natural resource management.

The GEF grant would finance costs o f activities requiredto achieve global conservation benefits,
which would be incremental to the baseline national program undertaken by the Government
with support from the World Bank IDA credit and the PHRD grant (see Annex 15 - Incremental
Cost Analysis).

2. Rationale for Bankinvolvement

The Azerbaijan SPPRED highlights the importance o f environmental management: in a recent
Bank review o f integration o f environment in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Azerbaijan
was ranked 5`h out o f 53 countries worldwide6. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Azerbaijan7 stresses the need to generate jobs and non-oil-based economic growth by improving
the business environment, particularly in smaller urban and rural areas, and includes an
IDNGEF operation to support participatory approaches to sustainable forest, pasture and
protected area (PA) management, and for promoting sub-regional cooperation in the globally
significant ecosystems o f the Caucasus mountains.           The AREP will support CAS goals by
enabling rural communities in the project areas to benefit from improved environmental
management, adopt more profitable and environmentally sustainable livestock production
systems, and initiate income-earning activities relating to natural resource use. The Bank's
support for rural development in Azerbaijan has largely focused on irrigated, arable land in low

elevation areas, rather than the mountains. The AREP targets rural mountain areas, which are
amongthe poorest inthe country.

Inkeeping with the NEAP, the Bank's strategy for assistanceto Azerbaijan inthe environment
sector has two mainpillars: (i)    managing environmental challenges connected with development
o f the oil industry and broader economic development especially in coastal areas; and (ii)
addressing sustainable natural resource management within the context o f rural development and
conservation o fAzerbaijan's key ecosystems. The Azerbaijan Urgent Environmental Investment
Project (AUEIP) and the regional Caspian Environment Program have focused on the first
aspect, and also supported institutional strengthening for environmental management, including
the creation o f the Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR). The AREP will
continue this institutional support by helping MENR develop capacity for forest and pasture
management and for P A management, including adoption o f a participatory, multi-sectoral
approach. This will help the GOA meet national objectives and international commitments. The
AREP would be the first Bank-financed operation to support the NEAP objectives o f improved
pasture and forest management and biodiversity conservation. It offers the opportunity to bring
to Azerbaijan a considerable body o f knowledge and experience from numerous initiatives
relating to protection and management of mountain forest and pasture ecosystems across the
ECA region and elsewhere.

While there i s considerable interest on the part o f Government and within the donor community
to develop rural tourism in the Caucasus region, existing programs involving Azerbaijan are
small (less than $1million) and focus mainly on national policy and strategy, awareness raising,
training, information and capacity building. For successful tourism development, this must be
complimented by on-the-ground investment inpark management and key infrastructure, which
represents a substantial part o f the proposedAREP.

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes

The project will contribute to the restoration, protection and management o f globally significant
mountain forest and alpine meadow ecosystems, including a number of endemic and endangered
species and transboundary migrants. The creation o f the SDNP will greatly increase the area o f
the globally recognized ("hotspot")     Caucasus eco-region under protection. By supporting the
development o f new approaches to PA management inAzerbaijan, it will help shift biodiversity
and protected area policies and practices away from the highly centralized and exclusive model
inherited from the Soviet era, towards a more modem, inclusive approach that combines
biodiversity and ecosystem protection with providing economic and other benefits to local
communities. The project will also introduce active management o f pastures, and support the
development o f a participatory approach to natural resource management overall.           Equally
importantly, the project will contribute to lasting poverty alleviation insome o f the poorest areas
o f Azerbaijan, by introducing and catalyzing the adoption o f more modem, sustainable, and
value-added approaches to natural resource use and agricultural production and diversification o f
economic activities, including development o frural/eco-tourism.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkeyindicators

2a. ProjectDevelopmentObjective(PDO): The PDO is to improve biodiversity conservation
and introduce more sustainable natural resource management and economic activities in two
mountainous areas o f Azerbaijan, to restore the ecological health and productivity o ftheir natural
forests andpastures.

2b. Global Objective (GO): The GO is to protect biodiversity in two globally significant
biodiversity areas within the Caucasus and Zangezur mountains, and introduce and pilot an
ecosystem-based approach for Protected Area (PA) management inAzerbaijan.

        Key indicators for the PDOand GO are:

        Establishment of SDNP and enlargement o f OW, as indicated in the project document
        (see Section 3 and Annex 4), ;
        Development and initial implementationo f zoning and management plans for SDNP and
        ONP, following a participatoryprocess;
        Implementation of pilot community-based tree planting activities (covering 3000 ha by
        midterm, and 9,000 ha by the end o f the project), in order to assist local communities to
        meet their need for fuelwood and other wood products;
        Adoption o f more modem, productive and sustainable livestock husbandry practices by at
        least 20% o fhouseholds in(55) participatingvillages;
        150 or more environmentally friendly, financially sound, smalymedium enterprises
        identified, initiated and publicized (all or most receiving small grants from the project as
        partoftheir overall financingpackage);
        Midterm and end-of-project surveys indicate significantly increased awareness and
        understanding of, and support for, multi-purpose national parks (and more broadly, for
        environmentally sustainable development and natural resource management) within the
        project areas.

3. Projectcomponents

The project area consists of the areas of the proposed Shah Dag and enlarged Ordubad national
parks and the surrounding areas, including: (i)      state-owned lands that will be included in the
parks; (ii)state-owned pasture landto be included inother types o f PAs to be established around
and adjacent to the national parks; and (iii) neighboring municipal and private lands that may in
fbture be incorporatedinto the parks through agreement with their owners. The villages included
in(iii) listedinAnnex 16andthe boundaries ofthe two partsofthe project area are shownin
        are

                                                   6

The main instruments for achieving the project objectives will be the establishment o f the SDNP
and enlarged O W and the surrounding PA network, together with associated assistance for
community economic development. The model o f an ecologically coherent complex o f different
types o f PASwill provide a mechanism for coordinated ecological management, while meeting
the needs o f local communities and other land owners and users. Over time it i s anticipated that
the area included within the national parks will increase, through incorporation o f high priority
state-owned land and through land owners agreeing to include their land in the park through
various contractual agreements. Local communities and other stakeholders will participate inthe
preparation o f the park zoning and management plans and inthe preparation and implementation
of a comprehensive and coordinated ecological management plan covering the entire assemblage
of PAS. The community development aspects o f the project aim to promote more sustainable
livelihoods and economic activities in the project areas. In the short term the focus i s on
reducing pressure on natural resources and ecosystems and mitigating potential negative socio-
economic impacts o f increased restrictions on forest and pasture use, by helping local
communities to develop alternatives and to improve the productivity and sustainability o f their
traditional economic activities, particularly livestock husbandry. The longer term objective is to
promote a diversification o f local economies, makingthem less dependent on mass consumption
o f natural resources.

COMPONENT 1. Protected Areas Establishment and Management (US$8.69 million):
This component will support the establishment of Shah Dag National Park (SDNP) and
expanded Ordubad National Park (ONP),and adjacent PAS. A three-phase process i s envisaged
for the creation o fthe parks:

        Phase 1: the nationalparks are created on specified areas o f state-owned lands, including
        existing SPNAs, all Forest Fund land and high elevation meadows o f high biodiversity
        significance, most o f which are not used for grazing'. Total anticipated area of SDNP is
        about 113,000 ha, and o f ONP is about 43,000 ha. In accordance with Azerbaijan law,
        these parks can contain core conservation zones and areas for limited economic activity
        andother services (e.g. tourism, parkadministrationinfrastructure);

        Phase 2: national parks are expanded through addition o f some areas o f state-owned
        pasture, identified based on their highbiodiversity or ecological significance. Legislation
        will be amended as needed to make provisions for regulated grazing, resident and other
        economic uses inaccordance with park management plans;

        Phase 3: national parks and PAS are further expanded through incorporation o f some
        areas o fmunicipal or privately owned lands, without transfer o f landownership, based on
        voluntary agreements between park Administrations and the land owners. The main
        objectives are to reduce fragmentation o f the park (e.g. incorporate lands that are
        enclaves within park boundaries), and increase local support for the park through direct
        participationintourism development andother benefits.




  Expansion o f ONP inPhase 1i s expected to also include some pasture landcurrently within Zakazniks


                                                        7

Issuing o f the legal instrument establishing the SDNP i s a condition o f effectiveness for the
project; the Resolution expanding ONP i s expected to be issued prior to or soon after
effectiveness. Phase 2 is expected to beginbythe second year o f the project, after completion o f
detailed forest and pasture inventories and local consultations. Phase 3 can inprinciple proceed
inparallel with Phase 2, but is likely to require considerable prior awareness raising, education
and negotiation. Only a small portion (about 25%) o f this total potential area i s expected to be
added to the PA network during the project. Creation o f the other PASwill proceed inparallel
with the creation o f the national parks, and is anticipated to be completed by the midterm o f the
project. Details ofthe envisaged process and target areas (hectares) are provided inAnnex 4.

The project will support measures to modemize and improve park management, restore degraded
areas, tourism development, and increase participation o f stakeholders inpark management. It
will also support better sustainable management o f biological resources in the other PASto be
established in the project areas, through direct investment (as appropriate) and by creating and
supporting institutional structures and planning activities involving the key stakeholders,
Specific activities to be financed under this component include: delineation and demarcation o f
park and other PA boundaries; technical assistance and training for institutional capacity
building; forest andmeadow inventories, preparation o fpark zoning and management plans and
annual operating plans; implementation of management plans, including reforestation in high
priority areas, rehabilitation and limited construction o f critical infiastructure for park
management and tourism, andprovision o f essential equipment; implementation o f an ecological
monitoring system; andincremental operating costs.

COMPONENT 2. Community-level investment in sustainable agriculture and natural
resourcemanagement(US$4.48 million): This component will assist residents o f 55 villages
inside or immediately adjacent to the two national parks and surrounding PAs9 to shift their
traditional agricultural and natural resource use practices towards more modem and efficient
approaches that place less pressure on natural resources and ecosystems. The main focus is on
promoting a shift away from low value livestock husbandry based primarily on grazing in
vulnerable high-elevation pastures, to more intensive and productive methods based on fodder
production. With the help o f technical advisors, communities will develop village investment
plans, drawing upon a menu of options (seeds, fertilizers, agricultural equipment, small scale
irrigation, milk collection and storage facilities, artificial insemination services, fencing material
for pasture management, etc.). Assistance will also be provided for restoring and improving the
management o f badly degraded municipal pastures close to villages.                        In addition to fodder
production, access to agricultural machinery and irrigation will help villagers to increase
production o f potatoes and other marketable crops (rehabilitation o f access roads under
Component 1will enhance access to markets). A committee comprised o f representatives o f the
Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources, Ministry o f Agriculture, Ministry o f Agricultural
Development, the local Executive Committee, and each municipality included in the village
cluster, will approve the village investment plans, to ensure that they are consistent with other
local development plans andobjectives.

To begin to close the gap between fuelwood demand and sustainable offtake from the natural
forest, the project will support pilot scale community-based tree planting, and small scale
demonstration o f the benefits o f more efficient wood-burning stoves for domestic heating. The
experience gained through these pilots i s expected to stimulate replication and expansion with
significant positive impacts inthe future.

Specific activities to be financed under this component include: technical assistance, small scale
works (ponds and pipelines for irrigation; facilities for the implementing organizations); goods
and equipment for the village investments and services; and operating costs for the implementing
organizations chosen by the communities that will implement Component 2 activities.

COMPONENT3. RuralEnterpriseDevelopment(US$1.95 million): Component 3 aims to
stimulate economic diversification inthe project areas by assisting local entrepreneurs to start or
expand environmentally sustainable small andmedium commercial enterprises.

The project will fund small mobile business advisory teams to help interested clients identify and
assess the viability o f commercial ventures and prepare business plans. It will also provide
matching grants (ca. $2000-$10,000) for start-up or expansion o f small or medium enterprises,
based on independent evaluation o f the business plans. The grant will normally support up to
60% of the total project cost, with the grantee responsible for contributing the remaining 40% in
cash, but in exceptional cases the grant proportion may be higher Priority will be given to
activities that are linked to national park objectives (including tourism-related enterprises,
alternative energy and energy efficiency, and value-added processing o f sustainably harvested
natural products such as fruits, nuts and medicinal plants) and enterprises that support
Component 2 objectives (e.g. value-added dairy products). Following technical and financial
evaluation by a contracted Grants Administrator and PIU, grants will be approved by an
Awarding Committee comprised o f representatives o f the Ministries o f Ecology and Natural
Resources; Agriculture; Youth, Sports andTourism; Finance; and Economic Development

Given the time and resources available, the objective is not to achieve a large scale
transformation o f local economies, but to catalyze a shift by stimulating interest, demonstrating
and testing different types o f business opportunities, building local understanding and capacity
for business planningand development, and creating an environment that will encourage other
SMEprograms andmicro-credit institutions to increase their presence inthe project areas.

COMPONENT4. ProjectManagement,Monitoringand Evaluation,and Communications
(US$1.98    million):      This component will support overall project management and
administration, including the staffing and operating costs o f a central Project Implementation
Unitandthree field offices (Project CoordinationUnits, PCU): two inthe Shah Dagarea, one in
the Ordubad area. The branch offices are needed because o f the size, remoteness, difficulty of
access and poor communications infiastructure o f the project areas.        This component also
includes cross-cutting activities such as: Monitoring and Evaulation (M&E); the development
andimplementationo fa communicationsplan(incollaborationwith local authorities andNGOs)
to increase awareness and knowledge o f the project and its objectives and activities at all levels;
detailed socio-economic studies to improve targeting o f project benefits; and facilitating the

   4. Lessonslearnedandreflectedin the projectdesign

   Based on experience with similar projects inthe Europe/Central Asia Region and elsewhere, the
   following lessons havebeenincorporated into the project design:

        0    Project design should be focused, limited in terms of geographic area and types o f
             activities; new approaches should bepilotedbefore mainstreamingthem at national level;
        0    Be realistic about what can be achieved within the available time frame and the capacity
             o f implementing agencies, particularly when the project involves elements such as the
             introduction o f new ideas, approaches and skills; substantial strengthening or
             establishment o f new institutional structures; community mobilization and participation;
             or restriction o f traditional access to natural resources";
        0    Set specific and realistic objectives and interim targets, which can be used to evaluate
             progress and re-orient components or implementation approaches ifneeded;
        0    Combine enforcement and incentives for effective protection and sustainable
             management ofbiodiversity andnatural systems;




   loW h i c h involves implementation of an Access RestrictionProcess Framework


                                                             10

   0    Involve key stakeholders early in the project design and in the preparation phase to
        ensure ownership and to ensure that the design and specific investments make sense in
        the country and local contexts;
   0    Combine financial assistance for SME start-ups/expansion with professional business
        advice and, to the extent possible, address constraints inthe overall business environment
        (tax and other policies, regulatory processes, infrastructure, etc.);

These lessons are reflected inthe project design. For example, the project will focus on the Shah
Dag and Ordubad areas, rather than addressing the entire national PA system, with the objective
of demonstrating approaches that can be replicated in other areas. Considerable effort has been
made to involve local stakeholders inthe preparation phase, including the establishment o f local
project offices, and the project includes measures to ensure communities have the opportunity,
means, knowledge and incentives to participate inpark management. Component 2 is strongly
focused on livestock improvement and related economic activities, rather than supporting a
broad menuo f potential local development objectives. Implementation (see Annex 3) are based
on a realistic implementation schedule that allows adequate time for key steps including
recruiting personnel, procuring works and goods; carrying out community mobilization,
awareness-raising and participatory planning activities; building institutional capacity;
developing business plans; etc.             The project includes a substantial investment in Technical
Assistance (TA) for PA management, community mobilization and small enterprise
development, because preparation studies identified a lack o f such services inthe project areas as
a major potential constraint to success. However, the TA i s primarily local, and structured to
ensure an emphasis on capacity buildingand in-service training.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

The project will introduce and implement the concepts o f biodiversity conservation and
sustainable natural resource management on an ecosystem scale, in two large protected
landscapes", each with a national park at its core. An initial proposal for a broader project to
create a coordinated national Protected Areas (PA) system was rejected, in view of weak
institutional capacity and the need to pilot new approaches before embarking on a more
ambitious expansion program. Another early proposal, to create a single park encompassing the
Shah Dag area and the coastal area o f Samur-Yalama, was rejected as impractical (the Samur-
Yalama area i s beingdeveloped as a separatePA). InShah Dag, the highest prioritybiodiversity
conservation sites are dispersed across large areas, surrounded by large areas o f intensivelyused
summer pasture. Altemative approaches that were considered but rejected included:                               (i)
establishing a network o f relatively small, disconnected PASseparated by unprotected areas; (ii)
creating large, conventional national parks which would exclude human habitation and all
economic activities other than tourism; and (iii)             creating two large multi-purpose parks which
would incorporate large areas o f actively used pasture landand both state-owned and non state-
owned land. The first option was rejected as operationally impractical and ecologically unsound,
as it fails to address the linkages between the core conservation areas and surrounding areas.
The second option was rejected as it would have involved relocating more than 60 villages (over
40,000 people) and taking large areas o f valuable pasture and forest permanently out o f


I'Note: this i s a descriptive term, not necessarily meant to correspond precisely with the IUCN definition of a
"Protected Landscape"

economic use. Both the first and second options would also have perpetuated the unsustainable
and increasingly unacceptable status quo o f isolating local communities from the valuable
resources and economic potential o f the PAS. The option o f large, multi-purpose national parks,
while becoming increasingly common in many countries, was deemed to be unfeasible due to a
lack o f local experience with the model and because the legal framework regarding substantial
economic use such as widespread grazing within national parks i s unclear. Therefore, the 3-
phased approach described above was selected, whereby the parks will initially be created on a
more traditional model, with the objective o f moving towards a more comprehensive, multi-
purpose and multiple-ownership approach.

Giventhe weak local technical andinstitutional capacity inrelation to modem approaches to PA
management, high value livestock production and commercial development, the option o f a
purely technical assistance/ capacity buildingproject was considered. However, there is a strong
demand and urgent need for interventions on the ground, and for demonstrating the viability and
benefit o f these new approaches. Therefore, the project was designed to combine a major
investment in capacity building with on-the-ground investments, some o f which are at a
pilotldemonstration level.        Alternative approaches to capacity-building were considered,
particularly making less use o f international Technical Assistance and relying primarily on
training and local consultants. However, because local capacity i s very limited, international TA
i s needed to introduce new approaches and modern methods, to fill the immediate need for
skilled and experienced personnel to get activities moving, and to provide in-service training and
capacity building for their counterparts. The international TA is structured with repeated visits
of limitedduration, inorder to emphasize local capacity-building and avoid the risk o f TA taking
over line responsibilities.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements(ifapplicable)

As part o f the "hotspot" Caucasus ecoregion, Azerbaijan benefits from a number o f regional
programs by bilateral and multilateral donors and international NGOs, which complement the
AREP objectives. For example, the Regional Environmental Centre for the Caucasus12(RECC)
and the Caucasus Environmental NGO Network supporting activities by regional and local
NGOs relating to transboundary cooperation innatural resource management and c~nservation'~.
Agro- and eco-tourism i s a particular focus (e.g.: a UNDP/GOA "pro-poor" tourism project
(launched in 2004), a Eurasia Foundation project to develop transboundary hiking routes and
agro-ecotourism, the World Bank-financed Cultural Heritage Project, the Trans-Caucasus
Tourism Initiative co-financed by the World Bank and the Swiss Government, a WWF initiative
on ecotourism development inthe Caucasus supported by the German government; rehabilitation
o f cultural heritage sites in and around Sheki fbnded by Norway, and a rapid assessment o f
tourism potential undertaken in 2003 as the first phase o f a program o f the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to support growth o f the tourism sector in
Azerbaijan. Most o f these programs are implemented with local NGO partners. Other likely

partners inthe fbture include USAID, and the Soros Foundation, which are supporting (capacity
building for rural tourism in several other countries in the region. Recognizing the need for
greater coordination and collaboration among these many and diverse supporters and initiatives,
a Tourism Steering Group was established inBakuinMarch, 2004 to facilitate information flow.

While the local NGO sector i s relatively poorly developed, particularly outside Baku, several
NGOs that are active inthe project areas have beeninvolved inpreparation o f the AREP and/or
are expected to participate in implementation. These include general environmental
organizations concerned with environmental policy, protection, education and monitoring (e.g.,
the Information-Analytic Environmental Agency (ECORES); Azerbaijan Ecological Union;
Xazri TETA; CENN); with biodiversity conservation (e.g. WWF-Azerbaijan; Birdlife;
Azerbaijan Zoological Society; Azerbaijan Animal Protection Society, etc.),            and with
ruraVsustainable development (e.g., Azerbaijan Mountain Regions Development Association
(ADRIA);Rural Development Programme for MountainousandHighlandAreas). There will be
several avenues for NGOs and other stakeholders to participate inor collaborate with the AREP,
including direct contracting or collaboration with ongoing programs for providing rural advisory
services and administration o f small grants.     The communications/outreach, social impact
assessment and monitoring programs coordinated by the PIU will all be carried out in
cooperation with NGOs and community groups.

Important partners among intemational NGOs include the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF),
which has been supporting and carrying out conservation activities in the Caucasus for over 10
years.     This includes leading the development o f an ecosystem profile for the Caucasus
biodiversity hotspot, under the auspices of the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF).
This involved the participation o f over 130 local and intemational experts, and provides a
framework for inter-governmental and donor coordination based on agreed conservation
priorities and targets. The CEPF itselfmay in hture provide co-financing for some community-
based conservation activities to be supported under the AREP.

The rural enterprise development component o f the AREP will benefit from partnership with
numerous organizations and initiatives involved in developing small and medium enterprises in
Azerbaijan, such as the EUEBRD-funded Business Advisory Services Programme and the
Azerbaijan Business Development Pr~gram'~.       Also, as noted in Section B4, some enterprises
applying for grants under Component 3 will require additional loan financing to be viable. The
AREP will not provide credit, butwill seek partnership with existing microfinance institutions.

While the operating costs o f the parks are expected to be met mainly by Government and, inthe
future, partly fkom tourism revenues, the MENRand the Bank will also explore the possibility o f
partnership with the private sector. For example, the oil industry has already become involved in
supporting conservation, environmental management and sustainable development inAzerbaijan
and neighboring countries in the context o f the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. Another
avenue to be explored in future is partnership with downstream users o f water from the SDNP
watershed, including the city o f Bakuandthe petroleum and other industries concentrated on the
Absheron peninsula.      Similarly, the project will explore opportunities for carbon financing
(payment for reducingcarbon emissiondsequestration o f carbon).

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), established by the Government o f Azerbaijan for
implementation of the World Bank-financed                projects in the environmental sector, will have
overall responsibility for project implementation and coordination, including planning,
pr~curement'~,financial management and accounting, monitoring and evaluation, progress
reporting, training on project implementation procedures, and cross-sectoral coordination and
govemment liaison. The PIU i s administratively under the MENR, and is well experienced in
project implementation, having served effectively for implementation o f the Urgent
Environmental Investment Project. For the AREP it is being strengthened including the addition
o f small, locally-based regional offices to facilitate implementation and communication with
stakeholders inthese large, remote areas. The regional offices will also serve as a home base for
the long-term technical service providers under Components 2 and 3.

The Project Steering Committee which was established to facilitate cross-sectoral coordination
and support during the preparation stage, will continue for the same purpose during
implementation.

MENR, through its Department o f Biodiversity Conservation and Development o f Specially
Protected Natural Areas (DBCDSPNA, or Biodiversity Department) will have overall
responsibility for implementation o f Component 1. In accordance with Azerbaijan law, each
national park will be established as a separate legal entity with its own Charter and
Administration.       The park and adjacent PA Administrations will have responsibility for
monitoring and supporting conservation and sustainable management o f biological resources, in
coordination with other local authorities. Institutional structures such as a Stakeholder Advisory
Group and an Ecological Coordination Committee will be established as mechanisms for
coordinating among these agencies and for involving local communities and other stakeholders
inPA management, and for promoting sustainable development and coordinated ecological and
natural resource management across the project area as a whole.

The institutional mechanism (implementing agency) for implementation o f Village Cluster
Investment Plans under Component 2 will be selected by communities with the assistance o f
Technical Advisors (the Project Implementation Manual describes in detail the technical
assistance to be provided to the communities). Participating villages will be grouped inVillage
Clusters (VC) with 3-5 villages each, for more efficient and cost-effective implementation.
Because o f limited time and resources, about half the villages within the project areas will
participate directly in Component 2. These have been identified based on criteria such as
population density, accessibility, availability o f agricultural land for fodder crop production, and
the extent to which the villages represent a source o f pressure on the natural resources in the
parks (and are likely to suffer negative impacts due to grazing restrictions).                 Each V C will
preparean investment plan. The PIU will establish an Investment PlanApproval Committee for
each V C to review and endorse V C investment plans. Community members will pay user fees to
the implementing agency for some o f the services (e.g. rental o f agricultural machinery, artificial

under CommercialPractices, Component 3

insemination). The fee structures will be decided by the communities as part o f their overall
investmentplan.

Inthe absence o f suitable service providers inthe project areas, implementation ofComponent 3
will be contracted to business consulting firms or suitable NGOS'~.One contract will be for
establishment o f small mobile business advisory teams, responsible for assisting prospective
entrepreneurs to identify eligible and viable commercial opportunities, analyze market
conditions, prepare business plans and submit grant applications, and, where appropriate, assist
clients to identify credit providers and prepare loan applications for additional financing. A
second contract will be awarded for administration o f the matching grants program, including:
evaluating proposals for their technical, financial, environmental and social viability and passing
recommendations to an Awarding Committee (headed by the PIU); administering and
monitoring the use of grant funds; and regular reporting to PIUonprogress o f implementationo f
these activities.

3. Monitoringandevaluationof outcomes/results

Annex 3 provides the overall framework, indicators and initial targets for monitoring and
evaluation o f project outcomes. This will serve as the basis for development o f a more detailed
M&E plan during the first year of the project. The PIU will ensure that the M&E plan is
integrated into project implementation for each component. A detailed socio-economic study
will also be carried out duringthe first year, to supplement information from studies done during
preparation. Outputs o f this study will include: refining the socio-economic baseline data and
social impact monitoring indicators and targets; recommendations for improved targeting of
project benefits; and a Social Mitigation Plan to ensure that the elements o f the Access
Restriction Process Framework are fully incorporated into project activities. For biodiversity
impact monitoring, the project will support detailed forest and rangeland inventories during the
first year, and will make use o f the W W F N o r l d Bank Alliance/GEF Management Effectiveness
Tracking Tool (METT) and "Tracking Tool for GEF Biodiversity Focal Area Strategic Priority
Two: MainstreamingBiodiversity inProduction Landscapes and Sectors."

4. Sustainability

The project aims to put inplace systems for more sustainable use of natural ecosystems that are
currently being overused and degraded, and to promote economic development that will reduce
reliance on mass consumption ofnatural resources. Inthe short term this will be mainly through
improved protection, but the longer term objective i s develop communityhser-based
management systems and to trigger a shift from traditional, low-input livelihoods based on
miningo fnatural resources (forests andpastures) towards more value-added economic activities
that are less dependent on these resources or use them more efficiently. Because o f the short
time frame, the project can only serve as a catalyst for such a shift, by introducing new
approaches, demonstrating opportunities, changing incentives, providing some start-up capital,
and improving market accessthrough rehabilitationo fkey accessroads.

An ecosystem approach involvingboth national parks and less restrictive PASis expected to be
more sustainable in the long run than conventional, exclusive PASbecause it will enjoy greater
local and national support. The Government is committed to expanding its PA system and to
providing the necessary recurrent budget, and the resources available for this purpose should
increase over the next few decades with overall economic growth from oil revenues. At the
same time, the scale o f institutional development and capital investment is being limited to
reduce operating costs. Over the longer term, the PA system will have the potential to generate
revenues from tourism (entry fees, concessions, etc.) to help cover maintenance costs. At present
the parks cannot legally retain revenues to supplement operating budgets, but changing this will
be a keyobjective inmodernizing the PA system over the next few years.

The community level investments to be supported under Component 2 are expected to be
sustainable because they will be selected by the communities based on their own needs and
priorities. Fees to be charged by local implementing agencies for the services under Component
2 will also contribute to the sustainability o f the investments.           To maximize viability and
sustainability o f small enterprises supported by the project, the matching grants will normally
require applicants to present a long-term financing planandprovide at least 50% o f start-up cost.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicandfinancial analyses

The economic analysis o f the project suggests an economic rate o f return o f 26%, a net present
value of US$44 million and a cost:benefit ratio o f 3.5.         These figures exclude potentially
significant long-term benefits from reduced flooding and sedimentation, and non-marketed
benefits potentially accruing to expatriates and visitors to Azerbaijan and the international
community as a whole through improved biodiversity.             The financial analysis indicates a
financial rate o f return o f 23%, a net present value o f US$36 million and a cost:benefit ratio o f
3:1. Financial benefits will accrue from increased profit associated with tourist visitor
expenditure, potential future park visitor fees, reversing pasture degradation with resulting
improvement inreturns from sheep grazing over the long term, increased yields from cow milk,
enhanced crop yields, sustainable wood harvesting and profits from new and enhanced small
businesses. Other economic benefits not included in the above analysis include potentially



                                                  18

significant long-term benefits from reduced flooding and sedimentation due to reduced meadow
erosion and forest cutting. Net present value i s calculated based on a 40 year period to obtainthe
economic benefits from long-term environmental improvements. Details o f assumptions and
estimates used for these calculations are provided in Annex 9, and the underlying model,
assumptions and data are available inthe project files.

Sensitivity analysis shows that the results are robust to the complete exclusion o f crop yield
benefits, tourism benefits and non-use benefits, with Internal Rates o f Return(IRRs) falling only
by a few percent respectively. However, the results are more sensitive to exclusion of the sheep
revenues, with a decline in ERR to 14% and FRR to 10%. The long-term fiscal impact o f the
project i s likely to be positive. The 8% Government contribution relates mainly to development
of the proposed parks and to park staffing. Fiscal benefits to the Government will arise through
increased tourism in the Park areas and significantly enhanced agricultural and business
development, generating Government income through taxes. To enhance the long-term financial
sustainability o f the parks, continued Government and international assistance should be
combined with maximizing opportunities for raising revenues through entry fees, park sales, and
tax/concession type arrangements with organizations makingmoney from sustainable use o f the
parks' resources (e.g. tourism, mining o f minerals, collection o f aggregates downstream o f the
parks, and water bottling operations).    In addition, there is scope in the future for obtaining
financial   assistance from carbon funds, from payment for environmental services such as
maintaining water supply and quality for downstream users (e.g. Baku), and corporate
sponsorship (e.g. fromBP).

2. Technical

InAzerbaijan, as inmost countries of the former Soviet Unio biodiversity ca servation has
been based mainly on a system o f relatively small, exclusive PASwhich make no provision for
any economic or recreationaluse or community participation or benefit. Due to the limitations
of this type o f conservation model, the alternative approach o f "ecosystem management" is
increasingly popular, with numerous institutional models being implemented or explored in
different countries. These models generally share some key features: (i)     zoning o f the overall
area into smaller sectors which are managed for different uses (strict biodiversity protection,
tourism development, low-intensity use o f natural resources, sustainable agriculture, etc.); (ii)
institutional mechanisms for planning and coordinating land and resource use across the whole
area; and (iii) mechanisms to enable local communities to obtain economic benefits from the PA.
Inlinewith that approach, this project will support the creation o ftwo largePA networks which
will include national parks, as well as other types o fPAs which allow a wider range o f landand
resource uses while still retaining objectives o f protecting biodiversity and the natural
environment. Institutional structures will be developed for involving local communities and
other stakeholders and for enabling local communities to participate directly in economic
benefits such as tourism development (including, on a voluntary basis, agreeing land that they
own to be managed as part o fthe national park or other PA).




                                                 19

There is a great diversity o f institutional models for PASand PA systems involving multiple
types o f landuse and landownership, reflecting different ecological, political, legal and cultural
conditions. The challenge will be to develop an appropriate model for Azerbaijan, drawing upon
the experience o f other countries in the region and around the world. This model will have to
take into account factors such as overlapping institutional responsibilities and interests (e.g. with
regard to issuing o f grazing permits), limited inter-sectoral coordination, and a physical
environment which makes cooperation among stakeholders difficult (large area, remote villages
with poor infrastructure for travel and communication).

The proposed 3-phase approach for establishing the national parksreflects the need to clarify and
amend legislation to allow for different types o f economic activities and land ownership within
national parks. It also allows for bringing new areas into the park as their biodiversity and
ecological significance becomes clear (based on detailed inventories and the development o f
parkmanagement plans), and as awarenessandunderstanding o fthe benefits o fbeing associated
with the park increase and concerns regarding potential negative economic impacts are
addressed. Establishing other types o f PAs inthe adjacent, heavily-usedpasture areas provides a
mechanism to begin introducing more sustainable use o f those pastures, because it establishes a
clear responsibility and mandate for the MENR to monitor the condition o f these resources and
define the conditions needed to protect and manage them. Specific restrictions and regulations
can be defined in the Charter o f a Zakaznik to confer needed protection on particular species,
sites or ecosystems and to limit or regulate particular resource uses. However, the support,
commitment and cooperation o f other government agencies and stakeholders will be essential for
improved management of these areas to become a reality. The project's awareness-raising,
educational and communications activities will in turn be essential for buildingthis support and
commitment.

Technical and institutional capacity for forest and pasture management are weak in Azerbaijan
The project will help to fillthis gap by providing technical assistance and training, including
exposure to the experience of neighboring countries which have been dealing with similar
challenges, inmanycases under World Bank-financedprojects (e.g. Turkey, Georgia).

In the short term, protection and management of the parks and other PASwill be dependent
mainly on the financing provided by Government and donors (including international NGOs).
Long term sustainability will require a more diverse financial base, through a combination o f
user fees and other sources such as carbon financing and transfer payments from downstream
users o f water or owners o f infrastructure who have an interest in maintaining the watershed.
The project will provide TA under Component 1to explore such financing options and develop a
long-term financial sustainability strategy for the parks.

For Components 2 and 3, the main challenge is that the economic productivity and
competitiveness o fthe project areas is constrained by factors such as short growing seasons, soils
vulnerable to erosion, limited surface water, difficult access to markets, etc.            Livestock
husbandryis boththe prevalent economic activity and, along with tourism, probably the one for
which the areas have the greatest comparative advantage. At the same time, these activities are
very dependent onthe natural environment. The objective is to capitalize onthese advantages by
supporting enterprises that make use o f the rich natural resource assets o f the area, while putting



                                                 20

measures in place to ensure that this does not stimulate over-harvesting o f biodiversity or other
negative impacts, such as ecological destruction due to poorly planned or unregulated tourism
development. Another potential issue is ensuring that the economic opportunities provided by
the project are well targeted to local communities, which are relatively poor and strongly
dependent on the areas' natural resources. For example, preparation studies indicated that a
substantial proportion o f the livestock grazing in the project areas are owned by outside
businessmen, but more work i s needed to obtain reliable figures regarding local vs. outside
livestock ownership and pasture use. Similarly, many o f the existing tourism enterprises are
owned bypeople from outside the area, and it is unclear what contribution they make to the local
economy. The more detailed socio-economic study to be undertaken during the first year o f the
project will provide data on these and other issues relating to the distribution o f project costs and
benefits. This information will be used to prepare a Social Mitigation Plan to refine baseline
indicators and improve targeting o f project opportunities and benefits. Measures already taken
include using socio-economic criteria to select the villages eligible to participate in Component
2, and limitinggrants under Component 3 to residents o fvillages within the project area.

3. Fiduciary

The financial management assessmentconcludedthat the existingsystems, including accounting,
financial  reporting, internal controls,      staffing, credit/grant disbursements and auditing
arrangements, at the central PIUwithin the Ministry o f Ecology and National Resources satisfies
minimum financial management requirements.            The PIU staff have functional experience in
managing World Bank projects, having implemented the ongoing Urgent Environment Project
and GEF and PHRD grants. The 1C Accounting system at the PIUis operational, but requires
hrther customization of the Chart o f Accounts to accommodate all project components and
sources o f financing. The internal control systems andprocedures are documented inthe Project
Implementation Manual. Strengthening o f the minor weaknesses identified in the systems will
be completed prior to Board presentation to ensure systems and controls are fblly capable of
satisfactorily recording transactions and balances, supporting the preparation o f regular project
financial statements, safeguarding the assets, and are subject to auditing arrangements acceptable
to the Bank. Because o f the multi-layered project implementation arrangements and capacity at
the regional-level, close coordination and monitoring by the PIUwithin the Ministry o f Ecology
and National Resources will be critical to minimizing fiduciary risks associated with
`community-level investment and natural resource management'                  and `rural enterprise
development' components o fthe Project.

4. Social

N o villages or households will be relocated and land ownership and rights will not be affected,
but the WB's       Involuntary Resettlement Policy is triggered because the establishment/
enlargement and improved enforcement ofthe two NPs will reduce access to pastures and forests
that are traditionally important for local livelihoods. Inthe longterm, restoration and sustainable
management o f these ecosystems will benefit the users, but the short term impacts will need to
be mitigated, through measures detailed in the Access Restriction Process Framework (ARPF),
which forms part o f the Project Implementation Manual. These include involving local users in
park zoning and management planning, phasing in o f grazing restrictions, and support for



                                                   21

developing alternative livestock rearing methods, sources o f wood, and income sources
(including some employment inthe parks themselves). Development assistance provided under
Components 2 and 3 will be particularly targetedto villages that are most likely to be affected by
resource access restrictions. Village Clusters to receive assistance under Component 2 were
selected based on factors includingtheir proximity to areas o f the parks where stricter resource
use restrictions are most likely to be implemented. Villages not included in the VCs are small,
scattered and located in remote areas where resource restrictions are unlikely.         The park
management planning process and the Social Mitigation Plan (see below) will indicate whether
any additional mitigation measures should be undertaken in these villages.              Matching
requirements for grants under Component 3 will be reduced or eliminated for applicants from the
highest elevation (poorest and most vulnerable) villages, and for enterprises with particularly
high social benefits.    Preparation studies indicated that, although there are some Internally
Displaced Persons in the Shah Dag project area, they are integrated into the local communities
and do not require special provisions to ensure that they participate in project implementation
anddecision-making andhave accessto mitigation measures andprojectbenefits.

The PIU will put in place a program to assess, monitor and mitigate socio-economic impacts.
This will include: (i)detailed socio-economic study duringthe first year (buildingupon work
                       a
carried out duringproject preparation); (ii)preparation o f a Social MitigationPlan to ensure that
project benefits are well targeted to those affected by resource access restrictions and any
vulnerable groups within the communities, and optimally designed and implemented to help
alleviate poverty in these remote, economically depressed areas; (iii)      strengthening conflict
resolution processes and ensuring adequate grievance procedures; and (iv) refining o f socio-
economic baseline and impact indicators and targets for the project.

5. Environment

EIACategory: B

The project is expected to have an overall positive environmental impact by conserving globally
and nationally significant biodiversity, protecting rare, transboundary ecosystems and enhancing
the sustainability o fnaturalresource use inthe project areas. Other likely environmentalbenefits
include: reduced soil erosion (improving downstream water quality),             flood moderation
(protecting downstream infrastructure such as roads, bridges and imgation systems), and carbon
sequestration in restored meadows and forests. Barn improvements (sanitation and ventilation)
under Component 2 will improve environmental health conditions both for livestock and for the
people who handle them.

The Environmental Assessment undertaken during project preparation identified the following
issues:




                                                 22

    0    Impacts such as disruption o f natural habitats or wildlife, soil erosion, etc. from
         construction andor rehabilitation o f infrastructure (small in scale and very limited in
         extent);

    0    Negative impacts of increased tourisdrecreational use of the two areas (e.g., disturbance
         of wildlife, generation o f solid waste, overuse or pollution o f surface water, and social
         disruptions);

    0    Localized negative impacts associated with grants under Components 2 and 3 (e.g.
         pollution from liquid or solid waste, over-harvesting o f vulnerable species, increased
         fertilizer use, etc).

Mitigation measures are outlined in the Environmental Management Plan, and will be
incorporated into the Project Implementation Manual for Components 2 and 3. These include
assessing proposed construction sites for potential biodiversity or environmental concerns,
including waste management measures and site clean-up requirements in construction designs
and contracts, environmental screening o f micro-project proposals, etc. The EMP also lays out
responsibilities o f the MENR and other government agencies, the PIU and grant beneficiaries.
These include carrying out the appropriate level of environmental screening or assessment, based
on the type o f activity in question, obtaining required clearances and environmental permits and
monitoring compliance and impact. The EMP is fully consistent with World Bank requirements
and with the Azerbaijan Law on EnvironmentalProtection.

PublicParticipation

Public consultation during project preparation included over 30 meetings in both project areas,
involving over 700 local stakeholders, including local public officials, elected municipality
leaders, NGOs, representatives o f the scientific community and community leaders and
members. These consultations contributed to project design and to preparation o f the EA/EMP
andARPF. Discussion topics included issues related to: (i) services; (ii) availability;
                                                               basic               land
(iii) ofagriculturalmechanization; (iv) croppingpattern, cropproductionpractices; (v)
      level
livestock production; (vi) marketing etc. The main concerns voiced by communities related to
anticipated restrictions on access to pastures and their priorities for development assistance and
delivery mechanisms. Villages commonly identified need for dairy and food processing
facilities, for mechanization and irrigation, for improving livestock genetic materials as
priorities. A second phase o f public consultations took place in February 2005, when the final
versions o f the EA/EMPand ARPF were publicly disclosed at meetings inBakuandbothproject
areas. This round o f consultation focused on implementation of proposed mitigation measures
and impact monitoring. The consultations were carried out by the PIU and PCUs. The PIU
documented the meetings andthe minutes are available at the PIU Office inBakuand two PCU
offices.

An Environmental AssessmentlEnvironmental Management Plan has been prepared and
disclosed prior to project appraisal (see Annex 10). The Natural Habitats policy and the Forest
policy are triggered because the project areas include relatively pristine natural habitats, a large
part o f which is indigenous forest, for which management plans will be developed and
implemented. However, the project will result in improved protection o f these areas, not in
destruction or increased exploitation. Natural areas with high biodiversity value, including the
existing PAS,will be incorporated into the two new NPs as core conservation areas, and their
protection i s expected to improve as a result o f the project. All management activities relating to
natural forests and other natural habitats will be consistent with the WB policies.                                    The
Involuntary Resettlement policy is triggered because o f anticipated new restrictions on access to
forests and pastures. This i s addressed by measures described inthe Access Restriction Process
Framework. The Pest Management policy i s not expected to be triggered because the type o f
agricultural production that will be supported and promoted is unlikely to involve use o f
pesticides. Similarly, no impacts on cultural heritage sites or property are anticipated. However,
as a precaution, both of these issues are addressed in the EA/EMP environmental screening
checklist attached to the Project Implementation Manual. Since small scale irrigation systems
will draw water from small secondary and tertiary streams which are not tributaries o f rivers
flowing into the Caspian Sea, the InternationalWaterways policy i s not triggered.

7. PolicyExceptions andReadiness

The legal flamework for project implementation is based on the Law on Specially Protected
Natural Areas (LSPNA), the Forest Code and the Land Code. Together these laws define the
objectives, approaches and institutional responsibilities for managing state-owned forest and
pasture lands, including the creation o f different types o f SPNAs.                           The legal instrument
establishing the SDNP (a condition o f effectiveness for the project) will be accompanied by the
map showing the boundaries o f the proposednational park. A map o f all the state-owned land in
the project area, indicating how that land will be allocated to different kinds o f PAS,will be
submitted to the Bank at the same time. Prior to issuing the decree, the Borrower will obtain the

                                                           24

agreement by the Bank that the proposed constellation o fPAs meets the objectives o fthe project,
with regard to biodiversity conservation, sustainable natural resource use and sustainable
development. The Government will also confirm its commitment to establish the other PAS
within areasonable period o ftime (project funds will beavailable to assistinthis process).

The Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas defines the objectives and administrative
mechanisms for national parks, which can include zones for strict nature protection and for
limited economic activities including tourism. However, between the LSPNA and the Land
Code, it is not entirely clear which types o f economic activities are permissible, or whether
residences or other non-state owned land can be included within national parks. The legislative
framework will need to be clarified, and amended as required, for the successful implementation
of some aspects of the project, including "Phase 3" o f establishment/enlargemento f the national
parks. The project will support technical assistance for this purpose. The necessary provisions
will also have to be included in the national Park charters. Approval o f an SDNP Charter
acceptable to the Bankwill be a condition o f disbursement o f project funds for goods and works
to support the operation o f the park (e.g., construction and rehabilitation o f buildings for
administration and management; vehicles and field equipment). Other elements o f the project
(TA for park management capacity building,TA and grants under Components 2 and 3) will not
be subject to this condition o f disbursement, either because these expenditures are needed to
support the process o f developing the Charter, or because implementation o f the activities would
contribute effectively to project objectives evenbefore the park is formally established.

Azerbaijan i s a mountainous country o f 86,600 km2and a population of about 8 million people.
It lies on the western coast of the Caspian Sea among the mountain ranges o f the Greater and
Lesser Caucasus and the Talish mountains. Mountains cover about 44% o f the territory, and
forests cover about 11%.

Azerbaijan's economy declined significantly following independence in 1991,slipping to one o f
7 lowest income countries in the ECA Region. Over the past five years there has been progress
in many areas, and Azerbaijan is moving towards middle income status as benefits from
increasing oil development start to flow. But the country faces continuing problems o f regional
income disparities. In the mountain areas targeted by this project, most people fall under the
poverty line o f US$24 per month (average income i s $16 per month in villages above 2000
meters). In the past, about 80% o f rural households, including most households in the project
areas, were connected to the gas and electricity network and enjoyed a reliable and highly
subsidized energy supply. Supplies are now erratic and expensive, and the households have
largely turned to fuel wood for their energy needs. Prior to 1991, Azerbaijan also relied on
cheap wood imports from Russia, but today wood supplies come exclusively from State forests,
resulting inrapidly increasing deforestation. Demand for wood fuel exceeds sustainable annual
fuel wood yields by up to a factor o f ten insome areas.

Azerbaijan is facing many of the same challenges as other CIS transition economies, including
an agenda o f policy and institutional reforms needed to redefine the role o f the state and create
essential underpinnings o f a market economy.       One o f the six strategic pillars o f the State
Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED) is an enabling
environment for income-generating opportunities.

ENVIRONMENTALMANAGEMENTAND NATUREPROTECTION

Environmental management is recognized as an important right and obligation in the
Constitution o f the Azerbaijan Republic (1995).      In addition to guaranteeing environmental
safety and ecological balance and calling for participation o f the general public and civic
organizations in environmental protection, it identifies biological diversity as a basic
environmental principle. The Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas and Objects (2000)
provides for the protection and preservationo f natural areas, both for the protection o f biological
variety and ecology and to provide for tourism and recreation. The law includes provisions for
taking into consideration social and economic factors and interests o f local people, and for
participation o f the population and social organizations in preserving Protected Areas (PAS).
The Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) was created in 2001 to integrate all
aspects o f environmental protection and management, including environmental assessment and

monitoring (including reporting on the state o f the environment), management o f forests and
wildlife resources, ando f specially protected natural areas".

The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), completed in 1998, identifies priorities
relating to reducing pollution damage from oil extraction and industry; halting the decline of
sturgeon populations and water qualityinthe Caspian Sea; protecting biodiversity and improving
the management o f forests, pastures, and agricultural lands; preserving cultural heritage;
addressing ecological problems with regional or global impacts; and improving the institutional
and policy framework for environmental management.                    The NEAP also identifies specific
biodiversity conservation priorities, including strengthening o f the PA network through: (i)the
adoption o f national parks as instruments for the sustainable use o f biodiversity, to complement
the existing protected area network which emphasizes strict nature reserves; (ii)             creation o f new
protected areas, and (iii) implementation o f pilot projects in sustainable uses o f biodiversity
                              the
which address rural poverty as a root cause o fbiodiversity degradation andloss.

The National Strategy andAction Planon Biodiversity Conservation (NSAPBS), currently under
preparation", i s built upon two main pillars: (i)       preservation, improvement and rehabilitation of
key ecosystems and natural habitats by enhancing and efficient management o f protected areas;
and (ii)optimal utilization o f the country's economic and social potential at the national and
regional level, including sustainable usage o f the biological diversity o f Azerbaijan, Currently
PAScover approximately 7% of the country19, but most are small and fragmented, and some
important ecosystems are under-represented. The GOA signed the Convention on Biological
Diversity in 2001, and has made a major commitment to protecting biodiversity, including
maintaining and substantially expanding the nation's PA system to increase coverage o f under-
represented ecosystems. By 2010 the PA system i s to be expanded from about 7% to about 10%
o f the national territory. Creation o f the Shah Dag National Park (SDNP) and expansion of the
OrdubadNational Park (0") are among the highestpriorities.

Management o f existing PASneeds to be strengthened through building stronger institutions,
human resource development and increasing resources available, as well as addressing issues
such as poverty and pressure for economic development in surrounding areas. Furthermore, the
prevailing model for PASinAzerbaijan, as inmuch o f the CIS, is based on centrally controlled,
Strict Nature Reserves (Zapovedniks). In accordance with the NEAP and NSAPBC, the GOA
has begun to diversify the national PA system, created the country's first four National Parks in
2003-200420. National Parks have the status o f PAs21but, unlike Zapovedniks, allow for zones
of limitedeconomic activity (primarilytourism).

NATURALRESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Forests: Almost all natural forest inAzerbaijan belongs to the State and is designated as Forest
Fundland. Duringthe Soviet era, forest inventory and planningwere centralized inMoscow and
inthe Caucasian Forest Stocks Projection Institute in Georgia, leaving little forest management
capacity inAzerbaijan after independence. The Forestry DevelopmentDepartment andits Forest
Protection and Rehabilitation Units (MENR) were established in 2002, but their staff lack
training and experience.        Since 2003, all forest cutting, for either commercial or sanitary
purposes have been suspended by the MENR, and officially only forest residues are collected
and sold. However, it i s generally recognized that large quantities o f standing trees continue to
be cut illegally and forest cover continues to decline.                 A National Programme on the
Rehabilitation and Extension of Forests (established in 18 February, 2003) aims to restore 25,000
ha o f existing forest and plant some 44,700 ha o f new forest, but due to insufficient funding, only
about 3,000 ha o fplantingwere completed in2003.

Meadows and Pastures: All high elevation summer pastures and a large proportion o f mid-
elevationwinter pastures belong to the State. Some small pasture areas and hayfields belong to,
or are under the management of, local municipalities. Municipalpastures are free for use, while
grazing rights on State pastures are leased by the State Land and Cartography Committee,
together with Rayon Executive Authorities and Ministry o f Agriculture, to individuals or
companies on the basis o f grazing permits, usually with a duration o f 10-15 years. While grazing
rights are in principle allotted on the basis o f numbers o f animals, there are no specific legal
provisions in the grazing contracts, and no monitoring on the part o f authorities, to ensure that
the official stocking rates are followed. In the Shah Dag area, it is estimated that the actual
stocking rates are as much as five times higher than the official norm (totaling 2.5 million
animals, as opposed to 500,000).

GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY SIGNIFICANCE

Azerbaijan lies at the convergence o f three biogeographic regions (Europe, Central Asia and
Asia Minor), resulting inhighbiodiversity. The Caucasus mountains have been identifiedby the
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as a Global 200 Ecoregion, and by Conservation
International as one o fthe world's 25 biodiversity "hotspots" (the only one inthe ECA region)22.
The Caucasus "hotspot," which spans six countries, has one o fthe highest levels o f endemism in
the temperate world, and is believed to contain more than twice the animal diversity found in
adjacent regions o f Europe and Asia. It has been named a large herbivore hotspot by WWF's
Large Herbivore Initiative, as eleven species o f large herbivores, as well as five large camivores,
are found over a relatively small area. The flora is particularly rich in endemic and relict plants
that escaped a series o f glaciations in sheltered pockets. It includes over 7,000 plant species, o f
which 4500 can be found inAzerbaijan (along with 600 species o fvertebrates andat least 14,000
species o f insects).    Seven percent (270) of Azerbaijan's plant species are endemic to the
country. Almost half o f the forest in Azerbaijan i s found in the Greater and Lesser Caucasus
regions. The vegetation o f the Caucasus also represents one o f the richest gene banks o f plant
species useful for agriculture and medicine. A recently completed ecosystem profile and five

of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and small parts ofRussia, Iranand Turkey.

vast majority o f conservation targets, including protection o f most o f the 51 globally threatened
species. Five o f these corridors were identified as top priority for conservation action, including
the Greater Caucasus (which encompasses the proposed SDNP) and the East Lesser Caucasus
(encompassing the OW).                Both the SDNP and ONP include elements o f important
transboundary migratory corridors.

In addition to their significance as global, regional and national biodiversity assets, both the
SDNP and O W represent important economic assets, due to their rich natural resources and
tourism potential. The proposed expanded ONP contains a large proportion o f all highelevation
meadow in the Nakchchivan Autonomous Republic. Shah Dag i s Azerbaijan's second highest
mountain and serves as a watershed which provides much o f the water for Baku and the
Absheron Peninsula, which i s home to nearly 30% o f the country's population.

THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY

The Caucasus ecosystem profile identified deforestation, overgrazing and hunting as the three
greatest direct threats to biodiversitg4. Increaseddemand on local forests, resultingfrom the end
of importation o f wood from other countries and decline in availability o f natural gas, has
contributed to rapid ongoing deforestation in the project areas. Forest edges are also being
pushedback (to higherelevations) as aresult o fgrazingpressure.

Overgrazing o f pastures has become a serious threat inthe project areas since the late 1980's, as
more people took up shepherding or increased their herds inresponse to growing unemployment
anddeclining economic opportunities inother sectors. There is clear evidence o f overgrazing at
all altitudinal levels (montane, sub-alpine and alpine), with a visible trend o f replacement o f the
original grassland species by unpalatable or grazing-resistant species such as sedges, flatweeds,
and mat-grass.       In sub-alpine meadows, which serve as summer pastures, overgrazing and
associated disturbance is contributing to declines in wild goats and chamois. In the lowland
grasslands, where the same sheep herds go for winter pasture, severe overgrazing is significantly
impacting the endemic flora and fauna o f steppe ecosystems. Competition for grazing has
contributed to the decline o f Persian gazelle and, indirectly, striped hyena. Traditionally, sheep
were grazed in alpine meadows, with subalpine meadows reserved for fodder production and
used during the winter months.             However, traditional grazing areas in the north Caucasus
(Dagestan, Georgia) are no longer accessible, and livestock is kept nearer to villages all year
round, resulting in overgrazing o f subalpine meadows as well as degradation o f fragile subalpine
woodland ecosystems.

There is evidence o f significant declines inpopulations o f large mammals, particularly ungulates
andpredators such as wolf, lynx andbrownbear. While there is little byway o f concrete data, it
is believed that illegal hunting has a significant impact, along with habitat loss and competition
with domestic livestock.

RELATIONTO GEF OPERATIONAL PROGRAMS

Biodiversity conservation i s the key focal area for the project. The project addresses GEF
strategic priorities for biodiversity conservation through: (i)catalyzing sustainability o fprotected
areas, (ii)mainstreaming biodiversity in production landscapes and sectors, and (iii)     generating
and disseminating bestpractices for addressing current and emergingbiodiversity issues. Project
activities will directly support innovative practical approaches called for by the 7th Conference
of the Parties (COP-7) o f the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in its Decisions VIU1
"Forest Biological Diversity", VIUll "Ecosystem Approach", andVIU28 "Protected Areas".

The project follows the GEF Strategic Guidelines and incorporates elements o f several GEF
Operational Proaams:

        No. 3 (Forest Ecosystems): by supporting in-situ protection o f ecologically mature
        temperate forest ecosystems under threat, and combining strict protection and multiple
        use to achieve sustainable forest management. Among other things, it will support the
        first comprehensive forest inventory and status assessment since 1984, makingit possible
        to make sound management decisions.

        No. 4 (Mountain Ecosystems): by supportingin-situconservation and sustainable use o f
        biological resources, expanding and improving connectivity of the protected area system
        inthe Greater andLesser Caucasusmountains, andcombiningproductive, socioeconomic
        and conservation goals.

        No. 12 (Integrated Ecosystem Management): by emphasizing the creation o f an enabling
        environment for biodiversity conservation, forest and rangeland management, the
        strengthening o f institutional capacities at local, regional and national levels as well as
        investments insustainable natural resource management.

The GEF grantwould finance costs o f activities requiredto achieve global conservation benefits,
which would be incremental to the baseline national program undertaken by the Government
with support from the World Bank IDA credit and the PHRD grant (see Annex 15 - Incremental
Cost Analysis).

OVERVIEW

The project will support the restoration, protection and improved management o f economically
and biologically important forests, meadows and pasture land, much o f which has become
degraded through over-use. The main instrument for achieving this will be the establishment o f
the two large NPs and a surrounding cluster o f other PAS. Based on biodiversity, ecological and
economic criteria, the large, mainly contiguous area o f state-owned land in each project area will
be divided into different types o f PAS, involving different types o f specific management
objectives and regimes. This cluster o f PASwill make it possible to improve ecological and
natural resource management across a large area. Over time, the objective is to also involve
municipal and private owned lands, through voluntary agreements with the land owners to
manage their landas part o fthe nationalpark or other PA. The national park will be at the center
of the PA clusters. They will provide for strongprotection and restoration o f the most important
biodiversity and ecologically fragile areas and will serve as a main attraction for tourism
development. The national park Administrations and Administrations of the surrounding PAS
will also have specified responsibilities for biodiversity protection and natural resource
management and monitoring in the surrounding areas, either directly or in collaboration with
other authorities and land owners. Institutional structures involving key government agencies,
local authorities and other stakeholders will be put in place to achieve this collaboration. The
aim i s to coordinate ecological and natural resource management and to promote sustainable
economic development at an ecosystem scale, across a range o f land uses and types o f land
ownership

Inthe short term the focus is on improvedprotection ofhighpriority biodiversity areas (forests
and high elevation meadows), on reducing pressure on degraded natural resources and
ecosystems, and on mitigating potential negative socio-economic impacts created by limitations
on forest and pasture use. Biodiversity protectionwill be accompanied bymeasures to help local
communities that are currently using the resources in unsustainable ways to develop more
sustainable alternatives.        The emphasis in this respect is on improving the efficiency and
sustainability o f traditional economic activities that are best suited for mountain ecosystems,
particularly livestock husbandry and processing o f fruits and other tree products. The longer
term objective is to promote a diversification o f local economies, makingthem less dependent on
mass consumption o f natural resources. Tourism represents a sector in which biodiversity-rich
areas, including mountains, have a comparative advantage, and there is growing interest in and
support for transboundary tourism in the Caucasus ecoregion. While tourism prospects for the
ONP area are limited at this time25,there is already a modest tourism industry inthe Shah Dag
area. If  properly directed and supported, this could grow over time into a significant contributor
to local economies and a source o f sustainable financing for the park. Therefore, developing
park infrastructure and management capacity for ecotourism, and assisting local communities to
develop tourism-related economic activities, are also important project objectives.

COMPONENT 1. ProtectedAreas Establishment and Management (USSS.69million):
This component will support the establishment o f the national parks and the PASsurrounding
and supporting the parks, development and implementation o f appropriate zoning and
management plans for the parks and natural resource development plans for the wider project
areas, and strengthening o f institutions and systems for PA management and for ecosystem-wide
coordination.

The process o f establishing the national parks and the adjacent PA clusters will involve three
phases:

       Phase 1: the creation of the new SDNP and the expansion of ONP will initially include
       only specified portions o f the state-owned lands in each project area. The SDNP will
       include the existing Specially Protected Natural Areas (SPNA), Forest Fund lands and
       very high elevation meadows that are not currently used for grazing due to their
       inaccessibility. The state-ownedsummer pasture lands will be designated as State Nature
       Preserves (Zakazniks26) or other categories o f PA, based on an evaluation o f the required
       level o f protection and management objectives. The same will apply to the expanded
       ONP, except that some o f existing summer pasture lands may be included within the
       national park, through special provisions that are consistent with the park Charter. In
       addition to the usual maps o f park boundaries that accompany the legal instruments
       establishing the national parks, the Government (SLCC with MENR) will prepare maps
       covering all o f the state-owned landinthe project areas, including the other types o f PAS
       that are to be established. The total area o f the Phase 1 SDNP i s expected to be
        approximately 110,000 ha, andthe Phase 1ONP about 43,000 ha (see following table for
       details).27 An agreed map o f the park and other PASplanned for the Shah Dag area,
       accepted by both Government andthe Bank as meeting the biodiversity conservation and
       sustainable use objectives o f the project, is a prerequisite for the legal instrument
       establishing the park (which in turn i s a condition o f effectiveness for the project). In
        accordance with the Azerbaijan Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas and Objects,
       the national parks themselves will include core conservation zones, tourism zones, and
       zones for limited economic activities and for other services (e.g. tourism facilities, park
        administration.    Approval o f a park Charter for SDNP, acceptable to the Bank, is a
        condition o f disbursement for project funds directly related to supporting park
       management, such as buildings and equipment for the SDNP and ONP Administrations.
       The process andtimetable for establishing the surrounding PAShas not been specified or
       made a condition o f effectiveness or disbursement. However, it is expected that this will
       be completedwithin the first two years o f the project. Project funds will be available for
       mapping andother activities for this purpose.

        Phase 2: over the next few years, it is expected that the two national parks will be
        expanded by incorporating some additional areas o f pasture, which are identified through
        detailed inventories as being particularly important for biodiversity protection or

      ecological functions (erosion control, ecological restoration, migration corridors, etc.)
      and requiring a higher degree of protection. At the same time, it is expected that the
      relevant legislation (Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas, Land Code, etc.) will be
      amended to include specific provisions to allow grazing, residence and other land uses
      within national parks, in accordance with PA management plans and regulations. This
      will create the legal basis for Phase 3.

      Phase 3: after the legal framework has been established, the national parks and/or other
      PASmay be fUrther expanded by including municipal and/or privately owned lands,
      based on voluntary agreements negotiated between the land owners and the park
      Administrations to manage these lands as part o fthe park (without transfer o f ownership).
      The main objective would be to improve effectiveness o f park management by reducing
      fragmentation (e.g., in cases where the municipal and private lands are enclaves within
      the park boundaries).       Municipal and privately owned lands within the proposed park
      areas total about 80,000 ha for SDNP, and 16,600 ha for ON?. If all o f this additional
      area is successfully brought into be managed as part o f the park or other protected areas
      (without transfer o f ownership), the PA system could eventually cover over 343,000 ha in
      the Shah Dag area and 137,000 in the O W area. However, it is not expected that this
      process would be completed during the life of the project: the target for the project is to
      incorporate25% ofthis land.

Residents o f sixteen Districts (rayons) in the Shah Dag area, and four rayons in the ONP area,
hold grazing rights within the summer pastures that will be established as PAS. A number o f
central government Ministries and agencies also have mandates and programs in the area. The
project will provide technical and financial support to establish institutional structures to provide
for the effective participation and coordination o f all these stakeholders (see Annex 6). MENR
will provide appropriate staffing for the two national parks Administrations and surrounding PA
Administrations. This will include sections for forest and rangeland management; socio-
economics, community participation and education; park planning and ecological monitoring;
tourism development; enforcement; etc. The project will support measures to modemize and
improve park and other PA management capacity and increase participation o f stakeholders in
both parks.

Specific activities to be financed under this component include: delineation and demarcation o f
park and other PA boundaries; technical assistance and training for institutional capacity
building; forest and meadow/pasture inventories, preparation o f zoning and management plans
and annual operating plans for the park and ecological management plans for the PA networks;
implementation o f management plans, including rehabilitation and limited construction o f
critical infrastructure needed for park management and supporting activities (e.g. tourism) and
essential equipment; establishment and implementation o f an ecological monitoring system; and
operating costs. Incremental GEF resources provide the opportunity to establish and test new
institutional structures and address new mandates, such as building partnerships with local
communities and other stakeholders). The component will be implemented by the Ministry o f
Ecology, Department o f Biodiversity Conservation and Development o f Specially Protected
Natural Areas (DBCDSPNA), and the SDNP and ONP Administrations, with support and
assistancefrom the Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

COMPONENT2. Community-level investment in sustainable agriculture and natural resource
management (US$4.48million):

This component will assist communities in the project area to shift their traditional agricultural
and natural resource use practices towards more modemand efficient approaches that place less
pressure on natural resources andnatural ecosystems. The main focus is on livestock husbandry,
which is the economic mainstay o f local communities, and also one o f the greatest threats to the
area's biodiversity and ecological systems, particularly in the vulnerable high elevation summer
pastures. Inparticular, the aim is to promote dairy cattle, which are typically kept close to home
andalso offer the greatest potential for a return on investment. Assistance will also be provided
for restoring and improving the management o f badly degraded municipal pastures close to
villages. Communities will develop village investment plans, drawing upon a menu o f options
(fodder seeds, fertilizers, agricultural equipment, small scale irrigation, milk collection and
storage facilities, artificial insemination services, fencing material for pasture management, etc.).
In addition to fodder production, access to agricultural machinery and irrigation will help
villagers to increase production o fpotatoes andother marketable crops.

Local demand for wood inthe SDNP area is estimated to be as much as 20 times the sustainable
off-take level2*, with the gap being met through illegal, unsustainable cutting. The project will

28100,000m3per year, comparedwith5,000 m3per year.


                                                   42

support community-based reforestation and management o f currently treeless or badly degraded
municipal and State forest lands as an alternative source o f wood, and will support
demonstrations o f the benefits o f more efficient heating stoves and development and promotion
of alternative sources o f energy.

The project will target 55 villages, representing about half o f the total population in the two
parks29. The villages have been selected on the basis o f criteria, including their dependence on
the natural resources o f the park areas (and consequently the threat they currently represent to the
park and their potential to be negatively affected by access restrictions imposed by park
management); the amount o f cultivatable land potentially available for forage production, etc.
The selected villages have been grouped into Village Clusters (VC) to facilitate project
implementation (see Annex 6). The V C will receive Technical Assistance and funding, in the
form o f block grants, to prepare and implement V C Investment Plans, drawing upon the menu o f
options described above. The V C InvestmentPlans will be approved by committees comprising
representatives o f local and national governments, and implemented by locally based
implementing agencies selected by the communities in accordance with criteria set out in the
Project ImplementationManual. Inaddition to support for implementation o f the V C Investment
Plan, two fuel-efficient stoves would be allocated to each village, to be put inappropriate public
buildingsas a demonstration o ftheir practicality andpotential for saving on fuel expenses.

Specific activities to be financed under this component include: technical assistance for
preparation o f the V C Investment Plans; small scale works, goods and services required to
implement the Investment Plans, provision o f fuel-efficient stoves, and facilities and operating
costs for the local implementing agencies.

COMPONENT3: Rural Enterprise Development (US$I.95 million)

Inthe past there were some medium-sized factories andworkshops for carpet-making, leather
work and other handicrafts, juice-processing, etc. in the project areas, but these activities have
virtually disappeared since independence.              Tourism is also very limited, with few modem
accommodations and services (mainly owned by people from outside the area). Component 3
aims to stimulate economic diversification inthe areas by assisting local entrepreneurs to obtain
the technical and business information and advice and the financing they need to start or expand
small and medium commercial enterprises. The information and advice will be provided by
small mobile business advisory teams funded by the project that will assist interested clients to
identify and assess the viability of commercial ventures, prepare business plans and obtain
financing.    These teams will also help PIU and Government to identify and alleviate policy,
regulatory andother types o f constraints to SME development.

The project will provide matching grants o f about $2000-$10,000, based on an independent
evaluation o f the business plans. When the business plans call for a larger amount or longer term
financing, the advisors will help the prospective entrepreneurs apply for loans from existing
banks or other credit institutions. The grants will be evaluated for technical and financial
feasibility by a Grant Administrator contracted by the PIU, and for environmental soundness by


29Including 67% o f the population inside the proposed SDNF', and 29% of the population o f villages inside or close
to the boundaries ofthe proposed ONF'

MENR, and will be approved by an Awarding Committee comprised o f representatives o f
MENR, the Ministry o f Economic Development (Agency for Support o f Entrepreneurship), the
Ministry of Agriculture (Agricultural Credits Agency), the Ministry o f Youth, Sports and
Tourism, and the Ministry o f Finance. For both the technical assistance and matching grants,
priority will be given to activities that are linkedto national park objectives, including tourism-
related enterprises, alternative energy and energy efficiency, and value-added processing o f
sustainably harvested (non-threatened) natural products such as fruits and nuts. Enterprises that
support Component 2 objectives (e.g. processing o f dairy products) will also be particularly
encouraged. Proposals from the poorest villages, or with a strong public goods element, will
receive a higherproportion o f grant financing, up to 100% insome cases.

Given the time and resources available, the objective is not to achieve a large scale
transformation o f local economies, but to catalyze a shift by stimulating interest, demonstrating
and testing different types o f business opportunities, building local understanding and capacity
for business planning and development, and creating an environment that will encourage other
SME programs and micro-credit institutions to increase their presence inthe project areas. The
evaluation criteria for grant proposals will include the objective o f achieving a good geographic
distributiono fthe funds withinthe project areas.

COMPONENT 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Communications
(US$1.98million)

This component will support overall project management and administration, including the
staffing and operating costs o f a central Project Implementation Unit and three regional PCUs
(two inShah Dag area, one inOrdubadarea). The branch offices are needed because o fthe size,
remoteness, difficulty o f access and poor communications infrastructure o f the project areas.
The PIUwill be responsible for procurement, financial management and general administration,
including facilitating inter-Ministerial and inter-agency coordination, for developing and
implementing a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system addressing both project operations
and impacts, for ensuring the implementation o f the project Environmental Management Plan
and the Social Mitigation Plan that will be developed during the first year; and for progress
reporting. For Component 1, the M&Esystem will make use o f GEF tracking tools for Protected
Area management effectiveness andfor biodiversity conservation inproduction landscapes.

The PIU will also coordinate several cross-cutting activities. The first is the development and
implementation o f a communications plan (in collaboration with local authorities and NGOs) to
increase awareness and knowledge o f the project and its objectives and activities at all levels.
The second is a detailed socio-economic study, to be carried out inthe first year (with a shorter
follow-up at the mid-tenn), which will carry further the assessment work undertaken during
project preparation and enable the PIUto refine the baseline data and targets for socio-economic
impacts of the project.     The study will also assess the effectiveness o f project design and
implementation structures for targeting project benefits and mitigation measures to potentially
affected people, and will develop a Social Mitigation Plan as required to ensure that such
measures are effectively integrated into project implementation and monitoring.          The third
activity, to be carried out inclose collaborationwith the Ministryo f Youth, Sports and Tourism,
will be facilitating and coordinating the development o f a cross-sectoral tourism development

                           AZERBAIJAN: RuralEnvironmentProject


Detailed implementation arrangements for all project components will be outlined in a Project
ImplementationManual (PIM), which will be referenced inthe Grant and Credit Agreements, A
draft PIM will be reviewed at appraisal, and completion and approval o f the PIM by MENR and
the World Bank will be a condition o f effectiveness ofthe project.

Component 1

The Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Development o f Specially Protected Natural
Areas (DBCDSPNA, or Biodiversity Department) within MENR has overall responsibility for
Specially ProtectedNature Areas (SPNA) inAzerbaijan. However, Biodiversity Department i s a
small, central policy and coordination unit, not an implementing body. In Azerbaijan, each
SPNA is established as a separate legal institution with its own Charter, which lays out its
objectives, rules and regulations and legally establishes its management body (here called the
parkAdministration). Zakazniks are oftenplacedunderthe responsibility o fthe Administrations
of adjacent Zapovedniks or national parks, while other types of PASare administered through
different mechanisms based on their category and how they are established. The MENR has
responsibilities for all types o f specially protected natural areas, even where it is not directly
responsible for administration.

The park Administrations for SDNP and the expanded ONP (SDNPA and ONPA, respectively)
will face new types o f management challenges associated meeting new objectives such as
tourism development and community participation, and coordinating ecological management
over the expanded area. The ONPA will be strengthened with some additional staff as well as
training and technical assistance. Because o f the large area o f the SDNP, it i s envisaged that it
will be divided into two or three sub-regions, each with a Deputy Director reporting to the
overall park Director. One o f the sub-regional headquarters will also serve as the overall park
headquarters.

The existing SPNAs in the project areas will be dissolved as separate legal entities and
incorporatedinto the SDNP and ONP, inmost cases as core conservation areas, along with their
staff and facilities, based on an evaluation o f needs and capacities. Similarly, the six State
Enterprises for Forest Conservation and Restoration3' in the SDNP area will be dissolved and
responsibility for managing these forests (along with some or all o f the existing Department
staff) will be transferred to a forest management unit within SDNP Administration structure.
The management structures for other PAS to be established in the project areas will be
determined in accordance with the Law on Specially Protected Natural Areas, based on their
legal categories and objectives andthe types o f landandresources they include.

In each project area, a Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG) will be established to provide a
mechanism for stakeholder participation inthe preparation o f park management plans, including


30official managementunits of the State forest, under the MENRDepartment of Forest Extension and Development


                                                        48

infrastructure development, tourism and other use, and identification o f additional areas to be
included in the park.     In addition, an Ecological Coordination Committee (ECC) will be
established for the PA network ineach project area. The ECC members will include (inaddition
to the park Directors) key stakeholders such as local representatives o f the Ministry o f Ecology
and Natural Resources, Ministry o f Agriculture, State Land and Cartography Committee and
Ministry of Youth, Sport and Tourism; the Rayon Executive Authorities, the municipalities,
NGOs and the private sector. Its role will be to develop approaches and plans for improving
natural resource management at the ecosystem level, in order to achieve compatibility and
synergy between management o f the parks, the other PASand the municipal and privately owned
lands in the project area. The purposes, roles and responsibilities o f the ECC and SAG will be
detailed inthe Project ImplementationManual.

As i s the case for all SPNA, the salaries and basic operating costs o f the ONP and SDNP
Administrations and administrations o f the surrounding PAS will be the responsibility o f
Government. However, the project will provide capital investment (additional facilities and
equipment), training and technical assistance, and incremental operating costs associated with
building their capacity to increase their effectiveness.     Training will also be provided for
memberso fthe SAGSand EMCCs.

Component2

Because villages in the project area are small and scattered, it is not cost-effective to deliver
goods and services to them individually. Furthermore, a critical mass o f users i s needed to make
some types o f investments (e.g. agricultural mechanization centers, milk collection equipment)
economically viable and sustainable.        Therefore, the 55 villages that will participate in
Component 2 o f the project have been grouped into 15 Village Clusters (VCs), each comprised
o f 3-5 villages. With three Technical Advisory teams working for 3 years, each V C will receive
four months o f TA support for preparation o f its V C Investment Plan. The 11VCs inthe SDNP
area four VCs in the ONP area have been selected based on criteria such as population density,
ease o f access, availability o f agricultural land for fodder crop production, and the extent to
which the villages depend on the natural resources o f the parks (and therefore represent a source
o f pressure, and at the same time are more likely to be affected by restricted access to these
resources). Annex 16 provides the list o fthe VCs and member villages for Component 2.

The institutional mechanisms for implementing the V C Investment Plans (implementing
agencies) will be selected or established by communities with assistance o f Technical Advisors,
in accordance with criteria set out inthe Project Implementation Manual (e.g. representative o f
and accountability to the communities, non-commercial, with the legal status to maintain a bank
account and hold assets on behalf o f the communities). The project support for implementation
o f V C Investment Plans will be inthe form o f grants provided to the V C implementing agency,
based on a grant agreement signed with the PIU.            The agencies will be responsible for
procurement o f goods and services, following the World Bank's Guidelines for Community
Level Procurement.      The project will provide facilities and other support required for the
operations o f the implementing agency, including training in procurement, accounting and key
technical skills. The PIU will advise, support and monitor the implementing agencies to ensure
they meet Bank and Government procurement and accountingrequirements.



                                                 49

The project will meet related capital and operating costs o f the implementing agencies for 18
months. The agencies will charge modest fees (to be indicated in the Village Investment Plans)
for use o f agricultural machinery, artificial insemination and milk collection.                      For other
investments, the communities will decide whether or not to charge fees. Any fees collected by
the implementing agencies during the 18 months o f project support for will remain in the
agency's bank account, to provide seed funds for future operations. The method for allocating
investments benefiting primarily individual farmers or small groups o f fanners, such as barn
improvement and small scale irrigation, will be agreed as part o f the V C Investment Plan. As a
general guideline, only about 25-30% o f the resources should be for investments benefiting
individual farmers or small groups, so that most o fthe resources benefit the community at large.

Component3

Implementation o f Component 3 will be contracted to business consulting firms or suitable
NGOs. While it would inprinciple be preferable to work with and build capacity among local
(long-term) technical and financial service providers, no appropriate organizations have been
identified inor close to the project areas, and it i s beyondthe scope of the project to support their
establishment.

One contractor will be engaged to establish five 2-person mobile business advisory teams (BAT),
whose responsibilities will include: (i)         preparation and dissemination o f awareness-raising and
instructional materials; (ii)one-on-one support to interested clients to identify business
opportunities and prepare business plans and grant applications; and (iii)                  where appropriate,
assisting clients to identify credit providers andprepare loan applications. It is not expected that
the BATSwill continue beyond the project: sustainability will lie inthe capacity they have built
among their client base.

A second contract will be awarded for administration o f the matching grants program. The
company or NGO selected to be the Grant Administrator will be responsible for evaluating
proposals for their technical, financial, environmental and social viability3' and passing
recommendations to an Awarding Committee (headed by the PIU); administering and
monitoring the use o f grant funds; andregular reporting to PIU on progress o f implementation o f
these activities.

Component4 (OverallProjectAdministration)

A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), established by the MENR for implementation o f the
World Bank-financed projects in the environmental sector, will have overall responsibility for
project implementation and coordination. The PIUis well experienced inmatters such as project
administration      and inter-governmental            coordination,     having     served      effectively     for
implementation o f the Urgent Environmental Investment Project. During preparation o f AREP


3'Assigning an EA category, and approving Environmental Impact Assessments (issuing environmental passports
for proposed projects) is the responsibility o f MENR, but the Grant Administrator will be responsible for ensuring
that grant proposals meet the environmental and social criteria set out in the ENEMP, which forms part o f the
Project Implementation Manual.


                                                        50

two Regional Project Coordinators were engaged (one based in the Shah Dag area, one in the
Ordubad area) to enhance communication and consultation with local stakeholders. Inview o f
the size and remoteness o f the project areas, during the implementation stage this will be
expanded to three regional offices (in Guba, Ismailli or Shemaha, and Ordubad Rayons). The
Baku-based central PIUwill provideproject-wide services such as planning, procurement (for all
goods, works and services except those falling under community-basedprocurement, Component
2, and under Commercial Practices, Component 3), financial management and accounting,
monitoring and evaluation, progress reporting, training on project implementation procedures,
and cross-sectoral coordination and government liaison.         It will also be responsible for
implementation of cross-cutting activities under Component 4 (socio-economic impact
assessment and preparation and implementation o f a Social Mitigation Plan; coordinating
development o f an integrated tourism development plan for the Shah Dag area, etc.).          The
regional offices will consist o f a local coordinator and an assistant, and will be responsible for
awareness raising and communications at the local level, day-to-day implementation support
(including disbursement of grant funds under Component 2), organizing field visits, data
collection for monitoring, organizing meetingsof the V C InvestmentPlan Approval Committees,
etc. These offices will also serve as a home base for the long-term technical service providers
underComponents 2 and3.

1.      Summaryof the FinancialManagementAssessment

ExecutiveSummaryandConclusion

An assessment to determine whether financial management arrangements at the central Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) within the Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources (MENR) are
acceptable to IDA was undertaken in February 2005. The PIU staff have functional experience
inmanagingWorld Bankprojects, having implementedthe ongoingUrgentEnvironmentProject
and GEF and PHRD grants. The assessment concluded that the existing central PKJ that will
have the overall responsibility for Project financial management, including consolidated
accounting and financial reporting, Credit and Grants disbursements, internal controls, and
auditing arrangements satisfies minimum financial management requirements.             However, to
further strengthen the existing 1C Accounting system, further customization o f the Chart o f
Accounts for the proposed project will be required to accommodate all project components

A detailed financial management assessment questionnaire is included in the project files. A
report on the Review o f FinancialManagement Systems i s also included inproject files.

CountryIssues

The Azerbaijan Country Financial Accountability Assessment diagnostic work carried out in
2002 recommended accounting and auditing regulatory and institutional reforms to increase
accountability and good governance in the country. The proposed reforms are addressed in the
proposed three Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs). Inparticular, enactment o f the new
Accounting Law and related secondary regulation mandating use o f International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) for public interest entities and govemmental enterprises and
International Public Sector Standards (IPSA) for the public sector. The Law will assure greater
transparency and accountability o f public funds. Inparallel, the enactment o f the new Audit Law
and establishment of regulatory and institutional frameworks for the Chamber of Accounts, the
Country's Supreme Audit Institution and the Chamber o f Auditors, the audit profession
regulators, and standard-setters will provide greater transparency and comparability o f financial
transactions.

2.      FinancialManagementAssessment

(a) ImplementationArrangements

The IDA Credit would be lent to the Government o f Azerbaijan.             The Credit would be
supplemented with GEF and PHRD Grants that would be administered by IBRD for project
implementation. The PIU within the Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources will have the
overall responsibility for project implementation and coordination. Specifically, the PIUwill be
responsible for: (i)  financial management arrangements including preparing and maintaining
consolidated project accounts, and financial reporting; (ii)   Credit and Grants disbursements
including administration o fthe Special Account(s) for the Credit and the Grants, Project Account
for counterpart funds, and local bank accounts to be opened in the three participating regions;
(iii)auditingarrangements; (iv)procurementarrangements; and(v)monitoring, evaluation and
providing supervision support to the regions during project implementation. In order to ensure
focused attention on the community-level investment in sustainable agriculture and natural
resource management, Regional Offices (Project Coordination Units: PCU) will be opened (two
in the Shah Dag area, one inthe Ordubad area). For implementation of community activities
under Component 2, the project will provide grants to the local implementing agencies identified
by Village Cluster Committees to implementtheir VC Investment Plans, onthe basis of contracts
signed betweenthe identified implementing agency and the PIU. For Component 3, the PIUwill
contract a firm or a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) to serve as the Grant Administrator
on its behalf. The PIUwill be responsible for the coordination o f the day-to-day activities o f the
Regional Offices, the V C implementing agencies and the Grant Administrator. It will maintain
proper books o f accounts for the project, allocate funds to the decentralized locations based on
identified and justified implementation needs, and closely supervise and monitor this
decentralized flow o f funds.

(b) Staffing

The central PIU is a fully operational central unit with competent and experienced staff,
including: PIUDirector/Project Manager, two Component Managers (one for Component 1, one
for Components 2 and 3), Chief Accountant, Procurement specialist, Accounting Assistant, and
Procurement Assistant, all with extensive expertise and experience inimplementing World Bank
projects. Other PIU staff include a Communications Specialist, Interpreter/Translator, Director's
AssistanUSecretary and two drivers.      Each o f the three PCUs will be staffed by a PCU
Coordinator and an Assistant, two o f whom will have skills in financial management and one in
engineerindcivil works or another appropriate technical area. The PCUs will perform project
financial management work on the community-level operations - check and verify invoices,
submit full documentation to the PIUfor payment, andprepare andsubmit periodic reportsto the
PIU. Financingmechanismandreporting formats for the Project andcommunity driven activities
will be agreedwith the PIUandthe Regions andincluded inthe Project ImplementationManual.
The risk o f Regional Offices staff not performing a strong monitoring role i s high. To mitigate
this risk, technical advisors and focused training will be provided to the Regional staff in the
initial stages to bringthem up-to-date on the Bank and Project requirements. Additional training
in financial management and disbursements will be provided to the PIU staff during project
implementation.



                                                53

(c) Flow of Funds

The IDA Credit of US$S.O million, GEF Grant o fUS$5.0 million, and PHRD Grant o fUS$2.72
million would be disbursed under Bank's traditional disbursement procedures. In most cases,
payments for contracts would be financed from one source when normal procedures for payment
would apply. However, there would be cases when contracts need to be paid from more thanone
source when it would be necessary to transfer hnds from the respective Special Accounts to the
sub-account (Transit Account), and make payments from that account. It would therefore be
critical that the funds flow and transaction details are clear and the payment out o f the transit
account to the contractor/supplier i s made within a day or two o f the funds coming into the
Transit Account from Special Accounts funds. Funds flow arrangements are clearly written up
in detail in the Project Implementation Manual.        At the time the PIU submits withdrawal
applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts, they would be required to provide not
only the bank statement showing the transaction from the Special Accounts to the transit
account, but also the bank statement o f the transit account showing the multiple transactions into
it that ledto the single transaction out of it for payment to a supplier or provider. Inaddition to
the Special Accounts and Transit Account, a Project Account for Government counterpart funds
(US$1.39 million), would be opened at the IBA for project implementation. To facilitate
implementation o f community-level activities, three local bank accounts will be opened in the
local branches o f the IBA, one in each participating region.         The implementing agencies
responsible for the implementation o f the community-level investment activities under
Component 2 will manage the local bank accounts to finance capital investment and operations
costs on behalf o f the village clusters. The recipients o f matching grants under Component 3
will open bank accounts for into which boththe grant funds and their matching contributions are
to be deposited.

The following Grant disbursement procedures for the community-level investment component
will be applied:

     0)      The implementing agencies for the community level operations will manage the local
            bank accounts intheir respective regions to finance capital investments for the village
             clusters andoperating costs.

     (ii) Initialadvancetothelocalbankaccountsandreplenishmentoftheaccountswouldbe
             made based on agreed milestones to be specified inthe Investment Plan andthe Grant
             Agreement betweenthe PTUandthe implementing agency.

     (iii) Replenishment to the localbankaccounts wouldbemadeonbasis ofsimplified
             reports showing sources and uses o f funds, supporting documents including bank
             statements. The replenishment package would be verified by the Regional Offices
             and endorsed by the PIU before replenishment o f the local bank accounts. Detailed
             instructions on flow o f funds to the community level outlined in the Project
             ImplementationManual.




                                                   54

For the rural enterprise development component, the PIU will award and manage contracts for
providing the mobile business advisory teams (BAT) and for administration o f the matching
grants program. The Grant Administrator will receive two contracts: one for the administration
fees and one for the grant funds themselves. This will make it possible to separate the funds
according to their purpose, and to ensure that only the grant administration fees are subject to
taxation.

As a result o f multi-layered control system and managing community driven development
operations, the risks associated with flow o f funds is high. However, the actual implementation
of controls would be monitored very closely by the central PIU, technical advisors, and Bank
supervision missions. An operational review carried out by independent consultants/auditors
under terms of reference acceptable to IDA would be carried out during the project Mid-term
Review. The main objective o f the operation review would be to: (i)assess operations controls
relating to the effectiveness and efficient o f the use o f resources; (ii)
                                                                          financial reporting controls
relating to the preparation o f reliable financial reports; and (iii) compliance controls relating to
the implementing agencies' compliance with applicable regulations andprocedures as outlined in
the CooperationAgreement and inthe Project ImplementationManual. The PIUwouldhave the
overall responsibility for operation, maintenance and administration of the Special Accounts, the
Project Account, and the transfer o f funds to the local bank accounts. Detailedprocedures on the
flow o f funds and documentation are outlined inthe Project Implementation Manual.

(d) AccountingandReportingSystem

The centralPIUhas installed a financial accounting and reporting software (lC, Version 7.7)that
is successfully used in the ongoing                  and in accounting and reporting o f the two
preparation grants for the proposed Rural Environment Project. The Chart o f Accounts will
however require further customizingto accommodate all project components. It will classify the
project by components, reflect the sources o f funds by financier and different types o f
expenditures to enable the PIU to provide information on the receipts and uses o f funds and
produce financial reports comparing budget with actual sources and uses of funds at any given
time.    The system will have adequate security levels and fully meet Bank's reporting
requirements. The existing format o f the Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will also be
updated include all project components classified inthe Chart o f Accounts. A system that fully
meets Bank requirementswill be inplace prior to Board.

The PIURegional Offices will prepare andmaintain simple accounts and financial reporting in a
format to be agreed with the PIU and the Bank. They will submit full documentation and simple
reports on monthly basis which would be verified by the PIU for completeness, eligibility, and
then recorded inthe PIU's accounting system. Thus, the PIU's books o f accounts would reflect
consolidated accounting for the project activities.

(e) AccountingPoliciesandProcedures

Accounting policies and procedures are set out in the existing Financial Management Manual.
This Manual will be updated to include implementation procedures for the proposed Rural

32IDA-financed Urgent EnvironmentalInvestment Project


                                                   55

Environment Project and will form part o f the Project Implementation Manual. The updated
procedures will include flow o f funds, flow o f accounting information and records between the
PIU, the Regional Offices, andthe implementing agencies for the community level operations (to
be determined).

(f)InternalControls

The PIU has the overall responsibility to ensure accounting and administration controls are
adhered to, and are in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the PIM. All project
expenditures payments (except operating costs for the community-level investment component)
will be made at the PIU level, and all procurement procedures including contract awards will be
carried out at the PIU, thus minimizing control risks. The risk associated with internal control
(the effectiveness and efficiency o f operations and compliance with laws and regulations) is
assessed as high at this stage. Initial frequent monitoring and supervision o f Regional Offices
and implementingagencies will assure provide greater assurance on reliability and effectiveness
o f controls.

(g) PlanningandBudgeting

The PIU will prepare the annual budget for the project, as part o f the Annual Work Plan (AWP),
which will be reviewed and approved by the World Bank. The Component Managers will be
responsible for ensuring that the activities under their respective components are reflected inthe
AWP and in progress reports, including the Annual Operational Plans o f the Shah Dag and
Ordubad national parks, the Village Cluster Investment Plans and the portfolio o f grants
provided under Component 3.

3.      AuditingArrangements

InternalAudit. The PIUhas no properly functioning internal audit function inthe real sense of
examining, evaluating and monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness o f accounting and internal
control systems.

External Audit. The project financial statements will be audited annually by independent
auditors in accordance with standards and terms o f reference acceptable to IDA. Acceptable
auditing standards are International Auditing Standards (IAS) issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board o f the International Federation o f Accountants. The
scope for the audit will be determined by the Borrower in agreement with IDA, adapted to
project risks, and will include audit o f the Project Financial Statements, the Special Accounts,
disbursements made on basis o f Statements o f Expenditure (SOEs), the PHRD and GEF Grants
and the PIU internal controls. The audit report will be submitted to the Bank no later than six
months after end of each year audited. The contract for the audit would be awarded during the
first year o f project implementation and extended subject to satisfactory performance. The cost
of the audit will be eligible for financing under the Credit.




                                                  56

4. ReportingandMonitoring

The PlUwould maintain separate financial records for the Rural Environment Project, and would
ensure appropriate accounting for the h d s provided. They would prepare and submit quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) in an agreed format 45 days after end o f each quarter.
Theformat and timing is to be agreed at negotiations.

The FMRswould include:

        1. Project Sources and Uses ofFunds Statement
        2. Uses o f Fundsby Project Component Statement
        3. Project Balance Sheet
        4. Special Account Statement, and Local Bank Account Statement
        5. Reconciliation o f Credit Accounts Balances Statement
        6. Output Monitoring Reports
        7. Procurement Process Monitoring (Consultants) Statement
        8. Procurement Process Monitoring (Goods and Works) Statement

5. RiskAnalysis

From a financial management perspective, the proposed project i s considered a medium-risk
project. A summary of consolidated risk assessment for the project are outlined in Table 1
below. The key staff o f PIU have experience in implementing Bank-financed projects having
implemented the ongoing Urgent Environmental Project and project implementation grants. A
set o f appropriate accounting procedures and internal controls including authorization and
segregation o f duties have been instituted and documented in the Operational Manual, but
require updating for the proposed project. The PIU experience and support o f the technical
advisors will mitigate risks any risks that might adversely affect project implementation.

 5. Internal Audit                     High        The PIUhas no internal audit function. However,
                                                   weak overall internal audit function inthe country

 OverallInherentRisk                   Moderate



The following financial management risks could adversely affect project implementation:

     1. Low implementation capacity at the region level.

    2. Wherever possible local bank accounts would be opened and maintained at the local
    branches o f International Bank o f Azerbaijan (IBA). Where no local branches o f IBA are
    present, the weak bankingfacilities at other commercial banks would have a negative impact
    to the implementationo fthe community-level project activities

6.      Impact of ProcurementArrangements Based on diagnostic work carried out under
                                                   -
the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) issued in 2002, the following key factors
have a direct effect on the financial management arrangements:

Legal Framework and Enforcement Regime.                Azerbaijan has introduced a new Public
Procurement Law (PPL) that is based extensively on the United Nations Commission for
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model. The PPL has set up a three-tier review system
that consists o f an internal administrative review by the State Procurement Agency (SPA) and
judicial review. Perceptiono f the courts' ability to deal with procurement disputes is poor, thus
jeopardizing the SPA'S level o f confidence andoverall transparency inthe review process,

Regulatory Functions. The SPA has been vested with the procurement regulatory functions and
has shown willingness to ensure compliance with the Public Procurement Law (PPL). The SPA
has competent andwell-trained staff.




                                                 58

InstitutionaZ Capacity. The country lacks a planned training system for procurement. Staff who
undertake procurement tasks often do so without sufficient or any formal training.

7.       Supervision Plan Financial Management supervision would be conducted every six
                           -
months to monitor progress of project implementation. The risk-based financial management
supervision would pay particular attention to: (i)flow o f funds arrangements to effectively
support the project's objectives; (ii)
                                     review o f Projects FMRs and audited financial statements,
including follow up on any remedial actions recommended in the Management Letter issued by
the Auditors.

                               B: DisbursementArrangements

The Credit and Grants funds would be disbursed over a period o f four years. Disbursements
would be based on the new Country Financing Parameters for the Republic of Azerbaijan, and
disbursed under the Bank's traditional disbursements methods (reimbursements with full
documentation, Statements o f Expenditure (SOEs), direct payments to third parties and special
commitments). The allocation of Credit and Grantproceeds are detailed inthe tables below.

total amounts and categories to which such retroactive financing will apply, will be agreed at
negotiations.

Payment made for expenditures for goods and works for national park management (Category
l(a) inSchedule 1) will be conditional on the Borrower having approved the charter of Shah Dag
National Park, acceptable to the Association. The criteria for acceptability will be agreed at
negotiations and recorded inthe Minutes o fNegotiations.

Special Account(s)

To facilitate timely project implementation, the PIUwould maintain three Special Accounts and
one sub-account to the Special Accounts (Transit Account) in a commercial Bank acceptable to
the Bank33to finance project expenditures from the IDA Credit, the GEF Grant and the PHRD
Grant. In addition, the Borrower would open a Project Account for Government counterpart
funds.

Authorized Allocations. The `Authorized Allocation" of the each o f the Special Accounts should
generally not exceed 10%of the total Credit/Grants amount, and would be set as follows:

    IDA Credit. Authorized Allocation to the Special Account would be set at USS800,OOO to be
    withdrawn from the IDA Credit Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to
    paragraph l(c) Schedule 5 o f the Credit Agreement. However, the Authorized Allocation
    would initially limited to US$400,000 until the aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the
    Credit Account plus the total amount o f all outstanding special commitments are equal to or
    exceed the equivalent o f SDR 1 million.

    GEF Grant. Authorized Allocation to the Special Account would be US$500,000 to be
    withdrawn from the GEF Grant Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to
    paragraph l(c) Schedule 5 o f the Grant Agreement. However, the Authorized Allocation
    would initiallybe limitedto US$250,000 untilthe aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the
    Grant Account plus the total amount o f all outstanding special commitments are equal to or
    exceed the equivalent o f US$1million.

    PHRD Grant. Authorized Allocation to the Special Account would be US$250,000 to be
    withdrawn from the PHRD Grant Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant
    to paragraph l(c) Schedule 5 o f the Grant Agreement.

Community level activities would be financed through Grants from IDA and GEF. Funds would
be transferred from the respective Special Accounts to local bank accounts to be opened in the
localbranches o fthe IBA, inthe participating regions.

                            AZERBAIJAN: RuralEnvironmentProject


Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; "Guidelines:
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y 2004; and the
provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure
categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed by the Credit, the
different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification,
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and
the Bank inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.

Procurement of Works: Works, estimated to cost US$600,000 and more will be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Works estimated to cost less than US$600,000
and more than US$lOO,OOO will be procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB).
Smaller works estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO each will be procured through Shopping
procedures.

Procurementof Goods: Goods estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more will be procured through
ICB. Goods estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO will be procured through Shopping on the
basis o f at least three written quotations obtained from qualified suppliers.

Selection of Consultants: Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than
US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f national consultants in
accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines. Consultancy
services to be provided by consultancy firms estimated to cost US$200,000 or more will be
procured through Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method. Consultancy services to be
provided by consultancy firms estimated to cost less than US$200,000 may be procured through
Consultants' Qualifications (CQ) method, or by other methods (Selection Under a FixedBudget,
Least-cost Selection, Single Source Selection) for services which the Bank agrees meet the
relevant criteria under the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. The consultancy firm for project audit
will be selected through Least Cost Selection (LCS) method. The contract for design and
implementation o f public awareness campaign will be awarded through Fixed Budget Selection
(FBS). Individual Consultants will be selected in accordance with Section V o f the Consultancy
Guidelines.

CommunityParticipationProcurement(CPP): Procurement o f goods, works and services for
community level investments (Component 2) to be implemented by the communities in each
Village Clusters shall be carried out by Community Participation Procurement method in
accordance with paragraph 3.17 o f the Procurement Guidelines and in accordance with
procurement procedures defined inProject Implementation Manual, prepared in accordance with
the Manual for Conducting Very Small Value Procurements under World Bank/IDA/ Small
Grants, Loans, Credits (June 2004).

Commercial Practices (CP): Procurement o f goods, works and services for rural enterprise
development (Component 3) to be implemented by individual entrepreneurs or small and
medium sized enterprises shall be carried out through Commercial Practices established in the
country in accordance with paragraph 3.12 o f the Procurement Guidelines and in accordance
with procurement procedures defined inProject ImplementationManual.

The PCUs, with support from the PIU, will provide advice and hands-on training to the
beneficiaries and will also provide standard documents and contracts for their use. The PCU will
prior review the first five contracts from each Village Cluster and all contract estimated to cost
more than $10,000. The PCUs will also carry out ex-post review o f contracts carried out by
beneficiaries, not only regarding procurement, but also technical and financial aspects. The PIU
will supervise the work carried out by the PCUs and provide prior reviews on any contract
estimated to cost above $50,000.

Operating Costs: Operating costs for the PIU, PCUs and National Park Administrations, and
administrations o f the surrounding PAS,covering office rent, supplies, utilities, operating and
maintenance expenditures o f office equipment and vehicle, per diems and local travel costs, costs
o f consultative meetings or workshops, communications costs, etc. and will be disbursed on the
basis o f annual budgets to be prepared by the implementingagencies and agreed with the World
Bank.

The Bank's Guidelines, Standard BiddingDocuments to be used for each procurement method,
as well as Consultant Selection documents were provided to the implementing agency during the
appraisal mission and the updated documents are available inthe Bank's external web-site.

B. Assessment ofthe agency's capacityto implementprocurement

A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established under the Ministry o f Ecology and Natural
Resources (MENR) will have the overall responsibility for project implementation and
coordination including planning, procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation
etc. The PIU i s well experienced in project management and implementation, having served for
the implementation o f ongoing Urgent Environmental Investment Project financed by the Bank.
The PIU is staffed by qualified experts on planning, monitoring and evaluation, procurement,
financial management and technical coordination. The procurement activities will be under the
responsibility o f PIU, which has one full-time procurement expert and one full-time procurement
assistant recruited on competitive basis as individual consultant and they will be working closely
with procurement staff assigned by the Ministry.

An assessment of the capacity o f the ImplementingAgency to implement procurement actions
for the project has been carried out by Elmas Arisoy, Sr. Procurement Specialist inMarch 2005.
The assessment reviewed the organizational structure o fMENRfor implementing the project and
possible implementationarrangements.

The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the project have been
identified and include the following:



                                                64

  (a) At the country level, a comprehensive analysis o f the public procurement system in
  Azerbaijan was carried out during the Country Procurement Assessment review (CPAR) in
  June 2003. The Public Procurement Law was adopted on December 27, 2001. The Law i s
  inspired to a great extend by UNCITRAL model law and consistent with international best
  practices. Based on the analysis o f legislative framework, effectiveness o f regulatory
  institutions, the strengths of enforcement regime, the capacity o f institutional and human
  resources, performance o f Bank financed projects and the threat o f corruption, the CPAR
  found that the public procurement environment inAzerbaijan is mediumto highrisk.

  (b)   PIU has experience in implementation o f Bank financed project (namely Urgent
  Environmental Investment Project). MENR will also assign at least one person for
  procurement, who will be working with procurement staff in PIU. This arrangement would
  help capacity buildingwithin the Ministryand will also help mainstreamingwith the existing
  structure o f the Government.

  (c)   The overall project will be managed by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
  established in MENR and the PIU will be responsible for the procurement activities except
  the following components:

        - Component 2: Procurement under community level investments will be implemented
           by the implementingagencies chosenbythe communities, and

        - Component 3: Procurements under rural enterprise developments will be
           implementedbybeneficiary enterprises.

The corrective measures which have been agreed are as follows:

  (a) The procurement file containing up to date procurement documents (guidelines, manuals,
  templates o f procurement notices, standard biddingdocuments for procurement o f goods and
  works, standard request for proposal documents for consultants' services, evaluation report
  formats, regional and simplified procurement documents etc.) is provided to PIU at the time
  o f Appraisal Mission. The PIU is recommended to visit the Bank's web-site frequently to
  ensure usingthe most updated procurement documents.

  (b) The Project Launch Workshop will have a specific session on Procurement Training for
  the PIU staff.

  (c)   The procurement staff o f PIU and the Ministry will attend procurement trainings on
  Bank's procurement procedures given by ILO in Turin and/or by the Bank at the beginning
  of the project and will attend additional courses to improve and update their procurement
  knowledge, especially inCommunity Participation Procurement.

  (d) Bank procurement specialist will be a member o f the project team throughout the project
  cycle. During project implementation, the Bank procurement specialist shall involve in the
  supervision missions.



                                             65

The overall project risk for procurement i s highrisk.

C. ProcurementPlan

The Borrower developed a procurement plan for project implementation which provides the
basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between borrower and the task
team during appraisal. The procurement plan is available in the project's database and in the
Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the task team
annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity.

D. Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended every six months supervision
missions to visit the field to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

                                 Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
                              AZERBAIJAN: Rural EnvironmentProject34


The economic analysis o f the project suggests an economic rate o f return o f 26%, a net present
value o f US$44 million and a cost:benefit ratio o f 3.5.                    These figures exclude potentially
significant long-term benefits from reduced flooding and sedimentation, and non-marketed
benefits potentially accruing to expatriates and visitors to Azerbaijan and the intemational
community as a whole through improved biodiversity.                          The financial analysis indicates a
financial rate o f retum o f 23%, a net present value o f US$36 million and a cost:benefit ratio of
3.1. Financial benefits will accrue from increased profit associated with tourist visitor
expenditure, potential park visitor fees, maintenance o f revenues from sheep grazing over the
long term (as pasture degradation is halted and reversed), increased yields from cow milk,
enhanced crop yields, sustainable wood harvesting and profits from new and enhanced small
businesses.

The increased profit associated with tourist visitor expenditure assumes that currently there are
250,000 visits to the Shah Dag National Park area each year, and 50,000 to the Ordubad NP,
increasing by 2.5% per year specifically as a result o f the project, with a 20% profit level and a
5% increase in spend per visit due to the project. This results in a present value o f US$5.6
million over a 40-year period. Over the same 40-year period and assuming the same visitor
numbers, potential present value park visitor fees (excluding collection costs) could be around
US$1.8 million. This assumes visitor fees o f US$0.5 per national and US$5 per intemational
visitor introduced 3 years after project completion. It is assumed possible to capture fees only
for 50% of all park visits, and that collection costs are 50% o f collected visitor fees.

Assuming that the project results insignificantly improved pasture grazing controls, returns from
sheep grazing will be retained rather than continuing to decline. The resultingretainedrevenues
from sheep grazing over 40 years could be inthe order o f US$40 million (present value). This i s
based on the estimate o f 2.5 million sheep currently grazing inthe pastures. It also assumes that
"without the project" sheep grazing numbers will initially continue to grow at 5% per year for 4
years, and then decline by 10% per year, due to decreased productivity o f degraded pastures.
With the project, sheep numbersare projectedto continue to grow at 2%per year for 4 years, and
then decline by 5% per year as a result o f measures to reduce the total numbers down to a
sustainable carrying capacity. Returns on sheep grazing on overgrazed (degraded) pastures are
assumed to US$17.6 per sheep. A 5% increase inreturns per sheep is assumed for sheep grazing
on better managed pastures (reduced grazing pressure).

Under Component 2, improved pasture restoration and other agricultural provisions (e.g. seed,
fertilizer, machinery centers, artificial insemination, barn improvements, milk collection
facilities, small scale irrigation etc) are assumed to improve production o f fodder to feed the
enhanced progeny o f artificially inseminated cows and to reduce the grazing pressure on
mountain pastures. They should also enable some land that used to be cultivated in the past, to


34The economic analysis was carried out for an earlier version o f the project concept, and may therefore not entirely
reflect the final version, inrelation to the areas to be covered by the national parks versus other types o f PAS.
However, this does not affect the economic and financial outcomes and projections.


                                                            68

be cultivated again to grow crops and some existing cultivated land to be enhanced, thereby
improving crop yields.      Increased milk revenues from 5,000 artificially inseminated cows,
improved crop and fmit output from 285 ha, and improved rangelands o f 1000 ha could result in
present value benefits o f US$370,000, US$1.5 million and US$240,000 respectively.

The project will also fund 9000 ha o f community afforestation as pilot schemes to demonstrate
the potential to harvest wood on a sustainable basis. Assumingwood can be harvested 10 years
after planting at a sustainable yield o f 1.6m3 wood/ha/year, with a margin o f US$3.4 per m3
wood, this gives a present value benefit over 40 years o f US$70,000. In addition, a total o f 240
fuel-efficient stoves will be given for free to schools and households inthe park area. These will
help show that such stoves can save on fuelwood and hence reduce the pressure on forests. No
estimates are made o f financial or economic benefits resultingfrom provision o f the stoves.

Component 3 should give rise to 150 small enterprise development grants worth US$1 million
that could result inpotentialprofits o fUS$4.8 million.

In addition to the above financial benefits, further economic benefits potentially accrue to the
Azerbaijan economy. These include the national visitor consumer surplus (i.e. enjoyment over
and above that paid for) associated with visiting the parks. This could give rise to present value
benefits o f around US$700,000 million. This assumes existing consumer surplus values o f
US$0.75 and US$1.5 per visit for nearby local Azeris and national Azeris respectively.
Furthermore, a 40-year present value non-use benefit o f US$6.4 million may exist for the
Azerbaijan adult population. This represents the value or enjoyment accruing to residents as a
result o f simply knowing that the parks exist to maintain the country's biodiversity and
landscape. The value is based on an assumed non-use value o f US$O.l/adult/year after the
project starts and US$0.2/adult/year five years after the project has been completed, as the
biodiversity begins to improve. These non-use values are based on non-use values calculated
elsewhere and adjusted accordingly.

Other economic benefits not included in the above analysis include potentially significant long-
term benefits from reduced flooding and sedimentation due to reduced meadow erosion and
forest cutting. In addition, significant non-use values are also likely to accrue to expatriates and
international visitors to Azerbaijan (potentially US$7 million over 40 years) as well as the
international community as a whole.

Sensitivity analysis shows that the results are fairly robust to the complete exclusion o f crop
yield benefits, tourism benefits and non-use benefits, with IRRs falling only by a few percent
respectively. However, the results are more sensitive to exclusion o f the sheep revenues, with a
decline in ERR to 14% and FRR to 10%. Furthermore, under the "without project" scenario, if
the severe pasture deterioration occurs after 8 years instead o f after 4 years, with the other
assumptions remaining constant, there would actually be an overall sheep revenue loss from the
project rather than a gain.     This highlights the significant sensitivity o f the sheep revenue
assumptions

The most significant potential financial and economic risk associated with the project relates to
the fact that the agricultural intensification package (component 2) could in fact result in

increased mountain pasture grazing pressure.      This i s likely to be the case if strict grazing
controls and incentives are not put in place and appropriately enforced. This would result in
increased erosion, loss o fbiodiversity and potentially an ultimate collapse insheep grazing.

Furthermore, the attainment o f economic and financial benefits relating to the agricultural output
(e.g. crops and milk), small businesses and tourism related profits are also significantly
dependent upon i)good management and ii)there being a market for the products. The park
areas are currently rich inresources and products, but suffer severely from lack o f markets to sell
the output to.

The long-term fiscal impact of the project is likely to be positive. The project has intentionally
been designed to achieve maximum impact with the smallest possible loan size. Government
contributions relate to development o f the proposed Park Authorities and the Park staff. Fiscal
benefits to the Govemment will arise through increased tourism in the Park areas and
significantly enhanced agricultural and business development. This will generate Government
income through taxes on tourists, goods, services and salaries.

The long-term financial sustainability o f the Parks could potentially be a problem if the Park
Authorities are not managed appropriately. However, there i s a range o f potential sources o f
finance that the Parks can potentially tap into. In particular the Parks must make a case for
continued Government and international community assistance, and maximize the opportunities
for raising revenues through entry fees, park sales, and tax/concession type arrangements with
organizations making money from the park resources (e.g. tourism, mining o f minerals,
collection o f aggregates downstream o f the parks, and water bottling operations). In addition,
there is scope for obtaining financial assistance from carbon funds and corporate sponsorship
(e.g. from BP).

EnvironmentalAssessment (OP 4.01)

The project is expected to have an overall positive environmental impact by conserving globally
and nationally significant biodiversity, protecting rare, transboundary ecosystems and the
enhancing the sustainability o f natural resource use in the project areas.            Other likely
environmental benefits include: reduced soil erosion (improving downstream water quality),
flood moderation (protecting downstream infrastructure such as roads, bridges and irrigation
systems), and carbon sequestration in ecologically restored meadows and forests.               Barn
improvements (sanitation and ventilation) under Component 2 will improve environmental
health conditions both for livestock and for the people who handle them.

Safeguard related-risks and measures to address them. The project aims to put inplace systems
for more sustainable use o f natural ecosystems that are currently being overused and degraded,
and to promote economic development that will reduce reliance on mass consumption o f natural
resources. Inthe short term this will be mainly through improved protection, but the longer term
objective i s to develop community/user-based management systems and to trigger a shift from
traditional, low-input livelihoods based on mining o f natural resources (forests and pastures)
towards more value-added economic activities that are less dependent on these resources or use
themmore efficiently. This shift can involve some risk o fnegative impacts, such as unregulated
tourism development or increased pressure on particular species o f high commercial value.
While the direct, short-term impacts o f the project will be limited by the relatively small scale o f
the interventions, the project i s intended and expected to catalyze change on a much larger scale
inthe longerterm.

The risk o f negative longer term impacts is mitigated by the establishment o f the national parks
and PAS. This provides a (currently absent) legal and institutional mechanisms for planning and
regulating development, as MENR has a clear mandate to ensure that conservation and
environmental sustainability objectives are met. The creation o f a Coordinating Committee,
including relevant government agencies, local authorities, local communities, environmental
organizations    and other interested stakeholders,       will support this mandate, as will
educational/outreach and monitoring programs supported by the project. The project will also
support the preparation o f an integrated tourism development plan for the Shah Dag area,
coordinated by the Ministry o f Ecology and Natural Resources. Environmental sustainability
will be a key criterion for selection and design o f community and small enterprise development
activities under Components 2 and 3, allowing them to serve as models and demonstrations for
future development.

Safeguard-related impacts. The Environmental Assessment (OP 4.0 1) undertaken duringproject
preparation identified the following environmental impacts that could result during
implementation o f the proposed project:

    0   Construction and/or rehabilitation o f infrastructure within the National Parks, including
        checkpoints and guard stations, visitor centers, roads and trails, etc. could have direct
        impacts on flora and fauna at the construction sites or result in erosion, and generate
        wastes requiring disposal. However, these works will be small scale, limited in extent,
        andbased on approved park management plans;

    0   Increased tourism/recreational use o f the two areas could result in impacts such as
        disturbance o f wildlife, generation o f solid waste, overuse or pollution o f surface water,
        and various social disruptions;

    0   Some micro-projects under Components 2 and 3 (e.g., small scale irrigation, marketing o f
        non-forest timber products) could lead to environmental impacts associated with
        construction, waste disposal, over-harvesting o f vulnerable species, etc.

Mitigation measures. Mitigation measures to address these impacts are outlined in the project's
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which was completed and disclosed (in-country and in
the Bank's Infoshop) prior to appraisal, and have been incorporated into the Project
Implementation Manual.       These include assessing proposed construction sites for potential
biodiversity or environmental concerns, including waste management measures and site clean-up
requirements in construction designs and contracts, environmental screening o f micro-project
proposals, etc. The EMP also lays out responsibilities o f the MENR and other government
agencies, the P I U and grant beneficiaries. These include carrying out the appropriate level o f
environmental screening or assessment, and obtaining required clearances and environmental
permits from MENR in accordance with the Law on Environmental Protection, and monitoring
o f compliance and impact.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12)

Safeguard-related impacts. Creatiodexpansion o f the two national parks and surrounding PAS
will result in some restrictions on natural resource use on the state-owned forests and pastures,
compared with the current situation.        Some additional areas that are particularly rich in
biodiversity or vulnerable to erosion will be declared fully protected core conservation zones
(closed to any habitation or economic use), some other areas will be temporarily withdrawn from
use for purposes o f ecological restoration, and some areas will be subject to increased regulation
inthe interests oflongterm sustainability.

All o f the state forest land in the Shah Dag area will be included within the SDNP and, while
detailed forest inventories will need to be camed out, it i s expected that most o f the forest will be
established as core conservation and ecological restoration zones.                Total permissible
(sustainable) wood off-take from the forest will therefore be very limited. By contrast, most o f
the pasture inboth project areas will continue to be available for grazing. Inthe Shah Dag area,
only those areas which are within existing Specially ProtectedNatural Areas, plus high elevation
meadows that are not used for grazing due to inaccessibility, will be included within SDNP in
the first phase, while some areas o f highbiodiversity and ecological priority will be added inthe


                                                  72

second phase (see Section 3 and Annex 4). The expansion o f ONP may include some actively
used pasture land, which could continue to be used for grazing in a regulated manner, in
accordance with the provisions o f the park Charter. The remaining state-owned pastures inboth
project areas will be established as other types o f PASwhich are less restrictive than national
parks, in that they allow economic use o f the biological resources, but which are legally
designated as areas for protection o f ecological quality and biodiversity (see Annex 4 for
details). While continued use i s intended, restoring degraded pastures to good ecological quality
and moving towards sustainable use will involve changes, such as restricting the number o f
animals per hectare and shortening the grazing season to avoid damaging fragile plants in the
early spring. Such restrictions will have impacts on local communities, whose livelihoods and
economies depend very heavily on the pastures. However, this impact will be limited by the fact
that improved management will be introduced gradually (with a target o f only about 20% o f the
total available pasture being subject to increased regulationby the end o f the project.

Mitigation measures. Although no villages or households will be relocated and land ownership
and rights will not be affected, the World Bank's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) is
triggeredbecause the establishment/ enlargement and improved enforcement o f the two National
Parks and the establishment o f the other adjacent PASwill reduce access to forest and pasture
resources that are traditionally used and economically very important both for local communities
and other livestock owners with legal summer grazing rights in these areas. In the long term
restoration and sustainable management o f these ecosystems will benefit the users, but the short
term impacts need to be mitigated, as detailed in the project's Access Restfiction Process
Framework which was disclosed prior to appraisal. An additional detailed socio-economic study
will be undertaken during Year 1, with a follow-up at midterm, to: (i) baseline data and
                                                                           refine
impact indicators and targets; (ii)strengthen project measures for targeting mitigation and
benefits to potentially affected communities and individuals; and (iii)
                                                                      prepare a Social Mitigation
Plan to ensure that mitigation measures called for in the ARPF are effectively integrated in
project implementation.      These include involving local users in zoning and management
planning o f the parks and other PAS,phasing ino f grazing limitations over time, and support for
developing altemative livestock rearing methods, sources o f wood, and income sources
(including some employment in the parks themselves). The menu for development assistance
provided under Components 2 has been created based on consultations with potentially affected
communities, and the villages to receive assistance have been selected based on criteria which
include the likelihood that they will be affected by resource access restrictions.       Matching
requirementsfor grants under Component 3 will bereduced or eliminated for applicants from the
highest elevation (poorest and most vulnerable) villages, and for enterprises with particularly
highsocialbenefits.

Alternatives to minimize safeguard-related impacts. The current project design represents the
best altemative for minimizing the impacts associated with the Involuntary Resettlement
safeguard. An altemative design that was rejected would have created two large, conventional
strict nature reserves that exclude human habitation and all economic activities other than
tourism. This design was rejected because it could have involved relocating up to 60 villages
(over 40,000 people), transferring ownership o f private lands to the MENR, and taking large
areas o f valuable pasture and forest permanently out o f economic use, perpetuating the
unsustainable and increasingly unacceptable status quo o f isolating local communities from the



                                                 73

valuable resources and economic potential o f the Protected Areas (PAS). The current project
design minimizes negative impacts on the local population. Specific measures are beingtaken to
ensure that local users are provided development assistance to compensate for any reduced
access to pasture and forest resources.

NaturalHabitats policy (op4.04) and the Forest policy (op4.36)

Safeguard-related impacts and mitigation measures. The Natural Habitats and Forest policies are
triggered because the project areas include relatively pristine natural habitats, a large part of
which i s indigenous forest, for which management plans will be developed and implemented.
However, the project will result in improved protection o f these areas, not result in any
destruction or increased exploitation. Natural areas with high biodiversity value, including the
existing PAS,will be incorporated into the two new National Parks as core conservation areas,
and their protection i s expected to improve as a result o f the project. All management activities
relating to natural forests and other natural habitats will be consistent with the World Bank
policies. Support for livestock husbandry are not expected to increase livestock numbers in the
area, as it will introduce and support methods that promote intensified (fodder and stall-fed)
rather than extensive grazing approaches. There are no important endemic local livestock or
crop varieties at risk o fbeingdisplaced by introduction o f improved varieties.

PublicConsultations on Safeguard-related Impacts

An Environmental Assessment/ Environmental Management Plan (ENEMP) and an Access
Restriction Process Framework (ARPF) were prepared during the preparation phase o f the
project, in accordance with World Bank requirements. Extensive public consultations were held
duringpreparation of these documents to obtain stakeholders feedback on the project design, and
again to review the final versions prior to appraisal. The documents are also publicly available
in-country and inthe Bank Infoshop.

Public consultation during project preparation included over 30 meetings in both project areas,
involving over 700 local stakeholders. Consultants preparing the project ENEMP and the ARPF
met with local public officials (local representatives o f the Rayon Executive Authorities, local
staff o f concerned Ministries, Directors o f Ismailly and Pirkuli Nature Reserves (Zapovedniks)
and o f six Forestry Units), elected municipality leaders, NGOs, representatives o f the scientific
community, school directors and teachers and other community members including elders
(aksakkals), shepherds, farmers, small business owners, handicraft makers, youth and women.
Discussions included communities' perceptions and concerns, which mainly focused on
restrictions on access to pastures, their priorities for development assistance and mechanisms for
project implementation at the local level. Common priorities identified by communities during
discussion included need for dairy and food processing facilities, for agro-mechanization and
irrigation services, improving livestock genetic materials. Most o f the consultants undertaking
preparation studies also met with local stakeholders to discuss the specific aspects o f the project
with which they were concerned, as did members o f the World Bank task team during
preparation support missions.




                                                   74

A second phase of public consultations took place in February, 2005 (prior to appraisal), when
the final versions of the E N E M P and ARPF were publicly disclosed, in accordance with WB
Safeguard policies.      This round o f consultations focused on proposed mitigation and
management options. The consultations were carried out by the Project Implementation Unit and
the PCUs, in Baku and both project areas. The minutes o f the meetings, including lists o f
participants, are available at the PIU.

Public involvement and participation will continue during project implementation. The project
has beendesigned so that local populations can, to the extent feasible, participate inall aspects o f
park management planning, including the delimitation and demarcation o f park boundaries,
zonation o f park areas, the determination o f resource-use restrictions and compensatory
measures, and in the monitoring o f both socio-economic and biological changes due to project
interventions. The PIU will prepare and implement an outreach strategy, and will have local
offices inthe project areas to facilitate communication with beneficiaries and stakeholders.

Institutionalresponsibilitiesfor implementingand monitoringmitigationplans

During project implementation, the Borrower, through MENR and other institutions
implementing the project, will carry out project-specific EAs as needed under each project
component. Specific EAs will be prepared for the infrastructure construction and rehabilitation
activities carried out under Component 1. The Village Cluster InvestmentPlans (Component 2),
and the project proposalshusiness plans (Component 3) will be subject to environmental
screening, with preparation o f environmental assessments and environmental mitigation and
monitoring plans where required. In accordance with Azerbaijan law, the project proponents
(park Administrations under Component 1; organizations selected to implement the V C
Investment Plans for Component 2; grant applicants for Component 3) will be responsible for
proposing an EA Category and preparing mitigatiodmonitoring plans, while MENR (Ecological
Expertise section) i s responsible for deciding the EA category and reviewing/approving the EAs
and mitigation plans, and issuing any required environmental passports for the activities. PIU
will assist project proponents to fulfil their responsibilities, either directly or through providing
short term consultant services, and will be responsible for ensuring all necessary environmental
procedures have been followed and all permits obtained before disbursing funds for these
activities. The requirements and procedures for environmental and social impact screening and
assessment will follow Government laws (e.g. the Law on Environmental Protection, EIA
Handbook which specifies EA screening and approval procedures), and World Bank
requirements. They are detailed in the Project Implementation Manual which will be approved
bythe Bank prior to project effectiveness.

The Project ImplementationUnit (PIU), on behalf o fthe Borrower, will report on the status o f all
EAs carried out under the project. The PIU will also put in place a program to monitor socio-
economic impacts o f the project. The results will be used to modify project components and
implementation where needed, for example to address the needs o f any subgroups (e.g. women,
youth, internally displaced people) that are identified as particularly vulnerable.

                            AZERBAIJAN: RuralEnvironmentProject35


1. Overview

The project's global objective is to restore and protect biodiversity in two globally significant
biodiversity areas in the Caucasus (Shah-Dag) and Zangezur (Ordubad) mountains through the
establishment o f an inclusive model o f Protected Area management. The project will allow the
GOAto pioneer a new model o fProtected Area inAzerbaijan that will help shift biodiversity and
protected area policies and practices away from the highly centralized and exclusive model
inherited from the Soviet era towards a more modem, inclusive approach that combines the
objectives o f biodiversity and ecosystem protection with the objectives o f providing economic
and other benefits to local communities. The project will also contribute to lasting poverty
alleviation in the project areas by introducing and supporting the adoption o f more modern,
sustainable, and value-added approaches to natural resource use and agricultural production and
diversification of economic activities (particularly the development o frural/eco-tourism).

The cost o f achieving the GEF alternative i s US$16.88 million, o f which US$8.99 million is for
baseline activities and US$7.89 million i s for incremental activities. GEF financing i s requested
to cover US$5.00 million o f the incremental costs.                     The remaining US$2.89 million in
incremental costs i s financed by a PHRD technical assistance grant (US$1.70 million) and the
government counterpart contribution (US$l.19 million).


2. Context and Broad Development Goals

Azerbaijan i s a mountainous country o f 86,600 km2that lies on the western coast o f the Caspian
Sea among the mountain ranges o f the Talish mountains and Greater and Lesser Caucasus. The
Caucasus have been identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature as a Global 200 Ecoregion,
based on selection criteria such as species richness, levels o f endemism, taxonomic uniqueness,
unusual evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity o f major habitat types. It i s also one o f
ConservationInternational's 25 global biodiversity "hot spots."

The proposed Shah Dag National Park, located in the Greater Caucasus mountain range, is in a
watershed that drains to the Caspian Sea. The area encompasses the highest peaks o f the Greater
Caucasus, and the highest peak (Shah Dag Mountain) in Azerbaijan. The proposed park and its
surrounding buffer zone form a microcatchment that serves as a conservation unit containing
essential elements o f the Caucasus mountain ecosystem. The natural habitats, which consist
mainly o fbroadleaf forests and rangeland (mostly alpine and subalpine meadows), play a critical
role inwatershed protection, and contribute to local economy and subsistence.

The recently established Ordubad National Park covers 12,200 ha in the southem slopes o f the
Zangezur mountains, located in the Nakhichevan Autonomus Republic, which i s adjacent to


35T h s analysis was prepared in relation to an earlier version o f the project document, which involved creation o f
two large, multi-purpose national parks. This has been replaced by the two park-centered PA networks described in
the current document. However, the incremental cost analysis i s not affected by this change.


                                                         84

Armenia and Iran. The park is rich inbiodiversity, with a number o f endemic and endangered or
threatened species of mammals, birds, reptiles and plants, and represents an important area for
transboundary migratory wildlife. The proposed Park extension covers an additional 125,000 ha.

In recent years, large parts o f the park's forest and pasture land have become badly degraded
through over-use. While grazing land i s allocated on a permit basis, there i s no management,
monitoring or enforcement o f grazing activities, resulting in pastures that are heavily over-
utilized and deteriorating. Similarly, lack o f access to affordable energy has ledto an increase in
harvesting for fuelwood by the local population, resulting indegraded forest lands. The over-use
and degradation of the forests and pastures presents an important economic problem, due to
declining productivity, and a serious threat to globally significant biodiversity.


3. Baseline Scenario

The Government recognizes the negative trend in natural resources management, and has
prepared analyses and actions plans to address them, including a National Environmental Action
Plan (1998) and Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2000). In addition to these priority
settingand consensus buildingactivities, the GOAhas: (i) a Ministry o f Environment and
                                                             created
Natural Resources, which was recently elevated from state committee status as a means to
integrate forestry, range management, and protected areas management functions; (ii)enacted
several codes for natural resource conservation and use (forests, fisheries, wildlife); and (iii)
collaborated with FA0 and counterparts in Turkey and Georgia as a first step in understanding
how other countries inthe region are dealing with these problems.

The Government has made a major commitment to conserving biodiversity, including
substantially increasing the network o f Protected Areas (PAS) in the country. However, the
prevailing model for PASin Azerbaijan, as in much o f the CIS, is based on centrally controlled,
Strict Nature Reserves (Zapovedniks).      These strict reserves can be useful for protecting small
areas o fhighvalue and vulnerable ecosystems, but are insufficient for the longterm conservation
o f the region's biodiversity. Moreover, management o f the PASis generally ineffective, due to:
(i) andpressureforeconomicdevelopment; (ii) inlegislationandinstitutionaland
    poverty                                                  gaps
governance weaknesses; and (iii)     inadequate staffing, lack o f modem management plans, and
lack of financial resources for effective administration.

Underthe Baseline scenario, the following outputs would be expected:

     Establishmentand managementof NationalParksalong the lines ofthe traditional system
     of protected areas. Parks would focus primarily on strict nature reserves and would not
     incorporate biodiversity conservation on a broader, multiple- use, landscape level. Forest
     and meadow inventoriedassessments would be carried out over several years (rather than
     through a rapid assessment), limiting the ability o f the park managers to establish and
     implement effective management plans. As a consequence, forest areas would continue to
     decline as the local population continued to cut down trees and branches for fuelwood. Over-
     grazing on alpine pastures outside o f the Parks' core reserve areas would also continue,
     resulting in reduced grass cover, erosion, increased flooding and sedimentation downstream,
     and loss o f biodiversity. Overall, biodiversity would continue to decline due to the loss o f

    unregulated, increased development.

    Community livestock intensification,resulting in increased numbers o f hybrid cattle and
    improved and increased dairy production.        However, intensifying livestock production
    without sufficient environment management could easily result in increased pressure on the
    Parks' resources, especially sensitive high alpine summer pastures, and further degradation
    of community pasture lands.

    Increaseddevelopmentof enterprisesin and around the Park based on Park amenities and
    natural resources, without environmental management. Focus on tourism-based business
    results in the establishment o f additional resorts, restaurants and recreational activities
    without appropriate zoning or development regulation to ensure that impacts on natural
    resources and biodiversity are controlled.

While the baseline scenario would generate domestic benefits, it would have very limited global
impacts. It would not be sufficient to address the existing threats to the most critical areas o f the
highest biodiversity and international conservation importance.          Moreover, it would not
adequately integrate biodiversity Conservation on a broader, landscape-level, which is necessary
for long-term ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. Total expenditures under
the Baseline are estimated at US$8.99 million.


4. Alternative Scenario

The GEF Alternative Scenario would build on the baseline by supporting incremental activities
inthe project areas needed to achieve global environmental benefits. The proposed alternative
would strengthen management capacity for biodiversity conservation by expanding protected
area management from small, strictly protected reserves, to broad, multi-purpose national parks.
The model o f large, multi-purpose parks with diverse land ownership and management zones is
well established in many western and central European countries, but it is quite new to
Azerbaijan. There i s as yet no national park that encompasses a variety o f land and resource
uses, or has a substantial resident human population. The multiple-use model being introduced
under the GEF Alternative will create a mechanism for involving local communities and other
key stakeholders inpark management, and ensuring that they benefit from the conservation and
improved management o f the park's valuable natural resources.

The multiple-use protected areas will be implemented by establishing different management
zones with different levels o f management intervention, from core conservation zones (where
biodiversity is main maintained in a natural state with no intrusive use or management) to
sustainable natural resource management zones (where controlled grazing and timber harvesting
i s allowed, based on ecological targets and monitoring). The park will also include tourism,
residential and economic development zones.

In addition to the direct global benefits resulting from the increased protection o f the
internationally significant ecosystems, the project will establish strategic partnerships with local
land owners, land users, and communities which would greatly contribute to the long-term



                                                86

sustainability o f the conservation effort. The community natural resource activities and small
business development assistance are expected to be instrumental in strengthening the partnership
with and commitment o f local land owners, land users, and communities to conservation o f the
Park's natural and globally important resources.

Specifically, the GEF Altemative would support the following activities:

    Establishment and management of National Parks through pioneering a new, multi-
    purpose model of Protected Area that not only conserves biodiversity through core
    conservation zones, but also protects and enhances biodiversity over a larger area by
    combining the objectives o f biodiversity and ecosystem protection with the objectives o f
    providing economic and other benefits to local communities. Underthe GEF Alternative, the
    parks will have larger core conservation zones, better monitoring and increased stakeholder
    participation. Meadow and forest assessments will be undertaken rapidly, to allow park
    managers to prepare and implement management plans within the first year or two o f park
    establishment.

    Improvedcommunity-levellivestockmanagement. The GEF Altemative will buildon the
    baseline by incorporating environmental practices into livestock management, including
    demonstrating the value o f pasture restoration through pasture management trials. Over the
    long-term, the increased income from improved livestock management should reduce the
    communities' dependence on traditional livestock, thereby reducing grazing pressure,
    particularly the high-altitude summer meadows with highest biodiversity values.

    Support for developingsmall enterprisesthat improve livelihoods for the local population
    while reducing impacts on the Park's natural resources and biodiversity.           Technical
    assistance will identify and encourage business ideas that are linked to conservation
    objectives.   Specific focus will be given to ecotourism development (versus mainstream
    tourism development) that intentionally limits visitor impacts on park resources and strives to
    preserve the Park's globally important ecosystems and associatedbiodiversity.

    Project management, monitoring and evaluation and communications. The GEF
    Altemative will support implementation o f project activities with global values.       It will
    improve monitoring and evaluation o f project activities and measure the project's
    environmental and social impact. A communications program will increase public awareness
    and understanding o f biodiversity conservation and, in particular, the role o f multiple-use
    national parks inprotecting, conserving and managing the country's unique biodiversity.

Total expenditures under the Alternative Scenario are estimated at US$16.88 million.


5. Incremental Costs

The estimated Baseline and GEF Alternative project costs are summarized in the Incremental
Cost Matrix below. The difference between the costs o f the Baseline ($8.99 million) and the cost
of the GEF Altemative ($16.88 million) i s $7.89 million, o f which $5.00 million are GEF costs.
This represents the incremental cost for achieving global environmental benefits. A GEF grant
