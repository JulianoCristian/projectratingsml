2. Implementation 
Generally
2.1. 
The Recipient, through the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, shall: (a) carry out 
the Activities with due diligence and efficiency; (b) promptly provide the funds, facilities, services 
and other resources required for that purpose; (c) furnish all information covering the Activities and 
the use of the proceeds of the Grant as IDA shall reasonably request; (d) from time to time exchange 
views with IDA's representatives on the progress and results of the Activities; (e) take all necessary 
measures required to enable IDA to visit the territory of the Recipient for purposes related to the 
Grant; and (f) cause all goods and services financed out of the proceeds of the Grant to be used 
exclusively for the purposes of the Grant
.
Without limitation on the foregoing, the Recipient shall, if 
IDA shall so request, prepare and furnish to IDA promptly upon completion of the Activities a 
report, in form and substance satisfactory to IDA, on the results and impact of the Activities. 
 
3. Procurement
3.1. 
Except as IDA shall otherwise agree, procurement of the services required for the carrying 
out of the Activities and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Grant shall be governed by the 
provisions of Attachment I to this Annex, as said provisions may be further elaborated in a 
procurement plan approved by IDA (the Procurement Plan), covering the initial eighteen (18) 
month (or longer) period of implementation of the Activities. The Recipient shall update the 
Page  4
-4-
Procurement Plan in accordance with guidelines acceptable to IDA, and furnish such update to 
IDA not later than twelve (12) months after the date of the preceding Procurement Plan, for 
IDA
’s approval. 
 
4. 
Withdrawal of Grant Proceeds
4.1. 
The amount of the Grant shall be credited to an account opened by the Bank on its books in 
the name of the Recipient (the Grant Account), and may be withdrawn therefrom by the Recipient in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 4, to finance 100% of the reasonable cost of 
consultants’ services required for the Activities described in paragraph 1.1 and to be financed out of 
the proceeds of the Grant. 
 
4.2. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 4.1 above: 
 
(a) 
No withdrawals shall be made from the Grant Account: (i) for payments made for 
expenditures prior to the date of signature of this Letter Agreement by IDA; and (ii) for the purpose 
of any payment to persons or entities if such payment, to IDA’s knowledge, is prohibited by a 
decision of the United Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United 
Nations; 
 
(b) 
The Recipient may withdraw amounts of the Grant only to the extent that such 
amounts are available to IDA from Japan for the purposes of the Grant; and 
 
(c) 
No withdrawals shall be made from the Grant Account after December 31, 2009, or 
such later date that IDA shall establish by notice to the Recipient (the Closing Date), provided that, 
except in special circumstances, the Closing Date shall not be extended beyond the expected date of 
Bank approval of financing for the Project. However, withdrawals may be made after the Closing 
Date for expenditures incurred prior to the Closing Date if the corresponding withdrawal application 
is received by IDA within four months after the Closing Date, after which time any amount of the 
Grant remaining unwithdrawn from the Grant Account shall be canceled. 
 
4.3. 
When the Recipient shall desire to withdraw any amount from the Grant Account, it shall

carrying out of the Activities. IDA shall pay the amounts withdrawn by the Recipient from the Grant 
Account only to or on the order of the Recipient.

equivalent each, all under such terms and conditions as IDA shall specify by notice to the Recipient.  
 
4.5. 
Withdrawals of the proceeds of the Grant shall be made in the currency of the Grant.  IDA, 
at the Recipient’s request and acting as an agent of the Recipient, shall purchase with the currency of 
the Grant withdrawn from the Grant Account such currencies as shall be required to pay for 
expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the Grant. Whenever it shall be necessary, for the 
Page  5
-5-
purposes of this Letter Agreement, to determine the value of one currency in terms of another, such 
value shall be as reasonably determined by IDA. 
 
4.6. 
To facilitate the carrying out of the Activities, the Recipient may open and maintain in U.S. 
Dollars a special deposit account (the Special Account) in a commercial bank on terms and 
conditions satisfactory to IDA, including appropriate protection against set-off, seizure or 
attachment.  Deposits into, and payments out of, the Special Account shall be made in accordance 
with the provisions of Attachment II to this Annex.

IDA), as so audited; and (B) an opinion on such statements by said auditors, in scope and  detail 
satisfactory to IDA; and (iii) furnish to IDA such other information concerning such records and 
accounts and the audit of such financial statements, and concerning said auditors, as IDA shall have 
reasonably requested. 
 
(c) 
For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Grant Account 
were made on the basis of statements of expenditure, the Recipient shall:  (i) retain, until at least one 
year after IDA has received the audit report for or covering the fiscal year in which the last 
withdrawal from the Grant Account was made, all records (contracts, orders, invoices, bills, receipts 
and other documents) evidencing such expenditures; (ii) enable IDA
’s representatives to examine 
such records; and (iii) ensure that such  statements of expenditure are included in the audit for each 
fiscal year, or other period agreed to by IDA, referred to in subparagraph (b) above.

accordance with the provisions of this Attachment. 
 
3. 
After IDA has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been duly 
opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows: 
 
(a) 
The Recipient shall furnish to IDA a request or requests for a deposit into the 
Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the 
Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, IDA shall, on behalf of the 
Recipient, withdraw from the Grant Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or 
amounts as the Recipient shall have requested. 
 
(b) 
(i) 
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Recipient shall furnish to 
IDA requests for deposits into the Special Account at such intervals as IDA shall specify. 
 
(ii) 
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Recipient shall furnish to

payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such 
request, IDA shall, on behalf of the Recipient, withdraw from the Grant Account and deposit into

shown by said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the Special Account for 
eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by IDA from the Grant Account, and in 
the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by said documents and other 
evidence. 
 
4. 
For each payment made by the Recipient out of the Special Account, the Recipient shall, at 
such time as IDA shall reasonably request, furnish to IDA such documents and other evidence

5. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Attachment, IDA shall not be

if, at any time, IDA shall have determined that all further withdrawals should be 
made by the Recipient directly from the Grant Account;

if, at any time, IDA shall have notified the Recipient of its intention to suspend in 
whole or in part the right of the Recipient to make withdrawals from the Grant Account pursuant to 
the provisions of paragraph 6.1 of the Annex to this Letter Agreement; or

such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be 
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 
 
6. 
(a) 
If IDA shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the Special

this Attachment; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to IDA, the Recipient shall, 
promptly upon notice from IDA: (A) provide such additional evidence as IDA may request; or (B) 
deposit into the Special Account (or, if IDA shall so request, refund to IDA) an amount equal to the 
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless IDA shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by IDA into the Special Account shall be made until the 
Recipient has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 
 
(b) 
If IDA shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding in the 
Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the 
Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from IDA, refund to IDA such outstanding amount.
