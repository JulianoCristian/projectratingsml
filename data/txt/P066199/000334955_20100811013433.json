Some lessons learned\n            included: projects that involve selecting sub-grant\n            beneficiaries using selection criteria and mechanisms,\n            should pilot the selection during project preparation to\n            identify any weaknesses in the proposed process, and have a\n            pipeline of pilot sub-projects ready to implement promptly\n            upon project effectiveness. Ensure project readiness for\n            implementation before taking it to Board. Avoid\n            effectiveness or disbursement conditions that require\n            prolonged bureaucratic procedures, parliamentary\n            deliberations, or stakeholder negotiations; ensure that\n            conditions are met before Board submission. Ensure that all\n            relevant procurement documents for the first-year consultant\n            selections and procurements are ready by Board submission.\n            Minimize changes in task team leadership to ensure\n            supervision quality, especially in problem projects.\n            Implement close performance monitoring with short-term (90\n            day and 180 day) performance targets; use monthly video\n            conferences to track performance and address emerging issues\n            before the project develops serious performance issues.\n            Consider restructuring early if implementation remains slow.\n            Look for sustained implementation progress before upgrading\n            Project ratings and decreasing supervision intensity in\n            problem projects. Seek temporary assistance or consider\n            part-time contracts to avoid delays in implementation when\n            project procurement or Financial Management positions are\n            unfilled; seek help from other Bank projects in the same or\n            neighboring countries.
