The project experience\n            re-emphasizes the importance of clear strategies and\n            technical know-how upon decentralization, as well as the\n            critical aspects of adapting the project design to the local\n            implementation capacity. In the Indonesian context, the\n            long-term success of the integrated safe motherhood program\n            will require a clear resolution of the issues of cooperation\n            between the National Family Planning Coordinating Board\n            (BKKBN) and the Ministry of Health (MOH). Coordination\n            meetings and workshops, even planning mechanisms may not be\n            enough, if stronger incentives for coordination are not in\n            place. Moreover, coordination at the local level is simpler,\n            and most likely to succeed as has been noted. Using vouchers\n            as a tool for demand-side financing is logistically\n            feasible, and would be an effective way to target the poor.\n            Despite the limited scope of the pilots, these clearly\n            demonstrated the possible use of vouchers, and such demand\n            financing tools to help improve access to services. This\n            model can also be adapted to the public sector as well as\n            the private sector, and can cover a wide range of services.\n            The challenge will be how to coordinate supply and demand\n            side subsidies."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
