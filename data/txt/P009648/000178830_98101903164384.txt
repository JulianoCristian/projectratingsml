INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO
THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE
KADANA IRRIGATION PROJECT

REPORT AND RECOMMINENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OM A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA FOR THE IADANA IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $US35 million to
India.
PART I - Historical
2.        Since 19b9 the Bank and the Association have made ten loans
and credits totaling some $USllO million to finance agricultural projects
in India, the last of wqhich was the Tarai Seeds Project, signed in
June 1969.
3.        The credit I am now proposing would complete a major on-going
scheme to develop irrigated agriculture in two areas on the Mahi River
in the State of Gujarat in Central India.
4.        The project was appraised in May and August 1969, and negotia-
tions for the proposed credit were completed in Wiashington on December 17,
1969.  The Borrower was represented by:  Igr. G. A. Narasimha Rao, Chair-
man, Central r!ater and Power Commission; 'Mr. B. B. Vohra, Joint Secretary
(Agriculture), iMinistry of Food and Agriculture; and Mr. G. V. Ramakrishna,
Director, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs. Mr. C. C.
Patel, Chief Engineer, and MIr. G. A. Patel, Director of Agriculture,
represented the Government of Gujarat.



5.        The Bank has made 38 loans to India, 30 of which are fully dis-
bursedc The hssociation has made 24 credits, including 18 which are
fully disbursed. The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and
IDA credits to India as at December 31, 1969:

6.        Delays in disbursement of certain loans have continued.  After
considerable delay in the implementation of the Balancing Scheme Project
of the Indian Iron and Steel Company, (Loan INlo. 456-IN), the Bank suspendeJ
the right of the Company to make withdrawals from the loan account as of
December 15, 1969. During the course of the next few months the situation
with respect to this project TTill be reviewed. The Company has requested
an extension of the Closing Date for its loan for the Collieries Project,
(Loan. No. 307-IN), partly because of difficulties which have arisen in



sinking the mine shafts. A technical report by a consultant on the progress
of this scheme is now under reviewr.  The rate of disbursement under the
'ower Transmission Project (Loan IJo. 416-IN) which had earlier been unsatis-
factory, has accelerated. It is expected that complete disbursement will be
achieved by the revised Closing Date of December 31, 1970. Although the
CJosing Date of the Beas Equipment Project is not until December 31, 1972,
the rate of disbursement is slower than expected and a mission to reviewr
the progress of the project is planned for later this year. The rate of dis-
bursement under the outstanding loans to ICICI is expected to increase con-
siderably in the light of recent large commitments thereunder.  Loan No. 414-IN
is fully committed and Loan No. 515-IN is more than 90 percent committed.
7.        Since 1957 IFC has made twelve commitments in India totaling $36.5
million of which $27.6 million represent loans and $8.9 million equity.  As
of December 31, 1969, $14.5 million had been disbursed. The largest commit-
ment is a total of $18.9 million to Zuari Agro-chemicals for a fertilizer
plant in Goa. A number of other industrial schemes are currently under con-
s-ideration.
8.        Negotiations will soon be held with India for IDA credits to finance
?.i agricultural credit project in Gujarat and a further industrial imports
project. Appraisal reports are being prepared for the Punjab Agricultural
Credit Project, Second Power Transmission Project, hormugao Port Project,
Cauvery Delta Irrigation Project, and Pochampad Irrigation Project. A number
of other projects are at various stages of preparation including a further
loan to ICICI.

PART III - The Proj ect
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Kadana Irrigation Project - India"
(PA-27) is attached.
11.       Agriculture plays a dominant role in both the Indian economy
and the economy of Gujarat. Since 1966 the Government of India has given
special attention to the development of agriculture, -wjith emphasis on
investment in modern inputs, As Dart of this strategy, in its fourth
Fi-e-Year Plan (1969/70 to 1973/74) India is giving priority to the
completion of on-going irrigation projects. Irrigation is essential
to reduce the farmers' dependence on uncertain rainfall, and to help
them achieve regularly higher yields from their lands.
12.       IDiA assistance will accelerate the speed of completion of the
Kadana Irrigation Project, which although started in 1954 has progressed
slowly, partially because of a scarcity of funds. Fhrther, the project
will be improved through the inclusion or e:.ansion of ancillary works
and services, as well as by certain changes in organization and manage-
ment.
13.       The project now will be completed by mid-1975, at an estimated
total cost of Rs. 735 million ($1US98 million). As of December 31, 1969
about ';US31.3 million of this amount had been spent. The credit now
proposed, of the equivalent of $US35 million, would finance about
52 percent of the balance of the cost of the project (or 36 percent of
the total cost). The remainder will be financed through the budget of
the State of Gujarat, to which the Government of India annually con-
tributes development assistance in the form of both grants and loans;
these loans will include the on-lending of the Association's credit.
14r       The project includes:
(a)  construction of the Kadana Dam on the Mahi River;
(b) expansion of the existing irrigation system on the right
bank from 143,COO ha to 263,000 ha;
(c) construction of a new irrigation system on the left bank
to serve about 20,000 ha;
(d) construction of watercourses and field channels through-
out the project area;
(e) remodeling and expansion of the drainage systems;
(f) land leveling of about 42,000 ha; and
(g) upgrading of existing roads and construction of new dis-
trict village and farm-to-market roads totaling abcut
3,200 krn.



It also includes groundwater investigations, a study of water charges, a
trial land consolidation program and construction of trial-cum-demonstration
farms.
15.       Benefits from the project arise from increased agricultural pro-
duction. Assured irrigation in the kharif (monsoon) season and increased
cropping in the rabi (dry) season will lead to intensified cropping
patterns and higher yields.  Increased agricultural production will
eventually reduce India's dependence on imports of food, cotton and other
agricultural products, freeing foreign exchange for use on other purposes.
At full development of the project area, the annual incremental net value
of production attributable to project investment would be about Rs. 200
million ($US27 million), and the estimated economic rate of return on the
project is at least 14 percent.
16.       The project is being carried out by the Irrigation and Roads
WTings of the Public ;Jorks Department, and the Department of Agriculture,
of Gujarat.
17.       In order to ensure coordination and timely execution of work on
the project, the Government of India will maintain a Coordination Committee
comprised of senior officials of the Central Water and Power Commission,
the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Commission, and the Department
of Economic Affairs, and provided with suitable full-time staff.   Two
further coordinating committees will be appointed by the Government of
Gujarat - one at the state level to exercise overall budgetary control and
coordinate the annual plan of operation, and another to be responsible for
day-to-day coordination of project activities.
18.       During negotiations, it was agreed that items of equipment with
a total estimated cost of about .$US2.3 million would be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding with a level of preference to domestic
suppliers of 15 percent or the prevailing customs duty whichever is
lower, and these would be financed out of the proceeds of the credit. Other
goods with an estimated value of $USo.2 million, but wIhich are unsuitable
for international competitive bidding, would also be imported and financed
under the credit. The remaining items of equipment required for the
project, with an estimated cost of $US0.7 million, will be reserved for
local procurement but no items so procured will be financed out of the
proceeds of the credit.
19.       Apart from the $132.5 million of equipment financing described
in the preceding paragraph, the remainder of the credit will finance about
50 percent of the local currency costs of the project. Agricultural pro-
jects are of overriding importance in the development of the Indian
economy, and I am convinced that Bank grcup lending strategy should give
priority to financing in this sector. Because the requirement of finished
capital goods and the direct import content of such projects is quite small,
the Bank group can make a significant contribution in this vital sector
only by covering a large proportion of local currency expenditures.



PART IV - Legal Instruments and Authority
20.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the State of Gujarat
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
21.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and draft Project Agree-
ment contain provisions usual to agreements for irrigation projects. Two
provisions of the draft Project Agreement are of special interest:
(a) Section 2.08(iv) provides that within six months of
the date of the Project Agreement, Gujarat will adopt
and begin to implement a program to  consolidate land
holdings in part of the project area; and
(b) Section 2.09(i) provides for the levying of water charges,
cesses and land taxes in the project area ultimately
realizing not less than Rs. 20,000,000 annually.
PART V - The Economy
22,       The last economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of
India," (R69-75, distributed on April 28, 1969) pointed out the con-
siderable achievements in fiscal year 1967/68, after the drought-recession-
inflation period of 1965/66 and 1966/67. With favorable weather and
improved farm practices, agricultural output reached an all-time record
in 1967/68 with foodgrain production estirmated at 95.1 million tons, In-
creased food supplies eased the strong inflationary pressures iwhich over
the previous five years had raised the price level by about 65 percent.
Moreover, the rapid increase of agricultural income stimulated the demand
of rural households for consumer goods and for agricultural equipment and,
after three years of near stagnation, industrial production picked up
again. Gross national product increased by about 8.9 percent in real
terms compared Twith the previous year.
23.       The improvement *which took place in 1967/68 continued, on the
whole, through 1968/69. Although the weather in 1968/69 was less favor-
able, foodgrain production was only 1 percent below the previous year's
record. Industrial production rose by 6 percent. Consumer prices
recorded a small decline. One of the most favorable developments in
1968/69 was the recovery of exports, wxhich increased by 13.5 percent
even though exports of some traditional items like tea and jute did not
perform well. Exports of engineering goods doubled. This achievement
reflected both the efforts of industrialists to find alternative outlets
to the sluggish domestic marlket and the strong incentives and pressures
provided by government policy.  Exports of two other items, iron and
steel and iron ore, increased by 30 and 20 percent respectively. Combined



with lower food imports, these export advances improved the trade balance,
the d;e2i:,; t being reduced to $667 million or roughly half that of the
previous year.
24.       Growth prospects for 1969/70 look fairly good.  This year's
southwyest monsoon, which accounts for over three-quarters of the total
yearly rainfall, was fairly satisfactory; however, post-monsoon rains
so far are worse than Last year's, and the Goveirnment now estimates
total foodgrain production at around 97 million tons, Groundnut, cotton,
cane, and jute crops have fair prospects for increases. From April to
July, 1969 the index of wholesale prices showed an upward trend, largely
due to seasonal food price increases. In August, wholesale prices leveled
off.
25.       The most recent industrial production figure (the adjusted figure
for H1ay) shows that for the first five months of calendar 1969, industrial
output increased by nearly 7.5 percent over the performarnce in the same
period of the previous vear, Recent signs of steel and raw materials
shortages indicate that this trend is being maintained. The expected
increase in agricultural incomes should help to maintain the demand for
consumer goods, vehicles, and agricultural supplies and equipment. This
industrial revival is by-passing some sectors of the capital goods in-
dustries, however, (e.g. heavy industrial machinery, railroad and genera-
ting equipment) with no upswing in sight, as the Government is not in a
posi'tion to sustain a substantial expansion of demand in the public sector
through budgetary expenditures. Taking all these factors into account, a
real rate of growth of GTP for 1969/70 of the order of 4 percent may be
expected, against 1.8 percent the previous year.
26.       While imports have continued to decline, export growth also
has slackened. Exports during the first seven months of 1969/70 were only
1.8 percent higher than during the same period last year. Exports if
engineering goods are still performing well, but iron and steel exports
are dovn substantially, mainly because of increasing internal demand.
Export performance of traditional items is mixed.
27.       In spite of recent improvements in the economy, India requires
now and will require for some time to come, substantial inflows of net
aid if a satisfactory growth pattern is to be sustained.  Wiith present
balance of payments prospects, and with the debt service position a cause
of continuing concern, it is clear that this aid must be on concessionary
terms, and IDA financing is fully justified. Since the direct import
content of high priority projects is in general quite low, Association
financing in most cases will have to include a portion of the local
expenditures involved.
28,       A basic data sheet, updating the information in the last ecoS-
nomic report, is attached as an Annex.
