Katowice Heat\n            Supply and Conservation Project are to: 1) enhance energy\n            conservation and efficiency in the district heating sector;\n            2) extend the life of existing district heating assets\n            through rehabilitation and introduction of modern\n            technologies, thereby significantly reducing capital\n            expenditures and operating and maintenance costs; and 3)\n            reduce environmental pollution through investments in\n            energy-efficient equipment and systems as well as by\n            supporting a program to eliminate coal-fired heat-only\n            boilers. The project will support implementation of the\n            Government's ongoing energy sector restructuring\n            program and it comprises: 1) an investment component\n            consisting of investments in equipment to optimize the\n            existing district heating system; and 2) technical\n            assistance through consultancy services, studies and staff\n            training. The project scope can be summarized as follows: a)\n            reduction of water losses; b) improvement of water quality;\n            c) reduction of heat losses; d) introduction of automation,\n            controls and metering at the substation level; e)\n            improvement of network monitoring; f) conversion of system\n            control from fixed to variable flow; g) enhancement of\n            system load dispatching capability; h) elimination of small\n            heat-only boilers; i) a consumer installations pilot\n            program; and j) technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1994-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
