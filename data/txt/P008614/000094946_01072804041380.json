The\n            project met its objectives of increased energy efficiency\n            and good fiscal impact and benefits to the consumers. The\n            project reduced pollution from coal-fired boilers resulting\n            in coal savings and good fiscal impact and benefits to the\n            consumers. The project has been a complex one involving five\n            different municipalities, which caused initial delays.\n            However, as soon as the obstacles were removed, the\n            investment portion was highly successful. The financial and\n            institutional sides of the project were not equally\n            successful. Contrary to the other district heating projects\n            in Poland, PEC Katowice did not address these aspects of the\n            project in a proactive way. This, in combination with the\n            tariff-setting framework in which they worked, resulted in\n            delayed and inadequate tariff increases. Unlike the other\n            district heating companies, the regulator had made Regional\n            District Heating Enterprise Katowice use a very complex\n            tariff structure with more than 60 tariff categories for\n            which costs and revenues had to be calculated. The key\n            lessons learned concern: a) demand forecasts, b) tariff\n            policies, c) financial covenants, d) entity financial\n            management, e) corporate governance, f) institutional\n            development, g) reallocation of substation benefits, and h)\n            involvement of local combined heat and power plant."}, "docdt": "2001-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
