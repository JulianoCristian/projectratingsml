MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
KATOWICE DISTRICT HEATING EN4TERPRISE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND
FOR A HEAT SUPPLY AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Katowice
District Heating Enterprise (PEC-Katowice) in the amount of US$45 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with
a 17 year maturity including five years of grace and would help to finance investments
in energy conservation and efficiency, asset life extension, and reduction of air
pollution.
2.    Background. The Polish Government launched in 1990 an Economic Transformation
Program. In that context it sought Bank assistance to develop an energy policy that
would enhance efficiency and increase competition in the energy sector.
Implementation started with the Energy Resource Development Project (Loan 3215-POL),
followed by the Heat Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project (Loans 3377/83-
POL), in particular the Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL) of tiat project (Loan 3377-
POL).  That SECAL supported a comprehensive energy sector restructuring program,
including price liberalization, demonopolization, commercialization and privatization
of energy sector enterprises where possible, and introduction of a sound regulatory
framework between the network fuels (power, gas and district heating). Good progress
was made under the SECAL in energy sector restructuring. The Bank considered that
three of the four conditionalities for second tranche release of the SECAL had been
met and proposed an extension of the loan closing date from March 31, 1994 to
September 30, 1994 in order to enable the Governimnt to present the draft Energy Law
to Parliament. However, the Government allowed the closing date to lapse.
3.    The US$340 million Heat Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project was
approved by the Board on June 26, 1991. It included five loans to district heating
enterprises (DHEs), one of which was for WPEC-Katowice (Loan 3380-POL), the Katowice
Voivodship's DHE. However, just prior to loan signature th's large regional WPEC-
Katowice system was broken up into 11 entities. This action was taken by the Voivod
of Katowice pursuant to the May 1991 Law on the Municipalities which provides for the
transfer of ownership of state-owned enterprises to the municipalities they serve.
4.    In September 1991 the Bank identified the possible successor borrower to WPEC-
Katowice. It was agreed that a loan would be most beneficial if the adjacent systems
of Katowice and Chorzow were merged, because a hydraulically interconnected system
between these two could result in substantial energy savings and decreased
environmental pollution. The merger took place effective April 1, 1992.
5.    Due to the time it took to complete the merger, plus lengthy subsequent delays
in the Government's issuing approval of the draft Guarantee Agreement because of
legal/technical problems, the Bank and the Government eventually agreed that too much
time had lapsed since the presentation of the original project to the Board to attempt
to devise revised project arrangements under the original loan. Hence, in agreement
vith the Covernment, Loan 3380-POL was withdrawn in early 1993 and a separate and new
project was prepared. However, the Government was not able to include guarantee
authority for this project into the 1993 budget and Board presentation of the project
was postponed to 1994.

6.    Energy Sector Restructuring.  Under the energy sector restructuring program
major changes have been and are being implemented in order to make the energy sector
more competitive and viable. The various subsectors are being, or have already been,
demonopolized. The state-owned enterprises are being commercialized into joint stock
or limited liability companies. Privatization of selected companies would follow as
soon as possible, but the speed af the process depends on a number of factors (e.g.,
political will, energy prices and availability of capital). An appropriate regulatory
framework would be put into place and an Energy Regulatory Agency created, in order
to encourage competition, allow open access to new entrants, protect consumers and
avoid distortions in investment decisions.
7.       Continued implementation of the Government's energy sector strategy is
critical for the development of the sector, and good progress has been made in a
number of areas, including energy pr:icing policy. Coal prices, adjusted for quality,
are no.* being set virtually treely by the market and have almost roached import parity
levels. Coal mine operating subsidies have been eliminated except for those mines
that are being closed down, and coal export controls have been suspended. Prices of
network fuels, though still being controlled, have reached on average about 60% of
estimated economic levels. Household prices for power and gas are now significantly
higher than the corresponding industry prices, while household subsidies for heat and
hot water consumption have been reduced from 78% in mid-1991 to about 20% by October
1,1994. These subsidies have been eliminated already in some major cities and are
expected to be eliminated in most of the country by the end of 1995. The current
system of approximately quarterly price adjustments is expected to result in modest
real price increases for the network fuels during 1994.
8.    The SECAL's energy pricing conditionality stipulated that household prices for
gas and electricity should reach parity with industry price levels and that household
prices for district heat should reach 60% of the industry price, i.e., subsidies
should be reduced to 40%. Those targets were met. However, significant further work
needs to be done for all prices to reach economic levels. The relatively greater
adjustment effort would need to be focused on household prices, because their price
levels range from 50-66% zf estimated economic levels, depending on the type of fuel.
This is particularly important for the gas distribution companies, since household
gas connections are only marginally profitable. However, the Bank recognizes that
special measures should be taken to protect the lowest income groups. This could be
done through measures that do not encourage excessive use of energy. The Bank and
the Government are engaged in a policy dialogue on how to proceed with price
adjustment from here on to ensure that energy prices would reach economic levels,
based on Polish economic costs, in the medium term.
9.    The Government is currently preparing a draft energy law for presentation to
the Parliament. This law would set up the future energy regulatory framework and
establish an Energy Regulatory Agency.   As it stands,  the draft provides for
competition in the network fuel subsectors and for open access to new entrants. The
Energy Regulatory Agency would have adequate autonomy, subject to overall
accountability to the Council of Ministers. The Bank has reviewed this draft law and
is satisfied that it meets the principal objectives of the Government's June 1991
energy sector development policy letter. The draft law is expected to be submitted
to Parliament during 1994. The Bank/ESMAP has offered to provide assistance with the



3
drafting of secondary legislation, permits, licenses, st.atutes and training of
personnel for the future Energy Regulatory Agency.
10.   Demonopolization has proceeded apace.    The power  sector  is  completely
demonopolized and consists of one transmission company, 34 generating enterprises and
33 distribution enterprises. Substantial restructuring is expected to take place
between the generators based on economic/financial criteria, grouping them into a
small number of competitive companies. Coal mines have been restructured into seven
large and three small companies. A closure program for eight out of 71 mines is
underway, and four other mines are expected to be slated for closure shortly. The
Polish Oil and Gas Company, the last remaining monopoly, would have been broken up
by the end of 1995, initially by divestiture of service companies, followed by
separation of the exploration and distribution companies. To enhance competition,
the first gas and oil exploration and production licenses were awarded to AMOCO and
British Gas; contracts for coal-bed methane exploration and production were awarded
to AMOCO (IFC made recently a US$8.7 million equity investment in an AMOCO-operated
coalbed methane project in Poland) and McCormick. In the district heating sector,
significant restructuring and commercialization is underway with a new emphasis on
network  efficiency  improvements,   energy  conservation,   cost  reduction  and
competitiveness with other heat sources. Since June 1991, the number of district
heating enterprises has increased from 50 to about 500, largely as a result of the
break-up of regional monopolies.
11.   Less progress has been made in enterprise commercialization and, hence, in
privatization. This is a nationw-,de problem, affecting all sectors of the economy.
A February 1993 law transferred the responsibility for commercialization of the power
and  coal  sectors  to  the Ministry  of  Industry.   All  coal  enterprises  were
commercialized in March, 1993 into seven multi-mine companies and three single-mine
companies. All power distribution enterprises were commercialized in July, 1993.
Commercialization of the generating plants awaits a decision on the restructuring of
the generators (para 10).   In the district heating sector about 100 out of 500
enterprises have been commercialized, including those of Gdansk, Gdynia and Krakow,
all Borrowers under the Bank's Heat Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project.
Those enterprises have started to spin off service companies which, in several
instances, have been privatized. Six small DHEs have been privatized, which makes
the DH sector the first energy sector in Poland where actual privatization of
operating companies took place.
12. Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project is consistent with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy according to which the Bank would aim at: (i) assisting
the Government in addressing the most critical structural issues (public finance
reform, downsizing of large loss-making sectors, financial sector reform); (ii)
supporting private sector development and catalyzing private sector financing or
participation; and (iii) financing medium-sized projects in social and economic
infrastructure with increased emphasis on projects at the local government level.
The Bank's strategy in the energy sector envisages projects to support primarily
priority rehabilitation and modernization investments in the district heating, power
and gas subsectors that enhance energy conservation and efficiency and reduce
environmental pollution.   In the coal subsector the Bank aims to assist the
Government's downsizing efforts by helping to mitigate the social cost of
restructuring.



4
13.   Bank assistance under the Energy Resource Development project (Loan 3215-POL)
supports gas pricing reform; domestic production of gas; and increased private sector
participation in developing petroleum resources. Under the SAL (Loan 3247-POL), coal
prices were decontrolled and steps were taken towards elimination of energy-related
subsidies and cross-subsidization of household energy consumers.  Under the Heat
Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project (Loans 3377/83-POL), in particular the
SECAL of that project (Loan 3377-POL), the Bank broadened and deepened its support
for further comprehensive energy sector restructuring (para 6>. While good progress
has been made on energy pricing under the SECAL, the Government and the Bank are
engaged in a policy dialogue about the additional measures needed to bring energy
prices to their economic levels in the medium term (para 8) and to introduce the new
regulatory framework (para 9).
14.   The project supports the Bank's sector assistance strategy and the Government's
ongoing energy sector restructuring effort. It would result in significant energy
savings and reduce er,vironmental pollution. PEC is expected to be commercialized
shortly and is planning to divest itself from a number of service units, which would
be privatized.
15.   Project Description.   The project comprises:  (i) an investment component
consisting of investments in equipment to optimize the existing district heating
system; and (ii) technical assistance through consultancy services, studies and staff
training to enhance management and staff efficiency and capabilities.   The loan
proceeds would finance most of the direct foreign exchange costs of these items.
16.   Demand for heat and power in Poland has fallen sharply since 1990.  Demand for
heat from existing consumers, in particular, can be expected to decline in the medium
term, given the potential for energy conservation and efficiency improvements.
Projects focusing on optimization and rehabilitation, rather than capacity expansion,
and introduction of economically justified pollution control equipment would have,
therefore, priority. In addition, since the most energy efficient and least polluting
way of providing both heat and power in an urban agglomeration is through combined
heat and power (CHP) generation, local boiler elimination would have a high priority.
17.   The project would contribute to a reduction of water and heat losses and
improvement of water quality through installation of sectioning valves, bellows
compensators, preinsulated pipes, water filters upstream of all sensitive equipment
and conversion of industrial consumers from direct to indirect connections.   A
metering program would be implemented directed at large heat producers as well as
large industrial and residential customers. Reduction of heat demand and better load
management would take place through retrofitting and automation of transfer and large
consumer and subarea substations, installation of heat exchangers at large
substations, and through a consumer installations pilot program (para 19). Substation
automation and control equipment includes domestic hot water controls, pressure
differential valves, flow/heat meters, outside temperature-regulated devices, and/or
heat exchangers. These measures would provide energy savings while increasing comfort
to consumers through better control of water temperature at the substation level.
18.   Improved network monitoring would be achieved through installation of flow and
heat meters in the network. Improved load dispatch and temperature reduction would
be achieved by installing variable speed drives at the main pumping station and by
elimination of heat-only boilers (HOBs) with a total capacity of 67 MWt, the load of



5
which would be connected to the main network via automated substations. Elimination
of HOBs would also lead to reduced air pollution. Integrated system operation would
be enhanced through installation of a central control unit.
19.   Separation of the primary and secondary networks through heat exchangers is one
of the major objectives of the project.   It is an essential requirement before
thermostatic controls can be installed in secondary (consumer owned) installations.
Such controls enable both further energy savings as well as increasing consumer
comfort.  Continued adjustments in energy prices towards economic levels and the
phasing out of consumer subsidies for heat consumption would ensure a significant
further increase in consumer interest in energy conservation measures. Commercial
bank funding for these purposes is currently virtua'lly unobtainable. Therefore, under
the project PEC also intends to implement a pilot program to assist selected housing
cooperatives in financing improvements in consumer-owned heat installations.
20.   Procurement would be carried out by PEC's own procurement unit.  This unit has
qualified staff, is well equipped, and has received training in international
procurement by specialized Bank staff. PEC has already completed several procurement
cycles from bid document preparation through contract award following the Bank's
guidelines. Hence, the project includes a retroactive financing provision in the
amount of US$4.5 million to cover approved expenditures already incurred after April
1, 1992. The exception to the normal retroactive financing period was granted because
of the unusual delays in presenting this project, caused by limits on the Goverrment's
annual guarantee authority.
21.   All equipment to be financed from the Bank loan proceeds would be procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Polish manufacturers and joint
ventures established in Poland and competing undar International Competitive Bidding,
would receive a domestic preference in bid evaluation of 151 of the c.i.f. price or
the prevailing customs duty applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less,
provided they can prove that the value added to the product in Poland exceeds 20% of
the ex-factory bid price. All bidding packages for equipment estimated to cost
US$500,000 equivalent or more would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procurement documentation. Prior approval would also be sought for the use of the
limited international bidding, international shopping and direct contracting
procurement methods.   Other contracts would be subject to ex-post review after
contract award. Consulting services to be financed from the loan proceeds would be
procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. All
documents relating to procurement of consulting services would be subject to the
Bank's prior review.
22.   The total project cost is estimated at US$93 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$ 53 million (57% of the total cost). The Bank would provide
851 of the foreign exchange financing. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amount and L ethods of procurement and the disbirsement
schedule are shnwn in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of P -nk Group operations in Poland are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. . map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11814-POL, dated October 1,
1994, are also attached.
23.   The Borrower of the Bank loan would be PEC.  The entity is well managed and
capable of implementing the project within the agreed timetable.



6
24.   Agreed Actions.   PEC agreed to the following pr4nripal actions: (a) complete
implementation of the core master plan recommendations by December 31, 1999; (b)
prepare a complete master plan for long-term rehabilitation, modernization and future
development by September 30, 1995 and start implementation of the agreed
recommendations by January 15, 1996; (c) use up to 5X of its loan amount to prefinance
consumer installations against terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank; (d)
achieve net internal cash generation ratios of at least 30% in any one year based on
a three year moving average during the project implementation period; (e; maintain
annual debt service coverage ratios of at least 1.3 times; and (f) present to the
Bank, by September 30 of each year, forecast financial statements.
25.   Benefits.  The project would have a rate of return of 26%.  Benefits have been
estimated in the following categories:  (a) energy savings;   (b) network life
extension; (c) reduction in operating and maintenance costs; (d) reduction in labor
costs; (e) reduction in water losses; and (f) air pollution abatement.
26.   Risks, The main risk assoc::ated with the project is the possibility of delayed
increases in heat prices needed to gererate the appropriate enterprise cash flow
levels and to ensure that consumers receive the proper economic signals. This risk
is manageable, given tlhe Government's past record with regard to energy price reform
and the limited impact on the economic viabiliry of the project resulting from delayed
implementation due to shortages in counterpart funds, if any. The economic benefits
of the investments, if undertaken in t*e sequence suggested by the optimization
program, are not significantly affected by delayed implementation, since the
quantities of energy savings and other benefits would be the same, except obtained
over a longer period. The risk of declining demand has been adequately addressed in
this project, since it assumes an 8% decline in demand through the year 2000. A more
rapid decline is unlikely, given the cost of insulating buildings and equipping them
with internal controls, as well as the scope for eliminating more HOBs. The risk of
procurement delays has been minimized by: (a) the establishment of a procurement unit
within PEC, which has already awarded several contracts under Bank procedures; and
(b) tight reporting schedules on project implementation progress during supervision.
27.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
