Park (AENP), a mosaic of\n            landscapes defined by unique terrestrial and marine flora\n            and fauna, spectacular scenery and deep cultural heritage.\n            The AENP starches across 180.000 hectares, from a semi-arid\n            zone at its northernmost end, across the Zuurberg Mountains,\n            southwards through the Sundays' river valley to it\n            mouth, then east along the coast of Algoa Bay to the\n            Bushman's river mouth, taking in the woody cape\n            sections of the coast and including the bird island and St\n            Croix island groups. The park contains an impressive\n            representative sample of the Eastern Cape's unique mix\n            of biodiversity, scattered across marine and coastal zones\n            and five of South Africa's nine terrestrial biomes:\n            thicket, forests, fynbos, nama-karoo, and Indian Ocean\n            coastal belt. Grassland elements also occur in the area."}, "docdt": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
