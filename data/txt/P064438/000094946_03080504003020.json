biophysical\n            information, to determine opportunities, and constraints\n            presented by the environment as related to the\n            implementation of the Greater Addo Elephant National Park\n            Program Project, and, recommend ways to optimize\n            opportunities and minimize constraints, as well as\n            distributing relevant information, while highlighting the\n            Bank safeguard policies. Within the country's\n            environmental legal framework, and Bank environmental\n            policies, the EA looks at the natural environment, i.e.,\n            biodiversity, freshwater, and marine environments, and, at\n            the socioeconomic environment on the Eastern Cape, the\n            largest of South Africa's nine provinces, and third\n            largest in population. While the project offers a more\n            sustainable, and economically viable form of land use for\n            most of the planning domain than the current agricultural\n            option, providing long-term security to the mix of\n            biodiversity, and ecological processes, yet, a legitimate\n            concern on the regional economy - i.e., the agricultural\n            sector, particularly the dairy industry - and social aspects\n            regarding the labor market, namely farm workers, foster the\n            following mitigation measures. International, and national\n            conservation standards should be met, in order to enhance\n            eco-tourism as an economic tool that generates employment\n            opportunities within the SANParks, Eastern Cape, and South\n            Africa at large (Eco-tourism has limited costs to the\n            environment, compared with intensive farming). It is\n            highlighted that red data species should be preserved, and\n            research opportunities enhanced, towards the protection of\n            unknown medicinal plants. Within the ecological services to\n            be provided, opportunities for social, and financial uplift\n            of local communities will develop. To this end, a\n            restructuring of the Addo Planning Forum is recommended to\n            include a wider representation, and diversification of\n            duties. A communication strategy has been designed to form\n            the link with stakeholders, and enable communities'\n            concerns to be taken into consideration."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
