the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible; the Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory; and the Borrower's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Implementing a\n            participatory approach to achieve biodiversity conservation\n            with government programs, private sector and local\n            communities can be effective both for improving biodiversity\n            conservation and for promoting economic development.\n            Expanding the original area of a national park to include\n            new ecosystems can be an important approach to climate\n            change mitigation and adaptation. Literature discusses the\n            benefits of incorporating continuous ecosystems to\n            mitigation and support adaptation due to climate change.\n            Income generated through nature based tourism can compete\n            successfully with that generated through agricultural\n            activities, especially considering that agriculture income\n            is limited by the poor soil conditions and water\n            availability. This project demonstrated this in a concrete\n            way, both, through investments and through a detailed\n            socio-economic survey. Community development and managed\n            areas is an important strategy for conservation. The\n            Mayibuye Ndlovu Development Trust (MNDT) is an excellent\n            model for organizing communities around a protected area and\n            for assisting them in establishing a legally registered\n            entity and developing economic activities. The importance of\n            sound science remains essential to conservation planning and\n            in answering inquiries from difficult stakeholders.\n            Gathering reliable scientific information should remain a\n            cornerstone of such projects."}, "docdt": "2011-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
