The AENP lies\n            to the north of the city of Port Elizabeth, in South\n            Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape Province. The park is one of the most\n            diverse conservation areas in Southern Africa which contain\n            rich marine ecosystems. AENP was one of South Africa\u2019s most\n            economically challenged provinces, faced with high rates of\n            illiteracy and unemployment. Persistent poverty, unabated\n            over the years by subsistence livestock farming, posed a\n            threat to the region\u2019s biodiversity and hastened\n            desertification as communities struggled to eke out a living\n            from their surrounding natural resource base. The\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n            provided a grant from the Global Environment Facility as\n            well as the expertise and technical knowledge of several\n            experts. As a result, income from tourism became significant\n            economic benefit to the region. Populations of one of the\n            most threatened species in the AENP and in all of Africa,\n            the black rhinoceros population, continues to increase\n            within the park. Employment amongst local businesses showed\n            steady increase resulting in the creation of new jobs by new\n            private sector enterprises The project has contributed to a\n            revitalization of the local environment and economy by\n            providing an opportunity for local communities to benefit\n            financially from the removal of invasive alien vegetation,\n            and serves as a benchmark for further future community\n            development projects."}, "docdt": "2012-04-13T07:58:01Z"}
