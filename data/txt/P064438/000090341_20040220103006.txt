A. Project Development Objective

1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The project's development objective is to establish a megabiodiversity conservation area around
the existing Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) to avert further ecosystem degradation. The
project also aims to contribute to poverty reduction by creating direct employment in nature
conservation and by catalyzing the development of eco-tourism.

Global environmental objective. The global environmental objective o f the project i s to conserve
a significant representation o f five of the country's seven terrestrial biomes (63% o f the Addo
footprint), including globally important biodiversity (236,000 ha) and 120,000 ha of one o f the
country's three marine provinces, into a single National Park. The project will address threats and
root causes o f biodiversity degradation across a wide range of terrestrial, aquatic and marine
systems.

Background to the project area and project

The project is located inthe Eastern Cape Province, situated along the eastern seaboard o f South
Africa. The Province i s the second largest in South Africa and comprises 24% o f the surface area
of the country. The province i s situated in a climatic transition zone with rainfall ranging from
250 mm inlowland areas to 900 mm per annum on high mountain peaks. The relief i s varied and
comprises coastal dunes, river valleys, mountains and a plateau. Low rainfall and poor soils
means that only 4% of the surface area i s used for agriculture, mainly grazing. Agricultural lands
are generally o f lower productivity classes.

The Province has a population o f 6.4 million people out o f a national total of 43 million (Census
estimate 2001) and is experiencing high annual population growth. The Province lags behind
most other parts o f the country in terms o f socio-economic development, with average Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita at 50% of the national figure. Approximately 57% of all
households live in poverty. The Eastern Cape's economic base i s less diverse than in other
provinces and i s centered around agriculture, manufacturing and industry, although tourism i s
becoming a more important sector inmany rural areas. While traditional agriculture i s in decline,
eco-tourism i s growing and can offer a productive land-use alternative. Secondary industry i s
focused around motor vehicle manufacturing, largely around the main commercial centers o f Port
Elizabeth, Uitenhague and East London. The proposed Coega Harbor development east o f Port
Elizabeth i s expected to enhance economic expansion in this area, through container traffic and a
possible aluminium smelter.

The Eastern Cape Provincial government has had to amalgamate former so-called homelands
including the Ciskei and Transkei, together with administrations from South Africa. This has
proven to be a difficult task as provincial and local governments are generally regarded as weak in
terms of staff numbers and technical capacities.

South Africa is considered a megadiversity country (Conservation International) primarily due to
its floristic variation and high levels of endemism. South Africa's plant diversity i s estimated at

over 23,000 species, representing at least 9% of the global total.            Two o f the world's 25
threatened biodiversity hotspots are found within the country's boundaries. These include the
Succulent Karoo Biome and the Cape Floral Kingdom, portions of which are found within the
project area. The project area also contains the so-called Albany Center of Plant Endemism,
which is located in the Thicket Biome. This Biome, which is confined to South Africa, has some
of the highest levels of endemism globally per km. The project area also contains five out of
South Africa's seven plant biomes making it a unique and critical transition zone to conserve.
Terrestrial biodiversity is under threat from land uses such as agriculture, which i s causing land
degradation, but also from the loss of key species inthe ecosystem including major herbivores and
carnivores. I t i s for these reasons that two other GEF activities are focused on the region. The
Thicket Biome Project will develop a bioregional plan for the greater area, while the Conservation
Farming Project will develop broad land-use models, and research how farmers can change from
traditional (and environmentally degrading) agricultural practices to those of lower impact and
higher economic value. This land-use change is particularly important as a buffer on the edges of
areas requiringprotective management (see Annex 10). In the marine environment, over 11,000
species have been found, o f which 3,500 are endemic. Algoa Bay contains 10% of South Africa's
population of humpback dolphins. Two island groups within Algoa Bay (Bird islands and St.
Croix group) are of great historical and conservation value. Over-harvesting o f marine resources
i s a key cause o f biodiversity loss.

The Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) was established in 1931 and currently covers
approximately 165,000 ha. I t i s a main tourism attraction inthe province, with 120,000 visitors in
2002 (50% foreign). Tourism only impacts on 11% o f the Park area at present. The project
offers land users the prospect o f higher net returns and more diversified and sustainable income
sources. The financial retums to livestock farming are generally low in the area. SANParks
receives numerous sale offers, and several farms are undergoing market driven conversion to
game farming and eco-tourism. Behindthe low averages are significant variations. Dairy farming
can be very profitable, and the Park does not intend to compete with this activity. At the other
extreme, marginal lands are already so overgrazed that rehabilitation and game introduction
appears to be the only viable alternative, (see section E.2 for further detail). The Eastern Cape's
800 km o f coastline supports a small fishing industry based on squid, sardines, hake, kingklip and
crayfish. Mariculture ventures produce abalone and oysters for export, mainly to the Far East. In
the Algoa Bay project area, the dune coast provides high tourism potential for beach activities,
boating, whale and shark watching, recreational fishing, and diving.

The aim of the project i s to increase the area under conservation within the current AENP, into
the Greater Addo Elephant National Park (gAENP), including terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
Over six years, the project will seek to protect the area o f globally significant biodiversity through
land acquisition and partnerships with private land owners. Only a very small percentage of land
inthe project area falls under communal land tenure. A detailed assessment has beenundertaken
of the number of inhabitants who have been and will in future be affected by the proposed
expansion. The number o f inhabitants to date affected and who in future may be affected, i s not
expected to exceed 188 inhabitants.

It is within this context that the South African Government has identified this project as one o f its
key deliverables in the Eastern Cape and requested World Bank and GEF assistance. The overall
investment inthis project will be approximately US$40 million with approximately US$5.5 million
coming from GEF, US$6.5 million from private sector and the remainder primarily from
government and the South African National Parks (SANParks). This provides an excellent
leveraging ratio for GEF funds o f 1: 6.3.

2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Outcome/ImpactIndicators:
The key impact indicators measuring progress towards achieving the project development and
global environmentalobjectives include:

1. 236,000 ha of globally significant terrestrial biodiversity and 120,000 ha o f marine protected
    clustered around the AENP falling under protected area management
2. Globally significant biodiversity maintained and enhanced through the protection o f five key
    biomes under 63% o f the gAENP footprint
3. Additional 46,000 ha o f private land (nature-based conservation partnerships) included into
    the Park by year 6
4. Formal proclamation o f a contiguous Addo Marine Protected Area (MPA), inclusive o f the
    two island groups

    ecosystem health, safeguarding o f endemism and recovery o f threatened species (monitored
    according to the Guidelinesfor Monitoring and Evaluation of GEF Projects)
6. Employment levels inthe gAENP area increased by 30% over the current baseline case.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 18995          Date of latest CAS discussion: 03/1999

This project is not in the current CAS. In 2003, the South African Government identified this
project as a key deliverable to sustainable development in the Eastern Cape and requested World
Bank and GEF assistance. This project addresses two of the main development objectives o f the
CAS, namely: 1) Promoting higher growth and employment while maintaining macro-economic
stability in order to generate sustained improvement in living standards; and 2) Fostering social
and environmental sustainability by reducing poverty and inequality through investment inhuman
and natural capital, accelerating and improving the delivery o f assets and services to the
disadvantaged segments o f society and enhancing environmental management.

The project will make contributions towards these two CAS objectives by:                  sustaining
improvements in living standards especially among the poorest groups in society in the area
through employment indirect work programs and increased private sector eco-tourism expansion;
strengthening sustainable conservation and integrated ecosystem management                  through
investments in human and natural capital, institutional strengthening, and park business
development; and implementing a replicable model o f community-supported, protected area
management.

la. Global Operational strategyprogram objective addressed by the project:
South Africa ratifiedthe Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) on November 2, 1995. Inmeeting its
obligations to this convention, the Government completed a preliminary First African National
Report to the Fourth Conference o f the Parties in January 1998. A National Biodiversity Strategy
and Action Plan is currently being prepared. As a result, South Africa has identified at national
and regional levels, key natural ecosystems to be protected. The proposed project is directly
linked to the efforts of the Government of South Africa to address national and global
environmental priorities by reversing land degradation and enhancing biodiversity, while also
improving local livelihoods.

The project is fully consistent with the objectives and priorities of the GEF Operational Strategy
and the GEF Operational Programs for OP 1, Arid and Semi-Arid Zone Ecosystems and OP 2,
Coastal Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems.             Linkages with OP 1 and 2 are through:
conservation and sustainable use o f biodiversity; monitoring of outcomes using key indicators;
investing in technical and capacity building activities; focusing on critical habitats and integrating
biodiversity protection with sustainable rural development; following best practice and ensuring
local participation in planning and implementation. The project i s located in an arid to semi-arid
global biodiversity hotspot containing five out o f seven o f the country's biomes, including the
Albany Plant Center o f Endemism. The marine component is located in a critical transition zone
after which the diversity of marine species drops off considerably.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Key sectoral issues and government strategies:

Issue 1. Low economic growth and employment, poverty and inequality. In the Eastern Cape
province, more than half of all households live below the poverty line. Almost one-third of the
provincial population i s below the age of 15 years, suggesting continued high population growth
in the future. An estimated 39% of the provincial labor force of 3.9 million (in the 16-64 year
group) is unemployed. Conventional livestock farms inthe project area generally employ no more
than 1 worker per 367 ha, and up to 50% of farms in the planning domain of the project are
vacant. Monthly wages on the most profitable commercial farms average only US$36-US$56 per
month. The more productive and profitable dairy and citrus farms are located near the coast
rather than inland in the further reaches of the project area. Economic growth alone will not be
sufficient to reduce chronic poverty and inequality to more acceptable levels. Disadvantaged
people need greater access to education and natural resources (especially clean air and water).
They also need better opportunities to share in the benefits from natural resource development,
including mining, forestry, and tourism.

Government strategy. The government has introduced a number o f initiatives to address low
economic growth and employment in the Eastern Cape Province.                 Priority in government
spending is on basic infrastructure and social services. For example, 83% o f the Eastern Cape's
budget i s spent on Health, Welfare and Education. The Nelson Mandela metropole is proposing
to undertake an impact study to design a realistic and effective intervention strategy for the
HIV/AIDS problem. The government is trying to attract foreign and domestic investment to


                                                - 5 -

expand the local economy, generate foreign exchange and provide employment: examples include
the Greater Fish River and East London Spatial Development Initiative, and the Coega Industrial
Development Zone, located on the edge of the proposed gAENP. The Working for Water and
Poverty Relief Program are targeting poorer provinces by providing investment to eco-tourism
infrastructure and the employment of local communities in public works programs. The Eastern
Cape Province i s expected to receive over US$9million from these programs over the next three
years.   Government has reduced unsustainable subsidies to the agricultural sector, which is
encouraging some farmers to convert land (presently used for grazing) to more environmentally
compatible and economically efficient uses such as hunting and eco-tourism.         South Africa's
White Paper on tourism targets the sector as a key contribution to growth. Nationally, tourism is
currently growing at over 5% per annum and a target has been set to generate 10% of GDP from
tourism in the near future. The Eastern Cape has been identified as a prime location in which to
stimulate and support eco-tourism. SANParks i s increasingly focusing on the social ecology
components of parks and designing them to benefit neighboring communities through greater
access to resources and benefit sharing. Furthermore, the private sector i s being invited to
manage facilities especially at the upper end of the tourism market, which will generate local
employment and income. The gAENP project fits well with this national strategy.

Issue 2. Conservation of natural resources as basisfor sustainable development. Environment
i s a cornerstone of the economy encompassing mining, agriculture, forestry, and nature-based
tourism. There i s considerable scope for growth in all these sectors, especially tourism. A t the
same time, serious concerns exist about land degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity and
poor quality o f water in some areas, coastal zone degradation, solid waste management, air
pollution, and inappropriate development from poor regional planning. Environmental problems,
ifnotaddressed,willhinderlonger-termeconomic andsocialdevelopment inthecountry. In
addition, environmental degradation affects the poor most of all because of their high dependency
on natural resources for livelihoods.

The project area contains a portion of one of the world's 25 biodiversity hotspots. Further, the
area contains valuable cultural property such as rock art and artifacts, which need better
management and protection. The primary land-use has historically been for grazing on marginal
agricultural land, This has placed considerable pressure on much of the area and land degradation
i s evident in the lower rainfall areas. However, given the inherently low productivity of land for
agriculture and the resulting unprofitable nature o f traditional agriculture in the Eastern Cape,
farms are getting larger as they shift towards more extensive practices.          De-population i s
occurring with fewer owners and staff on farms, and there has been a movement towards game
farming and commercial hunting(see Annex 12). While this has been a provincial-wide response,
it i s not taking place at the pace required in the project area to allow sufficient boundary
expansion to sustain the growing population o f elephants, as well as the re-introduction o f key big
game species. Without this boundary expansion, coupled with re-introduction o f major game
species and ecosystem management, the conservation o f globally significant biodiversity will be at
risk. The marine resources inthis area are under considerable pressure from recreational angling,
pollution, and commercial fishing operations in and around the MPA. Illegal harvesting o f
abalone by organized syndicates and individuals is becoming a serious issue, far outstripping the
legal harvest worth US$65,000 in2002.



                                               - 6 -

Government strategy. Government strategy has been fairly comprehensive through a series of
reforms, which are designed to: (i)enable economic growth while protecting biodiversity; (ii)
protect biodiversity and the country's natural resource base since half of the population still lives
inrural areas and dependonclean river water, fuelwood, plants for medicinal use, and subsistence
agriculture for survival; (iii)meet international commitments to conserve biodiversity and the
environment; (iv) place people at the center of development; and (v) effectively promote
integrated ecosystem management in order to achieve these objectives. Over the next ten years,
the government i s planning to increase the total land area under protected management in South
Africa from the current 6% to the international norm of 8%.              South Africa has ratified
international conventions aimed at conserving biodiversity - Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) -

International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES); reversingland degradation - United Nations
and begun to fulfill its obligations; preventing trade in endangered species - Convention for

Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), etc. The government has introduced new
legislation to promote sustainable development through its National Environmental Management
(NEMA) Act (1998). New National Biodiversity, and Protected Areas Acts will be promulgated
in2003, to enable new approachesfor protectingbiodiversity andpromoting sustainable use. On
the marine side, a White Paper for Sustainable Coastal Development (2000) has beenproducedto
guide proper coastal protection. This will help manage the incorporation of the proposed Addo
MPA into the gAENP. SANParks i s currently negotiating with Marine and Coastal Management
(DEAT) to draw up a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding shifting specific
management responsibilities in the proposed MPA to SANParks, especially for monitoring and
enforcement.    SANParks will be appointing a Marine Coordinator and a specialist from the
SANParks poaching unit in 2003 to assist the gAENP team with MPA planning and coordination.

Issue 3. Institutional structures, capacity, and governance for natural resources/biodiversity.
Concerns exist over national as well as sub-national institutional structures, capacity and
governance with respect to natural resource management. These concerns include inadequate
local participation in resource management planning and program implementation; weak
management capacity; insufficient coordination among relevant government organizations; and
poor program monitoring procedures. National Parks in South Africa have historically been
constrained by low finance, and to some extent insufficient numbers o f trained staff, outdated
management systems, and governance structures. Protected areas such as AENP are slowly
expanding revenues to meet operating costs, fund strategic investments in infrastructure and land
acquisition, and provide services to the high standard demanded by visitors. However, without
GEF support, it will be difficult for the Park to develop a solid and sustainable financial
foundation, as well as achieving expansion to the desired level to conserve globally important
biodiversity.

Government strategy. Within protected area management in South Africa, the needto reform and
strengthen institutions has been recognized. While the forthcoming National Biodiversity Act,
and Protected Areas Act provide policy guidance inthis regard, SANParks will increasingly focus
on its core objective o f national biodiversity conservation and integrated ecosystem management,
while improving financial performance.        A major organizational strategy was designed and
implemented in 2002 to help achieve these objectives (see Annex 18 on performance of



                                                 - 7 -

SANParks inmeeting its mandate). Management consultants assisted with this process through a
performance audit of SANParks. One result o f the new strategy i s increased outsourcing o f
non-core functions, rationalized tariff structures, dedicated fund-raising units, and streamlining.
Restructuring has reduced staff numbers by 12% and increased operating efficiencies. Revenue
generation has improved and a deficit position o f US$2.7 million two years ago has now been
turned into a modest operating surplus o f US$0.7 million. New initiatives approved by the
government (and integrated into the project), will help National Park managers to meet strategic
conservation goals by entering into various incentive-based arrangements with surrounding land
owners.    These innovative alternatives to outright land purchase can increase the area under
Conservation while using financial resources more efficiently. Committees involving stakeholders
are being established across the country as part o f the new park governance regime. Parks are
expected to be more consultative; ensuring community support i s regarded as critical for future
success.    Parks are also viewed as a key mechanism to contribute towards community
development and improved local livelihoods. The capacity o f government and SANParks has
been recognized as needing strengthening in some areas to better deliver on its mandate.
Priorities identified to date include the installation o f new environmental management systems, the
introduction o f electronic information systems, using GIS to better design and manage parks and
conservation areas, and increased public education, awareness, and participation.          Training
associated with each o f these priorities i s also needed.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will make interventions to address the strategic issues described above:

Low economic growth and employment, poverty and inequality.                The project will support
implementation o f government policy in the region to reduce poverty, improve livelihoods and
strengthen provincial economic development. The aim i s to develop a management model which
maximizes the socio-economic advantages o f the protected area without compromising the
globally valuable biodiversity. A key objective i s therefore to support a land conversion process
from marginal traditional farming to conservation management and eco-tourism within the
gAENP. Recent experience has shown this land-use shift generates higher employment while
supporting enhanced conservation; a win-win situation. Inparticular, the project aims to develop
a social ecology and community development program to improve the local community benefits
from the Park, To this effect, SANParks i s developing a new social policy specifically for this
project, which could be a model for other protected areas inthe country. Farm workers displaced
by Park expansion will be resettled and compensated in accordance with Bank safeguard policies.
Displaced farm workers will be given priority for new employment generated through the project.
This includes expanded eco-tourism with the private sector, sustainable harvesting o f natural
resources in specified    zones, alien species removal, and small works programs in the Addo
community. The creation of small and medium enterprises i s another integral element. Overall,
the expansion o f environmentally sustainable tourism will generate local income and employment
as well as contribute to regional and national economic development.

Conservation of natural resources as basis for sustainable development. The most important
project intervention will be the sustained conservation o f the region's globally significant
biodiversity. Inparticular, the project will address the root causes and threats to biodiversity loss



                                                   - 8 -

by focusing on integrated ecosystem management. The strategic interventions will create an
integrated terrestrial and marine park based on best-practice conservation planning principles,
The area required for incorporation into the Park i s predicated on baseline targets for vegetative
units and the habitat requirements of large herbivores and predators, some of which need to be
re-introduced into the ecosystem. It is also based on the need to maintain critical ecological
patterns and processes in the landscape. In order to achieve the longer-term goals o f expanding
the protected area into the gAENP, legal and institutional barriers hindering conversion o f farms
to conservation areas will be evaluated and an incentive framework put in place to attract more
farm owners bordering the Park to participate. The project will also develop and implement a
sustainable resource-use policy with local communities in specific zones.         With the marine
environment, the project area will bring under protection over 86% o f South Africa's endemic
marine vertebrate species, 34% o f South Africa's endemic fish species, and 95% o f the primary
marine production in Algoa Bay (See Annex 17). The project area will also include critically
important offshore islands containing threatened bird species such as the Cape Jackass (or
African) penguin. Commercial and recreational fishing in the MPA will be rationalizedin specific
use-zones and put on a more sustainable footing.

Institutional structures, capacity, and governance for natural resourcedbiodiversity.           The
project will support the South African government and SANParks to develop and pilot new
institutional arrangements for participatory management and integrated ecosystem management.
It will design a cost-effective and efficient structure for managing the Park, based on more
outsourcing o f non-core functions, improved staff structures, posts and job descriptions, as well
as work program requirements.       The project will facilitate implementation o f an Integrated
Environmental Management System (IEMS), building on experience and lessons learned in the
Cape Peninsula Biodiversity Conservation Project and Cape Strategy and Action Plan. Training
programs will then be developed and implemented.          The project will also establish a sound
financial framework for the gAENP, create new and unique relationships with the private sector
for eco-tourism and the management o f tourist facilities, and form new governance structures and
consultative processes with key stakeholders.

C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (seeAnnex 2 for a detaileddescriptionandAnnex 3 for a detailedcost breakdown):
Project Vision
The project has identified five inter-related components to protect the exceptional terrestrial and
marine biodiversity o f the Addo region through strategic conservation planning and
implementation, innovative land incorporation and development planning, and social capacity
building. Over the six years of the project, the total Park area will likely increase to cover about
236,000 ha o f terrestrial (Table 1) and 120,000 ha o f marine habitat. During the project, the
majority o f land acquisition will be through new contractual arrangements and gradually reduce
the ratio o f purchasedcontractual land from 88/12 to about 72/28.

 project

The current AENP i s a mosaic of landscapes, which are not completely contiguous.                    The
long-term vision i s that of a Park with a single fenced area for wildlife, but significantly larger than
at present. The project will achieve this vision by consolidatingexisting Park areas through highly
strategic land acquisition, focusing on priority parcels identified using a range o f criteria, but in
particular, potential conservation values and threats. Given the need to address broader goals o f
greater public participation, expanded tourism development with private-public partnerships, and
 increased social development in the region, a cautious and phased approach i s warranted. Park
expansion i s planned over five phases (see Annex 19). Each phase will focus on a specific block
o f the Park, and include boundary expansion, fencing, wildlife management, tourism development
 and social development. When all five phases are completed, many o f the fences separating each
 of the five blocks will be removed, thus consolidating one single large Park with expanded wildlife
range and well-developed tourism products. A marine protected area o f 120,000 ha will be added
 inAlgoa Bay to complete the vision o f a contiguous Park spanning several terrestrial and marine
 ecosystems. See Figure 1below.

preparatory studies focused on the systematic conservation planning exercise, freshwater
conservation, proposed marine protected area (MPA), and ecological monitoring o f the marine
environment (see Annex 2). The five sub-components each largely deal with park planning and
will form part o f the overall IntegratedEnvironmental Management System (IEMS).

i)ConservationPlan:
This sub-component will update the terrestrial, aquatic, marine, and cultural databases produced
during preparation, and subsequent studies, and amend the drafted conservation plan as required
to help conservation science better direct management.           Selected research projects will be
identified and commissioned, monitored and evaluated under this component as part o f the
ongoing maintenance o f the Conservation Plan.           Issues concerning zonation, surrounding
land-use, contractual incorporation and business arrangements will be further negotiated, with
action plans prepared for implementation.

ii)Strategic(Development)Plan:
Based primarily on the above information, a costed and phased strategic development plan will be
produced to guide the Park for the next six years. It will indicate the preferred development
zones (as part o f the Zonation Plan), rehabilitation areas, as well as infrastructure (roads, fences,
buildings, visitor facilities) within the Park. In addition, it will address the redefinition o f an
upgraded SANParks management structure for the Park, plus the development o f a
re-introduction plan for key game species.

iii)ParkManagementPlan:
A Park Management Plan (procedures and policies) will be drafted as part o f the IEMS to
facilitate more effective and efficient daily management. It will include clear and measurable
deliverables, which will be monitored andreported on a monthly basis.

iv) MonitoringSystem andResearch:
The Project monitoring system will be implemented and updated based on year 1 experience. It
will be augmented with key research on the biophysical and socio-economic environments in
order to monitor and adjust the impact o f the Park on the community, economy and environment.
The project Business Plan for year 1, sets out in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) the
indicators for the monitoring o f project objectives. Further, the IEMS to be implemented under
component 3 will be used as an adaptive management instrument to ensure the sustainability o f
park management.

v) Marine ProtectedArea (MPA):
To facilitate the proclamation o f the Addo Marine Protected Area (MPA), a marine planning
framework will be developed through consultations with all relevant stakeholders.                  An
implementation plan will then be prepared once all required negotiations have been conducted and
approvals obtained.     Legal studies will be undertaken to address potential conflicts between
current terrestrial and marine conservation legislation. A social assessment will be undertaken to
evaluate the impact o f the M P A on current users as part o f the marine planning framework.

COMPONENT 2: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN             -

The implementation        of    the development plan       including ecological management,
infrastructure and land incorporation, and socio-economic capacity building.

Implementation will occur in three different management scenarios: (1) SANParks land owned
and managed by SANParks, (2) concessioned areas within SANParks land, and (3) contractual
land adjoining the Park where SANParks may or may not manage the land.                 The three
sub-components will roll out o f the development plan, inclusive o f ecological management,
infrastructure development and land incorporation, to ensure effective implementation o f the
development plan.

i)SANParkdParkEnvironmentalInfrastructureProvision:
This sub-component focuses on the implementation o f the development plan.          Development
within identified zones will follow a plan, and investments will include all fixed infrastructures
(roads, fences, water provision, conservation center, heritage sites, waste management systems,
alien control, EMP and rehabilitation plans).

ii)LandIncorporation:
Land will be incorporated into the Park depending upon:         its relative value with respect to
enhancing ecological integrity and biological representativeness and biodiversity; improving local
socio-economic conditions and minimizing costs o f acquisition (including resettlement);  and the
potential to reduce threats to biological integrity. Options for land acquisition include direct
purchasing, contractual arrangements, management agreements, buffer arrangements, and
expropriation.    A prioritization matrix for the incorporation option has been developed for
SANParks (see Annex 19). The Conservation Plan developed in the preparatory phase helped
define the strategic incorporation zones but will need constant refinement as new information and
assessment techniques are developed (see Component 1).

iii) IncentiveContractingPartnerships:
Incentives will be offered to induce land owners to convert high priority areas to conservation.
Incentives could include legal recognition, traversing rights, management inputs, extension
services, fencing support, tax exemptions and game stocking (see Annex 19).

COMPONENT 3: INSTITUTION & GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES
GEF: US$1.460 million      - Co-Financing:   US$2.097 million Total: US$3.557 million
                                                                -

The development of institutions and governance structures to ensure the successful
implementation of theAddo project and management of the Park.

This component includes the design, implementationand maintenance o f management systems and
structures to enhance Park management and strengthening/creating institutional structures for
effective, participatory Park planning and program implementation.




                                               - 13-

i)IntegratedEnvironmentalManagementSystem(IEMS):
An IEMS based on IS014000 will be developed to enhance Park environmental and general
management. Technology and expertise developed in the GEF-financed Cape Peninsula National
Park project will be used in developing the Addo IEMS. The IEMS will include the development
o f corporate policies and park specific policies, the strategic development plan, procedures,
monitoring indicators, review and auditing procedures.

ii)gAENPManagementStructures:
Based on the developmental plan and the extent to which concessions will be introduced, a new
gAENP management structure will be developed and approved by SANParks for implementation
for the day-to-day management o f the expanded Park. The existing Park Steering Committee
(PSC) will be reviewed and restructured in line with SANParks strategy for overall governance o f
the gAENP. The Steering Committee's prime function will be to provide a high level oversight
function for the Park, the project and the Project Management Unit (PMU), to ensure compliance
with the project's goals and GEF grant funding agreement.             It is envisaged that as the
development o f the Park management plan i s initiated, the Addo Planning Forum (APF) will be
adapted and transformed to form a dedicated Park Forum.

iii)ProjectManagementUnit(PMU):
The PMU which i s responsible for day to day project management, procurement, and
administrative functions, will continue to execute the project on a daily basis. The unit will work
closely with gAENP staff but under supervision o f the PSC, and particularly that o f the gAENP
Coordinator. Financial management will be provided through SANParks staff and management
systems.

iv) Park BusinessPlan:
A business plan will be prepared, which models the financial requirements o f the Park including
income and expenditure, and which provides a basis for adjusting to the roll out o f the
Development Plan from the PIP. Initially, a year-one business plan will be drafted with financial
budgets, followed by a full plan, utilizing consultants under P M U and PSC guidance. The full
business plan will take into consideration the deliverables o f the PIP inclusive o f detailed action
plans, responsibilities, measurables and financials. The business plan will be reviewed annually as
the project i s implemented.

v) Management Informationand ReportingSystem (MIRS):
An electronic hardware and software system will be designed and implemented to manage the
IEMS.     The MIRS will be database driven, producing reports in conformance with the
requirements o f the governance structures o f the project, plus the management o f the gAENP. A
GIS officer will be appointed by SANParks to oversee the necessary databases and generate the
required reports in consultation with the PMU. The design and implementation o f the MIRS will
be coordinated by the PMU, utilizing services o f suitable providers.

vi) TrainingPrograms:
Training programs will help staff apply the new systems and technologies, and build a clearer
understanding o f policies and operational procedures contained in the IEMS. A training needs


                                                - 14-

analysis for new and existing staff will identify required training to implement the new
requirements posed by monitoring systems, environmental and cultural management, business and
financial management, socioecology, communication and public information, and HIV-AIDS
awareness.    Training needs will be matched with suitable activity-related courses, and staff
enrolled accordingly. Staff will be monitored on completion o f training to ensure conformance
with new systems and usefulness o f training programs. Training for non-SANParks staff will be
addressed inComponent 4.

COMPONENT4: COMMUNITYDEVELOPMENT & SOCIAL ECOLOGY.
GEF: US$0.153 million Co-Financing: US$3.321 million Total: US$3.474 million
                           -                                      -

ThePark should benefit communities through enabling managed access to natural resources,
access to employment, micro enterprise opportunities, training and environmental education.

This component will support implementation o f the Park development plan where it relates to
employment and economic benefits through communal conservation strategies, Small, Medium
and Micro Enterprise (SMME) opportunities, environmental education and fair resettlement o f
displaced individuals. This component will forge the benefits o f sustainable natural resource use
with social upliftment, particularly o f previously disadvantaged sectors o f society.

i)AccesstoNaturalandCulturalResources:
Although a preliminary survey was completed during project preparation, the project will finance
further research to better understand the scope and importance o f important cultural sites and
resources within the Park boundaries (see Annex 14). In addition, a policy guiding managed
access to these resources, in compliance with SANParks policies, will be developed and
implemented for the Park. This will also meet the requirements o f the Bank's safeguards for
cultural resources (OPN 11.03 and OP 4.11).

ii) Access to Employment:
Members of local communities, and in particular displaced people, will be given priority for new
jobs created through the project directly and through expanded eco-tourism development.         In
addition, these individuals will be offered training opportunities to help them benefit from new
employment opportunities in the Park. As part o f this process, a database and suitable policy
framework are needed. The SANParks national policy on Social Ecology will be modified to suit
the gAENP project in relation to meeting Bank safeguard requirements on involuntary
resettlement. Available employment datddatabases will be acquired from local government for
analysis to match with gAENP employment opportunities. The Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS) will provide useful baseline information about
individuals affected by farm conversion that can feed into employment programs (see Annex 13).
Gaps inthe database, such as skills analysis, will be identified and corrected.

iii)EmploymentandEconomicBenefitsBasedonCommunalConservationStrategies:
Analyses will be undertaken to identify small micro-enterprise                (SMME)   development
opportunities within gAENP in areas such as fencing, arts and crafts, charcoal production,
eco-tourism, alien clearing, rehabilitation, construction, and sustainable harvesting. SMMEs will


                                                - 15-

be assisted by gaining access to all available national S M M E incentive schemes. Research will be
done to identify what goods and services to gAENP may be sourced from SMMEs. Training o f
SMME staff members will be an important section o f this component with a needs analysis having
to be undertaken, with training undertaken in identified gap areas.          Such training will be
coordinatedwhere possible with that identified in Component 3. Some employment opportunities
will be through Working for Water and Poverty Relief programs funded by the South African
Government.

iv) Conservation Education:
An Environmental Education (EE) Program will be designed and implemented. As part o f the
program, a sustainable and cost-effective education program and conservation center will be
established to support community and visitor awareness about the Park. A limited number o f
tertiary scholarships @ossibly two per annum) will be provided to train a cadre o f new officials
from the community to enter SANParks at a professional level and advance in the organization.
Relevant tertiary education courses will be identified and then a recruitment process will be
pursued to select suitable candidates for evaluation and enrolment. To ensure effective operation
of the Conservation Education Center, a number o f Conservation Education Officers will be
recruited.

v) Resettlement Compensation(Resettlement):
Although the project's social objective i s to ensure that the greater Addo community largely
benefits from the project, SANParks will make funds available and source opportunities in
associated projects (Work for Water, and Poverty Relief) to ensure that any local people
negatively affected by the project are fairly compensated. Site-specific criteria for compensation,
developed during project preparation as part o f the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS), will be implemented in conjunction with other government
and local government authorities responsible for restitution issues.

COMPONENT5: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
GEF: US$0.340 million Co-Financing: US$6.729 million Total: US$7.069 million
                           -                                      -

Stimulating overall economic development in the area by creating an enabling environment
for tourism and associated economic activity.

This component will focus on enhancing the conditions for broader economic development inthe
area, largely through the tourism sector and the National Park.          Mainstreaming the project
objectives and achievements will be a priority to sustain the considerable support the project has
received from central government, local communities and donors.

 i) Marketingand ProductDevelopment:
A marketing plan will be prepared for the Park, inclusive o f existing Addo market research
information plus a management information reporting system (MIRS) module to record relevant
tourism statistics.  The marketing plan will include a communication strategy, new product
development, and identify prospective eco-tourism products emanating from gAENP.            These
identified products will be packaged on an established web site, along with all other relevant


                                                - 16-

information       associated     with    the    project   (see    www.addoe1ephantpark.co.za).        A
communications/marketing officer will be recruited as part o f the new gAENP management
structure.

ii)ConcessioningandPartnership:
The SANParks concessioning plan will be implemented to attract private sector investment in
eco-tourism facilities in the Park. Part o f this sub-component includes the development o f terms
o f reference, identification o f contractual partners, and creating a MIRS module to feed into the
wider IEMS-MIRS.

2. Key policy and institutionalreforms supported by the project:
The project will focus on three key reform issues as follows:

2.1, Incentive based conservation strategy:
A conservation strategy will be developed that provides incentives for landowners and
communities to support new contractual land conversion arrangements with gAENP (see Annex
19). While landowner conversion to eco-tourism is taking place in some parts o f the province, a
number o f barriers appear to be preventing enough landowners and communities in the project
area from following suit. The creation o f large consolidated areas are also essential for the
introduction o f new game. Building on the findings o f the preparatory phase, the project will
prioritize the barriers to be removed and further develop and implement the incentive framework
to support the conversion process.         The scale o f this project, including the number o f farms
involved, makes this a unique venture in South Africa.

2.2. Park planning to be informed by integratedecosystem planning:
In South Africa, park planning and establishing park boundaries have not always been based on
scientifically sound methodologies. Project preparation has piloted the use o f a new model which
sets targets for the determination o f marine, aquatic and terrestrial components to be included into
the Park as well as their integration.       This new approach applies the concept o f bioregional
planning, which has effectively been adopted as government policy. The project will demonstrate


                                                  - 17-

the value o f this method for adoption in future SANParks operations, in addition to guidinghow
to include local stakeholders to a much greater degree inplanning processes.

2.3. Sustainable use and resettlement:
Buildingon SANParks policy on sustainable use o fnaturalresources, the project will develop and
implement sustainable resource use policies and practices as part o f routine park management
operations where applicable. This will be undertaken inthe marine and terrestrial components and
will provide experience for other SANParks operations.           With resettlement, SANParks is
developing a new policy and practices based on South African and World Bank requirements
which should have potential for wider application.         Some program sub-components will be
integrated with social ecology components o f the project to ensure that local residents, and
especially displaced farm workers benefit from the project. The creation and development o f
SMME's will endeavor to draw upon this framework, as well as ideas from well established
Community Driven Development (CDD) projects inthe subregion.

3. Benefits and target population:
Benefits
Environmental benefits
    0   The over-riding benefit o f the gAENP project is the conservation o f a unique association
        o f biodiversity though integrated ecosystem management. The opportunity to bring five
        o f the seven biomes o f South Africa, estuaries and marine systems, coastal dunefields and
        offshore islands all within one park will generate unique national and global benefits.
    0   The conservation o f endangered and Red Data Book species i s enhanced, such as the
        African elephant, the south western black rhino (Diceros bicornis bicornis), African
        penguins, certain succulent plants, etc.
    0   Cultural resources, such as archaeology and paleontology, are preserved (see Annex 14).
    0   The project will reduce land degradation currently being caused by overgrazing, alien
        plant encroachment and unsustainable land use. At the same time it will not detract from
        more productive and viable agriculture such as dairy, chicory and mohair in the larger
        region.
    0   Environmental education programs will be made available through the development o f at
        least one Environment Education Center with associated staff.

Socio-economic benefits
    0   Of the US$39 million to be spent on the gAENP project, at least US$6 million will benefit
        local communities and normal contractors through community developmenthocia1ecology
        and routine contracting opportunities.       Funding will include government-sponsored
        Working for Water, Poverty Relief, and social ecology projects to enhance ecological
        services, natural resource management, minor works and eco-tourism. Wages paid, will
        be significantly higher than in agriculture.     In addition, resources will also be made
        available through the incentive framework to enable interested land owners to convert to
        more viable conservation land-use options.
        Tourism numbers are expected to increase from 120,000 in 2002 to 180,000 by the end o f
        year 6, in-line with capacity expansion.     Associated tourism expenditures and indirect
        economic impacts will also increase significantly. The Park will be the only one in the


                                                - 18-

        world offering visitors the "Big 7" experience, comprising o f the traditional Big 5
        terrestrial game species (lion, elephant, leopard, rhino, buffalo) plus marine whales and
        sharks (including the Great White shark).
        Through the project, conservation programs and eco-tourism development are estimated
        to create no less than 212 permanent and 914 temporary, contract jobs. The figure could
        reach 2,370 jobs. Employment with conservation land-use and eco-tourism represents
        about 1job/210 ha versus the agricultural norm o f 1job/367 ha.
        The Park i s expected to attract foreign investment from donors and investors. Given the
        fact that the Park i s already functional, and there i s to be greater diversification o f the
        wildlife product, investment opportunities will be enhanced.

Target Population
SANParks
SANParks, as the executing agency, will be one o f the key target groups in the project. It will
benefit from technical and financial support, capacity building, institutional development and
assistance relating to policy and management reform. SANParks will also gain valuable hands-on
experience in developing cutting edge conservation and integrated ecosystem management and
economic models. The project will also share models and lessons learned with the CAPE Action
Plan and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) supported Wild Coast project.

Government
The project will support effective implementation o f government environmental policies, poverty
alleviation strategies and enhanced social equity.        Departments and agencies involved in
supporting the project will benefit from institutional capacity building. Collaboration will be
enhanced between agencies and departments supporting the project.

NGOs and civil society
NGOs will be consulted together with other stakeholders about the project. They will also play a
more specific role in formalized Park structures such as the Park Forum. Civil society, including
farm workers, will be consulted at all stages and views and opinions used to inform the
implementation o f the project. Environmental education components will aim to strengthen civil
society understanding about environment issues and Park management.

Private sector and land ownersJarmers
The project will further develop and implement a planning model, which provides far greater
private sector and land-owner involvement in management implementation. Land-owners will be
specifically targeted to form partnerships that shift underutilized farmland into sustainable
conservation, ensure better retention o f labor, rehabilitation o f land and development o f minor
infrastructure. Private sector operators, outside o f landowners, will be invited to develop and/or
manage aspects of the park development inareas o f comparative advantage such as eco-tourism.




                                               -  19-

Local unemployedpeople
Employment and entrepreneurial opportunities will materialize from Poverty Relief and Working
for Water funding as well as more stable forms of employment associatedwith the Park expansion
and development of eco-tourism. Training opportunities will first be targeted at resettled people.
Inaddition, the identification and creation of SMMEs will be encouraged. A training planwill be
developed through the project which will include basic environmental and cultural management,
natural resource use enterprises (charcoal, arts and crafts), alien vegetation removal, basic
business and financial management, basic adult education, and HIV/AIDS awareness.

4, Institutionaland implementationarrangements:
SANParks, largely using existing staff, will be the lead executing agency for the Project over the
six year duration.    Other stakeholders that will collaborate in implementation include the
provincial Department of Economic Affairs, Environment and Tourism, national government
departments (Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Land Affairs, Labor), various NGOs,
community-based organizations (CBOs), the farming community, academic institutions, private
land-owners and private enterprise. Collaboration with project implementation will be effected
through the following institutions:

ProjectManagementUnit (PMU)
The current PMU consisting o f a part time SANParks project manager, finance officer and
administrative officer will be strengthened with the project paying for a procurement officer and
full-time project coordinator/manager.      SANParks has already deployed a full time marine
coordinator (October 2003) to the PMU.             The PMU will be responsible for project
implementation including:      (i)drafting and coordinating the development, management and
business plans by short term consultants; (ii) day-to-day management of project development and
implementation; (iii)annual work plans and budget preparation; (iv) donor coordination; (v)
secretariat function for the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and the Addo Planning Forum
(APF); (vi) financial management including establishing a financial management system,
withdrawal applications, financial reporting, procurement of consultants, goods, and services; (vii)
establishing the Park Forum (viii) reporting via a new Management InformationReporting System
(MIRS).

ProjectSteeringCommittee(PSC)
The PSC will provide a high-level oversight function for project implementation according to the
requirements o f the gAENP, the vision for the Park, Bank requirements, and the GEF Grant
Agreement. It will therefore ensure full integration o f project development into Park management
activities and provide a holistic and well-coordinated management platform. The PSC will meet
approximately every 6 months to review project progress and agree to the proposed project
deliverables for the following 6 months. The PSC will be chaired by the gAENP Park Manager.
The PSC composition is expected to be mainly SANParks personnel including: (i) PMU      The
Project Manager (ii)Park Manager, team leaders of the working groups (and section rangers,
financial, tourism representation as required); (iii)SANParks gAENP Coordinator; (iv) Head:
SANParks Park Planning; (v) Poverty Relief & Work-for-Water Coordinator; (vi) SANParks
Manager: Commercial Development; (vii) contractual park representative; (viii) representative
from Provincial DEAT; (ix) representative from APF and later the Park Forum.


                                               - 20 -

 ProjectWorking Groups (PWG)
 The PWGs, comprising o f 4-10 people, will be tasked with execution o f the key project

+components by the Project Manager.        They will play a crucial role in integrating the project
 activities into ongoing work of the Park organization and staff.        A specific structure is not
 required at this stage; working groups will be formed as needed and dissolved as the assigned
 activity i s completed. Members will be co-opted as needed but in general will include the Project
 Manager, a senior working group leader (preferably drawn from Park management), SANParks
 staff, government officials and any other key organizations or individuals.

 ParkForum
 It is envisaged that as development o f the Park management plan proceeds, the existing Addo
 Planning Forum will be transformed into a Park Forum. The establishment o f the Forum entails
 the nomination o f local stakeholders including farm worker representatives through a consultative
 process. This process will commence duringproject implementation phase. Other structures are
 also envisaged and may include the creation o f land-owner forums through which the Park
 management will work in order to enter into land incorporation and management agreements to
 achieve project objectives.

 Resettlement Working Group (RWG)
 The RWG will deal with all relevant issues associated with the resettlement o f affected farm
 workers,     The functions o f the RWG include: acting as an advisory and oversight body to
 SANParks in matters relating to resettlement; serving as a forum to solve any arising problems;
 and assisting SANParks in overseeing all the phases o f the resettlement process, including the
 allocation o f jobs and generation o f livelihoods, compensation and other benefits. The RWG
 composition includes: (i)farm workers representatives as nominated by the farm workers
 (affected by Phase 1, from 1997-2003 phase); (ii)designated SANParks representative

 FinancialManagement
 Financial management assessment
 SANParks will provide financial management functions to the PMU. A financial self-assessment
 has been completed and reviewed by the Bank staff. The assessment indicates high compatibility
 between Bank guidelines and requirements, and the SANParks financial management systems and
 procedures. SANParks has demonstrated excellent financial management performance in other
 Bank/GEF projects. A demonstration that the system and arrangements are able to produce the
 periodic Financial Management Reports (FMRs) will take place prior to effectiveness. A Bank
 accredited FMS will review the situation prior to declaration o f project effectiveness.

 Project monitoring, evaluation, and management reports
 The PMU will produce Project Management Reports (PMRs) that reflect project performance,
 including expenditures, against the logframe indicators presented in Annex 1.            Other key


                                                  - 21 -

monitoring systems will include the production of six-month project progress reports to the Bank
prior to supervision missions, as well as routine SANParks and national and provincial data,
which will indicate whether the project i s achieving its goals or not. The PSC will also perform a
monitoring role by assessingproject progress reports. General civil society monitoring will take
place via the APF and Park Forum, while resettlement issues will be monitored through the
Resettlement Working Group (RWG).              Where specific sub-components require detailed
monitoring and evaluation (such as land incorporation), more detailed systems will be developed.
The design of project components will be overseen by the PWGs. A Bank led mid-termreview
will be undertaken at the conclusion o f year 3 (May 30,2007), informed by a SANParks external
assessment.

Audit arrangements
SANParks external auditors, who are already approved for other Bank supported projects, have
been appointed to audit the Project accounts and financial statements on annual basis. In addition
SANParks internal auditors (a separate external entity) will provide internal auditing on a 6
monthly basis. The cost of the external audit will be financed from project funds.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
N o Project Alternative. The alternative o f not addressing the current scenario of environmental
degradation and loss of valuable biodiversity, both inside and outside the existing protected area,
with its links to rural poverty, was rejected. This alternative would lead to high economic and
social costs from a continued and gradual deterioration of the natural resource base and eventual
loss of globally important biodiversity.      Without project support, expansion into the larger
gAENP would be limited and not based on an integrated and systematic conservation planning
and management system. Modest expansion of game ranches and eco-tourism ventures would be
a positive trend but insufficient to meet conservation objectives for globally important
biodiversity, in particular the re-introduction of key predator species including lion, and the
reintroduction o f the larger herbivores including elephant and rhino over much of the area. These
species can only be introduced into very large areas of suitable habitat being managed
appropriately.   There would be reduced opportunity for the development o f an economic
alternative to unsustainable pastoralism, which continues to undermine globally important
biodiversity (within two hotspots and Albany Center for Plant Endemism). The no project
alternative would limit private sector eco-tourism investment in the region, hinder job and skills
creation opportunities, and reduce support for the conservation o f natural resources, particularly
among rural communities.           The marine environment would continue to suffer from
over-harvesting of resources, and water pollution from the catchment would remain largely
undetected and untreated. A MPA would not be established and more integratedmanagement o f
the marine and terrestrial components would not take place.

Traditional Protected Area Management Project Alternative.              The traditional approach to
protected area management including boundary expansion, i s to purchase additional land at
market value. Where failure occurs, expropriation and compensation can be applied. In either
case, the usual focus of management activity i s on biodiversity conservation and where possible,



                                                - 22 -

limited eco-tourism development to generate revenues. People and landowners surrounding the
protected area are not usually given opportunities to participate in management planning and
implementation, but rather are viewed as threats to conservation. This alternative was rejected
because of the major social impacts on surrounding communities, and creation o f an adversarial
climate between landowners, local people and SANParks in the gAENP area. This approach does
not draw on the comparative strengths o f different players, and would not build local support for
biodiversity conservation.

Therefore, a project alternative has been selected which involves private land owners and
inhabitants as detailed inAnnexure 19.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The Bank, GEF, and SANParks have a wealth o f experience in designing, financing, and
implementing protected area projects to meet multiple management objectives including
biodiversity   conservation,   community       participation,  private-public partnerships,    social
development, and poverty alleviation. The main lessons for project design from a review o f the
Bank/GEF global experience in protected area management and SANPark's local experience
include:

Use of comprehensive baseline information and biodiversity prioritization
Effective protected area planning i s based largely on accurate and comprehensive spatial baseline
biophysical information.    SANParks has brought considerable national experience to bear in
designing this project.    A thorough investigation into the terrestrial, freshwater and marine
environments has allowed critical environmental factors to be "layered" into a strategic GIS
conservation planning tool (C-Plan) and map. Minimal areas necessary to meet conservation
objectives were identified and the areas needed for conservation and ecosystem management are
therefore defensible and based on scientific rigor.

Creating effective partnerships
Positive and negative experience with the IFC supported commercialization o f certain Park
facilities in South Africa (such as new tourism resorts in Kruger National Park) have been
evaluated and lessons learned incorporated into project design and financial modelling.          The
project will buildon this experience in developing partnerships with the private sector for tourism
development which will reduce Park costs, increase income and enhance ownership and support
for the wider gAENP.      Lessons learned in other BanWGEF financed projects suggest that a
partnership for land reallocation can be applied inthis project through various methods. Allowing
landowners to be incorporated into the Park without necessarily involving a transfer o f title, has a
number o f benefits.

Fullpublic participation and communication
Active participation o f project beneficiaries and other stakeholders from the initial planning
process i s important to identify potential problems and solutions, generate support, and foster
knowledge sharing. The project rationale, benefits and impacts need to be made clear from the
outset. The public participation process inthe AENP has been a part o f regular Park management
for some time through the APF. Through the project, this process will be strengthened by the
establishment o f new and more effective institutions.

Planningfor long-termjnancial sustainability
GEF projects should help beneficiaries develop mechanisms to improve financial sustainability.
Global experience suggests there i s little justification in GEF and the government o f South Africa
investing inprotected area management without building capacity to generate sufficient revenues
to cover reasonable operations and maintenance budgets. The current project has been designed
to expand gAENP revenues from increased eco-tourism development through private sector
partnerships and contracting out various concessions. Forecasts indicate the gAENP will be in a
strong financial position by year 6 onwards.



                                                   - 25 -

Single institutional authority
Divided or unclear institutional authority has plagued other worthwhile protected area
investments both globally and locally (e.g. Dongola-Vhembe, and Pondoland). The institutional
roles and responsibilities were clarified early in the AENP program and provide a strong
foundation to strengthen the institutional framework for the project.

4. Indications of borrower and recipient commitment and ownership:
 Insupport ofthe project, the Government of South Africa, through SANParks hasundertaken
the following:
        Relocated a dedicated team of four scientific staff, assistant project coordinator, and an
        administrative officer to Port Elizabeth in 1999 to manage the GEF funded PDF-B grant.
        National DEAT and SANParks Directorate have identified the gAENP as a national
        conservation priority. To this effect they directed the entire land purchase allocation
        component (US$3.5 million) of the IDC loan to SANParks in 2000 - 2001 for land
        conversion around AENP and about 10% of the remaining loan into product development
        in the Park.   DEAT has also directed a further US$5.8 million for 2003/04 for land
        incorporation.
        Organized visits to AENP by high profile personalities, such as President Thabo Mbeki,
        the Portfolio Committee for Conservation, and the Boardof SANParks.
        Successfully negotiated the transfer of the Woody Cape Nature Reserve in 2001 from the
        Eastern Cape provincial administration to Schedule 1 National Park for incorporation in
        AENP.
        Successfully allocated South African governmental funding of US$6 million from Working

        2001 - 2003. A separate SANParks project coordinator for this money has been seconded
        for Water, and Poverty Relief programs specifically in the Addo project for the period

        to the parks management team.

5. Value added of Bank and Globalsupport in this project:
Based on the success o f previous and current Bank engagement in South Africa, the Bank i s in a
strong position to assist with implementation of this project. The aim of this assistance i s to :
   0    Incorporate experiences and lessons learned from other GEF regional biodiversity
        projects.
   0    Develop a resettlement policy for gAENP based on Bank safeguard policies for
        involuntary resettlement, thus ensuringpeople are fairly and fully compensated.
   0    Build on successes and experiences gained from the support to the Cape Peninsula
        National Park, to support the development o f cost effective institutional and governance
        arrangements for Park and project management. These will serve as best practice to be
        rolled out across SANParks.
        Continue to attract co-funding by building relationships with government and other
        partners to leverage additional funds to the project.

E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailedassessmentsare inthe projectfile, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
0 Costbenefit         NPV=US$million; ERR= % (see Annex 4)
0 Costeffectiveness
0 IncrementalCost
0 Other(specify)
The baseline cost without the GEF Alternative includes regular government o f South Africa
expenditures on the Park management and biodiversity conservation, implementation, institutional
development, community development, and regional development. The baseline costs are an
estimated US$34 million without project support. Incremental costs are estimated to cover
project expenditures on components that have global benefits and are eligible for GEF financing.
The incremental costs will help achieve global benefits by supporting improved conservation
planning processes, additional research and monitoring for globally important terrestrial and
marine biodiversity; implementation of activities that conserve globally important biodiversity;
strengthening o f lead institutions and governance structures for improved biodiversity
conservation; local community development programs aimed at conserving biodiversity; increased
public awareness and education programs; and regional development for eco-tourism as part of a
sustainable finance strategy to support long-term biodiversity conservation. SANParks and the
Government o f South Africa have already committed and will further commit US$27.6 million for
the GEF alternative.       This includes US$15.77 million for land purchase, infrastructure and
institutional development. A National Government contribution of approximately US$12 million
i s expected by project closure for land purchase and removal of alien vegetation. A portion o f this
funding was made during project preparation and the remainder will be provided during Project
implementation. Building on the previously successful IFC supported concessioning program,
another US$6.5 million i s expected to be leveraged from the private sector, primarily for visitor
and public facilities.     The location of these opportunities has been determined.      The other
investments in infrastructure and game which are likely to take place on private land have not
been factored into these calculations. The GEF Grant contribution, towards the GEF Alternative,
i s US$5.5 million over six years.

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR= % (see Annex 4)
The project will finance investments in Park planning, management capacity and environmental
rehabilitation, with the objective of creating a megabiodiversity conservation area representing
five o f the country's seven terrestrial biomes and one of the country's three marine protected
areas. To help meet this objective, the project will finance new approaches for participatory
management systems involving communities, private sector and government. As part o f project
preparation, work has been undertaken on the land incorporation and incentive framework to
encourage landowners to contract into the Park. Sufficient investigations and precedent has been
set to indicate the viability of this proposal and refinements will be made during implementation.

The project i s expected to generate an incremental 212 permanent and over 900 contract jobs.
Wages will be significantly higher than for farm labor. On pastoral and dairy farms, average
monthly labor rates are betweenUS$32 and US$60/month. By contrast, average labor rates for
SANParks are between US$116 and US$250/month. Private tourism operators are paying within


                                                 - 27 -

and above these rates depending on the skill required. Workers displaced from unproductive
farms, who are subsequently employed in the Park or private sector eco-tourism, will benefit from
higher incomes.

Fiscal Impact:
From a financial perspective, the project offers land users the prospect o f higher returns and more
diversified and sustainable income sources.       Specialist Reports (see no. 10 and 11) prepared
specifically for this project have examined the comparative returns o f land use options in the area.
The Gross Margin (GM), i.e. total revenue less direct variable cost) for livestock has been
estimated at about US$1l/ha (R116/ha). It should be noted that this average i s raised somewhat
by the inclusion o f dairy farm areas that are not part o f the Park's intended expansion. The Net
Margin i s more difficult to determine, because local data on indirect costs are not available. Using
results from other studies, Specialist Report no. 10 concludes that the NM i s inthe order of 70%
o f the GM, i.e. only US$8/ha.

The GM for game farming i s estimated to be similar to the average for livestock farming:
US$9/ha (R103). Using the same rule o f thumb as above to derive the NM, it would be in the
order o f only US$6/ha.

Adding eco-tourism, which would be compatible with game farming, would raise the net return
somewhat. However, Specialist Report no. 11 indicates that the increase would be very limited:
about US$1-3 NM per ha per annum. However, the NM concept utilized there appears to be
more inclusive than that utilized inReport no. 10. It should also be noted that the calculation only
includes income that accrues to the owner o f the land and facilities on site.           Tourists will
obviously spend beyond those limitedboundaries.

It is noteworthy that market actors are in many cases convinced that game farming and
eco-tourism can yield higher returns than livestock. Multiple examples o f such conversion in a
wide area o f the Eastern Cape can be given. This i s less surprising if one considers the wide
variation in returns behind the averages discussed above.        On some marginal lands, livestock
farming has effectively ceased as the vegetation i s exhausted. There i s also an emerging success
o f high-end eco-tourism.

The many offers o f selling land which SANParks has received bears further testimony to the
limited prospects o f livestock farming, and the attraction o f the incentives offered for conversion.
Hence, the Park was able to buy in the order o f 75,000 ha from 1997 to date. Purchases have
also increased drastically inthe last two years.

The Park i s already financially viable given its current size: it turned a modest operating surplus
before corporate overhead costs o f about R1.3 million (US$118,000)        in2002/3 for the first time
in decades. While this provides a sound platform onto which to build, it is quite clear that the
Park does not generate sufficient funds to carry the expansion that the project entails. The project
can therefore be seen as a vehicle to assist the Park to reach a new and much higher level o f
investment. The transitional period o f six years i s projected as sufficient time to adjust to a higher
level o f financial sustainability.


                                                 - 28 -

Wider regional economic impacts will result from project investments, and more importantly,
private sector investment funds leveraged and tourism expenditures on goods and services.
Approximately US6.5 million will be invested by private companies as part o f eco-tourism
expansion in the area. By year 6, it i s estimated that 180,000 tourists will visit the Park spending
money on accommodation, food, fuel, tours, souvenirs, guides, etc. Direct and indirect economic
impacts o f tourist spending will be a significant contributor to provincial GDP.

3. Technical:
The proposed project interventions require a skill mix o f human capacity with relevant knowledge
to ensure effective implementation and more importantly, the sustainable management o f the
expanded gAENP using new and innovative conservation approaches. South Africa, and more
specifically, SANParks has a long history o f national park management. South African parks (and
staff) are recognized as continental leaders in the areas o f wildlife management, tourism
development, and sustainable finance. South Africa i s also blessed with several universities having
outstanding research programs relevant to the project and its aims.           Regional experience in
community participation in natural resource management, eco-tourism and benefit-sharing (for
example in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, etc) will provide some external
knowledge to draw on. The project design i s appropriate for the level o f knowledge and expertise
available within South Africa and more specifically within SANParks (and gAENP). The country,
and SANParks, has a strong record o f investment in similar projects, therefore, estimates o f
investment and recurrent costs, and contingencies are felt to be very reliable.            The general
macro-economic stability o f the country also lends itself to more accurate projections o f costs and
benefits, Project investments will build on the organization's current knowledge base, experience,
and organizational assets to improve longer-term park development planning and implementation,
strengthen institutions and governance structures, enhance community development and social
ecology, and assist in economic development through sustainable tourism.

4. Institutional:
Institutional assessment
SANParks staff tasked with project implementation through the P M U are highly qualified in
technical areas and are highly committed to the organization and its mission, which focuses on
protected area management and biodiversity conservation. A broader assessment o f institutional
capacity however, suggests more generally that staff in SANParks, and in this case the AENP will
require training to buildmanagement skills. The proposed project has provided for such training.
The organization i s gradually shifting its focus to include greater use o f private sector partnerships
for revenue generation, and to use a wider range o f stakeholders (such as local communities and
landowners) inparticipatory Park management. SANParks i s slowly building experience in these
new directions, which will help with implementing the proposedproject.
4.1 Executing agencies:
The project preparation phase and other GEF financed projects in the country have demonstrated
solid project management experience within SANParks. While SANParks will be the Executing
Agency, success will also depend on active participation o f other stakeholders representing
relevant government agencies, NGOs, community-based organizations, farming communities,
tertiary institutions, private land owners and the private business sector. In this regard, the

membership composition and coordination functions o f various institutions i s critical. These are
described below.
4.2 Project management:
As indicated in C4 of this PAD, several institutions will contribute towards overall project
delivery.  The proposed institutions will provide a strong foundation for dynamic and highly
participatory project implementation. These include:
    0   Project Management Unit (PMU), consisting o f three contract personnel and SANParks
        financial management to deal with day-to-day project planning, finance, implementation
        and coordination. A marine-coordinatorwill be redeployedwithin SANParks to the Park.
    0   Project Steering Committee (PSC), consisting o f senior representatives o f SANParks,
        other Government Agencies, and other Project Institutions (APF-PSC), and providing
        broad oversight o f project implementation and coordination.
    0   Addo Planning Forum (APF), already operating in the AENP and providing a forum for
        consultative dialogue between local stakeholders and SANParks. It will be transformed
        into a dedicated Park Forum as the project develops a new Park Management Plan.
    0   Project Working Groups (PWGs) o f 4-10 people from across various stakeholders will be
        established to aid inthe execution o f specific project activities.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Consulting services, goods and works shall be procured in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines.     SANParks has demonstrated highly satisfactory compliance to Bank
procurement requirements in other projects.         A procurement self-assessment completed in
December 2002 indicates that existing controls within SANParks (AENP) for procurement are
relatively well-managed with no noticeable deviation from the Public Finance Management Act.
The assessment does however suggest a need to separate procurement from finance and that a
highly skilled procurement officer should be recruited. SANParks is committed to these actions
through the P M U where a procurement officer will manage the procurement function under the
direct supervision o f the Project Manager, while financial management will be through SANParks
Finance Department. Depending on the background o f the person recruited, short-term training
in Bank procurement processes may be required. A procurement plan will be provided prior to
effectiveness. N o major procurement issues are anticipated.
4.4 Financial managementissues:
Financial management capacity
(i)CapacityofstaffinSANParks
SANParks will be responsible for the overall financial management o f the project. The team at
the AENP's Financial Administration is well qualified and sufficiently familiar with Bank
procedures to ensure sound management and control.           A qualified and experienced full-time
financial officer will be seconded from SANParks to support the project. The officer will work
under the Project Manager but with financial management accountability still vesting with Addo's
finance officer who will ensure adherence to SANParks and Grant requirements.           Short-term
training in Bank financial procedures, including reporting may be required depending on the
background o f the person recruited.

(ii)FinancialManagementSystems.
The financial self-assessment, carried out in August 2002, indicated high compliance by
SANParks with Bank requirements and guidelines. A further Bank assessment was carried out in
March 2003 which substantially confirmed the self assessment. SANParks has a well established
internal control system. Rules and regulations, including rules o f ethics, are well defined and
documented in manuals. The institutional arrangements for financial management o f the project
will follow the proven Cape Peninsula National Park model.             At the time o f the financial
management assessment it was noted that although the SANPark's Internal Audit department was
functional, the coverage given to the AENP seemed inadequate. This weakness will be addressed
through a recently signed contract with a reputable independent accounting firm to provide annual
internal control audits to each Park including the AENP. The contract i s effective as o f March
2003.

The previous SANParks computer-based financial management system (Prophecy accounting
software) has a proven track record. However, as o f September 1, 2003, SANParks switched to
a new and better system called Great Plains. Staff training i s underway to facilitate the transfer to
the new system. SANParks has shown highly satisfactory financial management under another
Bank/GEF- financed project (Cape Peninsula National Park - GEF, US$6.3 million). SANParks
will demonstrate the capabilities o f the new system to the Bank, prior to effectiveness, by
providing a proposed FMW prototype quarterly report. A Bank staff member (FMS) will also
review the operationality and reliability o f the system before the project i s declared effective.

(iii)ProjectFlowoffunds.
The Grant funds will be disbursed over a period o f 6 years with project Completion Date set for
10/31/2009 and Closing Date o f 04/30/2010. SANParks will be the recipient and the Executing
Agency for the Grant. A four month advance from the proceeds o f the Grant, equal to
US$200,000, will be deposited by the Bank into a US$ denominated Special Account to be
opened by SANParks at a commercial Bank acceptable to IBRD. SANParks will fund all Project
expenditures from its existing Rand bank account, then reimburse itself, on a monthly basis with
the Rand equivalent o f eligible expenditures from the US$ Special Account to its Rand bank
account. Application for replenishment will be based on these reimbursements from the US$
Special Account, and will be supported by details o f the individual payments made.                 All
transactions will be managedthrough the SANParks financial management system.

The South African auditing system i s robust and no risks are foreseen with these arrangements
(iv) Auditing arrangements
The audit trail was found to be robust at the SANParks, given the capabilities o f the computerized
system, protocol surrounding processes, and information management. SANParks has received
no less than 7 consecutive unqualified audits from its independent external auditors. The filing
and archiving was also found to be one o f the strongest in the region.

South Africa i s home to all o f the major international management and audit firms, therefore, no
major risks exist with respect to project auditing. As in the case o f the Bank supported Cape

Project.
Peninsula National Parks Project, SANParks will appoint its current auditors on same terms to the

5. Environmental:                         Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertakenfor environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The project objectives are to achieve a number o f positive environmental, socio-economic and
developmental impacts.       The project components will also include mitigation measures for
potential adverse effects. A Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was undertaken to meet
Bank EA requirements. A SEA was selected instead of an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) (with Bank approval), as the exact location o f the new Park boundaries could not be
determined with great precision during preparation. While priority lands have been identified, the
specific areas encompassed by expansion will depend on the nature and uptake o f land conversion
incentives developed,     negotiations, etc.      A broad, forward planning instrument was needed,
therefore, an SEA was selected as an appropriate EA instrument.

The SEA evaluated the natural environment in the project area, socio-economic environment,
financial viability o f the gAENP, legal and institutional framework, issues and concerns raised
through public consultation, and potential development scenarios.               Following this review, a
Category B assessment was assigned: First the project focuses on protected areas. Second, it
will have an overall positive environmental impact by reversing current trends o f natural resource
degradation through improved protected area management and conservation o f globally and
nationally important biodiversity. Third, all sub-components involving potential impacts on the
environment will be subject to individual EIAs under South African EA policy and regulations as
well as those o f the Bank. (see Annex 12).

The major potential impacts noted through the public participation process o f the SEA were:
displacement and relocation o f farm workers; uncertainty about Park development; impact o f the
project on farming related industries and activities;          inadequate communication with affected
parties;   impact on employment opportunities;               impact created by the Coega industrial
development zone on the coast (not part o f the project); need for socio-economic indicators and
targets; compliance with SEA draft policy proposals;                 impact on dairy, beef and chicory
production; impact on mohair production and land purchase process. The key issue to emerge
has been a concern by some land owners with land incorporation into the Park and the impact on
livelihoods. The project makes detailed provision through its design to not only address this issue
but to have mutually beneficial impacts. The key instrument to achieve this will be the design and
implementation o f an incentive framework to landowners and communities to incorporate into the
gAENP as well as community development and social ecology components.                      A Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS) have been developed and
approved by the Bank to comply with OP/BP 4.12.
5.2 What are the mainfeatures of the EMP and are they adequate?
The project intends to develop detailed plans to conserve and rehabilitate the biodiversity o f the


                                                    - 32 -

area. Project outputs will include the development and implementation o f a conservation plan to
inform a Park development pladecological management plan, and development o f an
environmental management system which includes park policies and procedures to manage and
mitigate all Park operations and potential impacts. Further, there will be detailed socio-economic
and biophysical monitoring.          Domestic EA laws, policies, and regulations will apply to
development in the Park.         For developments deemed to require an EIA, a mitigation and
monitoring strategy will be identified. The project has budgeted funds for EMPs under various
components that may require an EIA, such as roads, fencing, etc.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status o f EA:
                     Date of receipt of final draft: April, 2, 2003
The draft SEA was received on April 2,2003 with "InCountry Disclosure" on July 21,2003.

5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b)draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were usedand which groups were consulted?
An independent consultationplanwas prepared and implemented to consult with key stakeholders
during the screening and impact mitigation identification stage o f the SEA. The consultation
process included scoping all principal concerns, feeding these back to inform the planning process
and stakeholders, and to include stakeholders in the final SEA report.               The process was
implemented by independent consultants in collaboration with SANParks and several other
government agencies. Key stakeholder groups were first identified, and an advertising/awareness
campaign about the consultation process then implemented through media and networking.
Stakeholders were invited to respond in writing to help identify critical issues and concerns over
the project, and more generally, protected area management in the area. A series o f meetings
were then held across the protected area. Materials for public review were prepared in three o f
the official languages. During this process, 234 interested and affected parties were consulted,
including civic organizations, farmers associations, landowners, businesses, chamber o f
commerce, farm laborers, labor unions, local authorities, councillors, community based
organizations and landowner associations. The semi-final report was presented to stakeholders in
M a y 2002 for inclusion of final public comments and considerations. The SEA was officially
disclosed "In Country" on July 21, 2003. The Addo Planning Forum facilitated much o f this
initial process.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? D o the indicators reflect the objectives and results o f the EMP?
The Project will entail the implementation and adaptive updating o f both biophysical and
socio-economic monitoring systems to inform management o f Project impacts and to ensure that
it remains beneficial. SANParks has already developed a comprehensive list o f indicators and an
Mand E system duringpreparation. The system will be supported by regular field measurements
to further build a solid baseline and to capture data change. Supportive research is also included
in the Project design. Monitoring information will be managed through the proposed IEMS to
facilitate reporting back on the Project impact at least on an annual basis.

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
The key social issue revolves around the resettlement o f farm workers as farms are incorporated
into the gAENP. A survey has been undertaken to identify all individuals who could be affected
by the proposedexpansion of Addo over the next 6 years and who have been affected since 1997.
Since 1997, SANParks has been purchasing land with a clause requiring land to be purchased free
o f occupation. Subsequent to the Bank Appraisal Mission, SANParks agreed to drop the clause
from all future land purchases. Original estimates o f potentially affected individuals varied from a
low of 570 inhabitants (191 workers) to a higher figure o f approximately 3300 inhabitants. The
variability inthe figures i s ascribed to the underlying assumptions which were made including: the
area o f land to be included into Addo, the ratio o f farm workers per ha o f land and the number o f
dependants.     Further, the actual number o f workers and inhabitants which might require
resettlement support will also depend on the extent to which workers and inhabitants, displaced
since 1997, can be found. With the recently completed farm-by-farm survey and survey to find
displaced farm workers and inhabitants, the number o f affected people has been reduced to 188
(workers plus dependents) o f which 70 were permanent workers at the time o f sale o f the farms to
SANParks. Of the 70 workers, 30 (plus 75 dependants) are currently unemployed and will,
therefore, be fully incorporated into the SANParks RPF and RAPs. Another 25 000 ha o f land i s
proposed for purchase by SANParks. Based on the calculated figure o f 1 unemployed person per
1000 ha, an additional 25 workers plus dependants are expected to fall under the RPF and RAPs.
Based on current phasing for the expansion o f the Park, it i s anticipated that SANParks
resettlement obligations in this regard will end inapproximately 2010. SANParks has also agreed
to monitor and to include any farm workers and their dependents into the RPF and RAPs where
private land owners have sold land to SANParks or who have contracted land into the Park and
who renegade on resettlement agreements reached with farm workers and their dependents. The
RPF and RAPs were disclosed "InCountry" on July 7, 2003.

In recent years, three new private tourism developers in the Park (Darlington Dam, Gorah
Elephant Camp, Kazouko), absorbed most o f the displaced farm laborers, offered additional jobs
to disadvantaged people from local communities, provided training in service jobs, and paid
wages at several times the level in agriculture.

The project's social development objective is to deliver improved socio-economic benefits to
people living in communities inside and outside o f the proposed larger Park. Key outcomes are
expected to include gainful employment, improved income levels for people who currently live in
the proposed Park area and more secure livelihoods. To achieve this objective, the project will:
ensure that community representatives serve on local advisory committees (the Resettlement
Working Group);      employ local members o f the community and provide training to shift from
farming based employment to park and eco-tourism work; prepare resettlement action plans prior
to appraisal; and leverage over US$6 million from Working for Water and Poverty Relief funds
for local employment programs as part o f resettlement plans.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participatingin the project?
The project includes several mechanisms to ensure stakeholder participation, and most critically,


                                                  - 34 -

mechanisms to address the resettlement process. The Addo Planning Forum (to be transformed
into a Park Forum) already provides a mechanism for a wide representation o f local stakeholders
to participate in project (and Park) management and implementation. The RWGs will include:

Departments of the Government of the Eastern Cape - Agriculture, and Tourism; National
farm workers' representatives; a designated SANParks representative; a member of the

Department o f Land Affairs;        a representative of the Resettlement Monitoring Team; a
representative from surrounding farmdagriculture; and a resettlement expert. The functions of
the RWG will include: acting as an advisory and oversight body to SANParks in matters relating
to resettlement in the gAENP; serving as court of first appeal to solve any arising problems and
then channelling them through the appropriate grievance procedures; assisting SANParks in
overseeing all the phases o f the resettlement process, including the allocation of jobs and
generation of livelihoods, compensation and other benefits.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
Extensive consultations have taken place with civil society and with NGOs through public
meetings and the Greater Addo Forum. The Forum will be transformed into a Park Forum.
Detailed consultations will continue inall project components as needed.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been providedto ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
Local communities will be represented on the proposed Park Forum.               The project also has a
social ecology and community development component to provide a mechanism for implementing
social development initiatives with the communities. Displaced workers will have priority for
local employment through the project, training, and other social support programs such as the
Working for Water and Poverty Relief fund as identified in the RAPS. Purchases of land by
SANParks (as opposed to other forms o f conversion) will hold back 10-15% o f the price to
ensure that the land owner addresses resettlement of displaced farm workers within current South
African law and Bank requirements.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance interms of social development outcomes?
The project will undertake a baseline socio-economic survey for planning purposes, against which
the results o f regular monitoring o f attitudes and needs o f local stakeholders and communities will
be measured and applied as feedback for project implementation. Monitoring is a specific project
sub-component. Bank supervision missions, every six months, will pay special attention to the
socio-economic monitoring results.

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguardpolicies.
With regard to environmental assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01), the project was rated
environmental Category B. A strategic environmental assessment was carried out, which included
local stakeholder participation. The assessment and record o f public consultations was submitted
to the Infoshop before appraisal. All developments in the Park will be subject to national EA
processes, which hlly meet Bank requirements (see Annex 12).

With regard to cultural property (OPN 11.03), the project meets Bank requirements through a
number o f measures. These include adherence to the National Heritage Resources Act (1999),
development by SANParks o f a strategic framework for the conservation o f cultural resources,
and a cultural resource management policy (see Annex 14). A preliminary inventory and mapping
o f cultural sites has been completed as part o f project preparation. This will form the basis for
further assessment and guide the development o f suitable measures for cultural site management,
compatible with Bank policy.          Field staff will receive basic training in cultural resource
management and a specialist staff member will be appointed to manage the data base and oversee
policy compliance.

With regard to involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), due to the fact that some farm workers
will fall within the scope o f the resettlement definition, a Resettlement Policy Framework has been
completed and RAPs produced for farms anticipated to be incorporated into the gAENP in year
one.    The community development component o f the project and a SANParks budgetary
provision including Poverty Relief Programs, will set aside sufficient financial resources to cover
the resettlement requirements for the lifespan o f this project. (see Annex 13 and applicable SA
legislation).    Employment creation through the project and with private sector tourism
development i s expected to absorb most displaced workers who wish to remain in the area and
continue working. Salaries paid by these alternative employment options are significantly higher
than inpastoral agriculture. The Bank i s responsible for approving the RAPs.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:

This project will strengthen conditions for protected area management and biodiversity
conservation inthe Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) area, with a well-defined component to
improve local livelihoods through eco-tourism development.            Several factors are linked to
sustainability. First, institutional sustainability i s important and i s being pursued by the initial
building o f a consensus on project design and scope with a wide range of stakeholders and
strengthening o f a participatory process. Appropriate institutions are being used inthe project to
facilitate long-term local participation in Park planning and management. The lead executing
agency, SANParks, has been undergoing business re-engineering processes in the past few years
with demonstrated success in improving operating efficiencies. The project is designed to ensure
that staff from the gAENP will participate in project execution through the Project Steering
Committee and the proposed Project Working Groups. This will ensure that the project i s well
integrated into the park operations and that a seamless transition i s made from the project
deliverables to their incorporation into routine park operations.

Second, Jinancial sustainability i s critical to ensure that the achievements from project
investments can be maintained inthe longer-term. The project i s designed with post-GEF closure
in mind; investments will generate improved income streams over time at both the executing
agency and local community levels. Detailed financial simulations, using the best available data,
indicate that project investments will enable the Park to be financially independent by year 6.
Financial sustainability will be based on increased and differentiated gate fees, a larger number o f
visitors, concession fees from accommodation and game sales. At the local level, the project will
build conditions for increased private sector investment in eco-tourism, creating sustained direct
and indirect employment and income benefits long after the project i s closed. The project i s
attracting initial private sector investment o f US$6.5 million.          In the long-term, there is
considerable upside potential for expanded investment to provide visitors with access to a
world-class Park.

Third, social sustainability is critical and is addressed through two main design elements. The
first design element will be establishing an economically viable Park, which will provide an income
and livelihood return to local residents greater than the current returns from agriculture. This will
greatly assist to enhance support for the Park and create more sustainable livelihoods.          The
proposed social ecology community development component o f the project will lead this
program.    The second design element is to involve stakeholders in the Park and the project
through consultative fora to ensure that support i s maintained.

Finally, environmental sustainability i s addressed through the SEA that was undertaken as part o f
project preparation, and the application o f South African EA processes (which meet Bank
requirements) for specific site developments during and after project implementation. The project
will improve biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource use inthe area.

la. Replicability:
The lessons learned from this project will have wide applications for other protected areas in
South Africa with respect to participatory planning and implementation, social assessment,
resettlement, management information systems, monitoring, land acquisition, and public-private
partnerships.     In turn, this project is being strengthened by lessons learned in other GEF
biodiversity conservation projects in South Africa such as the C.A.P.E. initiative. M o r e broadly,
the gAENP project will demonstrate important and valuable lessons for other countries in the
region and beyond when addressing similar marine and terrestrial protected area, and biodiversity
conservation challenges.

3. Possible ControversialAspects:
A possible issue is the involuntary resettlement o f people, mainly farm workers and their families,
affected by Park expansion to meet biodiversity conservation objectives. It should be noted that
the number o f affected people involved i s relatively limited and that many farm workers are
offered new employment with their current employers. However, to the extent that involuntary
resettlement occurs, this will be mitigated by a number o f strategies. First and foremost, any
resettlement resulting from this project will be governed by Bank safeguard policies. Second,
SANParks has developed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and will complete RAPS to
cover individual and previous farm acquisitions.          Third, resettled people will be the highest
priority for employment under the project, for example in small works or conservation activities
funded by other programs. Fourth, wages paid to people employed directly in the Park or on
small works/conservation initiatives are significantly higher than people would have earned as
farm labor.         Fifth, expanded eco-tourism development will offer various employment
opportunities for people, again with a priority on those individuals resettled.

                                Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
       SOUTH AFRICA: THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

The project has identified five inter-related components that strive to protect the exceptional
assemblage of terrestrial and marine biodiversity of the Addo region through strategic
conservation planning and implementation, innovative land incorporation and development
planning, and social capacity building. Justificationfor their inclusion is givenhere, and supported
by the preparatory studies listedinAnnex 8.

By Component:

Project Component 1. CONSERVATION PLANNING US$0.82 million
GEF: US$0.268million Co-financing: US$0.553million Total: US$0.821million
                             -                  -                -

This component builds on the conservation planning exercise largely undertaken during the
PDF-B phase of the project and forms the biological basis for the implementation phase. The
preparatory studies generated extensive documentation on the biological, social, institutional,
legal and economic environments (see Figure 1 for irreplaceability map generated from the
Conservation Plan and ongoing planning).

The concept developed is one of a national park protecting areas of global and national
importance through effective and efficient management through a combination o f state and private
initiatives.    Issues concerning zonation, land-use, contractual incorporation and business
arrangements need further negotiations, with action plans prepared for implementation. This
implies conservation planning that would require involvement of SANParks, provincial
conservation, private land-owners, communities, local government and the business sector. This
i s a critical step as it requires compiling a detailed social assessment of properties identified for
incorporation and matching that with the biological assessment of the area.          The second is,
developing a cross-cuttingincentive framework and funding line to roll out to private land-owners
and communities wishing to be incorporated into the Park. This activity will be integrated and
implemented with the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The approach being taken i s to
identify the barriers to be removed to enable these social and economic conversions to take place
and to provide programmed support.           This component cuts across the remaining project
components which will be integrated into the Integrated Environmental Management System
(IEMS) for the Park. Deficiencies indata, particularly for biodiversity, were identifiedduringthe
preparationphase and will be the focus of specific studies such as: restoration and rehabilitation;
impacts of megaherbivores and alien species (terrestrial and marine);             marine mapping,
biodiversity surveys and monitoring with emphasis on the marine environment; freshwater biota
surveys and mapping;         river ecological reserve determination.   Developing monitoring and
research capacity within SANParks i s essential to ensure the activities continue beyond the life o f
the project.

SUB COMPONENTSAND ACTIVITIES:
The five sub-components each largely deal with park planning and will form part o f the overall
IEMS which will be subject to the monthly Management Information Reporting System (MIRS).
Four conservation planning and research related reports facilitated the formulation o f this

component.

Sub-component 1.1- Conservation Plan:
GEF: US$0.04million - Co-Financing: US$0.113million             - Total: US$0.153million
This section will update the terrestrial, aquatic and marine, cultural databases produced during
preparation and amend the drafted conservation plan as required. Extensions to the original PDF
grant fine tuned the conservation planning recommendations under different land incorporation
scenarios.   It will also address the issue of deficiency in data, by identifying biodiversity,
conservation planning plus herbivore conservation research projects, and the preparation o f a
rehabilitation plan. Once the research projects have beenidentifiedthey will be commissioned and
monitored and evaluated under this component as part o f the ongoing maintenance of the
Conservation Plan.

Sub-component 1.2 Strategic (Development) Plan:
                      -
GEF: US$O.O16million Co-Financing: US$0.020million
                           -                                     - Total: US$0.036million
Based primarily on the above information a costed and phased development plan and planning
process will be produced to guide the Park for the next six years. It will indicate the preferred
development zones (as part o f the Zonation Plan), rehabilitation areas, as well as infrastructure
(roads, fences, buildings, visitor facilities) within the Park. The development plan will also take
into consideration a broad infiastructural plan (including camps, fences, roads, etc.) which will be
adapted to suit each use zone. Inaddition, it will includea redefinition of an upgraded SANParks
management structure for the Park, plus the development of a game re-introduction plan.

Sub-component 1.3 Park ManagementPlan:
                      -
GEF: US$0.012million Co-Financing: US$0.05million
                           -                                    - Total: US$0.036million
A Park Management Plan (procedures & policies) will be drafted (usingPAD & PIP information)
as part of the IEMS to make for effective daily management. It will include clear and measurable
deliverables which will be required to be reported against on a monthly basis (MIRS). The plan
will form an integral part of the IEMS.

Sub-component 1.4 MonitoringSystem andResearch:
                      -
GEF: US$0.152million       - Co-Financing:      US$0.168million Total: US$0.032million

Key baseline information has beengathered inthe biophysical and socio-economic environment to
monitor the internal and external impact o f development o f the Park, and other management
actions on the community, economy and environment. A monitoring and evaluation plan has been
developed for year one and will be adapted accordingly in subsequent years. This component will
also cater for the implementation o f an electronic monitoring and evaluation system for each of
the identified elements. Areas requiring specific research will be identified and approved and
research projects commissioned. These will include marine research in support o f the proposed
MPA and research into the impact o f major herbivores on the Park and the management actions to
be taken. Given the overall dearth of information for the marine environment, key projects have
been planned with detailed research, monitoring and cost protocols developed. The monitoring
and evaluation system will be updated on an annual basis and will also form part of the overall
IEMS.

The proclamation of the Addo Marine Protected Area (MPA) will require detailed planning in
terms o f management, cost and public consultation requirements. A marine planning framework
will need to be developed for interaction with all relevant stakeholders, as well as an
implementationplan once all requirednegotiations have beenconducted and approvals obtained.

Project Component 2. IMPLEMENTATIONOF THE DEVELOPMENTPLAN US$28.86 million

This component deals largely with the implementation o f the Greater Addo Project and includes
the provision o f environmental infrastructure, tapping into existing national poverty alleviation
programs to develop local SMME's in contracting services and goods on infrastructure projects.
The environmental infrastructure will be in line with a zonation plan developed within Component
1. Infrastructure will be in the form of fencing, roads, water provision, heritage sites, cultural
village, educational center, waste management systems, jetties, Environmental Management
Planning (EMP), rehabilitation and identifying the existence of natural and cultural resources.

A major focus will be placed on rehabilitation schemes including alien control and land
rehabilitation via biological and infrastructural schemes. Within the development of the zones will
be the inclusion of wildlife re-introduction and the provision of maintenance equipment and
vehicles. Support to the MPA will be in the form of infrastructural rehabilitation on the islands
plus infrastructure for marine support services.

Three differentmanagement models exist with regards to implementing land incorporation, as
identified by the conservation planning exercise and highlightedin SANParks incorporation policy
(see Annex 19):
1. SANParks land owned and managedby SANParks.
2. Concessioned areas within SANParks land.
3. Contruaktual parks adjoining SANParks land where SANParks may or may not manage the
    land.

With incorporation of new tracts of land, the RAPS, will be implemented to ensure the fair
resettlement or incorporation o f affected individuals. Incentivised partnerships will be canvassed
to facilitate land incorporation via contractual arrangements.

SUB-COMPONENTSAND ACTIVITIES:
The sub-components concern the roll-out o f the development plan, inclusive of ecological
management, infrastructural development and land incorporation. Specialist reports undertaken
to facilitate in the preparation of this component included: Legal framework; Development
prospects for communities/private partnerships; Economic activities; Incentives framework; Land
incorporation framework; Resettlement policy framework; Public participation; Social assessment;
Social monitoring prospects; and Cultural resources framework (see Annex 8).

The following sub-components ensure effective implementationof the development plan.

Focuses on the implementation o f the development plan and includes the provision of
environmental infrastructure in which the existing poverty alleviation programs (Working for
Water, Poverty Relief) development o f SMMEs have been incorporated. Development within
identified zones will follow a plan and budget which will include the provision o f all fixed
environmental infrastructure, roads, fences, water provision, heritage sites, waste management
systems, alien control, E M P and rehabilitation plans. Research will have to be done within each
development zone to identify the existence o f cultural and natural resources, to which managed
access may need to be provided to resettled communities.

Plans are underway to establish a cultural village and conservation education center.           New
sections incorporated into the Park will be stocked with game according to a re-introduction plan.
Infrastructure provision also includes the provision o f equipment and vehicles inclusive o f land
vehicles, boats, office equipment, maintenance equipment, supportive to Park Management in the
terrestrial and marine areas.       Support to the M P A will be in the form o f infrastructural
rehabilitation on the islands plus the provision o f infrastructure for marine services (Le. harbors,
jetty, ablutions, educational facilities, etc.)

Sub-component2.2 Land Incorporation:
GEF: US$0.016million       - Co-Funding:       US$5.300million   - Total: US$5.316million
The incorporation o f land through land-owner partnerships (contracts), and direct purchase will
be integrated with the recommendations o f the strategic Park conservation plan developed and
refined as part o f the preparatory studies. The budget figures only include land to be purchased
and not the value of private land incorporated through partnership agreements. A further activity
in this sub-component concerns fund raising for land purchases. GEF funds will facilitate this
through payment o f legal fees and valuations.

Sub-component2.3 IncentivisedContractingPartnerships:
GEF: US$0.415million Co-Financing: US$0.013million Total: US$0.428million

Financial and intellectual assistance (such as legal, infrastructural, rehabilitation training and
knowledge enhancement) will be provided to implement the proposed incentive framework over
the six year project period to remove barriers preventing farmers, land owners and the community
from converting from current unsustainable land-uses into nature-based ventures within the
gAENP. Criteria for their inclusion on a contractual basis have been developed and organized
into a prioritization matrix weighting conservation value and threats (see Annex 11). Prospective
contractual partners will need to be identified, together with the possible incentives, to secure
incorporation now and into the future.         A monitoring and evaluation system will need to be
developed to ensure conformance to contractual agreements.

inclusivemanagementdecisionmaking.

To ensure the effectivemanagementofthe gAENPproject,the PMU will be continuedfor the six
year project. The PMU will also be responsible together with consultants to develop and
implement a MIRS covering all activities with the IEMS. The MIRS will be an electronic
database driven system. The maintenance of the data bases and generation of reports will be
carried out by a GIS Officer to be recruited as part of the new Park management structure.
Trainingwill needto be providedto ensure conformanceto the newly developed systems.

SUB-COMPONENTSAND ACTIVITIES:

Sub-component3.1 IntegratedEnvironmentalManagement System (IEMS):
                      -
GEF: US$0.05million Co-Financing: US$0.423 million Total: US0.473 million
                        -                                    -
An IEMS, based on I S 0 14000, will be developed to enhance Park environmentaland general
management. Technology and expertise developed in the GEF funded Cape Peninsula National
Park projectwill be usedindevelopingthe Addo IEMS. The IEMS will includethe development
of corporate policies and Park specific policies, strategic (development) plan, procedures,
monitoring indicators, review and auditing procedures. It will be the guiding document for the
overallPark Management, encompassingthe conservation, development, managementandreview
of Park activities. An IEMS reportwill be producedeach year.

Sub-component3.2 gAENPManagement Structures:
                     -
GEF: US$0.020 million Co-Financing: US$1.400million Total: US$1.420 million
                          -                                   -
Based on the developmentalplan and the extent to which concessions will be introduced, the
required Park management arrangements will be costed and developed. These will include
definition of the required outcomes of the organization, definition of responsibilities, staff
organograms, andreportinglines etc. These will all form part of the Business Planandpart of the
IEMS. Within this sub-component, in conformance with the Park management plan, a new
gAENP management structure will need to be developed and approved by SANParks for
implementationfor the day to day management of the expandedpark, The existingPSC will need
to be reviewed and re-engineeredin line with SANParks strategy for overall governance of the
gAENP. The PSC prime function would be to provide high leveloversight function for the Park
and project, to ensure compliance with the project's goals and GEF grant funding agreement. It
is envisaged that as the Park Management Plan development i s initiated, so the APF will be
adaptedandtransformedto form a dedicatedParkForum.

Sub-component3.3 ProjectManagement Unit (PMU):
                     -
GEF: US$1.250 million Co-Financing: US$O.057 million Total: US$1.307 million

                     - -                             -
A business plan which models the financial requirements o f the Park including income and
expenditure and which provides a basis for adjusting to roll-out o f the Development Plan will be
prepared. The Business Plan will commence with the preparationo f a year one business plan with
financial budgets. The full business plan will be prepared utilizing consultants and will take into
consideration the deliverables of the PIP inclusive o f detailed action plans, responsibilities,
measurables and financials. The business plan will need to be reviewed on an annual basis as the
project rolls out.

Sub-component3.5 ManagementInformationand ReportingSystem (MIRS):
                       -
GEF: US$0.60million Co-Financing: US$0.30 million Total: US$0.090million
                           -                                   -
An electronic hardware and software system will be designed and implemented inorder to manage
the IEMS.     The MIRS will be database driven producing reports in conformance with the
requirements o f the governance structures o f the project, plus the management o f the gAENP. A
GIS officer will be appointed by SANParks to manage the databases and generate the required
reports. The design and implementation o f the MIRS will be coordinated by the P M U utilizing
services o f suitable service providers.

Sub-component 3.6 TrainingPrograms:

Inorder to implement the above, training programs will be required so that staff are able to apply
the various new systems and technologies, and have clear understanding o f policy and operational
issues contained in the IEMS and how it operates within SANParks. Together with gAENP
management, the P M U will, through consultants, conduct a training needs analysis for new and
existing staff to identify required training to conform with the new systems. Training needs will
be matched with suitable activity related courses and staff enrolled. Staff will be monitored on
completion o f training to ensure conformance with new systems. N o n SANParks staff will be
trained as part o f Component 4.

Importantly this component will provide major support to the implementation o f the development
plan for the Park and will cover employment and economic benefits based on communal
conservation strategies, developing S M M E opportunities, environmental education and the all
important issue o f fair resettlement o f displaced communities and individuals. The Social Ecology
department within SANParks remains an expanding and important concept that recognizes that
communities should benefit from the Park and its opportunities, without compromising
biodiversity conservation.

A total o f 12preparatory reports were generated indeveloping this component (see Annex 8).

                                                         -
Research will need to be done to identify what natural and cultural resources exist within the Park
boundaries, and develop a policy guiding managed access to these resources, in compliance with
SANParks use of natural resourcespolicy and specialist report findings and recommendations.

Sub-component 4.2 Access to employment:
                      -
GEF: US$0.005million Co-Financing: US$0.023 million Total: US$0.028 million
                           -                                   -
The aim is to train members of the community to the point that they can benefit from work
opportunities in the Park. Accessing some of these opportunities will be through Working for
Water and Poverty Relief funds. The SANParks Social Ecology national employment policy will
need to be modified to suit the gAENP project. I t will be necessary to acquire all available
employment data/databasesfrom local stakeholders (local government) for analysis to match with
gAENP employment opportunities. Where the analysis of the available data identifies gaps, these
gaps will need to be corrected to provide the required data. The Resettlement Framework
Assessment o f the labor force and skills assessment of those affected by Park expansion, will
provide a starting point inthis regard (see Annex 13).

                           -                                   -
This deals with employment opportunities based on eco-tourism and small works supporting roll
out of Park infrastructure.    Analyses will need to be done to identify SMME development
opportunities within gAENP in areas such as fencing, arts and crafts, charcoal production,
eco-tourism, alien clearing and harvesting.     Where opportunities are identified, prospective
SMMEs originating from the community will need to be incubated to avail themselves of the
opportunities. SMMEs will needto be assistedby gaining access to all available SMME incentive
schemes. Researchmustbe linkedto the working for water exit strategy. Research will also need
to be done to identify what goods and services for gAENP may be sourced from Previously
Disadvantaged Individuals (PDI) SMMEs. A PDI procurement policy will need to be developed
and implemented. National SANParks SMME development projects will need to be identified, so
as to be included for the gAENP. In addition, training programs for SMME staff will be
undertaken after a needs analysis.

Sub-component4.4 Conservation Education:
                      -

A sustainable and cost-effective conservation education program and conservation education
center will be established to support community and visitor awareness about the Park. A limited
number of tertiary scholarships (possibly 2 per annum) will be provided to train a cadre of new
officials from the community to enter SANParks at a professional level and to advance in the
organization. Relevant tertiary education courses will need to be identified following which a
recruitment process will need to be pursued to select suitable candidates for evaluation and
enrolment.    Evaluation should be against a skills analysis within gAENP to ensure that

Although the project's social objective i s to ensure that the greater Addo community largely
benefits from the project, SANParks will either make funds available or source opportunities in
associated projects (Working for Water & Poverty Relief) to ensure that any members o f the
community who were unjustly affected by the project are fairly compensated. Site-specific criteria
for compensation, developed as part o f the RAPS will need implementation in conjunction with
other government and local government authorities responsible for restitution issues. All of the
above i s addressed inthe Bank approved RPF and RAPSfor the gAENP (see Annexes 13 & 19).

Within this component, a communication strategy will be developed as well as a marketing plan.
It will be coordinated by the PMU, via appointed consultants. A MIRS module will be developed
and implemented to ensure the recording and reporting o f activities against the marketing plan. A
Communicationhiarketing Officer will be recruited as part o f the new gAENP management
structure, gAENP product packages will be researched and identified in each development zone
for packaging and offering to clients as part of the overall marketing plan. A web site will be
developed whereon all relevant marketing material will be listed and continually updated. Also
part of this component will be the concessioning and partnerships process where prospective
concessions and partners will be identified and incorporated into the gAENP. Negotiations with
concessionaires will be undertaken by SANParks.          A MIRS module will be developed and
implemented to monitor the contractual obligations o f concessionaires.

   SOUTH AFRICA. THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT


Background
The proposal to create a megabiodiversity National Park in South Africa to include five out o f
seven o f the country's biomes and a marine component, has strong national support and a high
level o f co-financing. It meets both national ecological and socio-economic objectives.

1. Baseline scenario
The baseline scenario i s assumed to primarily be the current SANParks budget to manage the
existing AENP. However, under this scenario, opportunistic foreign donor funding as well as
additional government funding could materialize from time to time to purchase land and support
other conservation or tourism related projects. This i s unpredictable and to some extent can not
be assumed. The baseline scenario represents what will happen in the event o f GEF funds not
materializing. Elements o f the baseline are therefore:
   0    ThePark would not receive the national and international attention it deserves to conserve
        its important biodiversity.
   0    Minor additional Park expansions with little focus on conservation o f globally significant
        biodiversity in the terrestrial environment. Unsustainable agriculture would continue in
        the project area with some conversion to game ranching and eco-tourism, but national and
        global biodiversity objectives would not be achieved. In fact, global biodiversity would
        continue to be lost through increased land degradation and unsustainable use o f marine
        resources.
   0    Few opportunities would be provided to neighboring communities to participate in
        rehabilitation, works and services inthe Park.
   0    Relatively less fundingmaterializes from other sources.
   0    Park management structures and systems would replicate existing SANParks practice.
   0     SANParks would continue to meet its baseline commitment o f approximately US$1.6
        million to the Park.
   0     Some SANParks eco-tourism concessions would be granted to the private sector but more
        than likely short o f the US$6.5 million under the GEF alternative.
   0    Few opportunities would arise for the neighboring communities to participate in
        opportunities in the Park.
   0    The Park would not receive the opportunity to develop itself into an economic engine for
        the impoverished Eastern Cape and function as an example o f how conservation can
        enhance ecological, social and economic value.
   0    The Park would not receive the large contribution from Poverty Relief and Working for
        Water funding.

2. GEF alternative
Under the GEF alternative the following main benefits will materialize:
        The GEF alternative scenario i s approximately US$40 million.             It will leverage
        approximately US$34.5 million intotal. This includes no less than US$15.77 million from
        SANParks as counterpart and financial contribution to land purchase, infrastructure and


                                                 - 58 -

         institutional development and support, US$6.5 million from the private sector for
         eco-tourism development, US$12 million from Government for land purchase, removal o f
         alien vegetation and environmental rehabilitation. The project seeks US$5.5 million from
         the GEF which will be critical to both catalyze the additional investment and to undertake
         the planning, development and support needed to bring about a consolidated gAENP
         spanning from the marine to the terrestrial environments. It i s needed to support key
         elements     including    detailed   planning    roll-out,     environmental    rehabilitation,
         conservatiodeducation infrastructure, SANParks institutional reform and towards the
         creation o f sustainable eco-tourism based industries amongst the previously disadvantaged
         communities. GEF funds will be used to implement the proposed incentive framework to
         encourage private landowners to incorporate into the Park.          Since much o f the Park
         expansion strategy i s predicated on the success o f this, it cannot materialize without GEF
         funds.
   0     Most importantly, GEF funds will catalyze the conservation of globally significant
         biodiversity in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems through the creation o f a
         megabiodiversity National Park.       The protection o f this expanded area will allow
         reintroduction o f native species which are extinct from the area, as well as rehabilitation o f
         the degraded ecosystems.
   0     The combined M P A will be the largest in South Africa and importantly linked to its
         terrestrial component.

By financing the incremental costs o f these activities, GEF funding will complement domestic
resources channeled through SANParks and other government entities, contributions from visitors
to the Park as well as other possible donations and private sector investment.

Components of the GEF alternativeand incrementalcosts
The matrix below inTable 1summarizes the baseline and incremental costs for the project.

COMPONENT I: CONSERVATIONPLANNING:
This i s concerned with the planning and monitoring framework for the long-term conservation o f
the unique assemblage o f biodiversity inthe region and the arrest o f environmental degradation.

Output: Updated conservationplan andplanning system, development plan, biological surveys,
monitoring and research component to support Park operations including the marine and
terrestrial environment.

GEF funds will be used to support the conservation and development planning process started
during preparation, the research and monitoring program and the planning and execution o f the
marine and coastal program. GEF funding i s critical for this component, to carry out these
activities. SANParks will provide counterpart funding for staff, basic research and monitoring.

Sub-total costs o f the GEF Alternative: US$0.82 1 million. GEF funding: US$0.268 million.

COMPONENT 2: IMPLEMENTATION OF DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
The implementationo f the development plan including ecological management, infrastructure and


                                                 - 59 -

land incorporation, and socio-economic capacity building.

Output: A megabiodiversity Park in South Africa developed with infrastructure to manage the
marine, terrestrial and conservation education environments. This will include game relocation,
roads,paths and a rehabilitated landscape. Land-owners will have contracted into the Park thus
enhancing conservation. The marine component will be protected through deployment of patrol
and monitoring equipment.

GEF funds will be used primarily to provide support to the above components in the Park
(US$2.425 million) and to support implementation of the incentive framework (US$O.S million).
Whilst no GEF funds will be used inrelation to purchase of land, minor support (US$0.020) will
be provided to assist the legal and valuation aspects of including land via purchases or
contracting.

Sub-total costs o f the GEF Alternative: US$28.865 million. GEF Funding: US$2.444 million.

COMPONENT3: INSTITUTION& GOVERNANCESTRUCTURES:
The development of institutions and governance structures to ensure the successful
implementation o f the Addo project and management o f the Park.

Output: Appropriate institutional structures will be established and capacitated, including
management and business plans, an IEMS, a monitoring system and a project management unit
("MU).

GEF funds will be used primarily to support the overall development of this component as
discussed above but not the operating costs of SANParks staff and gAENP which will be met by
SANParks. GEF funds will support the operations of the Project Management Unit (PMU),
development of a financial plan to ensure sustainability of the Park and to introduce new
Integrated Environmental Management Systems (IEMS) to the Park, which will be replicable in
other SANParks, and hopeklly elsewhere. To enhance project management and monitoring a
Management Information & Reporting System (MIRS) will be developed with GEF funds.

Sub-total costs o f the GEF Alternative: US$3.557 million. GEF funding: US$1.620 million.

COMPONENT 4: COMMUNITYDEVELOPMENT & SOCIALECOLOGY:
The Park should benefit communities through enabling managed access to natural resources,
access to employment, micro enterprise opportunities, training and environmental education.

Output: The main outputs will include a more socially viable community having benefited from
Park related employment through, eco-tourism projects, training, resource harvesting and
environmental rehabilitation. The work undertaken will make a major contribution towards
provision of Park infrastructure and the expansion of the social ecology concept in the direction
of Community Driven Development (COD). Any compensation in terms of resettlement action
plans willfall within this component. GEF is not requested tofund this aspect.




                                              - 60 -

 GEF funds will be usedto develop the environmental education component and to support review
 and monitoring of the Poverty Relief and Working for Water Programs. CDD concepts will be
 advanced.

 Sub-total costs o f the GEF Alternative: US$3.474 million. GEF Funding: US$0.153 million.

 COMPONENT 5: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:
 Stimulating overall economic development in the area by creating an enabling environment for
 tourism and associated economic activity.

 Output: This will include developing a tourism, marketing and product awareness plan. The
 largest activity will be leveraging private sector investment in the Park via concessioning.
 Funds will also be used to support providing information relating to the incentive framework
 process.

 GEF funds will be usedto better market and provide information about the Park to bothvisitors
 and the community in order to increase its use and thus its income.

 Sub-total costs o f the GEF Alternative: US$7.069 million. GEF Funding: US$0.340 million.

 Total costs of the GEF Alternative: US$39.94 million. GEFFunding: US$5.5 million.

                          Annex 6(A): Procurement Arrangements
    SOUTH AFRICA: THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

Procurement

Procurementresuonsibilities

South African National Parks (SANParks) will be responsible for carrying out the procurement of
goods and services. SANParks i s expected to work with a variety o f partners in the project,
including for-profit companies and nonprofit organizations.

Procurementprocedures

Procurement of goods, works, and services by SANParks will be carried out following Annual
Procurement Plans agreed with the Bank as part of the Annual Work Plan. Procurement of goods
and works will be in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits" (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999) (hereafter referred to as the 'Procurement Guidelines ') and procurement o f
Consulting Services will be in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised September 1997,
January 1999 and May 2002) (hereafter referred to as the 'Consultants' guidelines'). The Bank's
Standard Request for Proposals will be used for Consulting Services under QCBS. As the project
contains no procurement where International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used and there
are no major intemational consultancies foreseen, a General Procurement Notice (GPN) will not
be required.

The following summarizes the procurementmethods to be used:
 Procurement methods (Table A)

Goods
The grant will largely finance the roll out of implementation o f the gAENP project. GEF funds
will be used to purchase equipment such as vehicles (for biodiversity and fence operations,
anti-poaching patrols, and game recovery) and a boat for patrolling the proposed marine
protected area (largest proposed MPA in South Africa).         In addition, office support will be
provided to the SANParks Scientific ServicedPark Planning unit in Port Elizabeth and the Project
Management Unit (PMU) by replacingthe current computer system and installing a GIS computer
system. The use of GIS technology in the development and updating o f a conservation plan will
be an integral component o f the biodiversity conservation activity. Computer technology will also
form an integral component o f the IEMS and the MIRS.

Procurements using ICB procedures i s not expected to take place. The procurement of goods
and services, other than consulting services, will be undertaken inthe following manner:

0   Contracts for goods, equipment and services estimated to cost US$30,000 - US$250,000
    equivalent per contract will be procuredusingthe National Competitive Procedures which are



                                                - 64 -

    acceptable to the Bank and which are in accordance with paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 o f the
    Procurement Guidelines.

    Contracts for goods, equipment and services estimated to cost less than US$30,000 equivalent
    per contract will be procured using the Shopping Procedures in accordance with paragraphs
    3.5 and 3.6 o f the Procurement Guidelines.

0   Contracts will not be deliberately split to avoid usinga specific procurement method.

ConsultantServices
The SANParks will obtain consultant services in the form o f technical assistance, facilitation, and
planning advice through consultant contracts with firms, NGO's and/or universities, and
individuals. These consultants will assist the SANParks in a suite o f activities such as: project
management, formulating an IEMS, MIRS, landscape planning, biological surveys and
monitoring, conservation planning, social, legal, economic information, training, environmental
education,   health awareness,     business    establishment and management associated with
implementing the project. The selection of consultants will be done inthe following manner:

    For contracts estimated to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent per contract, the shortlist
    may contain entirely o f national consultants.

    Quality-and-Cost-based Selection:       All consulting service contracts valued at more than
    US$200,000 equivalent will be awarded through the Quality and Cost Based Selection
    (QCBS) method in accordance with the provisions o f Section 11, paragraph 3 of Appendix 1
    and Appendix 2 thereto, as per the Consultants ' Guidelines.

    Selection Based on Consultants Qualifications (applicable to selection of Firms): This method
    may be used for assignments, valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract, for
    which the need for preparing and evaluating competitive proposals i s not justified. In such
    cases, SANParks will follow the procedures as per paragraph 3.7 o f the Consultants'
    Guidelines   - "the Client will prepare the TOR'S, request expressions o f interest and
    information on the consultants' experience and competence relevant to the assignment and
    establish a short list, and select the firm with the most appropriate qualifications and
    references. The selected firm shall then be asked to submit a combined technical and financial
    proposal for consideration and contract negotiation".

    Services o f Individual Consultants meeting the requirements o f Section V o f the Consultant
    Guidelines will be selected under the provisions for the Selection of Individual Consultants
    method. Individual Consultants (IC) will be selected through comparison o f curriculum vitae
    against job description requirements o f those expressing interest in the assignment, or those
    having been identified directly by SANParks. Civil servants cannot be hired as consultants
    under the project.

    Single Source Selection o f consultants may be done on an exceptional basis, provided it meets
    the criteria as stated in paragraph 3.8 to 3.11 o f the Consultants' Guidelines. It i s envisaged


                                                 - 65 -

     that the aggregate amount of contracts under single source selection method will not exceed
     US$70,000 equivalent.      The Bank's prior approval must be sought by SANParks for all
     contracts under single source selection.

Works
The (South African), Preferential Procurement Policy Act o f 2000 mandates all the Organs o f
State to apply specific criteria in their procurement processes to allow for preferential treatment
o f the historically disadvantaged enterpriseshndividuals. The Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR) conducted jointly by the government and the Bank identified a number o f issues
in respect o f the implementation o f the Preferential Procurement Policy Act and its supporting
Regulations. Arising from the CPAR recommendations, the government, in its policy paper o f
July 2003 (now approved by the Cabinet), highlighted all the relevant issues in the application o f
the Preferential Procurement Policy Act and resolved to review the existing Preferential
Procurement Policy Act and its associated Regulations as an integral part o f the process to
promulgate the broad based Black Economic Empowerment Bill o f 2003.                The Preferential
Procurement Policy Act however, continues to be in operation until the Act and its associated
Regulations are formally amended. As SANParks is mandated by an Act o f Law to apply the
preferential rules in their national procurement, the procurement o f works, under this Project,
which are going to follow the national competitive procurement procedures, may follow the
Preferential Procurement Policy Act and its associated Regulations.

Works contracts will include development o f supportive tourism infrastructure in a selected few
sites, fencing activities, path and road construction, alien vegetation control and construction o f a
conservation education centre. A large focus o f the allocation o f these activities will be towards
previously disadvantaged groups, following Bank and SANParks procurement policies.                The
following procurement methods will be used:

0    Contracts for works estimated to cost US$50,000 - US$500,000 equivalent per contract will
     be procured usingthe National Competitive Procedures which are acceptable to the Bank and
     which are inaccordance with paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 o f the Procurement Guidelines.

0    Minor Works including clearing o f alien vegetation, estimated to cost less than US$50,000
     equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$2.15 million equivalent,
     may be procured under lump-sum,fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations
     obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The
     invitation will include a detailed description o f the works, including basic specifications, the
     required completion date, a basic form o f agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant
     drawings, where applicable. The award will be made to the contractor who offers the lowest
     price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete
     the contract successfully.   All procurement documents relating to Small Works will be
     properly filed and retained by SANParks, the main coordinating agencies for post review and
     audit by the Bank.

SANParksSelection Processof Consultants

Procurement proposals will be vetted by the gAENP Steering Committee (PSC) that consists o f
the following SANParks staff       Director: Conservation Development; Head: Park Planning &
Development; gAENP Project Co-ordinator; Park Manager o f Addo Elephant National Park; and
the General Manager: Commercialization. The Park Steering Committee will meet on a quarterly
basis and more frequently as the need requires during the early phase o f the project.

Procurement CaDacitv Assessment

Findings
   Although the current procurement function at AENP, is essentially part o f the Finance
   Department, it functions well in it's current arrangement. However, it ideally needs to gain
   greater independence especially in light o f the World Bank Project and the anticipated
   procurement to be spent on goods, works and consultant services.

   The existing controls for the financial aspect o f the procurement function are well managed
   with a high level o f discipline evident, with no noticeable deviation from the Public Finance
    Management Act.

   AENP has limited experience and capacity in general handling o f the procurement cycle and
   has no procurement planning.       Their knowledge o f procurement i s on the basis o f their
    experience on the job and they have had no training inprocurement.

    Current contracts are not well managed in terms o f compliance to the contract provisions.

    AENP's knowledge o f the Bank's procurement procedures and guidelines i s very limited.

   N o documented dispute resolution procedure exists.

   N o separate procurement audits are undertaken.

Recommendations
    Further procurement skills training for the AENP staff who will be handling procurement.

   A procurement officer will be contracted by the project to the PMUand Bank training may be
   provided ifrequired.

   Independent procurement reviews and evaluations on performance should be conducted by
   the Project once every six months (at least for the first 18 months until the capacity reaches a
    satisfactory level). The reports should be submitted to the Bank for review. Inaddition, Bank
    staff should conduct periodic reviews (once in four months) at least for the first year o f
    operation to ensure progress inbuildingcapacity and satisfactory performance.

   Prior to awarding any contract for clearing o f alien vegetation gAENP will adopt a similar

           Annex 6(B): Financial Management and DisbursementArrangements
       SOUTH AFRICA: THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

FinancialManavement
1. Summary ofthe Financial ManagementAssessment
Financial management capacity

(i)CapacityofstaffinSANParks:
SANParks will be responsible for the overall financial management o f the project. The SANParks
team at the AENP's Financial Administration is well qualified and sufficiently familiar with Bank
procedures to ensure sound management and control. A relevantly qualified and experienced
full-time Financial Officer will be seconded from SANParks to support the project. The officer
will work under the Project Manager but with financial management accountability still vesting
with Addo's Finance Officer who will ensure adherence to SANParks' and Grant requirements.
Short-term training inBank financial procedures, including reporting, will be required.

(ii)FinancialManagementSystems(FMS):
The financial self-assessment, carried out in August 2002, indicated high compliance by
SANParks with Bank requirements and guidelines. A further Bank assessment was carried out in
March 2003 which substantially confirms the self assessment. SANParks has a well established
internal control system. Rules and regulations, including rules of ethics, are well defined and
documented in manuals. The institutional arrangements for financial management of the project
will follow the proven Cape Peninsula National Park model as per section C4 of the PAD and as
discussed above. At the time of the financial management assessment it was noted that although
the SANPark's Internal Audit department was functional, the coverage given to the gAENP
seemed inadequate. This weakness i s being addressed through a recently signed contract with a
reputable accounting firm to annually provide internal audits for all of SANParks including the
AENP. The contract i s effective as o f March 2003.

The previous SANParks computer-based financial management system (Prophecy accounting
software) has a proven track record. However, as o f September 1, 2003, SANParks switched to
a new and better system called Great Plains. Staff training i s underway to facilitate the transfer to
the new system. SANParks has shown highly satisfactory financial management under another
Bank/GEF-financed project (Cape Peninsula National Park - GEF, US$6.2 million). SANParks
will demonstrate the capabilities of the new system to the Bank, prior to effectiveness, by
providing a proposed FMR prototype report. A Bank staff member (FMS) will also review the
operationality and reliability of the system before project effectiveness.

(iii)Readinessandnextsteps:
The format of FMRs will be provided by SANParks prior to effectiveness and demonstrating that
FMRscanbe producedby the computerized systemprior to effectiveness.

2. Audit Arrangements
The audit trail was found to be robust at SANParks, given the capabilities of the computerized
system, protocol surrounding processes, and information management. SANParks has received



                                                -71  -

no less than 7 consecutive unqualified audits from its independent external auditors. The filing
and archiving system was also found to be one o f the strongest in the region.

South Africa i s home to all o f the major international management and audit firms and the existing
SANParks' auditors, approved for other Bank supported projects, have been appointed to audit
this project. Therefore, no major risksexist with respect to project auditing.

Inconclusion, the financial management risk is considered to be minimal and well mitigated. As
to the counterpart funds, the Recipient has provided, its financial projections to demonstrate its
ability to provide counterpart funds.

3. DisbursementArrangements
The Grant funds will be disbursed over a period o f 6 years with project Completion Date set for
10/31/2009 and Closing Date o f 04/30/2010. SANParks will be the recipient and the Executing
Agency for the Grant.      A four month advance from the proceeds o f the Grant, equal to
US$200,000, will be deposited by the Bank into a US$ denominated Special Account to be
opened by SANParks at a commercial Bank acceptable to IBRD. SANParks will fund all Project
expenditures from its existing Rand bank account, then reimburse, on at least a monthly basis, the
Rand equivalent o f eligible expenditures from the US$ Special Account to its Rand bank account.
Application for replenishment will be based on these reimbursements from the US$ Special
Account, and will be supported by details of the individual payments made. The exchange rate to
be used, will be the exchange in effect on the day that funds are withdrawn from the Special
Account.    Applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly. All transactions will be
managed through the SANParks financial management system.

A retroactive financing amount o f US$7,000 will be permittedto enable an advert to be placed in
the press for the Procurement Manager and for related office equipment to be purchased.

    Additional Annex 12: Main findings of the Strategic Environmental Assessment
   SOUTH AFRICA THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

1. Background

The project objectives are to achieve a number o f positive environmental, socio-economic and
developmental impacts from investments to conserve nationally and globally important
biodiversity in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. A Strategic Environmental Assessment
(SEA) has been undertaken to meet Bank EA requirements. A SEA was selected instead o f an
EA (with Bank approval), as the exact nature of the new Park boundaries could not be
determined with great precision duringpreparation. The specific areas encompassed by expansion
will depend on the nature and uptake o f land conversion incentives developed, negotiations, etc.
Beyond the SEA, specific project investments, for example land conversion, or tourism
development, will require site-level Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as required under
South African legislation. This annex summarizes the key issues identified in the SEA, and the
compatibility o f South African environmental assessment policy and regulations with World Bank
safeguard policy requirements for project-level EIA.

2. Main Findingsof the SEA

The SEA was comprehensive and examined the biophysical and socio-economic environment in
the project area, financial viability o f the gAENP, broad legal and institutional framework, and
concerns raised by interested and affected parties, Strategic issues identified by the SEA, which
are associated with the proposed gAENP include:
        Displacement and relocation o f farm workers
   0    Ongoing uncertainty about the development o f gAENP
   0    Impact o f the project on farming related industries and activities
        Lack o f communication with affected parties
   0    Impact on unemployment and economic opportunities
   0    Impact created by the Coega Industrial Development Zone
        Need for socio-economic indicators and targets
   0    Compliance with SEA regulations
        Impact on dairy, beef and chicory production
   0    Impact on mohair production
        Landpurchase process

Most o f the strategic issues identified by the SEA, through extensive public consultations, were
socio-economic or institutional. The main environmental issue was the potential impact of the
Coega harbor development on the proposed gAENP, particularly the marine component. The
issues identified inthe SEA have been accounted for inproject design (Table 1).

Generally, the gAENP was perceived to bring positive environmental benefits to the planning
area, in particular by converting agriculture land (in some cases associated with agro-chemical
inputs) to more benign biodiversity conservation and ecotourism development. The project has
been classed as Category B under Bank guidelines, thus requiring a partial EA. Specific project
investments will be subject to environmental impact assessment (EIA) as required under South

African legislation. This should address the requirement for a partial EIA. Precedentshave been
set for this approach. The Bank's urban investment program (SUDP) in Swaziland undertook a
broad SEA during project preparation and then focused more detailed EIAs on site-specific
investments inroad, water and sewage, housing upgrading etc.

3. Framework for Environmental Management and EIA in South Africa

South Africa has a long history of legal and institutional support for environmental management.
The three most critical pieces of South African environmental legislation are the Constitution of
the Republic o f South Africa (1996);    the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA


                                              - 89 -

1998); and the Environment Conservation Act (ECA 1989). The ECA represented a major step
forward to consolidate legislation governing protection and control over the environment, A
number of provisions dealt with protected areas and natural resources, waste management and
pollution, general regulatory powers and provisions for dealing with offenses and penalties. The
Constitution enshrined the fundamental right of every person to an environment.,.."which i s not
detrimental to hidher health or well-being." The environment would be protected for the benefit
of present and future generations through legislative and other measures that would prevent
pollution and ecological degradation, promote conservation, and secure ecologically sustainable
development. The NEMA strengthened a number of statutes under the old ECA. The NEMA
provides broad principles for national environmental management; outlines new environmental
institutions (National Environmental Advisory Forum, and Committee for Environmental
Coordination); procedures for cooperative governance, decision making and conflict management;
outlines the principle o f integrated environmental management; specifies international obligations
and agreements; provides guidance on compliance and enforcement; environmental management
cooperation agreements; and administration of the Act.

In 1989,when the ECA was promulgated, it provideda framework for compulsory environmental
impact assessment (EIA). South Africa uses the term EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment)
while the Bank uses EA (Environmental Assessment).              The two terms are essentially
interchangeable. However, government resisted a legislative basis and continued to support EIA
as a voluntary planning tool. The 1992 Guidelines for Integrated Environmental Management
emphasized the importance of EIA as a mechanism for incorporating environmental factors into
planning and development but the process remained outside existing legislation. In 1994, draft
regulations for EIA were published and a lengthy consultative process was initiated in 1995.
RevisedEIA regulations were publishedin 1996 for public comment.

4. Recent DevelopmentsinEIA in South Africa

In September 1997, the Minister of DEAT promulgated regulations under the Environment
Conservation Act to require compulsory EIA. Guidelines for EIA were released in April 1998
while the NEMA was being formulated. When the NEMA was promulgated in November 1998,
the existing EIA regulations were incorporated. The EIA regulations have been subject to minor
modifications since 1998, the most recent in May 2002. For the most part, the amendments
tightenup wording inthe regulations, and clarify prescribed activities.

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) is the competent authority with
respect to implementingthe NEMA. Intergovernmental coordination i s through the Committee
for Environmental Coordination, while the Minister is advised by the National Environmental
Advisory Forum.

5.1 The EIA Processin SouthAfrica

The South African EIA process has the following main steps:
    When an activity prescribedby the ECA i s proposed, the project proponent must either make
    an application for authorization to the relevant Provincial authority, or seek exemption from
    compliance with the EIA regulations. In Gauteng Province, for example, exemptions are
    sought via a "Pre-Application/EIA Exemption Checklist" that describes the project, the
    existing land uses and environmental sensitivities, expected solid waste and effluent
    generation, and requiredpermits under other legislation. If an exemption is not granted, the
    Provincial authority either requires a Scoping Report or a plan for preparing a Scoping
    Report. The plan must be approved by the authority. A Scoping Report must identify how
    the environment might be affected, what environmental issues are involved, what the project
    alternatives are, and how the public will be consulted.
0   The proponent then prepares the Scoping Report, involving the public, and submits it to the
    Provincial authority for approval. In a number of provinces, it has become practice for the
    Scoping Report to include an analysis of potential impacts, proposed mitigation and
    monitoring measures, and an EMP.
0   Based on the Scoping Report, the Provincial authority then authorizes the project with or
    without conditions, refuses the application, or determines that a full EIA must be undertaken.
    It issues a formal Record of Decision.
0   If required, a full EIA is then produced and provided to the authority for a decision. The
    authority either authorizes the project with or without conditions, or refuses the application.
    I t issues a formal Record o f Decision.

5.2 The World Bank

World Bank requirements for Environmental Assessment (EA) are specified in OP/BP 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment, supported by the EA Sourcebook and Updates.                   Since gAENP
involves the management o f cultural resources, OP 4.1 1 on Cultural Property also applies. The
requirements of OP 4.11 are normally addressed within the EA process specified under OP/BP
4.01. EA documents are prepared by the Borrower. They must be approved by the Bank and
disclosed to the public before the project i s allowed to proceed to appraisal in preparation for
negotiations and approval by the Board.

6. Compatibilityof Bank and RSA Requirements for EA

6.1 Screeningand Scoping

At the project level, both processes currently require an initial environmental screening to
determine the need for and scope o f further environmental assessment. The Bank assigns a
proposed project to one o f three categories to prescribe the appropriate level of assessment (A:
full EA; B: partial EA; C: no EA). Projects in certain sectors or of certain types are normally
categorized as shown in Table 1. These examples are illustrative only. Categorization i s not a
function of the type or scale o f project, but of the location and sensitivity of environmental issues
and the nature and magnitude of potential environmental impacts. For projects requiringa partial
or full EA, an initial scoping and ongoing public consultation are part o f the preparation of the EA


                                                 - 91 -

report.

In South Africa, a proponent must first submit an application for authorization to undertake an
 activity prescribed by the ECA (Table 1).        The application is reviewed by the Provincial
 environment authority and a decision is then made to either requirea Scoping Report or a plan of
 study to complete such a report. In the latter case, the authority must approve the plan before
preparation o f the report can begin.

Table 2 indicates a close correlations between the two screening lists. The two gaps inthe South
African list are mining and resettlement. For the purposes of the gAENP project, mining i s not a
consideration. Resettlement issues will be managed through a Resettlement Policy Framework
prepared according to the requirements o f the World Bank resettlement policy OP/BP 4.12.

In terms of scoping the issues that are to be addressed in an EA study, there may be minor
differences between Bank and South African requirements. For example, the NEMA o f RSA
defines "environment" to mean the surroundings within which humans exist that are made up of:
   1. the land, water and atmosphere o f the earth;
   2. microorganisms, plant and animal life;
   3. any part or combination o f (1) and (2) and the interrelationships among and between them;
        and
   4. the physical, chemical, aesthetic and cultural properties and conditions o f the foregoing that
        influence humanhealth and well-being.

Inits preamble, the NEMA also states a number ofprinciples that project proponentsand decision
makers need to take into account when undertaking EA:

         (i) The State must respect, protect, promote and fulfill the social, economic and
environmental rights o f everyone and strive to meet the basic needs o f previously disadvantaged
communities; and

         (ii) Sustainable development requires the integration of social. economic and
environmental factors in the planning, implementation and evaluation o f decisions to ensure that
development serves present and future generations.



                                                -93 -

The World Bank broadly defines the scope o f EA to "take into account the natural environment
(air, water and land); human health and safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement,
indigenous peoples, and cultural property); and transboundary and global environmental aspects
(e.g. climate change, ozone-depleting substances, pollution o f international waters, and adverse
impacts on biodiversity)." (OP 4.01).

There i s considerable overlap in these prescriptions for the scope o f EA studies. At the same
time, Scoping Reports and, if needed, consequent full EIAs, prepared to meet RSA EA
regulations will need to be cognizant o f World Bank requirements in order to satisfy the needs o f
both processes.   For gAENP, involuntary resettlement concerns will be addressed through a
separate Resettlement Policy Framework, and there are no indigenous peoples concerns within the
meaning o f World Bank policy on the matter.

6.2 Consultation

Both the Bank and South Africa require public consultation for projects needing either a full or
partial EA (Bank) and Scoping Report and EIA (South Africa). The level o f consultation ranges
from publishing notices o f project intent and invitations to review EIA reports, to full public
hearings. With the South African process, the selection o f an appropriate public consultation
instrument depends on the nature o f the project and what the provincial DEAT determines as
minimum requirements. Duringscoping, this may range from simply informing neighbors about
the project and seeking input, to holding public meetings with interested and affected parties, after
publishing notices about the project in various media. Interested and affected parties are also
given time to respond to the draft scoping report. If an EIA i s then required under the South
African process, interested and affected parties must be given an opportunity to provide input as
well as comment on the draft EIA report. The proponent will first present authorities with a plan
o f study for the EIA, which must include public consultation mechanisms. The authorities will
either approve the plan o f study or request modifications, including recommended public
consultation processes to be followed duringthe EIA.

The 1998 Bank EA Guidelines provide proponents with directions to identify interested and
affected parties relative to the project, and appropriate consultation methods. The South African
requirements for consultation are fully compatible with Bank requirements.

6.3 Mitigationand Monitoring

The Bank EA process calls for a distinct Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for projects
deemed to require a full or partial EA. These plans generally outline the mitigation, monitoring,
and institutional measures to be taken during project implementation and operation to avoid or
control adverse environmental impacts, and the actions needed to implement these measures. The
South African guidelines do not require such an EMP. Instead, the EIA report must describe
mitigation and monitoring. The general requirements for an EMP (Bank) and EIA (South Africa)
are listed inTable 3.

Table 3 indicates that South Africa meets Bank requirements for specifying mitigation and
monitoring measures.       However, the South African guidelines do not directly specify an

implementation schedule and reporting procedures, and do not address training needs.

7. Conclusions

The South African EA process generally meets Bank requirements under OP/BP 4.01. While the
processes operate in a slightly different manner, the main elements o f screening, scoping, report
preparation, public consultation, mitigation and monitoring are quite similar in content. The two
processes offer essentially the same level o f independent authority over project approval. The
apparent "gaps" between the two are:
a) Under World Bank OP/BP 4.01, all physical investments under the gAENP will require either
   an EA containing an EMP, or just an EMP. Depending on the nature o f the investment, the
   South Africa process might not require a Scoping Report, or if it does, a subsequent EIA and
   an EMP, as defined by the World Bank, may or may not be required;
b) There is considerable overlap in RSA and World Bank prescriptions for the scope o f EA
   studies. At the same time, Scoping Reports and, if needed, consequent full EIAs, prepared to
   meet RSA EA regulations will need to be cognizant of World Bank requirements in order to
   satisfy the needs o f both processes; and
c) The Bank requires a more comprehensive E M P than i s specified inRSA EA regulations.

             Additional Annex 13: Summary :Resettlement Policy Framework
    SOUTH AFRICA THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

1. Background

This annex provides an overview of the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and associated
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), provided in a separately Bank approved document.              Since
1997, SANParks has been purchasing land with a clause requiring land to be purchased free o f
occupation. Subsequent to the Bank Appraisal Mission, SANParks has agreed to drop the clause
from all future land purchases. A survey has been undertaken to identify all individuals who could
be, and have been, affected by the proposed expansion o f Addo over the next 6 years. Original
estimates o f potentially affected individuals varied from a low o f 570 inhabitants (191 workers) to
a higher figure o f approximately 3300 inhabitants. The variability in the figures i s ascribed to the
underlying assumptions which were made including: the area o f land to be included into Addo, the
ratio o f farm workers per ha o f land and the number o f dependants. Further, the actual number o f
workers and inhabitants which might require resettlement support will also depend on the extent
to which workers and inhabitants, displaced since 1997, can be found.             With the recently
completed farm-by-farm survey and survey to find displaced farm workers and inhabitants, the
number o f affected people has been reduced to 188 (workers plus dependents) o f which 70 were
permanent workers at the time o f sale o f farm to SANParks. Of the 70 workers, 30 (plus 75
dependants) are currently unemployed and will, therefore, be fully incorporated into the
SANParks RPF and RAPs. Another 25,000 ha o f land i s proposed for purchase by SANParks.
Based on the calculated figure o f 1 unemployed person per 1,000 ha, an additional 25 workers
plus dependants are expected to fall under the RPF and RAPs. Based on current phasing for the
expansion o f the Park, it i s anticipated that SANParks' resettlement obligations in this regard will
end in approximately 2010.        SANParks has also agreed to monitor and to include any farm
workers and their dependents into the RPF and RAPs where private land owners have sold land to
SANParks or who have contracted land into the Park and who renegade on resettlement
agreements reached with farm workers and their dependents inthis regard.

2. ResettlementPolicy Framework(RPF) and ResettlementActionPlans (RAPs)

SANParks has developed a RPF to comply with Bank OP 4.12 and a series o f RAPs for years 1
and 2 o f implementation. The RPF includes a broad identification o f the affected community,
South African legal requirements, development o f guiding principles for compensation, generic
income restoration plans and implementation and monitoring arrangements.

Part 2 o f the document consists o f a series o f Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for the first year
of project implementation in which 8 farms were surveyed.            Of these 8 farms, one had no
inhabitants and the sale o f one other had not been finalized, therefore, 6 farms and a total o f 69
inhabitants have been located. The RAPs include income restoration plans. Phase 1o f the project
refers to the first 3 years o f project implementation. This first 3 year phase includes the 6 farms
and 69 inhabitants referred to above. Since there has been a lag time in Appraisal, the first year o f
Phase 1i s currently underway Le. Phase 1will be fully implemented within approximately another
2 years.


                                                  - 96 -

Detailed planning for the marine component o f the project will only begin in year 1 to 2 o f the
project. Therefore, it i s premature to produce RAPs or to develop detailed RPF proposals. The
RPF is likely to need 'some updating in future as the marine component o f the project is
developed.

3. Disclosure

The RAPs and the RPF have been developed with those directly affected.            They have been
disclosed to affected parties directly through meetings due to low levels o f literacy and long
travelling distances in the project area. The document has also been made available at public
libraries and the Bank.

A detailed and comprehensive public participation process around the implementation o f the RPF
and RAPs had been completed. The process included the following:
    0   Identification o f the target audience, which resulted in less written communication and
        more visual presentation and one-on-one meetings.
        Providing the identified target audience (key leadership, community representatives,
        affected farm workers and farm owners) with an overview o f the RPF and RAPS.
        Creating opportunities for these entities to comment on the RPF and RAPs.
        Obtaining buy-in for the RPF and RAPs.
        Communicating with above entities through letters, one-on-one meetings, questionnaires
        and public workshops with presentations.

4. Implementation/institutionalarrangements

Implementation o f the RAPs will be as follows: The lead responsibility for implementation will
rest with SANParks who will provide the necessary staff and budget for implementation including
the use o f an agent if needs be.     At community level, local level fora will be convened for
purposes o f communication and liaison. The local level fora will nominate representatives to sit
on the proposed Resettlement Working Group (RWG). The RWG will primarily provide an
oversight function including serving as a vehicle to raise issues and concerns and to monitor the
implementation o f the RAPs. The RWG will meet every 3-4 months and will be broadly convened
to include government, key agencies, NGO's and community representatives.          The RWG will
report to the Addo Steering Committee. SANParks will also appoint an independent team to
bi-annually monitor the implementation o f the RAPs. The reports o f the independent monitor will
be provided to the Addo Park Manager, the Addo Steering Committee, the RWG and the Bank.

5. Bank monitoringand supervision

The Bank will be provided with copies o f all RAPs for approval. Supervision missions will, on a
6 monthly basis, pay special attention to the planning and implementation o f the RAPs. Emphasis
will be placed on ensuring that corrective actions are taken where needed.

Additional Annex 14: Strategic Framework For The Conservation Of Cultural Resource
    SOUTH AFRICA THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

1. Background

The SANParks, in keeping with its corporate Cultural Resources Management (CRM) Policy and
desire to comply with South African cultural heritage legislation has selected to produce a
Strategic Framework for the Conservation o f Cultural Resources in the area o f the gAENP.
Further, as a precautionary principle, rather than a necessity, an initial desktop cultural resources
inventory has been compiled. Whilst parts o f the area in which the gAENP proposal i s found, are
known to contain important rock art, fossils and artifacts, none o f these resources are threatened
by the gAENP proposal. Therefore, whilst World Bank safeguard policy for Cultural Resources,
OPN 11.03 and OPN 4.11, i s triggered by virtue o f the presence o f cultural property in the area,
the beneficial land use impact o f the gAENP proposal, South African heritage legislation,
SANParks C R M Policy, the gAENP Cultural Resources Framework discussed below, together
with the compilation o f a cultural resources inventory, result incompliance with OPN 11.03.

Inthe south eastern portionofthe gAENP,the Alexandria Dune FieldArea is considered by the
South African authorities to have World Heritage Status. Motivations in this regard have been
made to UNESCO. It i s anticipated that some heritage sites found in gAENP will be o f National
importance while others have regional and local significance.          The South African Heritage
Resources Agency (SAHRA) and/or the local Provincial Heritage Authority will be involved in
the determination o f significance in consultation with experts.

It is clear that the proposed extent o f the gAENP encompasses an area with significant heritage
resources. In 1996, a small dinosaur called Nqwebasaurus thwazi (Kirky) was discovered near
Kirkwood, while the very first dinosaur to be identified in South Africa was discovered on the
Bushman's River (on the edge o f the Park) in 1845. Archaeologically, the area includes extensive
evidence o f Khoisan settlement in the past.         This is reflected in the shell middens on the
Alexandria coast, the rock art o f the Zuurberg and the stone cairns found along the Sunday's
River.

The proposed area o f the gAENP also has many important historic connections. Early travellers
accounts provide information on the old wagon paths and the history o f early elephant (and game)
hunting. The settlement o f the region by Xhosa-speakers and Europeans is reflected in the old
farm houses, mission stations, cemeteries and villages. There are early frontier posts associated
with the successive Wars o f Dispossession (Frontier Wars) also some activity related to the South
African War (Anglo Boer).

2. World Bank Safeguard Policies- OPN 11.03

The main objective o f OPN 4.11 i s to ensure that Bank supported projects avoid, minimize and
mitigate the risks associated with the possible loss o f cultural resources. OPN 11.03 uses the
United Nations definition      of "cultural property" to include sites having archaeological
(prehistoric), palaeontological, historical, religious, and unique natural values. Cultural property,
therefore, encompasses both remains left by previous human inhabitants (for example, middens,


                                                  - 98 -

shrines, and battlegrounds) and unique natural environmental features such as canyons.
Therefore, where such features exist as inthe case of the gAENP proposal, OPN 4.11i s triggered
and needs to be complied with.

3. The SANParksCultural ResourcesManagement ( CRM ) Policy

The conservation of heritage resources in the gAENP is o f importance.                I t i s therefore
praiseworthy that SANParks has committed itself to the conservation of heritage resources in its
Parks (see Policy Guidelinesfor Cultural Resource Management inNational Parks). Inthis policy
document SANParks accepts responsibility for the effective protection, preservation and
sustainable utilization of cultural resources and explicitly commits itself to an integration into the
development planning process as well as Park management.

4. Cultural resources mapping of the gAENP

The Albany Museum has been contracted to undertake a first-phase cultural (archaeological,
palaeontological, anthropological and historical) mapping exercise of the gAENP. In addition to
the physical description; information on significance, key management issues, potential impact and
recommendations for mitigation (if these are adverse) and conservation objectives will be
addressed.

The survey has been completed and the heritage resources have been catalogued in a spreadsheet
database. The database i s constructed in such a way that it can be constantly updated as new sites
are discovered. It i s envisaged that the database may be integrated within the GIS system for the
Park, making it a valuable tool inthe management of heritage resources inthe Park.

5. Legalissues

All heritage resources within the gAENP fall under the Natural Resources Heritage Act (1999).
The Act provides the general principles for governing the management of heritage resources. I t
provides for an integrated system for the identification, assessment and management o f heritage
resources; sets norms and standards for the management of heritage resources and empowers
civil society to conserve their own heritage resources so that they may be preserved for future
generations. The Act will form the basis of the management recommendations flowing out of the
specialist study.

The key implications of this legislation for the gAENP area are as follows:
        The regulation of National Heritage sites is generally a Provincial Government function.
        However, when significant sites are adopted as National Heritage Sites they will fall under
        the jurisdiction o f the national regulatory body, the South African Heritage Resources
        Agency (SAHRA). Shipwrecks are also deemedthe responsibility o f SAHRA.
        SAHRA needs to authorize the sale ofpictures ofNational Heritage Sites.
        Structures older than 60 years may not be altered or demolished without a permit from
        SAHRA.
        All archaeological material and remains of human activity (which are older than 100 years)
        and palaeontological sites as well as meteorites are protected by the Act.


                                                - 99 -

  0    Burial grounds and graves are afforded particular protection and a permit to exhume a
       grave or demolish a cemetery/grave will not be granted if detailed efforts are not made to
       contact and consult communities and individuals who have an interest in the
       cemetery/grave concerned. The Act makes provision for the protection o f Living Heritage
       and also defines Heritage Objects.       It allows for the restitution o f heritage objects to
       communities, which may claim them.

 SANParks i s taking the necessary measure to ensure compliance with the Act.

6. Mitigationmeasures

The main mitigation measures will include:
       The adoption o f the proposed cultural heritage database to ensure that small works are
       built away from sites o f culturalheritage importance.
       The updating o f the database as a planning instrument as new data becomes available.
       The training o f staff on cultural resources identification and management including
       reporting procedures on new finds.
Inthe event that an impact cannot be avoided the requirements o f SAHRA will be complied with
and where needed a mitigation plan will be producedby a reputable specialist.

7. Recommendations

        A basic training program for staff in the identification, management and reporting
        procedures o f heritage resources.
        To appoint a staff member to update and maintain the cultural resources database as new
        heritage resources are discovered.
   0    To integrate the management o f the database and cultural resources as a part o f the
        gAENP environmentalmanagement system which i s about to be adopted.

Therefore, whilst the World Bank Safeguard Policy for Cultural Resources, OPNl1.13 and OP
4.11,i s triggered by virtue o f the presence o f cultural property inthe area, the beneficial land use
impact o f the gAENP proposal, South African heritage legislation, SANParks CRM Policy, the
gAENP Cultural Resource Framework, together with the compilation o f a cultural resource
inventory, result in compliance with OPN 11.03.

    SOUTH AFRICA: THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

Addo ElephantNationalPark's tourism role in the Eastern Cape

Inthis regardAENP alone attracted 120,000 tourists in2002. The number oftourists to the Park
has been increasing at a steady 8% per annum since 1991 when only 51,000 tourists visited the
Park. But of importance in this number is the fact that over 50% of the tourists are from foreign
countries, mainly Germany, Holland and United Kingdom. This high proportion of foreigners,
almost twice that of those visiting Kruger National Park, i s important from the point of earning
forex and job creation. A t the moment the AENP tourism product o f self-catering units with a
total of 140 beds i s running at an average hut and bed occupancy o f 97% and 67%, respectively,
and employing a total o f 39 tourism personnel. With the above wildlife product running on only
13,500 ha, or 11% o f the total Park area, the plan i s to expand the eco-tourism product to
diversify the eco-experience and encourage the tourists to stay more than the present half to one
day to at least three days. Planned developments include boosting the number of beds to
200-250, split between eight tourists facilities (four of which would be outsourced to
concessionaires). An average bed occupancy of 60% and catering for a total o f 180,000 visitors
per annum is expected to generate an annual income of US$2.3 million for the Park, as well as
directly employing 360 people inthe tourism aspects alone. Increasinghut occupancy between 10
- 20% would firther increase income by a further US$0.08 - 0.6 million. This i s expected to
                                                                                  it
have a positive knock-on affect in the local economy. Knock-on affects o f the increase in tourism
around Addo is reflected in the 10 fold increase in the number of private bed and breakfasts
institutions around the Park in the last eight years. The planned development o f tourist lodges on
adjacent contractual Park land will also increase employment. For example the Kuzuko Game
Farm employs seven times the number of staff previously employed on the 16,000 ha farm
properties. Thus, a total of 72 new direct jobs and a further 48 indirecthemporary jobs were
created.

                      Additional Annex 16: Socio-Economic Context
     SOUTH AFRICA THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

1. General

The Republic o f South Africa is situated at the southernmost tip of the African continent, Since
1994, when apartheid ended and elections were held on the basis o f universal adult franchise, the
Republic has been a politically stable multi-party democracy.            A two-chamber national
government with certain governmental responsibilities also devolves to each o f the nineprovinces.
The country is classified as a middle-income developing country with a modem economic
infrastructure. It has an abundant supply of natural resources with well-developed financial, legal,
communications, energy and transport sectors. The challenges facing South Africa are to use
these resources in a sustainable manner to create a strong and balanced economy, to eliminate
poverty, to develop a dynamic human resource capacity and engage itself in the world economy.
Inthis regard, the Eastern Cape Province is the poorest of the country's nineprovinces, with the
highest unemployment rate in the country and thus in desperate need of development. I t i s also
the province which offers some of the most substantial opportunities with regard to its natural
resource base and biodiversity.

2. Population

According to the latest population census, South Africa has a population o f 43 million. The
Eastern Cape is South Africa's second largest o f the country's nine provinces (169,580 sq km),
with the third largest population of 6.4 million (15% of the total South African population)
growing faster than the national average of 2.4%. The main urban areas are Port Elizabeth and
East London. The gAENP project is situated 70 km from Port Elizabeth. The languages spoken
are Xhosa, 83.8% and English, 3.7%. The province has a highproportion (43%) o f people under
the age o f 15. This i s likely to continue although the impact o f HIV/Aids on the trend i s not
known.

The Eastem Cape has a highproportion of low paid workers. The economic diversity is confined
mostly to agriculture, manufacturing, commerce and services, with the weight o f this restricted to
the main commercial centers of Port ElizabetWitenhageand East Londonwhere the focus o f the
industrial and manufacturing sectors are in the motor industry. There is no mining and energy
sector to speak of and the 800 km of relatively undeveloped coastline supports a relatively small
sea fishing industry. Although agriculture only contributes to 3.6% of the economic output o f the
province, it is important as an employer accounting for 13.2% o f the labor force incomparison to
18% in the manufacturing sector. By far the largest contributor to the economy remains the
community and social sector providing 27% o f the economic input and 29% of the employees.
The province has the highestunemployment rate (48% versus the national average o f 34%) o f all
the provinces as well as a high labor dependency ratio (3.1% versus the national average o f
1.9%). As part o f the national government's overall economic strategic framework to stimulate
economic development in deprived areas such as the Eastern Cape, two Spatial Development
Initiatives (SDIs) were identified for the region, namely the Fish River and the Wild Coast SDIs,
and two Industrial Development Zones (IDZs) - West Bank, East London, and Coega (see below)
within those areas.


                                               - 102-

A survey o f socio-economic conditions in the project area shows that rural wages on large
commercial farms are low. The average wage for male workers on commercial farms in the area
(dairy, mixed) i s approximately R550 per month. If females are included (the average female
wage i s R141.00) the average drops to R282.00. Research has shown that certain agricultural
practices, particularly pastoralism, are neither ecologically nor economically sustainable, thus
undermining long-term social benefits. The future challenge lies in using the province's unique
assemblage o f biological and landscape diversity to provide more sustainable ecological and social
benefits. In this regard the gAENP can play an important and model example of meeting
conservation and social goals for the Eastern Cape and South Africa.

    SOUTH AFRICA: THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

1. SouthAfricanenvironment

South Africa's surface area i s 1,219,090 sq km. Its coastline is swept by two currents, the warm
south-flowing Mozambique-Agulhas which skirts the east and southern coasts and the cold
Benguela that flows northwards on the west coast towards southern Angola. Consequently there
are significant climatic variations in South Africa. There are two main relief features: an interior
plateau and the land (generally an escarpment o f varying height) between the plateau and the
coast. Inthis area betweenplateau and sea there are three major subdivisions, the easternplateau
slopes, the Cape folded belt and adjacent regions, and the western plateau slopes. The average
rainfall of South Africa i s 464 mm. The rainfall i s unreliable and unpredictable, droughts are
common and the rate o f evaporation is generally high, exceeding precipitation. In addition, the
soils of South Africa are unstable and around 500 million tons of topsoil i s lost through erosion
each year, largely because of poor land management.

Ecologically sustainable land use is crucial to the long-term welfare of South Africa.          The
Republic has amongst the world's greatest diversity of plant and animal species contained in one
country and includes a large number of endemic species. It ranks among the upper quarter of the
world's mega-biodiversity countries. This remarkable richness i s the result of the variety of the
landforms, geology and soil types, as well as the mix o f tropical and temperate climates. South
Africa i s the thirdmost biologically diverse country inthe world and i s of major global importance
for biodiversity conservation (1997, White Paper on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of
South Africa's Biological Diversity).      Some 23,404 vascular plant species occur within the
boundaries o f South Africa o f which 80% are found nowhere else.               In addition to the
extraordinary wealth o f plant life, 5.8% of the worlds' total mammal species, 8% of bird species,
4.6% of the global diversity o f reptiles, 16% of the total marine fish species and 5.5% o f the
worlds' described insects are to be found on 0.8% of the land area. Faunal endemicity i s notably
high amongst the amphibians (44%) and reptiles (31%).          In terms of biomes, South Africa is
world renowned, with a total o f seven biomes, two o f which, the Cape Floral Kingdom (or
Fynbos) and Thicket, are restricted to within the country. The Cape Floral Kingdom is identified
as one of the richest such areas in the world, while the Succulent Karoo biome i s o f extreme
importance because some 33% o f the worlds' succulents are found in this area of South Africa
alone.

Human activity has impacted on South Africa's biomes for many thousands of years. The pace
and extent has varied with the centuries. Agriculture and urban development has transformed
parts of the landscape. The country's rich biodiversity i s under great threat with about 47% of
South Africa's natural vegetation having been transformed. South Africa has the third highest
number of threatened reptile, amphibian and invertebrate species. Although only 13% of its
diverse mammalian fauna are considered threatened, the country i s still noted to be among those
areas under severe threat o f extinctions. Among the vascular plants, Southern Africa records the
highest number of Red Data Book species (2,575 species) per unit area, exceeding countries like


                                                -104 -

Australia, India and Mexico. Thus, in the global context, South Africa with its rich biodiversity
and increasing levels of threat makes it an area worthy o f conservation attention.

2. EasternCape Provinceenvironment

The Eastern Cape i s temperate rather than tropical and it i s free of malaria. Much of the
landscape o f this second largest province consists of undulating hills. The surface area i s 169,580
sq km, some 13.9% of South Africa. The proposed gAENP area covers approximately 383,000
ha, 263,000 ha inthe terrestrial zone and 120,000 ha inthe marine zone. The area falls within the
recent demarcation of four local government authorities (municipalities) of the Western District
Council, Blue Crane, Sundays River Valley and Ikwesi.                 The closest towns are Port
ElizabetWUitenhage, Jansenville, Somerset East, Paterson, Kirkwood, Addo and Alexandria.
Rainfall within the gAENP planning domain varies from 250mm on the northern rain-shadow side
o f the central Zuurberg Mountains belt, to 1,200"       on the mountains and 900"       in the south
eastern coastal section. The diversity of topography, the proximity to the coast, a diversity o f soil
types and its position at the boundary between major climatic zones has produced a range of
landscapes and biodiversity of unique proportions, making the gAENP potentially the most
diverse conservation area inSouthern Africa.

The diversity o f abiotic conditions prevalent in the Eastern Cape has made the region the most
botanically varied area of the country. It forms a major transition or tension zone between four of
the sub-continent's five major phytochoria: the Cape, Afromontane, Karoo-Namib and
Tongaland-Pondoland. This i s further witnessed by the convergence within the Eastern Cape of
five (Nama-Karoo, Fynbos, Grasslands, Forests and Thicket) of the seven recognized biomes in
the country.    These biomes are all represented within a 120km radius of Port Elizabeth.
Furthermore, within these biomes inthe Eastern Cape, a total o f 27 different vegetation types are
represented, more than any o f the other eight provinces o f South Africa. Thus, at the level o f the
vegetation type and biome, biodiversity inthe Eastern Cape i s the highest in Southern Africa.

3. Albany hot-spot

Within the Eastern Cape and includedwithin the gAENP, the Albany hot-spot has been identified
as one of the eight biodiversity hot-spots in the subcontinent. Although the f 2,000 species and
10% endemism in the Albany hot-spot i s not particularly high, the species-to-area relationship
compares with the other Southern African hot-spots, and it should be ranked among the worlds'
most conservation-worthy areas. Inaddition, the transitional nature of the vegetation types within
the Albany area, where many of the species are at their distributional limits, is particularly unique.
This pattern offers ideal opportunities to test the factors limiting species distribution, which i s of
particular importance in studying the ramifications o f global environmental change. Endemics
within the Albany hot-spot tend to be mainly succulents from the succulent thicket vegetation
types. For example 30% o f Southern Africa's succulent Euphorbia species are represented in the
Eastern Cape, of which 48% are endemic to the region.

4. Coast and estuaries

In addition to the diverse terrestrial elements, the Eastern Cape's coastal, marine and estuarine


                                               - 105-

components add further to the biodiversity richness of the area. The Eastern Cape i s particularly
richly endowed with river estuaries, several of which    - suchas the Sundays River (inthe gAENP)
- remain perennially open. The Sundays i s unique in that it exits through the Alexandria dunefield
and i s also ranked as the eighth most biological diverse estuary in the country. The Eastern Cape
marine component includesa diversity o f sandy and rocky shores and two island groups, Birdand
St. Croix islands (also in the proposed gAENP), add to the scenic and biological diversity of the
region.    This section o f the South African coast falls within the South Coast marine
biogeographical province (one of three nationally identified) and has been independently identified
inneedof protection. Muchlikethe terrestrial areas inclose proximity to Algoa Bay, this section
of the coast appears to be a transitional area of marine species from the cool temperate west coast
and warm tropical elements and i s particularly important for its diversity o f bivalves, limpets and
endemic fish species. Eastwards of Algoa Bay the proportion of endemic fish species rapidly
declines. The continental islands are also important sea-bird breeding sites supporting the largest
population o f the vulnerable jackass penguin, Spheniscus demersus, and the world's largest
gannetry o f the South African gannet, Morus capensis. It also supports other conservation
worthy species such as the endangered roseate tern, Sterna dougallii and South African
oystercatcher, Haemotopus moquini. The islands also harbor the most easterly colony of the
Cape fix seal, Arctocephalus pusillus.

5. Landscapesand biomes to be conservedby the gAENP

The gAENP project plans to conserve representation of the uniquerange o f landscapes and viable
samples of five of the country's seven biomes (described below) but, importantly, this long-term
conservation is dependent upon the inclusion of sufficiently large enough areas to include the
critical processes (both abiotic and biotic) supporting the biodiversity pattern as recommended in
the Conservation Plan for the gAENP (see Specialist Reports listed inreferences).

The proposed gAENP would conserve representatives of a wide range o f landscapes, terrestrial
biomes and aquatic systems including offshore islands (rare on the African coast), a river estuary,
one of the largest coastal dunefields, coastal forests, inland moist and semi-arid plains, mountains,
and perennial and ephemeral river system.

5.1 Terrestrialbiomes

   0    Thicket: Restricted to the South African eastern seaboard, only 4.5% o f this biome i s
        formally conserved.      I t is under immense threat from degradation as a result of
        unsustainable farming practices.     I t i s home to important elephant and black rhino
        populations (both endangered species) that will increase in their international value as the
        Park expands. The Park will contribute substantially to the conservationo f this biome.
        Nama Karoo: This biome has a relatively highdegree o f endemicity estimated to be about
         18% of its 2,100 plant species. This biome i s historically known for the mass movements
        of its once huge springbok populations, and will play an important part in the semi-arid
        processes characteristic o f the dry northern Karoo plains. The area has been extensively
        degraded through overgrazing, principally by small stock, so much so, that it was ranked
        as the most degraded vegetation type in South Africa.        It thus remains a conservation
        priority. Although it covers 28% o f the country and 25% o f the Eastern Cape, it remains


                                                - 106-

       poorly conserved with a meager 1.9% formally protected.           The gAENP project will
       increase protection by about 60%.
       Fynbos: Fynbos vegetation forms the major component of the Cape Floral Kingdom, the
       smallest of the six Floral Kingdoms of the world. The Fynbos Biome i s the second best
       protected biome in the country with about 12% formally conserved.             The gAENP's
       planned expansions will only marginally increase the amount o f these vegetation types
       under conservation. More importantly, conservation of the mountainous areas has been
       noted to be a key area linking biological and abiotic processes between the lowland and
       upland areas of the Park, critical to the long-term survival o f many large mammal species.
       The biome remains under threat from flower collectors, agriculture, alien vegetation and
       changing fire regimes, so much so that 1,700 (23%) plant species are threatened with
       extinction - the highest for any biome in South Africa.
       Forest: The Eastern Cape is particularly important in the conservation of the country's
       smallest biome, as it i s home to 95% and 47% o f the country's Coastal and Afromontane
       forests, respectively. The fact i s that they occur in small isolated patches under diverse
       management authorities and they are still under great pressure from exploitation, grazing
       and medicinal plant collection, so much so, that more than 43% of the original areas have
       been transformed. The relatively isolated nature of the forest patches in the Zuurberg
       section o f the gAENP makes them an important biological link between the eastern and
       southern Cape forest blocks. Inaddition, the Alexandria coastal forest i s important as it is
       the only forest that has a true mix of Tongaland-Pondoland and Cape elements together.
       Grassland: Essential to the livestock industry in the Eastern Cape, the biome has been
       placed under great threat, with an average o f 58% o f the biome having been transformed.
       The gAENP would increase the area of this biome under conservation by a further 50%.

O f importance inthe conservation of the above biodiversity, i s the need to preserve the ecological
processes driving the system. To this effect, the conservation planning undertaken as part o f the
PDF-B grant determined that about 82% of the planning domain was required to meet the
conservation of both ecological pattern and processes. This emphasizes the point that to conserve
those processes unique to this area with a full complement o f African herbivores and carnivores
indigenous to the region requires large areas under conservation.

5.2. Marine component

The proposedMPA o f the Park includes the following important attributes:

       Will greatly contribute to South Africa's national goal of increasingits MPAs from the 5%
       towards 20%.

       maintaining important ecological processes, particularly the sandy beach - surf zone
       Will create critical linkages between terrestrial and marine conservation areas thereby

       interaction important in diatom production, which accounts for 95% o f Algoa Bay's
       primary production.
       Conservation of sandy beach ecosystems, not adequately conserved in South Africa.
       Conservationo f 280 macro-algae species, 38% o f which are endemic to South Africa.
       The Park will protect representation o f over 86% of South Africa's endemic marine
       invertebrate species.

0 The area will offer protection to the highest concentration of endemic coastal marine fish
  species (34% o f South Africa's endemic fish species). The M P A will also play a pivotal
  role in re-stocking surrounding waters with over exploited reef fish species.

        Additional Annex 18: Performance of SANParks in Meetings its Mandate
    SOUTH AFRICA: THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

SANParks has extended the National Parks area under protection by a further 300,000 ha since
1995, with most o f the focus on under-conserved biomes. During this period a further four
National Parks were proclaimed thus increasing South Africa's conservation assets towards
meeting national and international conservation obligations.

In2002, SANParks achieved apositive turn-around inits financial performance. This was largely
due to the implementation of an improvement plan called "operation prevail". The plan was an
immediate eight-point action plan to improve the financial situation of SANParks. The major
activities included:
   0    Reducingstaff costs by way of staffretrenchment, especially at middlemanagement level
   0    Outsourcing non-core activities. This was initiated with the commercialization o f shops
        and restaurants
        Replacing and upgrading and investing in additional profitable accommodation units by
        borrowing funds
   0    Repaying expensive debt
   0    Better managing margins and stock holdings
   0    Approaching the Dept o f Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEA&T) for a cash
        injection to cover lost revenue resultingfrom the 2000 floods inKruger National Park.

The financial performance o f SANParks is annexed to this report. The bank overdraft facility of
R25m was breached and fully utilized.          The improved financial performance has enabled
SANParks to repay its overdraft and SANParks i s operating with surplus cash and i s earning
interest on its operational bank account.

DEA&T has allocated increased grants to SANParks. These grants cover new poverty relief
projects, land acquisition, road maintenance and an element to cover inflationon costs.

Tourism remains the main generator o f funds for SANParks. Accommodation occupancies are
relatively high and continue to grow. The tourism products and activities offered by the Parks
continue to enjoy success. SANParks largest costs remain salaries and wages for staff, however
this is benchmarked at a respectable 55% of total cost. Other major costs include refurbishment
of the tourism infrastructure.

Accountability has been cemented through full compliance with the Public Finance Management
Act as well as compliance with the King Code of Corporate Governance.              SANParks also
received an unqualified audit report for 2002.         During the year, Mckinsey Management
Consultants assisted SANParks with a performance audit, to enable the organization to organize
itself better. Recommendations from this report were briefly as follows:
        Streamline the Directorate and organization to support strategic objectives. Builda strong
        constituency building section that will focus increasingly on broad national support for
        SANParks, enhanced conservation education and attention to local communities. The
        new Directorate is inthe process of being created.



                                               - 109-

   0  Dedicated fund raising section required with personnel resident in the United States
      focused on this important market.
   0  Realizing best practice in conservation through an enhanced Conservation Services section
      with greater emphasis on adaptive management principles through an integrated
      environmental management system. This i s now been effected through employment o f
      further staff inpriority academic areas.
   0  African and non - South African citizens, per diem gate fees, tourism accommodation),
      Develop internal fund raising capacity through increased pricing (split tariffs for South

      better product offering, marketing and concession allocation.

These measures, designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness are already in the process o f
implementation and their effect i s still to be recorded.

The financial outlook for year ended 31 March 2003 remains positive.         It is expected that
SANParks will deliver a similar financial performance compared to 2002.       The income from
concessions i s also coming on stream for the first time in this financial year. This source o f
income i s expected to last for the next twenty years.

    Additional Annex 19: Summary of Land Incorporation& Incentive Framework for
                                   South African National Parks
     SOUTH AFRICA: THE GREATER ADD0 ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROJECT

1. Introduction

As the country's premierConservationorganization, SANParks has beenmandated by the national
government to contribute to the expansion of South Africa's biodiversity conservation areas from
the present 6% to 8% of the country's surface areaby 2010, and to increase the marine protected
areas substantially. National Parks as megabiodiversity repositories primarily serve conservation
purposes, but also have an enormous potential for economic development, so much so that when
fully developed they should be viewed as an asset and not a liability to South African society. The
booming eco-tourism industry in the gAENP and other Parks reflects this. In meeting both
conservation and socio-economic obligations, SANParks is attempting to address the issue o f
conserving a healthy environment, thus combining the objectives of conservation and the
sustainable use of biodiversity with restitution.        This is in accordance with the National
Constitution, the National Environment and Management Act (NEMA), and social justice
initiatives as advocated through the Land Restitution, and Reconstruction and Development
programs.

The national government has played a pivotal role of late towards land purchases, consolidating
40% of the 20,000 ha, in the Addo Elephant National Park alone in 2001-2, in addition to
facilitating the transfer o f a further 22,000 ha of state land to SANParks. Private investors have
also played an important role. However, alternative forms of incorporation into National Parks
through contractual arrangements with private land-owners and community land, offering them a
suite of incentives, are also being actively pursuedby SANParks.

The general requirement of setting aside large conservation areas is primarily designedto meet the
essential ecological patterns and processes associated with preserving sustainable functioning
examples o f the country's different biomes, but also enhances the aesthetic, recreational and
spiritual appeal. Furthermore, expansion of National Parks remains necessary in the face of
climate change and the habitat needs o f threatened and endangered species. Thus, for National
Parks to meet their essential requirement of conserving biodiversity, yet meeting human needs,
they must:
0    Be large enough to support representative examples of one or more natural ecosystems.
0    Contribute to biodiversity and ecological processesand preserve special cultural features.
0   Provide spiritual, scientific, educational and recreational opportunities.
    Incorporatethe needs and aspirations o f local, national and international communities.
    Reduce occupation and exploitation that are a direct threat to its main purpose.

To rationalize the expansion process o f National Parks, the following land incorporation and
associated resettlement frameworks, bound within their legal guidelines and obligations are
elucidated below.

2. Legalrequirements

As part o f South Africa's democratization process since the early 1990's, the country has
developed possibly the most progressive national constitution and supporting social legislation. A
great deal of emphasis has been placed upon legally supporting the poorest and most vulnerable
sectors o f South African society. Inthis regard, a suite o f laws such as: The Constitution 108 o f
1996; Labour Tenants Act 30 of 1996; Restitution o f Land Rights Act 22 of 1994; Prevention o f
Legal and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 19 o f 1998; National Parks Act 57 of 1976; National
Environment and Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA); Expropriation Act 63 of 1975;
Extension o f Security and Tenure Act 62 o f 1997 (ESTA); Marine Living Resources Act 18 of
1998; Sea Shore Act 21 o f 1935; The Sea Birds and Seals Protection Act 46 of 1973 govery
resettlement and land/marine right activities.       These are addressed in the SANParks Land
Incorporation policy and Resettlement Framework below.

3. LandAcquisition Framework

The SANParks land acquisition policy seeks to:
0  Establish the criteria for incorporating land into national parks.
0  Prioritize areas based upon national conservation priorities.
0  Prioritize areas for incorporationaccording to their contribution to the goals and objectives o f
   the specific Park.
0  Provide a fair and equitable framework by which to include areas.
0   Show flexibility with regardto different means o f incorporation.
0  Establish legally bindinginstitutions whereby contractual landowners can collectively contract
   with SANParks.

Any further expansion of a National Park or proclamation of a new one remainsjustified ifone or
more o f the five following basic principles are met, namely: maintaining ecological integrity;
representativeness; enhancing biological diversity; enhancing economic viability; and minimizing
threats.

Thus the importance placed upon any particular tract o f land or expanse of sea for incorporation
into a National Park will dependon its contribution to the goals and objectives of the Park and the
threat o f these not being achieved in the long-term because o f irreversible actions. This therefore
requires the weighing up o f a suite of criteria including: conservation value; location; size; cultural
value; economic contribution; purchase price; aesthetic value; and social constraints.

4. Incorporationoptions

Differentincorporation options would be exercised as follows:
   Purchase: will be entertained when the property i s considered to be of high biological
   importance within the identified core area o f the Park, adjoining or surrounded by current
    SANParks property, o f cultural or aesthetic value, managerial importance (straightening
   boundaries etc), at a reasonable price. The property will be proclaimed as a National Park.
   Contractual Arrangements: will be entertained when the property i s situated on the periphery
   o f the proposed Park area, preferably outside the core conservation area, i s o f biological merit

o n its own account, o f such a size that it would be able to support a sustainable
conservation-based enterprise, or was part o f a larger cluster o f smaller properties making up
an economic unit. The property will be proclaimed as a National Park.
Management Agreement:        will apply to areas on the periphery o f the Park, o f limited
biological value but with managerial importance and importantly can be fenced into the Park.
The property will not be proclaimed as contractual National Park land.
Buffer Agreement:    will be encouraged with surrounding land-owners largely outside the
desired Park boundary but where by Park integrity would be enhanced if their land use
conformed with that o f the Parks. This entails a weak agreement.
Expropriation:   will be considered when the purchase route could not be exercised on a
willing-buyer willing-seller basis for key properties identified for purchase, and all other
avenues have been exhausted.

Negotiationpriority - high                               Negotiationpriority - moderate

The extent to which SANParks implements any of the above alternatives will depend upon the
resources which they have at their disposal when considering the options and the perceivedvalue
o f the property as illustrated inthe above matrix.

The incorporation of government land (either terrestrial or marine) for conservation purposes
would also be governed by the conservation value and risk matrix above as a means of weighting
its priority for negotiation for transfer from other departments to SANParks. Given the fact such
land has no transactions costs would generally rate its inclusion highly provided it meets inclusion
criteria mentioned above.

5. Incentives

The full project expects to be able to use a broad set of incentives to encourage land users to
incorporate their land into gAENP. This includes assistance inthe following areas:
    0    Introduction o f game for use ineco-tourism.
    0    Wildlife management knowledge transfer.
    0    Traversing rights to the Park.
    0    Invasive alien plant control.
    0    Rehabilitation o f land.
    0    Firemanagement assistance.
    0    Marketing cooperation.
    0    Fundingconduit to mobilize government subsidies.
    0    Innovative fund for sewage works, etc.
    0    Joint program for fencing and roads.
    0    Tourism transport assistance.
    0   Legal recognition to incorporated areas, including status as Schedule 2, National Park.

The level of contractual land has already reached 20,000 ha. I t is projected to increase to some
66,000 ha by project end. With the incentive package comes a set o f obligations for the land
users, and returns to SANParks. Land users will be contractually committed to observe good
standards in biodiversity management, including stocking rates, fencing, and rehabilitation of
vegetation. There could also be direct financial obligations to share a percentage of financial
turnover with SANParks. Resettlement will be addressed as per the Bank approved RPF and
RAP.
