The project will therefore\n            support the expansion of the Park, and marine protected\n            areas, significantly boosting eco-tourism. To this end, land\n            acquisition is already taking place, therefore, this\n            resettlement action plan sets the policy framework in\n            compliance with the Bank operational policy, and the\n            country's legal framework guiding the principles for\n            compensation, income restoration, and implementation and\n            monitoring arrangements. A Resettlement Working Group has\n            been set up to include maximum participation by the affected\n            people in the resettlement process, to identify displaced\n            populations from appropriated farms. Alternative\n            accommodation, and facilities will be provided for loss of\n            access to farms, also allowing, the possibility to work for\n            the Poverty Relief program, while SANParks negotiates with\n            the Department of Housing, the necessary funds per household\n            to build new housing in the town of the affected\n            people's choice. Appropriate jobs have been identified\n            for displaced persons, and, training will be provided to\n            ensure satisfactory performances in their new jobs, as part\n            of the identified capacity building program. An\n            investigation of the viability of alternative income\n            generating strategies is ongoing, particularly through\n            negotiations with the Department of Land Affairs in terms of\n            the Land Reform Grants, which would afford a specified grant\n            for each household, through which profitable agricultural\n            activities may result."}, "docdt": "2003-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
