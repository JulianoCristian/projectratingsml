"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project's development objective\n            is to establish a megabiodiversity conservation area around\n            the existing Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) to avert\n            further ecosystem degradation. The project also aims to\n            contribute to poverty reduction by creating direct\n            employment in nature conservation and by catalyzing the\n            development of eco-tourism. The project has the following\n            five components. Component 1) will build on the conservation\n            planning exercise largely undertaken during the preparation\n            phase of the project and forms the biological basis for the\n            implementation phase. The preparatory studies focused on the\n            systematic conservation planning exercise, freshwater\n            conservation, proposed marine protected area (MPA), and\n            ecological monitoring of the marine environment. The five\n            sub-components each largely deal with park planning and will\n            form part of the overall Integrated Environmental Management\n            System (IEMS). Component 2) Implementation will occur in\n            three different management scenarios: (1) SANParks land\n            owned and managed by SANParks, (2) concessioned areas within\n            SANParks land, and (3) contractual land adjoining the Park\n            where SANParks may or may not manage the land. The three\n            sub-components will roll out of the development plan,\n            inclusive of ecological management, infrastructure\n            development and land incorporation, to ensure effective\n            implementation of the development plan. Component 3)\n            includes the design, implementation and maintenance of\n            management systems and structures to enhance Park management\n            and strengthening/creating institutional structures for\n            effective, participatory Park planning and program\n            implementation. Component 4) will support implementation of\n            the Park development plan where it relates to employment and\n            economic benefits through communal conservation strategies,\n            Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME) opportunities,\n            environmental education and fair resettlement of displaced\n            individuals. This component will forge the benefits of\n            sustainable natural resource use with social upliftment,\n            particularly of previously disadvantaged sectors of society."}, "docdt": "2004-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
