governments\n            Serbia and Montenegro, and its largest constituent member\n            state, Serbia, in the implementation of regulatory,\n            institutional, and structural reforms seeking to\n            significantly accelerate private sector-led growth through:\n            (i) improving the business environment by means of\n            comprehensive reform of enterprise entry, operation and\n            exit; (ii) strengthening the financial system by privatizing\n            and / or liquidating majority state-owned banks and\n            improving the environment under which banks and other\n            financial intermediaries operate; and (iii) privatizing and\n            restructuring socially-owned enterprises that crowd out\n            private sector growth, hamper banking sector recovery, and\n            incur significant fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs.\n            Accordingly the project will be focused in the following\n            areas: reform of business enabling environment, reform of\n            financial sector regulatory and supervisory framework,\n            banking sector reform, and enterprise sector reform.  The\n            credit will be a two tranche operation whose design\n            incorporates the lessons from the implementation of PFSAC I,\n            as well as from transition reforms in the Europe and Central\n            A region during the past decade.  The main benefit of the\n            proposed credit will be the facilitation of faster private\n            sector growth and job creation, supported by a healthier and\n            more developed financial system."}, "docdt": "2003-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
