In particular, the project team\n            recognized the need for a clean, and transparent\n            privatization process, and for tailoring the reform design\n            to the specific features, and economic culture of the\n            country, resulting in a hard-hitting, and results-focused\n            project, yet realistic reform program, as well. One of the\n            main reasons this project achieved its ambitious agenda, was\n            that a vast technical assistance (TA) provision supported\n            the Government in implementing its program, which included\n            both Bank and donor financing. The TA eased not only the\n            privatizations specified by conditionalities, and by the new\n            laws being drafted, but also the critical institution\n            building, required to implement changes, and sustain the\n            program in the long run. Other lessons reinforce the\n            importance of donor coordination, of an integrated approach\n            necessary to implement reforms in both the financial and\n            enterprise sectors, and, for establishing a legal framework,\n            while focusing on institutional capacity and enforcement."}, "docdt": "2005-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
