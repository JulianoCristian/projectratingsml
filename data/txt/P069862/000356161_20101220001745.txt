                                Restructuring Memo
                     Extension of Closing Date and Reallocation

1. The closing date for People's Republic of China, Agricultural Technology Transfer
   Project, Loan 4773-CHA, P069862 will be extended from December 31, 2010 until
   December 31, 2011. The extension has been requested by the Ministry of Finance in
   a letter, dated July 19, 2010. This will be the first extension of the project. The
   extension is being processed with a delay of 5 months due to a change in task team
   leader responsibility, which took place in late October 2010, and a subsequent
   supervision mission in November 2010 to further confirm the rationale for project
   restructuring.

2. Summary of project implementation progress and justification. The Agricultural
   Technology Transfer Project is an innovative learning project that tests various
   models of public private partnerships aimed at generating, transferring and applying
   agriculture technology. Over the past 5 years, the project has yielded very useful
   lessons on the public funding of public goods that support parallel private sector
   investments for innovation and market integration of small famers and, in some cases,
   on how the government can contract private entities to deliver public goods.

3. Overall, the project is making good and steady progress towards achieving its Project
   Development Objective (PDO) and the PDO will be continue to be achievable.
   About 116 innovative sub-projects are being supported by the project, of which a
   large number is expected to be completed with the six months or so. Disbursement
   currently stands at 81 percent and about US$18 million remain to be disbursed. Full
   disbursement of all remaining loan funds is expected at the time of the new Closing
   Date of December 31, 2011.

4. PDO and IP rating remain moderately satisfactory, and this rating is maintained after
   the completion of a supervision mission in November 2010. In the past, weak project
   management capacity and performance in Shaanxi province, which is the biggest
   province in terms of overall investment, had resulted in implementation delays of
   about one year in this province, and while changes in PMO management have been
   made, these have not yet resulted in the expected improvement in project
   management that would justify a fully satisfactory rating.

5. However, the extension is pursed because significant achievements in promoting
   public-private partnerships have already been made in all four project provinces that
   merit further consolidation and systematic learning and dissemination. Specifically,
   an additional implementation year is needed to fully capitalize on the experiences and
   lessons learned from the project's technological and institutional innovations in a
   more systematic manner and for bigger and more substantial impact across the
   Government's           own          agriculture        development            program.
6. The public private partnerships piloted under the project are successfully reaching out
   to small farmers. Many of the sub-projects financed by the project are expected to
   have resulted in income increases by integrating farmers into high value production
   chains. Because the investment phase for a large number of sub-projects is just about
   to complete, an evaluation of outcomes and a rigorous economic and financial
   analysis still has to be carried by the implementation entities as part of the project's
   learning activities to quantify the aggregate income increases and disaggregate such
   income for enterprises and farmers and by type of investment arrangement. The
   purpose of such analysis is to provide Government with key lessons on aggregate
   income and distributional benefits generated from public investments in such
   partnerships.

7. In addition, the project has adopted a monitoring system that is innovative in itself in
   that it is different from the Government's regular output/ input based monitoring.
   Some more time is required to complete the ongoing M&E work of the diverse
   investments and institutional arrangements piloted. With an additional year of
   implementation time, it is expected that the M&E system can fully materialize to
   produce empirical information on income, environmental impacts, technology
   adoption rates, farmer satisfaction with cooperative arrangements, and the
   effectiveness of agriculture public-private partnerships. Once completed, it is
   expected that the value of such M&E, along with strengthened M&E capacity, is
   recognized by Government for integration into its own program monitoring.

8. Finally, a number of sub-projects require about six months to be fully completed
   either through completing procurement of important equipment or construction or
   through operation. Among these are a number of flagship sub-projects, such as the a
   vegetable pesticide testing facility for a wholesale vegetable market in Xianyang
   (Shaanxi), which is one of the most important vegetable markets in North-West China
   supplying vegetable for about 10 million people; a farmer cooperative in Xianyang
   that produces organic apples for international markets, which is expected to yield
   important lessons for farmer organizations on how to manage and access markets for
   high value organic food production.

9. The November supervision has worked closely with the Central Project Management
   Office in SOCAD on an agreed action plan to ensure the timely and satisfactory
   completion of all remaining sub-projects as well as the project's M&E, learning and
   dissemination task.

10. In addition, to the extension of the closing date, proceeds for People's Republic of
    China, Agriculture Technology Transfer Project, Loan 4773-CHA, P069862 will be
    reallocated as follows:

11. The proposed reallocation and amendment of the disbursement percentages has been
    discussed and re-confirmed with SOCAD during the November supervision mission
    (and is documented in the recent aide memoire) and is based on earlier discussions
    between SOCAD and the Bank on adjustments to the implementation program. The
    reallocation will also eliminate an overdraw in Category 2.

12. The change in the disbursement percentage under the Consultants Services category
    has been requested in a letter from Ministry of Finance, dated September 9, 2009.
    This amendment has not yet been processed and is proposed to be included as part of
    this restructuring. The rationale for this change is to allow for the financing of taxes
    under this category and thus simplify administrative processing of consultant
    recruitments under the project. It has been confirmed that the increase of the
    disbursement percentage under Category 4 will not be retro-active.

13. There are no outstanding or overdue audit reports for the Project.
