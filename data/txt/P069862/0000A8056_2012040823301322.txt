                         The development objective of the Project would be to develop and test innovative models for agricultural technology transfer and application aimed to generate
                         additional farm income in high value markets with a potential for scaling up. By this way the Project aims to give poor farmers a chance to participate in high value
                         agricultural markets domestically and internationally.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project supported and successfully implemented 108 sub-projects that tested various models of farmer-enterprise and public-private partnership arrangements to promote the
                         transfer of agriculture technology to small-holder farmers in four project provinces (Anhui, Hunan, Heilongjiang and Shaanxi).

                         On average, the supported sub-projects have generated high economic rates of return for farmers, farmer cooperatives as well as private enterprises that partnered with farmers and

                         delivered to support farmer-enterprise partnerships. Substantial implementation experiences have been gained with regard to various institutional and technological innovations in
                         agriculture and agriculture technology transfer models. Given the recent migration trends in rural China, the project had a particular positive impact on women, which comprise the
                         vast majority of the project beneficiaries, as is shown in the project completion statistics.
