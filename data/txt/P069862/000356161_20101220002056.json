The\n            extension is pursed because significant achievements in\n            promoting public-private partnerships have already been made\n            in all four project provinces that merit further\n            consolidation and systematic learning and dissemination.\n            Specifically, an additional implementation year is needed to\n            fully capitalize on the experiences and lessons learned from\n            the project's technological and institutional\n            innovations in a more systematic manner and for bigger and\n            more substantial impact across the Government's own\n            agriculture development program. In addition, the project\n            has adopted a monitoring system that is innovative in itself\n            in that it is different from the Government's regular\n            output/ input based monitoring."}, "docdt": "2010-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
