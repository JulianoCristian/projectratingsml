satisfactory; risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: the project effectively demonstrated that\n            technology barriers caused by fragmented production and\n            small farm size can be overcome through partnership\n            arrangements between companies and farmers or farmer\n            associations. Technology adoption constraints caused by\n            fragmented production and small farm size can be overcome\n            with innovative partnership arrangements. Adding value in\n            agricultural production with a fair distribution of benefits\n            needs effective organizational arrangements. Successful\n            public-private partnership needs clear selection procedures,\n            outcome definition and contractual arrangements. Public\n            goods can be successfully delivered through\n            public-private-partnerships. Public support can address\n            market failures and help generate a critical mass of raw\n            material production with different stakeholders.
