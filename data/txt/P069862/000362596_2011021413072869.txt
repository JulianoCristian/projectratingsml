          your request. Accordingly, the Loan Agreement is amended as follows:

                 The Closing Date in Section 2.03 of the Loan Agreement shall be amended to read
          "December 31, 2011".

                     The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended to read as
          set out in the Attachment to this letter.

                  Except as specifically amended in this letter, all other terms and conditions of the
          Loan Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
