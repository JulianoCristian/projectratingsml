                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has made good and steady progress towards achieving its development objective since the Supervision Mission of May 2010. About 120 sub-projects that test various
                         models of public-private partnerships to promote agriculture technology transfer to smallholder farmers are now being supported by the Project. About 90 percent of the Project
                         investments are expected to be fully completed soon and all sub-projects are expected to be fully operational within the next six months.
