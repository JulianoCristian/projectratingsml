pre-investment study of the Weiyuan gas field in order to\n            design a rehabilitation program that will maximize recovery\n            of gas reserves.  The project would include: (i) acquisition\n            of reservoir and production data using modern technology;\n            (ii) a comprehensive diagnostic study including an\n            assessment of key reservoir parameters, well completion and\n            production methods, reservoir simulation and well\n            stimulation, and related pilot operations, as well as the\n            design of an optimum development program; (iii) essential\n            equipment and instrumentation for data collection and\n            production; and (iv) training to strengthen East China\n            Petroleum Institute (ECPI) and South West China Petroleum\n            Institute (SWCPI) and to assist Ministry of Petroleum\n            Industry (MOPI) in undertaking a diagnostic study of the\n            petroleum education requirements at the national level.\n            Notwithstanding the low permeability and porosity of the\n            reservoir, there is a reasonable prospect that an additional\n            10 billion cubic meters (BCM) of gas (10 million toe) might\n            still be recovered."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
