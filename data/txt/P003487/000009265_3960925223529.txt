SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on China
Weivuan Gas Field Technical Assistance Prolect (Loan 2580-CHA)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on China - Weiyuan Gas
Field Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2580-CiA)" prepared by the East Asia
Regional Office, with Part II prepared by the Borrower.
The project was designed to establish a step by step rethodology for
determining how to rehabilitate older gas fields. Its central purpose was to
undertake a diagnostic study to determine whether the Borrower's interest in
investing $200 million to increase production was technically and economically
sound.  The study showed that the !mvestment would not produce the desired
results.
The project met all its major objectives.   It established a
methodology for studying and evaluating gas field rehabilitation projects, and
was instrumental in the enhancement of a national petroleum training and research
program. The performance of the project is rated as satisfactory, institutional
development as substantial and sustainability as likely.
The PCR quality is satisfactory.   The project will be audited
together with the first four projects completed earlier in the oil and gas
sectors in China.

WEIYUAN GAS FELD TECENICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2580-CHA)
PROJECT COMLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Weiyuan Gas Field
Technical Assistance Project in China, for which Loan 2580-CHA in the amount of $25
million was approved on June 11, 1985. The loan was closed, after three one-year
extensions of the closing date, on June 30, 1992. The last disbursement was made on
July 31, 1992. The undisbursed amount, $7,433.65, was canceled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Energy Division of China
and Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation, Summary, Parts I and IED and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank mission in February
1993, and is based, inter alia, on the President's Report; the Loan and Project Agreements;
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

WEIYSAN GAS FIELD TECNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2580CHA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.         The ultimate pret objective was to assist the Southwest Mining Distict
(SWMD) to arrest production dedline in an economical and effective manner. Toward this
end, the thrust of the project was directed at the tansfer of specalized modern technology
and institution bulding of SWMD in the following measures: (a) implementation of a
diagnosdc study of the Weiyuan gas field to gain a better understanding of the reservoir,
including verification of the gas reserve estimate, and investigate the feasibility of enhanced
gas recovery techniques and related investment that would maximize economic recovery
of gas reserves and minimize the risks associatd with this program; and (b) maintaining
gas production while the study was being undertn through the import of critcal
equipment. In addition, the project aimed at strengthening petroleum education at the
natonal level (Pa I, para 3).
Ipolementation Experience
2.          The project was implemented satisfactorily with a 10 percent cost overrun
in US dollar terms. Completion of the project in 1992 represented a four-year delay from
the apprail estimate. The extended delays could be attributable to a number of reasons,
including:  (a) protacted contract negotiations with international consultants and
subsequent revision in the scope of the diagnostic study, which were, in part, caused by
insufficient clarity in the Terms of Reference in defining the scope of work and inadequate
understanding between the project entity and the consultants (Part I, para. 8); (b) the
reservoir conditions were more complex than appraisal expectation, which necessitated the
drilling of six mote wells than the appraisal estimate for data collection (Part I, par  8);
and (c) extended delays in the p ent of mode-n equipment for data colection and
gas production as a result of intperience of the project entity in Bank projects,
cumbersome approval procedures and fragmentation of responsibilities among various
government agencies (Part I, para. 7).
Resut
3.          The main project objectives, transfer of technology and institution building
of SWMD, were achieved successfully through overseas training of SWMD staff as well



- iii -
as on-the-job training by intemational consultants for the diagitostic study, well service
contractors and suppliers associated with the supply of critical modern equipment and
instrumentation. Further, the diagnostic study achieved the objective of gaining a better
understanding of the Weiyuan reservoir. While the study largely confirmed the gas reserve
in place estimated by SWMD, it concluded that the rapid early development of the field
has resulted in irreversible damage to wie reservoir and there was litfle possibility of an
economically viable full-scale rcuscitation of the field as originally proposed by SWMD
(Part I, para. 9). Thus, the implementation of the comprehensive techno-economic
diagnostic study before embarldng on a full scale redevelopment program, such as
orginally prmposed, was filly justified and avoided considerable expenses and wasted
efforts. Separately, the exchange trining program arranged between the East China and
Southwest China Institutes and selected overseas universities was successful, and resulted
in contacts with foreign institutions being established (Part 1, para. 10).
Sustainalbility
4.          Although the diagnostic study has shown that some gas production could be
maintained, currendy available techniques are unlikely to recover sufficient gas to justify
a large-scale resuscitation of the Weiyuan gas field (Part I, para. 9). Study techniques and
experience gained, however, will be useful in assessing and producing other gas fields.
Further, the petroleum education component, including international exchange program,
was considered to be successful. The good practices learned under this component would
be replicated by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), to further strengthen
petroleum education in China. Moreover, the results of the study on the long-term training
and research program in petroleum technology would be incorporated in CNPC's plan to
build up the institution capability of the petroleum sector (Part I, para. 14).
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.           in retrospect, the project schedule expected at the time of project appraisal
was overly optimistic in view of Borrower's lack of experience in Bank-financed projects.
Further, to avoid implementation delays, the terms of reference for consultant services
should have defined clearly the scope of work. Finally, procurement procedures should
be streamlined as much as possible to avoid protracted delays.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.   Project Identity
Name                Weiyuan Gas Field Technical Assistance Project
Loan Number               2580-CHA
RVP Unit            East Asia and Pacific Region
Country             China
Sector            : Energy
Subsector         : Natural Gas
B.   Backgrounad
1.          Coal will inevitably continue to be the dominant energy source for China,
accounting for about 75 percent of its commercial energy consumption. Oil is another
significant source of commercial energy (17 percent) for the country. However, despite
China's high natural gas potential, the share of gas in commercial energy has remained
very small (2 percent). Gas exploration and development has been inadequate mainly due
to past neglect, financing constraints, and limited access to advanced technologies. Natural
gas production in China amounted to 15.4 billion cubic meters (BCM), in 1991. About
50 percent of the gas production is nonassociated gas, 90 percent of which is located in
Sichuan Province. Most of the major gas-producing fielis in China are considered mature
and many of these fields have already experienced natural production decline. In 1985,
gas production in China was 12.9 BCM, representing a decline of 11 percent from its peak
production (14.5 BCM) in 1979. The shortage of gas became a major impediment to
economic growth and remedial measures were urgently needed to arrest the decline of gas
production. It was at this critical juncture that the Chinese government sought the
assistance of the Bank in the development of the gas sector.
2.          The Weiyuan gas field was discovered in 1964 and gas production began in
1968. The gas producer, Southwest Minting District (SWMD), estimated gas reserves
originally in place in the Weiyuan field at 40 BCM. Peak annual production of 3.7 million
cubic meters (MMCM) per day was achieved in 1976. Since then, production had fallen
rapidly; by 1985, production fell (by 82 percent) to an average of only 0.8 MMCM per
day due to the influx of water into the producing wells. Cumulative gas production from



-2 -
the field only amounted to 12 BCM (or 30 percent of gas-in-plae). Based on the
assumption that an additional 10 BCM could be still be recovered, SWMD's initial request
for Bank assistance was to support a field-wide rehabilitation program of over $200 milion
to afrest production decline. However, in view of the complexity of the reservoir and
difficult operating conditions, the Bark recommended that extreme caution be exercised
to reduce technical and economic risks through a step-by-step approach. Prior to making
an investment decision on a major rehabilitation program, the Bank suggested, and SWmID
agreed, that a diagnostic study be undertaken under the project. This approach could avoid
unnecessary investment and, if the results are positive, the study would be followed in the
second phase by a major investment program to secure a higher level of gas recovery from
the Weiyuan field.
C.   Project Objectives and Description
3.          The ultimate project objective was to assist the Southwest Mining Distrct
(SWMD) to arrest production decline in an economical and effective manner. Toward this
end, the thrust of the project was directed at the transfer of specialized modern technology
and institution building of SWMD in the following measures: (a) implementation of a
diagnostic study of the Weiyuan gas field to gain a better understanding of the reservoir,
including verification of the gas reserve estimate, and investigate the feasibility of enhanced
gas recovery techniques and related investment that would maximize economic recovery
of gas reserves and minimize the risks associated with this program; and (b) maintaining
gas production while the study was being undertake  through the import of ctical
equipment. In addition, the project aimed at strengthening petroleum education at the
national level.
4.          The project included: (a) the acquisition of reservoir and production data
using modern technology; (b) a comprehensive diagnostic study including an assessment
of key reservoir parameters, well completion and production methods, reservoir simulation
and well stimulation, and related pilot operations, as well as the design of an optimum
development program; (c) essential equipment and instrumentation for data collection and
production; and (d) training and education to strengthen ECPI and SWCPI and to assist
MOPI (later CNPC) in undertaking a study of the petroleum education requirements at a
national level.
D.   ProJect Design and Organization
5.          The project was designed to assist SWMD in evaluating the feasibility of
enhanced gas recovery techniques and related rehabilitation program at the Weiyuan gas
field, which encountered technologically complex production problems. As noted above,
a step-by-step approach was adopted, whereby immediate assistance under the project
included the implementation of a comprehensive techno-economic diagnostic study instead
of a full-scale rehabilitation program. This approach preved to be prudent and appropriate
in light of the findings of the study that indicated that there is little possibility of an
economically viable full-scale resuscitation of the field as originally proposed by SWMD.



- 3 -
6.          The project was mainly implemented by SWMD with the assistance of
international consultants. A project implementation unit (PIM) was set up by SWMD under
a deputy director to facilitate coordination, monitoring and reporting under the project.
'fhe ed-a-tion department of the former MOi-I, currently the China National Petroleum
Cor riflon (CNPC), which was responsible for the implementation of the petroleum
educaaon component, also formed a PIU under a deputy director.
7.          However, considerable delays in procurement were initially encountered, in
part due to lack of experience with Bank procedures, fragmentation of responsibilities
among various Chinese agencies, and cumbersome internal clearance procedures. As in
the case of other onshore petroleum bureaus, SWMD did not have the authority to procure
directly Bank-financed goods and services, nor was it allowed to process Bank loan
disbursement applications directy. Internationalprocurement under the project was carried
out through an agent authorized by the governreent and disbursement applications were
centrally processed by CNPC. The above institutional arrangements were not conducive
to efficiency and contributed to delays in procurement and disbursements. These delays
were exacerbated by inadequate coordination among the concerned agencies.
E.   Project Implementation
8.         The project was implemented satisfactorily with a 10 percent cost overrun.
However, completion of the project was delayed by about four years due to a number of
reasons, including: (a) a slow process in soliciting and evaluation of bids, in part due to
the lack of experience of SWMD and inadequate interagency coordination noted above;
(b) protracted contract negotiations with international consultants and subsequent revision
in the scope of the diagostic study, which were, in turn, caused by insufficient clarity in
the Terms of Reference in defining the scope of work and inadequate understanding
between the project entity and the consultants; and (c) the reservoir conditions were more
complex than appraisal expectation, which necessitated the drilling of six more wells than
the appraisal estimate for data collection. In retroWect, the implementation schedule
envisaged at the time of project apprisal was overly optimistic.
F.   Project Results
9.          Diagnostic Study. The transfer of spedalized modern technology and
institution building of SWMD, two of the project objectives, were achieved successfully
through on-the-job training by international consultants, well service contractors and
suppliers associated with the supply of cntical modern equipment and instrumentation.
Further, the diagnostic study achieved the objective of gaining a better understanding of
the Weiyuan reservoir. While the study largely confirmed the gas reserve in place
estimated by SWMD, it concluded that the rapid early development of the field has
resulted in irreversible damage to the reservoir and there was little possibility of an
economically viable full-scale resuscitation of the field as originally proposed by SWMD.
Nevertheless, in view of the substantial amount of in-place gas reserves that have not yet
been produced, the study recommended the implementation of a pilot program to test a
number of techniques to enhance gas production in the Weiyuan gas field. These



-4 -
techniques, if shown to be viable, could be applied in a larger-scale gas production
scheme.
10.         Petroleum Education. The objective of strengthening petroleum education
in china was achieved under the project. International consultants assisted the former
MOPL, currently the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) in the development
of a national petroleum training and research program. In addition, under the petroleum
education component, 424 overseas training visits were made by professors, lecturers and
graduate students. Of this total, 28 were for intemational conferences, 44 for one-month
study, 24 for PhD degree study, 19 for MSc degree study, 139 for 3-4 month advanced
study, and 170 for 6-8 month cocperative research. The East China and Southwest China
Petroleum Institute's exchange program resulted in useful contacts being established with
overseas institutions.
11.         Project Costs and Financing. The total cost of the project was $32.94
million equivalent, representing 10 percent above the appraisal estimate of $30 million
equivalent. All of the cost overrun ($2.94 raillion equivalent) was related to local
expenditures, including $1 million for the diagnostic study, $1.04 million for the driling
of six additional in-fill wells for new logging data acquisition and $0.9 million for the
purchase of equipment and the setup of two compressor stations. The total foreign
exchange expenditure of the project was the same as appraisal estimate; the cost savings
from the diagnostic study and data collection were used to finance additional critical
equipment for maintaining gas production. Salient highlights of the project costs and
financing are given in Part III, Table 5.
12.         Loan Allocation. The original and actual loan allocation is shown in
Table 5, Part m. Unaocated amounts ($3 million) and savings from foreign exchange
cost (about $4 million) of the diagnostic study and data collection were largely reallocated
to increased equipment (gas compressors) for arresting gas production decline.
Consequently, the loan allocation for equipment was about 93 percent higher than the
appraisal estimate.
13.         Enviromnental Impact. As the project is basically a technical assistance
project involving a study, education and taining, there is minimal environmental impact.
G.   Project Sustaiabiity
14.         Although the diagnostic study has shown that some gas production could be
maintained, currently available techniques are unlikely to recover sufficient gas to justify
a large-scale resuscitation of the Weiyuan gas field. Study techniques and experience
gained, however, will be useful in assessing and producing other gas fields. Further, the
petroleum education component, including international exchange program, was considered
to be successful. The good practices leamed under this component would be replicated by
CNPC to further strengthen petroleum education in China. Moreover, the results of the
study on the long-term training and research program in petroleum technology would be
incorporated in CNPC's plan to build up the institution capability of the petroleum sector.

H.   SWMD Finances
a5.         Salient features of SWMD's finances over the period 1985-92 are
summarized in Anm.xL.- During 1985-88 (the financial forecast period at project
appraisal), SWMD's actual expenses were slightly higher than appraisal projections. These
adverse impacts were more than offset by its actual production and average gas prices
which were largely higher than the appraisal estimates. As a result, its actual net income
was higher than the appraisal expectation (by 3 percent in 1986 and 31 percent in 1988).
On the other hand, its average self-financing ratio during this period was 63 percent, which
was 9 percent less than the appraisal estimate of 69 percent. This was because SWMD's
actual investments were substantially higher than anticipated at the time of project
appraisal.
16.         During 1989-92, SWMD's net income declined gradually from a peak of
Y 79 million in 1985 to Y 50 million in 1992, representing a decrease of 37 percent. This
was attributable to rapid increases (by a total of 96 percent) in operating expenses, which
outpaced the increases of average gas prices (by a total of 34 percent) and gas production
(by 2 percent). Its average self-financing ratio during this period decreased to 51 percent.
The rapid rises in the costs of production reflected the increasing financing requirements
for field development and rehabilitation to arrest gas production decline. With a view to
increasing resource mobilization for sector development and providing incentives for
efficient uses of gas, SWMD's natural gas prices are expected to be further adjusted to
allow the gas producer to maintain financial viability.
T.    Bank Performace
17.         The preparation of the project was good, the decision during appraisal to
carry out a detailed study before embarking on an extensive program to rehabilitate the gas
field has proved to be a good decision. Supervision missions were made regularly. The
Bank has reviewed the consultant's report on the diagnostic study and has discussed the
recommendations with the Borrower.
J.    Borrower's Performance
18.         Apart from the early delays in the award of consultancy and equipment
supply contracts, which were due to SWMD's lack of experience of Bank projects and to
the interventions of central authorities, the Borrower performed well, particularly in
carrying out the field work. The preparation of documentation required for project
supervision was well done.
19.         Protracted negotations sessions with consultants' contracts caused inordinate
delays, ultimately necessitating extensions to the closing date of the loan.



- 6-
K.   Project Relationship
20.         The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower was good throughout
the project.
L.   Consultant Services
21.         The consultants, contractors, and suppliers used to carry out the studies
perfomed well and were the key elements in the successful completion of the project. In
addition to carrying out the studies, field work and the supply of the new equipment, they
provided on-the-job training in new techniques and use of the equipment needed for the
transfer of technology required to strengthen SWMD and the Institutes.
22.         The pnncipal consultants were responsible for the identification and hiring
of other consultants for engineering and other studies for which the principal consultants
did not have the expertise. The Borrower felt that the scope of work was too large and
vared for only one consultant and perhaps could have been accomplished more
satisfactorily by selecting a number of firms to focus on smaller components of the project.
23.         The consultants chosen to oversee and implement the education and
exchange program did a very credible job. The programs, professors and instructors
chosen to carry out the work drew high praise from the Borrower and will stand as an
example of hov' to implement similar education programs in the future.
M.   Project Documentation and Data
24.         The legal agreement proved adequate for the efficient conduct of the project.
The President's report provided a good framework for project implementation, while the
project supervision reports provided a comprehensive history and progress of project
implementation.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM
BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Projed Result
1.          The project objectives were largely achieved as the geological complexities
of the Weiyuan gas field were better understcod as a result of the studies. SWMD's
equipment and technology were upgraded through procurement of equipment and training
offered by the various sevice contractors and the consultants.
2.          Since July 1987, 33 engineers were sent abroad for technical training. The
training during the diagnostic study covered geology, logging, laboratory analysis, single-
well analysis, single-well simulation, reservoir simulation, history match and production
engineering. Software provided by the consultant would continue to play a positive role
in the development of Weiyuan gas fild and similar gas fields with bottom or edge water.
World Bank Performance
3.          As SWMD lacked experience in this type of project, the Bank staff made
a significant contribution to the implementation of the project. Assistance was given by
the Bank staff in preparing terms of reference, reviewing of technical specifications on the
procurement of equipment, introducing methods for evaluation of bids and financial
mnanagement. The supervision missions were instrumental in maintaining the progress of
the progress.
SWMD and SPA's Performance
4.          SWMD was very conscientious and responsible for the implementation of
the project.  The Loan Project Office of SWMD played an important role in
implementation of the project. The Project Leading Group of SPA was active in deciding
terms of reference of the diagnostic study, to confirm the bidding evaluation report and
results.
