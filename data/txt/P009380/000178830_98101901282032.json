       regulator structure equipped with radial gates and flap\n            gates; (c) construction of one major and 30 minor drainage\n            structures equipped with flap gates, and the improvement of\n            an existing drainage outlet; (d) improvement of 110 miles of\n            natural channels and the excavation of 6 miles of new\n            channels; (e) improvement of 9 miles of existing roads and\n            the construction of 9 miles of new roads for access to the\n            main project works; (f) installation of about 1,100 low-lift\n            pumps to raise water from the channels to adjacent\n            farmlands; (g) provision of workshops, equipment, and\n            vehicles for maintenance of civil works and pumps; (h)\n            construction of offices and housing for project staff; (i)\n            transportation (field vehicles, motorcycles and bicycles),\n            and agricultural equipment (hand sprayers, grain dryers)
