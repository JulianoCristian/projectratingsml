country by\n            providing the beneficiaries with modern equipment and\n            methodologies to improve their distribution, planning, and\n            design capability.  Specifically, the project consists of\n            four distribution studies.  These studies aim to (i) improve\n            the sector organization and coordination for distribution of\n            electricity, (ii) evaluate the quality and reliability of\n            electricity service and the origin and level of losses,\n            (iii) design and implement methodologies for least-cost\n            planning and define standards for materials and equipment;\n            and (iv) recommend procedures for improving the\n            utilities' operational planning, budgeting and\n            inventory control.  In addition, the project includes (b) a\n            metering program designed to provide data for studies under\n            (a) above and to improve system expansion planning, rate\n            design and billing; and, finally, (c) a training program\n            which will include fellowships, courses and arrangements\n            with foreign distribution companies for on-the-job training.\n            The project will provide the Government with recommendations\n            for increasing the efficiency of the utilities in charge of\n            distribution services."}, "docdt": "1986-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
