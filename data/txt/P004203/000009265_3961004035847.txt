MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR AN EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao
PDR) for SDR 13.7 million (US$19.0 million equivalent) to help finance an
Education Development Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 40 years. Grant cofinancing would be provided by the
Government of the Swiss Confederation through the Swiss Development Cooperation
(SDC) in the amount of SwF 15.0 million (US$9.8 million equivalent), and by the
Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Norway in the amount of NOK
21.0 million (US$3.0 million equivalent).
2.       Country/Sector Background.  The Lao People's Democratic Republic ranks
among the least developed countries in the world, with an estimated 1991 per
capita income of US$230. Following a decade of central planning, the Government
initiated in 1985 a program of reforrs to support the transition to a market-
oriented economy. These reforms have helped stimulate real GDP growth rates of,
most recently, 6.6% in 1990 and 4% in 1991. The potential for sustained growth
is, however, constrained by a lack of managerial and technical skills, and low
labor productivity.   To address these deficiencies, the Government and IDA
recognize the need to strengthen the aducational system as the cornerstone of a
comprehensive human resource development strategy. Priority is being given to
improving the quality and efficiency of primary and lower secondary education,
in view of the well-established social and economic benefits to be obtained from
investing in basic education, and the fact that middle- and higher-level training
are most effective when built on broad competencies acquired through a solid
foundation of general education. The Government is also taking steps to develop
appropriate policies and strategies for future investments in upper secondary,
vocational-technical and higher education.
3.       Current enrollments in primary and lower secondary education correspond
to gross enrollment rates of about 100% and 30%, respectively, with females
accounting for over 40% of total enrollments. While these figures represent
impressive gains since 1975, the quality of education is extremely poor. About
60% of primary and 40% of lower secondary school buildings are reported to be
severely dilapidated. All need basic classroom furniture, and there is an acute
lack of instructional materials. Curricular programs are outdated and poorly
organized.   Nearly a third of the teaching force has less than a secondary
degree, while many trained teachers leave the profession each year due to
difficult working conditions, including low or even unpaid salaries.   Most
primary students do not have access to schools offering the full five-year cycle,
and selection examinations are inappropriately used as early as at the end of
first grade. All these factors contribute to high repetition and dropout rates,
especially at the primary level, where repeaters constitute 30% of total
enrollments, and only 30% of entrants survive to the final grade of the cycle.
4.       Loosely-defined administrative structures, with only minimal links to
the central Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES), have not allowed national
authorities to address inefficiencibs or inequities that might be corrected fron
a more global management of limited resources.   Government-wide reforms are
underway to enhance the authority of central ministries through, among others,
recentralization of revenue collection and expenditure control, and designation



- 2 -
of local offices as ministry field services acting within the framework of
national policies. Implementation of these reforms will require building up the
currently limited staff capacities at all administrative levels.   Adequate
financing for the sector also needs to be assured, especially in view of the
declines in the share of education from 15% to 8% of the public recurrent budgets
between 1985 and 1988.
5.       Lesson, Learned from Previous IDA Involveyent.  IDA assistance to the
Lao PDR has consisted of sixteen credits totalling about US$316 million,
including a Second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC2) to support continued
reforms in the economic management system. The PCRs and PPAR of five completed
proiects highlight the importance of good technical preparation and the critical
role of IDA supervision in the Lao PDR where project skills are limited. Grant
funding of about US$900,000 equivalent was thus obtained from the Japan Policy
and Human Resources Development Fund administered by IDA to support detailed
project preparation, and intensive IDA supervision would be undertaken during
project implementation. The National Polytechnic Institute (NPI) Project (Cr.
2001-IA), the first operation in the education sector, aims to train engineers
and managers for the productive sectors of the economy. The NPI experience to
date points to the need for incentives to contain the turnover of project staff,
and to streamline the decision-making and administrative procedures involved in
implementir.g the project.   These issues would be addressed through reforms
supported by SAC2, and by project actions to promote improved employment
conditions for sector staff and to clearly delineate lines of authority and
responsibilities in project management and implementation.
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.   Following the approval of the NPI
Project in 1989, the Government requested IDA assistance to develop a program for
overall sector reform. IDA's main contribution to these discussions has been to
help sharpen the definition of sector priorities, and underscore the need to
balance desired objectives with proposals that are pedagogically effective and
financially viable.  IDA has also encouraged an approach that would promote
sector-wide policies and planning, and strengthen the coordination of development
activities in the sector. IDA involvement in the sector would further complement
the reforms being supported by SAC2 to establish systems of financial control and
accounting, reduce the civil service while upgrading salaries and employment
conditions, and redefine local government authorities and structures.   The
project would support implementation of these reforms in the education sector,
and would help ensure that sector requirements are taken into account as these
reforms are elaborated.
7.       The objectives of IDA's country assistance strategy are to support:  (a)
Government efforts to move to a market economy and maintain macroeconomic
stability; (b) development of the physical capital needed to expand production;
(c) sustainable use of the country's natural resources; and (d) human resource
development, both to increase labor productivity and alleviate 1.3verty. In line
with the human resource development objective, IDA has established solid
relationships in the education sector through its policy dialogue, sector
analysis and advice, and the technical assistance and training provided during
project preparation. The proposed project would represent a major increase in
IDA lending to education, in recognition of the importance of the sector for the
country's social and economic development. IDA has also mobilized substantial
cofinancing for the proposed project, and has sought to coordinate its activities
with other multilateral and bilateral donor agencies to help ensure a sustained
and coherent development effort in the sector.

8.       Proiect Objectives.  The project would aim to address I mediate needs
for quility imrrovement in basic education,  and establish tle policy and
institutional  frameworks  for long-term sector development.    Its  specific
objectives would be to: (a) improve student and teacher performance iv primary
and lower secondary schools; (b) develop mechanisms for assuring the provision
of apprcpriate primary and secondary school facilities; (c) promote efficiency
in the allocation and use of resources by devaloping skills in sector planning,
monitoring and evaluation; and (d) enable more effective delivery of education
services by strengthening educational administration and management.
9.       Proiect  DescriRtion.    The  project  would  include  the  following
components:  (a) Curriculum Development and Pedagogical Support (38% of total
project cost), including (i) development of new curricula and instructional
materials for primary and lower secondary education, (ii) instructional materials
printing and distribution, (iii) training of teachers and provision of in-school
pedagogical guidance, (iv) a pilot project to test a model of professional
support networks among neighboring primary schools, and (v) a study on Lao
language teaching; (b) School Infrastructure (43%), including (i) reconstruction
of primary and lower secondary schools, (ii) creation of Provincial Units for
Construction Assistance to provide material and technical support to communities
in primary school construction, and (iii) development of capacities in the NOES
School Construction Service to plan and manage the investment program for school
construction; (c) Sector Planning. Monitoring and Evaluation (4%), including (i)
establishment of systems of data collection and analysis to support management
and strategic sector planning, and (ii) analysis of factors affecting educational
outcomes, including gender-specific issues; and (d) Educational Administration
And Management (15%), including (i) strengthening of MOES capacities in financial
and personnel management, and preparation of plans for revised administrative
structures and a staff development program for the NOES, (ii) institutional
assessment of provincial, district and school administrations, and training of
staff at these levels, and (iii) assistance to the MOES Project Support Unit
(PSU) which would provide essential services to facilitate project
implementation. To carry out these activities, the project would finance civil
works, furniture, equipment, instructional materials, training, technical
assistance, and project management and operations.
10.      Project Imslementation.  The NOES would be the executing agency for the
project, which would be implemented over a six-year period from July 1, 1993 to
June 30, 1999. Day-to-day implementation would be the responsibility of HOES
departments or units as part of their regular line functions. Working groups,
comprising key staff from all departments involved in a particular component,
would ensure proper coordination and smooth implementation of activitie. related
to that component. Overall project coordination and policy matters would be the
responsibility of a Project Supervision and Coordination Committee chaired by the
First Vice-Minister of Education, with the PSU serving as Committee secretariat.
11.      The  total cost of the project  is estimated at US$37.5  million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$24.0 million, and taxes and
duties estimated at US$1.0 million equivalent. The proposed IDA credit of SDR
13.7 million (US$19.0 million equivalent) would finance, net of taxes and duties,
about 52% of total project costs, including 65% of foreign exchange and 27% of
local costs. The Swiss grant of SwF 15 million (US$9.8 million equivalent) would
finance, net of taxes and duties, about 27% of total project costs, including 24%
of foreign exchange and 33% of local costs.  The Norwegian grant of NOK 21
million (US$3.0 million equivalent) would finance, net of taxes and duties, about



- 4 -
8% of total project costs, including 11% of foreign exchange and 2% of local
costs. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in the Lao PDR are presented in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
11571-LA, is being distributed separately.
12.      Project Sustainability.   The project would support a wide range of
activities to build technical and managerial skills at all levels of the
educational administration.   These activities,  including organization and
management analysis, extensive staff training, and monitoring and evaluation,
would help develop the institutional capacities required to sustain the expected
improvements in the educational system. The increased financing required to
achieve the sector's development objectives would be sustainable if the following
assumptions are realized: (a) GDP continues to grow at an average rate of 5%
annually; (b) between 19% and 22% of the public recurrent budget is allocated to
education; and (c) by year 2000, the average number of students per teacher is
increased from 28 to 33, and from 13 to 25 at the primary and secondary levels,
respectively. The annual recurrent expenditure requirements for the sector would
correspond to between 2.5* and 3.0% of GDP--targets judged to be both reasonable
and attainable, given the 1980s average of 3.3% for low-income Asian countries,
and the stated priority given to education in the country's development agenda.
13.      Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Goven-ment provided assurances
that:   (a) project implementing units would be staffed in accordance with
personnel complements and schedules satisfactory to IDA; (b) annual work programs
and timetables for project implementation would be furnished to IDA for approval,
and semi-annual project performance reviews would be conducted; (c) a mid-term
review would be heid in April 1996 to consider modifications to implementation
targets or the project design as would be deemed necessary; and (d) annual budget
reviews would be held and IDA would be given the opportunity to comment on
budgetary allocations to the sector prior to submission of the final budget.
14.      Environmental Aspects. The project is not expected to have any negative
environmental impact. In the new primary school curriculum to be developed by
the project, an integrated sciences subject called "The World Around Us" would
encourage understanding of the environment and a commitment to its preservation;
environmental education would also be integrated into the secondary education
sciences curricula. School designs would minimize requirements for increasingly
scarce timber and utilize appropriate technologies to provide durable facilities
while protecting the environment.   Technical specifications in civil works
bidding documents would explicitly prohibit the use of building materials
containing asbestos in the construction of project schools and other facilities.
15.      Program Objective Categories. The project would improve the quality of
basic education, which leads to increased overall productivity and growth, and
raises the welfare of the poor directly through the income gains and greater
opportunities afforded by a better education. Analysis of gender issues in
education would be undertaken in order to identify appropriate strategies for
ensuring equal access to educational opportunities for women. With respect to
staff development activities for educational administrators, efforts would be
made to identify qualified women who could be trained to assume positions of
greater responsibility. Non-governmental organizations and local communities



- 5 -
have been consulted throughout projecc preparation, particularly with regard to
school construction, and would be involved in project implementation.
16. Project Benefits. The project would help ensure that sector development
is grounded on a solid foundation of quality basic education, and would realize
long-term benefits by developing the institutional capacities needed for greater
self-reliance in the design and management of educational development. By the
end of the project in 1999, an estimated 26,000 primary and lower secondary
teachers remaining in the system would stand to benefit from higher salaries and
improved working conditions.  About 785,000   tudents projected to be enrolled at
these levels would benefit from the qualitative improvements resultirg from
better-trained and more motivated teachers, new instructional materials and
teaching strategies, and upgraded school facilities. Expanded access is expected
as the system is able to accommodate more students in places formerly occupied
by repeaters, along with improved equity since problems of repetition and dropout
generally affect poorer children. Equity would also be enhanced through a more
balanced redistribution of resources among provinces and districts.
17.      Risks.  The project represents the first Government effort to undertake
a major national reform in the education sector, and faces important risks.
Implementation would involve a diverse set of activities in provinces and
districts throughout the country, and would require extensive coordination by an
executing agency that has limited management capacities. The project would also
be implemented during a period of transition as the Government endeavors to put
in place major reforms in public finance and administration. Actions to address
these risks have been taken on several fronts. The MOES has involved provincial
and district staff in project preparation to generate the local commitment and
sense of ownership that are critical for implementation success. Analysis of
institutional development needs and training of MOES staff were initiated during
project preparation, and would be continued under the project.   The staff
required for project implementation would be assured by the Government, and the
technical assistance to be provided would focus on training these staff. Project
activities would be closely monitored and considerable flexibility built into
project implementation and supervision.  IDA review missions would strive to
identify and resolve implementation problems as they arise, and project
performance reviews would be conducted to adjust or modify the project design as
needed.   Conditionalities under SAC2 would reduce the risk of delays  in
implementing the Government' s overall fiscal and administrative reforms, and the
risk that adequate public resources would not be provided to the sector would be
addressed by requiring the conduct of annual budget reviews.
18.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
