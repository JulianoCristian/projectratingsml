for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: an operation aiming to support the\n            implementation of a major sector reform should include\n            milestones for effective policy implementation, specific\n            provisions or instruments for high level policy dialogue\n            with government authorities and/or mitigation measures in\n            case of delayed or inadequate implementation of the policy\n            or law. This would be particularly relevant in cases where\n            the law has been recently passed, and there are\n            uncertainties about the potential for satisfactory\n            implementation of the legal or regulatory framework. Where\n            the sector consists of a large number of entities which are\n            poorly performing and most likely need to be merged or\n            liquidated, the political ramifications emanating from\n            liquidation could easily jeopardize the sector consolidation\n            process, and where supported, the process could be painful\n            and time-consuming, and the use of internationally reputed\n            consultants could impart transparency and credibility to the\n            process. In order to reach low-income households where\n            literacy rates are low and functional literacy is\n            practically nonexistent, efforts need to be made in the area\n            of social intermediation. Awareness raising and assistance\n            at the community level are therefore essential to improve\n            the likelihood of successful access to rural financial services."}, "docdt": "2011-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
