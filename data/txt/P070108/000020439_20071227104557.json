Capacity Building Project in Mexico The\n            additional loan would help finance scaling-up of project\n            activities relating to the following component: Expanding\n            Financial Services in Rural Marginal Areas. It relates to\n            the first stage additional financing project. The project\n            development objective and design of the Secretaria de\n            Agricultura, Ganaderia, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y\n            Alimentacion (SAGARPA) component continue to be relevant,\n            and remain fundamentally unaltered for the purposes of the\n            additional financing loan. The scale and geographic scope of\n            the SAGARPA component, however, are expanded for the\n            additional financing loan. The SAGARPA component of the\n            Phase I project aims at promoting secure and sustainable\n            financial services in rural marginal areas, through\n            specialized technical assistance and training. There are\n            four main reasons for scaling up this component: (a)\n            uniqueness of the component and the approach to its\n            implementation; (b) highly successful implementation\n            performance and satisfactory development outcome; (c) need\n            to expand the limited initial geographical coverage; and (d)\n            strong government commitment to the scale-up of this component."}, "docdt": "2007-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
