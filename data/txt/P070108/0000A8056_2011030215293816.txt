                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's main objective is to contribute to the integration of low-income people into the national economy, and to the realization of their income generating
                         potential by improving their access to financial services. This is proposed to be achieved by: (a) consolidating the rural financial institutions sector (including
                         setting up an information system and providing training to institutional staff), and enhanced and rigorous supervision of the performance of the participating
                         institutions, at both the principal (CNBV) and auxiliary levels (Confederation and Federations); (b) improving the outreach capacity of the rural financial
                         institutions and evolving newer and relevant financial instruments on the one hand, and providing technical assistance and training to communities in marginal
                         areas to link up with these financial institutions, on the other; and (c) undertaking studies to inform the strategy and policy relating to rural finance.
