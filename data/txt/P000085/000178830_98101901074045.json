Project are to: (a) support rural development; (b)\n            improve the local planning, coordination and work execution\n            capacity; and (c) test the effectiveness of accompanying\n            feeder roads construction with upgrading of some contiguous\n            footpaths. To achieve these objectives, the project will\n            consist of: (a) construction/improvement of; (i) 840 km of\n            feeder roads; and (ii) on a pilot basis, low standard tracks\n            connecting selected remote villages to these feeder roads:\n            It will also include; (b) maintenance of about 2,000 km of\n            feeder roads; (c) procurement of equipment and tools to\n            complete equipping four labor intensive brigades and one\n            bridge brigade and to replace some of the aging existing\n            equipment as well as; (d) technical assistance. The\n            technical assistance component is included; (i) to help SRDR\n            to implement the project and the training program; (ii) to\n            carry out a socio-economic impact study to monitor the\n            growth of traffic and analyze motives for trips generated,\n            assess the medium-term (10 year) needs for feeder roads and\n            monitor the pilot scheme for low cost tracks. The technical\n            assistance will aid DROA with the MTPCH training school in\n            Cotonou and the Equipment Maintenance Division; and (e)\n            prepare for a future project."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
