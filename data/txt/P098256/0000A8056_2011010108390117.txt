                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) has made remarkable implementation progress since the last supervision mission of March 2010. Both the implementation and
                         progress towards achieving its development objective are satisfactory. This is because of the HLP's achievements, in terms of increasing productivity and production, which can be
                         summarized as follow: (a) about 2,134 hectares of new orchards have been established in 11 focus districts, which represents 71.2 percent of the overall target of 3,000 hectares; (b)
                         a total of 13,000 poultry units have been established by women producer groups in 13 districts; (c) a total of 114 veterinary clinics have been privatized and about 75 percent of them
                         are doing well; (d) a total of 382 male horticulture producer groups and 260 female poultry groups have been established and about 22,500 members received training from extension

                         workers; and (e) producer groups have been linked to the export markets through the grape value chain pilot. Farmers are contributing 25 percent of the costs of production, which
                         indicates that they value the quality of services and benefits provided by the project. The farmer field school approach is used to deliver extension services. According to a recent

                         survey, about 99.5 percent of the of participating female poultry producers have adopted the semi-intensive production practice. As a result, poultry mortality has been reduced to
                         only about 11.5 percent. The first batch of 7,000 poultry units established in July 2009 produced approximately 13.3 million, out of the project target of 15 million. Again, over 90
                         percent of the 7000 units have entered the second production cycle without additional support from HLP.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i) The project has fully disbursed the IDA grant of US$21.82 million. However, only US$11.14 million (about 35 percent) of the total Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF)
                         grant of US$34.3 million has been disbursed (i.e., US$22.44 million undisbursed). This is mainly because of the: (a) suspended project activities in two focus districts due to
                         deteriorating security situation: and (b) the reduction of trellising targets due to the infrastructure design and procurement problems. In order to fully disburse the ARTF grant, it was
                         agreed that the project will establish 6,000 additional poultry units, which will restore the original target of 24,000 poultry units.
                         (ii) Procurement performance during the review period is rated as moderately Unsatisfactory. This is because of the: (i) delay in submissions of draft contracts, contract amendments,
                         and extensions of critical contracts; (ii) delay in initiating and issuing of the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the LFP; (iii) low quality and/or incomplete packages of procurement
                         documents submitted to the Bank for clearances; (iv) critical observations noted in the Independent Procurement Review (IPR) report; (v) lack of planning in initiating procurement
                         steps/actions in a timely manner; and (vi) weak contract management capacity. To address these issues, the Bank procurement team will monitor more closely the project's
