The restructuring will modify the\n            project objective to focus more directly on horticulture and\n            livestock productivity, adapt the approach to horticulture\n            and livestock development to the local conditions, and\n            rationalize the project scope and targets in line with\n            available capacity. The project closing date will be\n            extended by two years to accommodate the slow start of\n            project activities.
