                         Implementation Status Overview
                           The Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) made remarkable implementation progress during the last four years of implementation. Both the implementation and progress towards
                         achieving its development objective became satisfactory since January 2011 and remainedas such until the end of its implementation in December 31, 2012. HLP achievements in
                         terms of outputs for the last 12 months of implementation (between January and December 2012) can be summarized by continued promotion of adoption of improved production

                         practices, as shown by the establishment of 1,449 ha of new orchards, a three-fold increase in expected output for the major field investment activity carried out during 2012.

                         Overall, by its closing date HLP achieved most of its targets, thus completing a strong turnaround in performance after its restructure in early 2009. Overall achievements in terms of
                         increasing productivity and production can be summarized as follow: (a) on average, 65 percent of target farmers adopted the introduced improved horticulture practices in focus

                         districts (largely exceeding the 50 percent target); (b) 57 percent of target farmers (all women) adopted the introduced improved poultry husbandry practices in focus districts
                         (exceeding the 60 percent target); (c) 4,952 hectares of new orchards were established in focus districts (representing 141 percent of the final overall target of 3,500 hectares); (d)
                         24,850 semi-intensive poultry egg production and 250 broiler units were established by women producer groups (representing 100 and 104 percent of the respective overall targets);
                         (e) 214 veterinary clinics were privatized (130 percent of the target); and (f) 813 producer groups -445 male horticulture producer groups and 368 female poultry groups- were formed
                         and received training from extension workers (surpassing the 782 target). In addition, the project developed 108 extension messages overall –horticulture and livestock– according to
                         the Farmer Field School (FFS) principles (exceeding the overall target of 60). Farmers receiving TA and investment support in higher productivity activities contributed 25 percent of
                         the investment costs, which indicates that they valued the quality of services and benefits provided by the project, as also expressed by an overall 80% rate in the satisfactory range
                         by beneficiaries for training received.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                           There are no sensitive issues involved in disclosing the ISR. The project had a rocky start and low performance during its original three-year implementation period. It recovered
                         steadily during the added three years of implementation completing an overall performance very much in line with what would be expected for an agricultural project of its final size
                         given the operating environment. It closed on December 31, 2012, after being restructured and receiving a two-year extension in 2009, and a one-year extension and additional
                         financing in 2011. The total funding provided to HLP was US$70.8 million, which included an IDA grant of US$21.5 million and an ARTF grant of US$49.3 million. The IDA grant was
                         fully disbursed, while it is expected that about 96 percent of the ARTF grant will be disbursed by the current end of the grace period on June 30, 2013.
