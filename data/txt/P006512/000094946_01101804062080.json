Key lessons\n            convey that common development objectives between the Bank,\n            and Borrower are critical to pursue project implementation,\n            and, that the Bank should ensure the appropriate\n            implementation arrangements, particularly with implementing\n            agencies. Specifically, in light of active participation of\n            agencies (other than the Implementing Agency) separate\n            Project Agreements, or comparable arrangements could\n            authorize the Bank - should default occur - to suspend\n            disbursements in the absence of compliance. Indeed, direct\n            contractual agreements should be pursued with those entities\n            that have the mandate to fulfill the requirements needed to\n            meet the project's objective, and, the scope of these\n            objectives must not be broader than the scope of the\n            Borrower's operational capacity. Lack of clear leverage\n            by the Bank, precluded the adherence of the implementing\n            agency to both the implementation plan, and agreements\n            (partly also because of the Borrower's financial\n            capacity to undertake such a program on its own). Such being\n            the case, the Bank should seek to expand the stake in the\n            fulfillment of agreed actions, by including communities to\n            form a wider range of stakeholders, who would then be\n            empowered, and, responsible to sustain resources productively."}, "docdt": "2001-10-02T00:00:00Z"}
