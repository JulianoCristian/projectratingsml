The components of this\n            project  are: 1) air, water and soil pollution control and\n            land reclamation investments in CVRD's mining,\n            industrial, rail and port operations throughout the country;\n            2) natural resource investments (reforestation, conservation\n            of natural forest and ecosystems and fauna and flora\n            inventories and conservation); 3) socially oriented\n            investments (municipal improvements and the Amerindian\n            program); 4) studies, research, training, and technical\n            assistance; 5) implementation of a comprehensive corporate\n            environmental information, control, monitoring and auditing\n            system; 6) erosion control in mines and along the railroad;\n            and 7) environmental impact assessments in the project\n            's areas of influence.  The project  will have a\n            positive impact on the environment and especially on the\n            many indigenous peoples who live in the region. Most\n            directly affected by the project are: 1) the Xikrin of\n            Catete, whose reservation borders directly on the CVRD\n            mining concession; 2) the Gaviao of Mae Maria, whose\n            reservation is crossed by the railway line; 3) the Gaujajara\n            of Pindare and Caru, whose reservations lie very near the\n            railway; and 4) the Awa, who will be provided with\n            protection and medical care.  The project  will\n            substantially improve the conditions of indigenous\n            communities, particularly in terms of health care and land\n            demarcation.  Future support for tribal communities should\n            concentrate on the demarcation and protection of reserves,\n            the provision of health services, and educational campaigns\n            designed to prepare tribal communities to better manage,\n            protect and develop the natural and other resources\n            available to them for their own benefit.  The project should\n            also: 1) progressively reduce dependence on its actions and\n            funding, by promoting self reliance and community\n            participation; 2) remove itself from involvement in day to\n            day management of the program by acting through other\n            institutions/organizations; 3) finance actions which have\n            been designed with the active involvement and support of the\n            community; and 4) emphasize actions which will eventually\n            lead to self sufficiency and which incorporate ways to\n            achieve self management and financial self sufficiency in\n            their design."}, "docdt": "1994-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
