The project consists of the following\n            components: 1) air, water and soil pollution control and\n            land reclamation investments in CVRD's mining,\n            industrial, rail and port operations; 2) natural resource\n            investments, which include reforestation and the\n            conservation of natural forest and ecosystems in or around\n            CVRD's installations; and fauna and flora inventories\n            and conservation; 3) socially oriented investments\n            contributing to the alleviation of social problems in\n            ecologically sensitive areas in CVRD's area of\n            influence; 4) studies, research, training, and technical\n            assistance, including a comprehensive impact assessment of\n            the Tubarao industrial port, other pollution monitoring and\n            impact studies; 5) implementation of a comprehensive\n            corporate environmental information, control, monitoring and\n            auditing system; and 6) other sub-projects and studies,\n            aimed at further reducing pollution and environmental degradation."}, "docdt": "1995-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
