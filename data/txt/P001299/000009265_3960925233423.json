They\n            include (a) institutional development which involves the\n            reorientation of Kenya Railway's management toward more\n            commercial practices, introduction of modern management\n            skills, and human resource development; and (b) increased\n            motive power through the purchase of locomotive spare parts,\n            improved locomotive repair and maintenance, and training.\n            Finally, the project provides for (c) improved train\n            operations through organizational changes, minor capital\n            investments, and technical assistance.  The proposed project\n            is expected to benefit Kenya and its railway significantly.\n            The main quantified economic benefit expected to derive from\n            the project are savings in transportation costs."}, "docdt": "1987-05-14T00:00:00Z"}
