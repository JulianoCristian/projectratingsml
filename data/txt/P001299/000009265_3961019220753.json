The\n            objectives of the project were: (i) achieving the needed\n            organizational restructuring and greater commercial\n            orientation on Kenya Railways (KR); and (ii) revitalizing\n            KR's operational performance. The objectives were clear\n            and unambiguous, and at the same time, they left sufficient\n            room for flexibility in project implementation. However, the\n            cultural change required by the first objective was very\n            demanding in the economic environment prevailing in the\n            earlier stages of the project. The second objective aimed at\n            improving financial results and reducing costs by improving\n            KR's operations, primarily by actions to address\n            weaknesses in locomotive maintenance and operational\n            planning. Lessons Learned from the Project: (i) The\n            borrower's commitment to major structural change needs\n            to be positively demonstrated before commencing project\n            implementation; in this case, the  Memorandum of\n            Understanding (MOU) remained a statement of good intentions\n            till the mid-part of project implementation;(ii)important\n            institutional problems, (like, in this case, the locomotive\n            maintenance delivery system) need to be addressed with\n            fundamental reform which could include involvement of the\n            private sector; (iii) client ownership of Technical\n            Assistance (TA), periodical evaluation of TA performance and\n            its linkage with absorption capacity are essential for\n            success; (iv) arrival of TA personnel need to be\n            synchronized with availability of inputs like spares; (v)\n            spares procurement should be in manageable tranches, take\n            into account the need for proprietary sources for critical\n            items, and be done by a specialized agency, in case in-house\n            expertise is inadequate; and (vi) equipment specification\n            should emphasize proven experience in a similar working environment."}, "docdt": "1996-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
