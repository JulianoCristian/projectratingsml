will accord priority\n            to strengthening contractual and bidding practices in the\n            sector. The project will provide a line of credit to the\n            participating banks (PBs) on lending for construction\n            equipment and machinery for the manufacture of building\n            materials and small items of construction equipment. The\n            project will also include a technical assistance program for\n            management development of contracting companies; a technical\n            assistance program for the JCDCI; and staff training and\n            technical assistance for the PBs to help them improve their\n            capacity to evaluate and supervise loans in the sector."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
