Project preparation and appraisal failed to\n            adequately assess the impact of the macro-economic\n            conditions on marketing the sub-loan. The Borrower\n            (Government of Egypt) found it difficult to apply the\n            project's on-lending conditions to the participating\n            banks in isolation of the overall, distorted interest rate\n            and foreign exchange regimes plaguing the banking system at\n            large. Marketing of the sub-loans proved more difficult than\n            expected. On-lending terms were non-competitive as a result\n            of the multi-currency base of the Bank's funds,\n            distortions in interest rate and foreign exchange policies\n            and the almost non-existent demand for Bank loan because of\n            increasing risk of LE devaluation. More significantly, the\n            project proved that full Government ownership of a concrete\n            plan to remove market distortions should be a prerequisite\n            to on-lending in such markets."}, "docdt": "1995-06-20T14:42:05Z"}
