satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the role of loans in addressing climate change became a\n            communication challenge for this operation. The role of\n            policy loans in development finance was a communication\n            challenge with the line ministries responsible for\n            delivering results. Wider and more regular communication\n            about these sorts of issues would help to clarify\n            expectations and intentions, strengthening the partnership.\n            More involvement in monitoring and tracking of indicators at\n            activity level could have sent a stronger signal to\n            technical ministries, provided greater opportunity to steer\n            the policy process, and provided feedback to senior\n            management. The project process brought together policy\n            makers, policy implementers, development partners and other\n            stakeholders in a dialogue process. This was relatively\n            unique at the time for the breadth of issues covered and the\n            number of agencies convened. However, the number of agencies\n            and actions covered also created challenges for\n            communicating clearly about the rationale for the operation,\n            the use of the funds, and the links to the specific policy\n            actions. The time and resource commitment needed to do this\n            successfully should not be underestimated."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
