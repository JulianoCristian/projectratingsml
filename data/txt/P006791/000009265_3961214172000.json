The Cuicuta water supply and sewerage\n            project had two main objectives: (a) to improve and expand\n            water supply, sewerage and storm drainage services in the\n            city of Cucuta; and (b) to help the water company of Cucuta,\n            Empresas Municipales de Cucuta (EMC), develop into a strong\n            multi-service municipal company which could serve as a model\n            for similar companies in other medium-size Colombian cities.\n            Despite the success achieved in executing the Zulia river\n            water supply works, the project's sustainability is\n            still in doubt. Management of the program for construction\n            of the wastewater treatment plant was not always\n            satisfactory. The institutional weakness of the borrower\n            (EMC), the constant interference by local politicians in its\n            administration and the resulting instability of its key\n            personnel prevented achievement of one of the main project\n            objectives, that of converting EMC into a model enterprise.\n            Overall, the project results can be regarded as marginally\n            satisfactory. Implementation of the works took place\n            satisfactorily, though behind schedule. Key lessons learned\n            included: 1) Significant parts of the institutional\n            strengthening programs (managerial, financial,\n            administrative and technical) ought to have been implemented\n            up front; 2) In the case of loans to regional or local\n            utility companies, the local political environment should\n            always be evaluated during project preparation; 3) The size\n            of an approved loan should be in proportion to the\n            company's annual billing volume and hence its capacity\n            to generate internally sufficient resources to service its\n            debt obligations; and 4) The achieved benefits justified the\n            decision to extend the closing date of the loan."}, "docdt": "1996-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
