C. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1. Equipment Purchases
Monitoring activities are mainly being carried out in a visual basis during construction period.
Therefore no new equipment is intended to be purchased within this project. of the local.
After handing over the housing units to the beneficiaries, the monitoring activities will be
carried out by the relevant authorities using their own equipment.
2. Training
Training programs will be designed for local PIU Offices' and consultants' and constructors'
staff, i.e. the engineers and technicians designated for carrying out environmental mitigation
and monitoring activities. The environmental specialist of the PIU who is responsible for
assuring that the environmental requirements as stipulated in Turkish environmental law and
regulations are followed, and who is experienced in organizing training seminars in respect to
monitoring and evaluation of environmental data shall be designing and implementing such
training programs. The technical staff of local offices of PIU and the consultants who will be
delegated with the responsibility of the environmental specialist for the monitoring of
mitigation activities at the sites shall be attending the training programs and the workshops
organized periodically. The training programs will cover the current legislation related to the
environment, the mitigation measures to be taken and the techniques of sampling and
analysis, and the sessions will last approximately one day at each three of the local offices of
the PIU in the construction sites. These programs will be organized in the PIU Local Offices
in the construction sites, the first one being in the following month. There need to be at least
one person from each consulting firm and from the PIU Local Office designated for the
environmental monitoring in each of the construction sites participating in the meetings. The
second and the third workshops will be organized in the middle and towards the end of the
construction period respectively. For these programs, there will not be any additional cost, out
of the allocated budget.
3. Consultant Services
No consultant services are intended to be used for environmental institutional strengthening
within this project.
D. SCHEDULE
The environmental impact mitigation and monitoring activities will be carried out in parallel
with the construction activities. They will start together with the starting of mobilization and
will be completed after the demobilization. For example, dust and noise, transportation of
material, etc., will be monitored throughout the construction period, i.e. approximately eight
months. Landscaping activities shall be carried out after the finishing of civil works. After the
completion of the civil works, and the handing over of the housing units to the beneficiaries,
the monitoring activities shall be carried out by the relevant local authorities according to the
programs designed by those organizations such as municipalities and Provincial Directorates
of Ministry of Environment.



E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
Collection of Data: Monitoring data will be collected by the local PIU Offices, Consultants
and relevant local authorities (Municipalities of Adapazan, Izmit, Golcuik, Gebze,
Korfez(Hereke), Diizce, Cumayeri and Golyaka; and the Provincial Directorates of the
Ministry of Environment) when required. The collected data will be transferred to the Project
Directorate of PIU with monthly reports prepared by the consultants.
Analysis of Data: Data will be filed in the Headquarters of PIU and analysis of data will be
carried out by the Project Directorate of PIU. The results of the analysis will be used to check
the effectiveness of mitigation measures, and if required, to revise/modify the mitigation plan.
Reporting: The report with monitoring data will be sent to the PIU Directorate once a month.
However, in case of observing any unusual situation, the report will be sent to the Directorate
of PIU for immediate action to take measures. The format for the monthly reports shall be
prepared and supplied to the Consultants by the environmental specialist of PIU in order to
provide comparable and compatible monitoring data from different reconstruction sites.
Decisions: The decisions in relation to the modifications of the mitigation measures,
informing the relevant authorities, etc. are taken by the PIU.
F. CONSULTATIONS WITH LOCAL NGO's AND PROJECT AFFECTED GROUPS
Before starting the implementation of the housing reconstruction component of MEER
Project, it was decided to carry out three social studies. The first study was a public
participation study, which was carried out in order to get the views of the beneficiaries whose
houses were destroyed by the earthquake, and the project affected groups. The first one of the
other two studies was aiming at the collection of data about the socio-economic status of the
households who would be affected by the expropriation, and the second one, a compensation
assessment study, was carried out to ensure that the people whose houses and land would be
expropriated would not suffer a loss of assets and income as a result of expropriation.
As apart of the public participation study, the first Public Participation meetings in all the
proposed reconstruction sites, i.e. in Duzce, Golyaka (beneficiaries in Cumayeri attended the
meeting in Golyaka), Adapazan, Izmit, K6rfez, Gebze, Adapazarn, Karamursel and Golcuk)
were held on May 27, 28 and 29, 2000. (One of the meetings was held in Karamiirsel where
the proposed site was cancelled due to the risk of landslides.) The time and location of these
meetings were announced to the public by using various posters and the announcement
systems of the relevant municipalities, the administrations of the pre-fabricated and tent cities.
A wide range of public, as well as the beneficiaries, the people who were affected by the
earthquake and the land acquisition and the groups of the public who are interested in the
project in some ways participated in the meetings. The number of the people who attended the
meetings are given below:



Location                  Number of Participants
Dfizce                     250
G6lyaka + Cumayeri         200
Adapazan                   250
Izmit                      500
Korfez                     400
Gebze                      150
Karamursel                 300
Golculk                    450
The objectives of the reconstruction project, the plans for the housing complexes were
explained to the public by the representatives of the PIU. The comments and requirements of
the attendees were noted. In these meetings, it was observed that the main concern of the
public in relation to the reconstruction of housing units is the provision of safe, earthquake
resistant houses, which are not higher than two or three stories. After holding the second
public meetings on October 13, 14 and 15, 2000, the report containing the complete results of
these public participation meetings will be submitted to the World Bank.
The report prepared by the Consultants for Public Participation for Reconstruction of Housing
Under MEER was submitted to the World Bank in September 2000.
In the selection of three of the reconstruction sites, although the aim was to minimize land
acquisition and involuntary resettlement, it was unavoidable to expropriate some private
lands, and approximately 30 households are needed to be reseftled for the reconstruction of
approximately 9 000 housing units. A Resettlement Action Plan was prepared for these
households to be resettled. The survey which was conducted by the Consultants to determine
the socio-economic status of the households whose houses were subject to expropriation, and
to estimate the potential impact of the project on the households in terms of replacement cost
of land and property was completed by the PIU contracted consultants. A questionnaire type
survey was conducted. The questionnaires were so arranged as to gather data about the size,
the current income and income sources, standard of living, etc., of the households living in the
expropriation area. The results of this survey showed that there is a differentiation in income
sources of the people living in these areas, so it was concluded that the loss of agricultural
income will not be affecting the economic status of the households in such a manner as to lead
them to poverty provided that they are paid full replacement cost.
The aim of the other survey, which was conducted by the consultants contracted by PIU was
to check whether the compensation paid to the people affected by the expropriation was fair
and sufficient to cover the full replacement costs. The results of this study revealed that the
compensation amounts determined by the evaluation committees were fair and sufficient to
cover the full replacement costs.
The results of the both surveys were submitted to the World Bank together with the
Resettlement Action Plan in August 2000.



The next steps to be followed are the monitoring and evaluation of the results of the
Resettlement Action Plan in order to check the effectiveness of the plan.
It is also planned to find out the views of the groups of public in relation to the environmental
mitigation measures to be carried out to mitigate the potential adverse impacts of the housing
reconstruction component of MEER Project in the second set of public participation meetings.
Another step to be followed is the consultations with the Provincial Directorates of the
Ministry of Environment throughout the reconstruction period to check the effectiveness of
mitigation measures and the monitoring activities.
