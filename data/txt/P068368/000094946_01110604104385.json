This environmental management plan discusses\n            various mitigating measures to reduce environmental damage\n            caused by the project. At the design and planning stage,\n            selection of areas that are environmentally sensitive to be\n            project sites will be avoided. Instead, geologically safe\n            sites that are earthquake resistant will be selected. During\n            construction, dry roads will be sprinkled with water and\n            trucks transporting construction material will be covered to\n            reduce dust. Environmental legislation will be enforced to\n            mitigate noise generated by machinery. Waste water at the\n            construction sites will be disposed of by septic tanks.\n            Solid wastes will be disposed to licensed landfill areas and\n            excavated materials will be recycled for appropriate use.\n            Habitats will be protected by relocating the trees to green\n            park areas designated on the site plans. After handing over\n            the housing units to the beneficiaries, natural gas will be\n            utilized for heating to reduce the impact of air pollution.\n            Domestic solid wastes will be collected daily by the\n            relevant municipality."}, "docdt": "2000-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
