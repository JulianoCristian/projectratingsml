Some lessons learned\n            include the following: while it is tempting to take\n            advantage of the post-disaster window of opportunity to\n            introduce institutional and regulatory reforms to promote\n            disaster prevention and mitigation, there is a need to be\n            realistic about what can be practically achieved in the\n            context of an emergency recovery project. Establishing\n            effective institutional framework and building capacity for\n            disaster risk management institutions is a long-term agenda\n            that is not likely to be achieved within the life span of\n            one project, in a course of 4-5 years. The existence of a\n            post-disaster recovery project implementation unit, solely\n            dedicated to the reconstruction efforts does accelerate and\n            strengthen the process. Post-disaster recovery needs tend to\n            be overestimated, therefore, while designing the housing\n            reconstruction projects, the teams should be very prudent in\n            needs assessments and take into account other factors and\n            housing options affected people have in the medium- or\n            longer-term following the disaster. The successful\n            reconstruction program should pay close attention and\n            support not only to reconstruction of housing units but also\n            to adequate social infrastructure, such as schools, clinics,\n            shopping areas, as well as public spaces, etc., which\n            contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the\n            affected communities. Finally, the issues which involve\n            complex and deeply-rooted factors are unlikely to be\n            resolved within one project cycle."}, "docdt": "2007-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
