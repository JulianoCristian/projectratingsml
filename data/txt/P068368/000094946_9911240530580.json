This\n            project has three main components: The first creates a\n            comprehensive emergency management structure that\n            coordinates and integrates risk reduction strategies,\n            preparedness, response, and recovery. It also creates an\n            insurance mechanism, establishing and expanding national\n            catastrophic risk management and risk transfer capabilities\n            by making liquidity readily available to resident owners of\n            damaged or destroyed dwellings; reducing government fiscal\n            exposure; ensuring the financial solvency of the pool; and\n            reducing government dependency on the Bank and other donors.\n            This first component also reviews legal reforms, and\n            strengthens the municipal capability to regulate, plan, and\n            implement disaster resistant development. Lastly, this\n            component establishes a land information system while\n            updating and improving obsolete registers and maps. The\n            second component funds the development of a trauma program\n            for adults, which sets up community mental health centers\n            and programs for psychological and organizational support.\n            The third component reconstructs permanent housing in\n            earthquake-affected areas."}, "docdt": "1999-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
