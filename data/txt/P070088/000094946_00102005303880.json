The project also supports the\n            enforcement of several international conventions relating to\n            the environment. There are four main project components. The\n            first improves customs procedures by aligning them with\n            European Union standards and developing a monitoring\n            mechanism; provides training on new procedures; and\n            designates border and inland customs stations to serve as\n            test sites for ideas to improve operations. The second\n            component supports trade facilitation by strengthening the\n            private-public partnership and improves the performance of\n            trade facilitation agents. The third component improves the\n            customs information system by using electronic messaging\n            system, making electronic payment of duties, using digital\n            signature--including the selection of the most appropriate\n            translator and digital signature software, implementing\n            computer valuation and tariff classification systems, and\n            upgrading to a web-based system. It also increases the\n            number of computers and printers, purchases Internet service\n            servers, provides technology software, and upgrades\n            infrastructure for servers. The fourth component improves\n            border crossing facilities."}, "docdt": "2000-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
