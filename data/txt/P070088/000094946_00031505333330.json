To\n            prevent, minimize, or mitigate site specific negative\n            impacts, however, this environmental management plan (EMP)\n            and a set of mitigation measures have been prepared. The\n            major concerns about possible negative site specific impacts\n            associated with border crossings relate to 1) emissions from\n            vehicles waiting for custom clearances; 2) drainage of\n            disinfectants and spills of oils and fuel; 3) waste disposal\n            and loose garbage; and 4) site disruptions caused by\n            upgrades or relocations of utilities or such infrastructure\n            as buildings, parking/waiting areas, and access roads.\n            Specific actions to minimize any potentially negative impact\n            and promote institutional development include liaising with\n            environmental authorities and reviewing and monitoring EMP\n            compliance; staff training and sensitization at each border\n            crossing; certifying acceptable practices and impact\n            minimization, especially storing and properly using\n            disinfecting materials and chemicals, and hazardous\n            materials and garbage; harmonizing regulatory requirements\n            with European Union and international standards; and\n            incorporating environmental plans in consultant contracts\n            and project design."}, "docdt": "2000-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
