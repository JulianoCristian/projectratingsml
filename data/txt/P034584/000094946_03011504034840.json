modest institutional\n            development impacts. Among the several lessons learned, the\n            first one addresses the issue of projects, such as this one,\n            which are forerunners in nature, particularly in a\n            transition economy, embarked in developing a framework for\n            fiscal decentralization. This entails municipal\n            accountability, i.e., investment needs are based on\n            municipal decision-making. Albeit, coordination, and\n            consistency between the various aspects of the loan were not\n            anticipated, as were not revenue problems in light of\n            falling water demand. However, the Bank's linkages with\n            other water projects helped provide a consistent approach,\n            showing comparative tariff structures, and proved useful for\n            monitoring purposes, and in taking further steps. Other\n            lessons reinforce the need for meaningful, and timely\n            project indicators to guide project management, which as the\n            case of the water demand curve proves, despite falling\n            demands, installation of water meters, and higher tariffs\n            combined to impact on unit water consumption, in line with\n            urban Western Europe. However, the difficult aspects in\n            evaluating municipal public utility performance, needs to be\n            reviewed by a nationally appointed public service utility\n            regulator, experienced, and outlined under the Bank's\n            Programmatic Structural Adjustment lending."}, "docdt": "2002-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
