Dear Minister Godmanis:
Latvia - Municipal Services Development Project (3964-LV) 
Amendment to the 
  Loan Agreement
To allow for a more efficient implementation of sub-projects under the Municipal 
Development Fund component of the above project, we propose to amend the Loan 
Agreement (3964-LV) dated January 26, 1996 as follows:
In Schedule 4:  Procurement and Consultants Services, Section C:  Other 
Procurement 
Procedures, add the following paragraph:
“5.  Procurement of Small Works:
"Works estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per contract, up 
to an 
aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000,000 equivalent, may be procured 
under lump-sum, fixed 
price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained 
from three (3) qualified 
domestic contractors in response to a written 
invitation. The invitation shall include a 
detailed description of the 
works, including basic specifications, the required completion 
date, a basic form 
of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where 
applicable. 
The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation 
for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the 
contract successfully."
Please indicate your agreement to the above amendments by signing and dating the 
two originals of this letter, and returning to us one of the originals.
Sincerely,
