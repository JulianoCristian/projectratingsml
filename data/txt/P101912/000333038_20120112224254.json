Some lessons learned included: supervision\n            missions should try to have a balanced skill mix that\n            reflects the makeup of the project's subject matter and\n            other specific requirements, particularly when project\n            preparation was constrained by lack of information. This\n            will give opportunity for improving some proposals that were\n            rushed during preparation. Perhaps the project needs in\n            preparing environmental safeguard instruments will have been\n            accomplished had the supervision missions included an\n            environmental specialist. Likewise, a thorough technical\n            review of the high-tech mobile clinic proposals by an\n            experienced veterinarian will have led towards a choice of\n            more appropriate technology. In an organizational setup with\n            an apparent need for clear line of command, project\n            organization should provide for well-defined staff\n            responsibilities and authority. Considerations should be\n            given in South Sudan to the possibility of relying on\n            stronger project coordination office, albeit within the\n            existing ministerial structure, where the Coordinator\n            becomes primus inter pares, and has a say on matters related\n            to the plan of work and budget of a project as well as in\n            the release of funds. The formulation of results framework\n            in projects that are designed to be implemented in phases\n            should endeavor to include specific objectives for each of\n            the phases instead of establishing global project\n            development objectives (PDOs) for the whole project. This\n            will avoid the risk of underestimating project outcome if\n            one or more of the anticipated phases are not implemented.\n            Failure in setting up key performance indicators for the\n            first phase of LFDP has prevented the project from getting\n            credit for the achievements it made in institutional\n            capacity building and improved animal health services.\n            Projects in post-conflict environments should be designed\n            with simplicity and the greatest analytical rigor allowed by\n            the availability of information. Gaps in information should\n            be shown transparently, and measures built into design to\n            adjust activities as more information becomes available."}, "docdt": "2011-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
