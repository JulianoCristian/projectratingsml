                         To build capacity of the public sector in Southern Sudan to fulfill its mandated role in livestock and fisheries, and to promote continuity in provision of key

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was initially designed as a two-phase intervention. Resource constraints in the MDTF and the Government of Southern Sudan precluded the possibility of a second
                         phase. For this reason, the range and scope of interventions were scaled down to fit the realized financing. In light of these financing realities, the project was restructured on
                         11/18/2010 to delineate Phase 1 activities from the overall program. As part of the restructuring, changes were made to the Project Development Objective, Key Performance
                         Indicators, project components, closing date and the financing plan. As of this reporting, all grant proceeds have been disbursed and the project is on course to close on June 30,

                         The project was restructured clearly to delineate the activities financed in the first phase, which is drawing to a close in months.
