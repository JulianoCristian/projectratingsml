for Southern Sudan is to\n            improve the performance of the livestock and fisheries\n            sectors in five selected states of Southern Sudan through\n            capacity building, improving animal health, reducing\n            post-harvest losses and improving market infrastructure. The\n            project will be implemented in two phases. Phase one will be\n            the first two years while the remaining three years will be\n            in phase two. The first phase of the project will focus on\n            capacity building and service delivery while the second\n            phase will concentrate on longer term institutional\n            development and continue with service delivery and marketing\n            activities. The Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) is expected to\n            make a commitment for the first phase (2006-2008) amount,\n            with subsequent commitments reflected by addendum to the\n            grant agreement.
