project estimated to cost US$16.4 million has been agreed with the Govern-
ment .
ii.       The revised project meets urgenT needs and forms paru of the
Government's education program (1968-1972) which goes two years beyond the
period cuvered by the First Malaysia Plan (1966-1970).   This program over-
emphasizes general secondary education and insufficiently stresses technical
and vocational education. However, following discussions between tne
Government and Bank in 1968, the Malaysian Cabinet has approved an education
po licy paper that envisages a new education program, using criteria satis-
factory to the Bank, to be made within 18 months following signature of the
proposed loan.
iii.      The proposed project compri.ses 5 new secondary technical schools,
6 new vocational schools and extensions to one other, 3 new agricultural
schools, 3 new general secondary schools and extensions to 2 others and 1
new primary teacher training college. The increase in facilities would
accommodate a total of 10,900 additional students, of whom 3,256 would be
boarders.  Accommodatiom for 282 staff would also be provided.   Technical
assistance and fellowships for the agricultural training are included.
Building and commissioning of the schools and college would take 4 years;
technical assistance would continue for a further 3 years.
iv.       The project is designed to provide maximum expansion of student
output on a reasonably sound basis over the short term. However, the ex-
pansion program included in the propcosed project would leave unprovided
large portions of Malaysia's general needs for technically trained manpower.
A faster expansion. of the technical and vocational schools is precluded by
an a-cute shortage of technical teachers. To relieve the existing bottleneck
of teachers, the Canadian Government is now providing technical assistance
to develop a new technical teacher training college. After full develcpment
of the college in 1972, additional expansion of technical and vocational
schools will become feasible.
v.        Students in the new secondarv schools in West Malaysia would
follow an industrial, agricultural or commercial course.   The output from
the commjercial and agricultural courses of present and Droiect schools would
largely meet projected manpower needs for this type of personnel during
1971-1980; in the case of industrial graduates   although the proposed proJeoc.
would increase output by 140%, output from present and project schools would
meet onlv 27,K of needs duiring 1971-1'980.
vi.       Because Malaysia has limrited experience of developing And operatin.g
agricultural schools, 40 man-years of technical assistance and 27 man-years
of rverseas felcr.Qhinsr- inlii ei irn +he p     atropoe  p roc.



Vii..     New mouern curricuia nave Deen developed for the seconUary tiC-cn-
nical, vocational and agricultural schools; those for the primary teacher
trai ning college and general secandary schoois have recentily been revised
to a satisfactory standard.
viii.     For all the various schools and the college in the proposed
project, there wotld be a sufficient supply of candidates from the lower
levels to fill the places to be provided. There should also be an adequate
supply of trained teachers.
ix.       The schedules of accommodaltion and furniture and equipment lists
are adequate; estimates of cost are satisfactory. Contracts for civil
works, furniture and equipment procurement would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding.  The Public Works Departments in West
and East iMalaysia are competent to uwdertake the design and supervision, of
construction work involved in the proposed project.
x.        Of the estimated total cost of US$16.4 million for the project,
the foreign exchange component amount1s to US$8.8 million, including interest
and related charges on the proposed :Loan during the construction period.
The estimated annuLal recurrent expenditure created by the project is
US$4.5 million.  Both the capital contribution and the recurrent costs are
within the capacity of the Government. The project is suitable as a basis
for a Bank loan of US$8.8 million for a period of 25 years including a grace
period of 10 years.

I. INTRODUCTICN
.01.   T  -T,,--Wse 1967, 4whe Bar'- re;,eived z reues fro,,th  T-,ala,-in-
Government for a loan to assist a proposed project comprising developments
." gEVIVlC"S agricu.tmal wad technica:l secondary schools,VL0 a otseodr
polytechnic, and a university teacher training department. The estimated
cost t,Ua] LedA M$229 AJL±LLULV  (UJ$75 Ii,?L±.L .
1.02      The proJ,ect, proposed by the GUo:vern[ment, was based o, the  Irst.
Ialaysia Plan (1966-1970), which inc:Luded a substantial expansion of th.e
couwntry's education system at a capital cost of MP.)38 million. lILLs ac:-
counted for about 10% of the total public development expenditure contem-
placed in the PlarL (Annex 1).  Expansion programs for various levels of'
education in the Plan had been deterrined by arbitrarily chosen percentage
enroLmenTos in schools or tne respecTi:Lve population age groups. Tne maj or
development was in general secondary education, for which the capital allo-
cation was nearly Mv$200 million. Reliatively minor importance was giver,tio
vocationaL education, as evidenced by a capital allocation of only M$35
mill-ion.
1.03      Study by the Bank of the proposed project was aided by data f'rom
a manpower survey carried out in West Malaysia in 1965 by the Malaysian
Government;, assisted by UNDP. The results of this survey had not been
available when the Plan for 1966-1970 was formulated. Evaluation of the
data indicated that a number of items in the proposed project could not
meet; Bank criteria.  For example, because of the already high output of
general secondary school graduates in West Malaysia, the Government's pro-
posed expansion of general secondary schools at an estimated cost of M$153
million could not be justified.  In addition, the request contained iteMs
which cou:Ld be justified on manpower grounds but which the appraisal study
team felt could not be carried out imameliately. For example, it included
2LI vocational schools, a number which could not possibly all be supplied
with trained teclhical teachers. The project was therefore substantially
reduced, with the agreement of the Malaysian Government, to cover an ex-
pansion program costing an estimated US$16.4 million.
1.04      The project forms part of the Government's education program
(1968-1972) and goes two years beyondi the period of the First Malaysia Planr.
This education program, however, is substantially out of balance because,
as indicated by manpower projections (Chapter V), too much emphasis has
been placed on general secondary education (except in Sabah) and too li-ttle
on vocational and technical education. Following discussions between Govern-
ment and the Bank during 1968, the Cabinet has now approved an education
policy paper in which the Government agrees to ccmplete a review and revi-
sioIn of t]he educatiion program (1968-1972) within approximately 18 months
following siEnatme of the proposed loan,

2.01      Malaysia has a population cf about 10 million in an area of
130,000 square miles.   It is geographically separated into two parts by th3
South China Sea, into Western Malaysia on the mainland and the two Borneo
States, Sarawak and Sabah (see maps).    Econcmic development in lest MIalavsia
is more advanced than in East Malaysia. The country is multiracial, composed
of M4alays (50%), Chinese (37P), Indians (11%) and other Malayo-Polynesian
ethnic groups.
2.02      Despite the multiracial cormposition of its population and regional
differences in its economic development, ivialaysia has maintained social and
political stability. A reasonably strong economy has undoubtedly been a
contributing factor.   GNP has risen at an average annual rate of 6.4% since
1961. The per capita income, US$315, is one of the highest in Asia.
2.03      Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, generating about a
third of the GDP and employing more than half of the labor force. Rubber
growing, on estates and small holdings, is the main agricultural activity.
In East Malaysia there has been an impressive growth in the timber extract-
ing industry. A Government program, to diversify agriculture, is making
progress but its full implementation requires more trained personnel than
are at present available.
2.04      Tin mining is next in econcmic importance to agriculture though
production has begun to stagnate, mainly due to gradual exhaustion of good
quality ores in easily accessible areas. The sector still accounts for
over 5% of GDP and 20% of exports and some 3% of employment.
2.05      The manufacturing sector produces about 11% of GDP and employs
about 9%" of the labor force: outDut has more than doubled since 1960 and
is rising steadily.   Further expansion in industrial production ranks high
among the Government's development objectives.    However, it is dependent,
inter aliz, upon a supply of technicians and craftsmen of whom there is a
severe shortage in. Malaysia.
III. EDUCATION AND TRAINING

is centr"alzed at- the MiLnistry Of Education.  1Ho=wever, because of their

ealaysia v e each     ofder a Eucaief oducn. ion Officer whilst- Sab&h and Sarawak
each have a Director of Education.



3.U0      Av the ifeuueal level, uner t.ne iunisrter 01 J-aucation, the rerma-
nent Secretary has overall responsibility for the work of his Ministry,
the Deputy Secreta;ry being responsible for administration and the Chief
Education Advisor for planning and day-to-day operation of schools (Annex 3).
The supervisory structure and financial controls are satisfactory. The
inspectorate is well led and effective in its present duties but requires
strengthening to supervise the increased activity in technical and agricul-
turaIL education.
3.03      The Government recognizes in its education policy paper that the
review of the education program to which it has committed itself (para. 1.04)
requires riore emphasis on education planning.  The Education Planning and
Research Division of the Ministry of Education is therefore being reorgamized
and streng-thened and will undertake as its first assignment the review of
the education plan (1968-1972). Steps have been taken to obtain technical
assistance from the Ford Foundation, which has offered to provide foreign
experts and consultants and the training of local staff. In this paper the
Government has also undertaken to develop more fully cooperation between
the Ministries of Education, Agriculture, and Labor. the Economic PlannLng
Unit. and the Treasury, for educational planning and for implementation of
the revised educati,on plan.  In this connection, a Higher Education Council
has been set up, wLth representatives from these Ministries, to advise on
policy relating to the intake of -the students for education at university
and college levels so as to maximize coordination between training and
economic needs.  In addition, and also performing a coordinating function,
are the Manpower SLbcommittee of the National Development Planning Committee
and a Standing ComLittee on Technical ancl Vocational Education within the
Ministry of Education.   Finallv. the Director of Technical Education is
responsible for agricultural training but has only one qualified agricul.-
tuiist. a lJnesco speeialist. Assuranees were obtained during negotiations

4ho2      As Table 2 shows, the major contributory factor to increases in
expenditure was the cost of secondary education, reflecting the introduction
in 1964 of universal education to secondary form 3 (grade 9). Because of
the large proportion of all children now attending schools, this rapid
growth rate of education costs is likcely to diminish in the future.

4.04      The Ministry of Education f'inances over 95% of recurrent costs
of Government and aided schools, the remainder being met by school fees.
The capital costs of primary and secondary government-aided schools are
financed equally by the Government and local authorities or religious
groups; but because local authorities and religious groups are becoming
less able to meet rising capital costs, there is a likelihood that the
Government will increase its share.
Future Education Expenditure
4.05      The education program in the First Malaysia Plan (1966-1970) was
recently extended to cover 1968-1972 and was somewhat modified by reducing
the need for general secondary school teachers.  The Cabinet has since then
approved an education policy statement that the Government will review and
revise the education program (para. 1.04). This revision is likely to
result in a small decrease in Government expenditure on education after
1970 from that exp,ected under the modified program, but the extent of the
reduction is hard to predict. On the basis of the 1968-1972 program as it
stands now the annual recurrent cost of education could rise from about
i4$385f million in 1967 to M$610 million in 1975 (Annex 5).  Capital invest-
ment allocated in bhe First Malaysia Plan totals M$440 million (Annex 1),
of w:hich about M$190 million was spent in 1966-1968; in the light of the
M{id-Term Review of this Plan it now seems unlikely that all the Plan al:Lo--
cation wTill be spent by 1970. The average annual canital exoenditure
during 1968-1970 would probably not exceed M$80 million and after 1970
would probably not exceed M$70 million per year.

The percentages shown in the final two lines of the above table are
reasonable.
4.o6     -l.rith reference to the proposed project, the Governlment should be
able to provide its share of the capital expenditure and to meet the recur-
rent expenditures entailed by the operation of the new schools and college.
The maximum capital contribution to the project by the 14alaysian Government,
occurring during the third year of project implementation, amounts to about
Mi$8 million; this is about 14% of the Ministry of Educationts average annual
capital expenditure during 1962-1967. As to the recurrent expenditures for
the project schools, these would amouLnt to about M$13.5 million per year,
beginning in 1972, or under 4% of the Ministry of Educationts average
recurrent expenditure during 1962-1967.
V. EDUCATICN ANT) TRAINING NEEDS

$.01.     The 1965 manpower survey carried out by the Malaysian Government,
assisted by UNDP, (Annex 6) has provided a valuable source of manpower sta-
tistics. Two orojections of mannower reouirements to 1980 have been made,
one by t.he Bank (Annex 7) and one by the Economic Planning Unit (Annex 8).
A noten the Ban-k: mep.thond Off nc:tAmating manpower rpoiuirements is given

grow at nearly 5% annually during 1967-70 and at 5.7% annually in 1971-80;
the annual increase in productivity of labor is taken to be about 2% in
1967-70 and 3% in 1971-80. The projections must be regarded with some caution

skilled technical workers with secondary level education would be needed

developed, would graduate only 1,800 students for entry into industry i7 1970

and subsequent years; the balance of the annual need of 11,500 skilled
tewh.aical workers by i975 can only be met if vigorous action is taken to
expand training facilities.
5.04      The need for skilled agricultural workers with secondary education
is substantially less than the corresponding need for technical workers.
This is because most skilled agricultural workers are unlikely to need a
seconday education of the type under consideration. By far tne largest
group of skilled agricultural workers are foremenon estates who have been
promoted from general workers and attended courses at Agricultural Traminig
Centers; this system of promotion and upgrading has been found satisfac-tory.
Nevertheless by 1975 the annual need for skilled agricultural workers would
be about 430. The agricultural schools now being developed by the -Ministry of
Agriculture reach mnaximum output of 160 graduates yearly by 1972; there
would remain a substantial balance to be met as far as practicable by suitable
expansion of other facilities.
5.05      The education program (1968-1972), if executed unchanged, wouLd
only aggravate the serious imbalance described above (para. 5.03). It is
therefore of special importance that, as mentioned earlier (para. 1.04),
discussions between the Government and Bank have led the Government to the
decision that it will review and revise this program with a view to achiev-
ing the maximum possible readjustment of balance in enrolments as betweerl
general secondary and technical/vocational schools, so as to move by stages
to a position of optimum enrolment by about 1980. During negotiations an
assurance    was   obtained that the revised plan will be sent to the Bank
for comment.

Sarawak
5.08       No manpower survey has been carried out in Sarawak. Using cerca:l'a
assunptions, estimates were made of the 1966 distribution of employment by
occupational categories (Annex 12) and of manpower requirements to 1980
(Annex 13). The public sector figures for distribution of employment were
provided by government offices and are reliable; the private sector figures
have been extrapolated from the Sabah manpower survey and so should be
regarded as orders of magnitude only.
5.09      These estimates indicate that present outputs from secondary
form 5 (grade 11) and form 6 (grade 13) are sufficient to cover the projectsed
needs for 1971-80. Consequently, the allocation of M$29 million contained
in the First Malaysia Plan for general secondary school development in
Sarawak would seem more than necessary.

This table( shows that the proposed project would largely meet the need
for commercial and agricultural form 5 (grade 11) graduates, there wil-(,
however, remain a serious shortage of industrial graduates.     At presenl,
it is not feasible to expand industrial training at a faster rate because
of the severe shortage of technical teachers. The Canadian Government
has recently prov-ided technical assistance to develop the Kuantan Tech--
nical Training College to produce 60 teachers per year, starting in 1972,
which will enable a more rapid expansion of technical education.
6.01      The supply of technical teachers for present and projected
technical and vocational schools, drawn from students in training, and
about to proceed for training, overseas and from the Kuantan Technical
Teacher Training College will be adequate; No difficulty in obtaining
the general teachers is expected.
6.05       Developrnent of agricultural teacher training is taking place at
the Serdang Agricuiltural College where a one-year course follows the
three-year diploma course. The annual output of 20 trained teachers ucould
be sufficient to meet the needs of the agricultural and technical schools.
6.06      Because of the lack of experience of local staff, a team of
specialists in agriculture, acceptable to the Bank, would be essential
for the technical and agricultural schools for about five years; these
specialists would be phased out as local staff becomes experienced.
Each agricultural school would require three specialists; one in agroromy,
one in animal science and one in farm mechanics, each for 3 1/3 years.
Tn addition, an aiministrator to work in the Ministry of Agriciiture, as
coordinator and adivisor to the Director of Education, would be repqired
for three years.   Each of the three technical schools with   cri(ultura:]
streams would reauire a vocational agricultural specialist for 2 1!/ year .

Justification of Project Items in Sabah
6.09      The new primary teacher training college at Sandakan would have
an estimated annual output of 90 trained teachers by 1970 which when
added to the expected output of existing colleges would meet about 90%
of average annual needs during 1971-1980. Consideration should be give
to a further modest expansion of a primary teacher training college in
about two years.  Teacher educators to staff this new college would be
selected from the 80 students overseas on education courses.
6.10      The three new and extensions to two general secondary schools
would increase form 5 (grade 11) output from 1000 in 1969 to 1,275 by
i975 which would provide about 80% of average annual needs during 1971-
1980 (para. 5.07). Because of teacher shortage it is not possible to
expand immediately secondary schools at a rate greater than in the project.
However, on completion of developments now taking place at Gaya College
where trained teacher output is planned to increase from 20 in 1968 to
80 in 1972, it will then be possible to consider a further expansion of
general secondary schools.
Justification of the Project Item in Sarawak
6.11      The project proposes to expand the Kuching Vocational School
so as to double the output of skilled technical and commercial graduates
by 1972.   About 100 of each type would then be graduated. Drovidin?
only about 10% of average annual needs during 1971-19580. There is
c1esrl1v a need for a fuirther substantial exnansion in these tvvnes of
education but this is not feasible until the technical and commercial

General Remarks for West Malaysia, Sabah and.Sarawak
6.1.2     Present and projected student enrollments in lower level
schools indicate that tnere wouid be adequate students qualified to
fill the schools and college in the proposed. project.
6.13      Accommodation and Equipment.   Accommodation schedules and
lis-ts of equipment and furniture for each school and the college have
been reviewed and revised to acceptable standards and the estimated costs
are consIdered reasonable.
6.14      Staff Accommodation.  The proposed project includes housing for
282 staff' at a cost of about US$4250 per housing unit. Many project
schools such as the three new agricultural schools are sited in areas
where there are no houses suitable for the schools' staffs or where houses
are obtainable only at high rentals. Provision of staff houses on the
scale proposed wculd enable the schools to attract and keep good quality
teaching staff. The estimated cost is reasonable.
6.1.5     Stud.ent Boarding Accommodation. The proposed. project includes
boarding facilities for about 3,256 students, i.e. about 30% of total
enrollmerits who live in remote areas. The "double-bunk" type accommodati;n
is economical and. satisfactory.
VII IMPLZEENTATION OF THE PROJECT

7.01      To imrplement the pronosed nroiect. a Proiect Director has been
appointed in the Ministry of Education.  During negotiations an assurance
was obtained that, any rhange in this appointment wail d be made only af'ter
consultation with the Bank. He will coordinate the work of the Direct-ors
of the Plblic Works Departments in lWest Malavsia, Sabah and Sarawak with
that of the respective officials in the Plinistry of Education and the
Directors of Education of Sabah and Sarawak and arrange that sunnples

7.03      The PID in West Malaysia is adequately staffed except for a
shortage of experienced civil engineers. During negotiations, an
assurance was obtained that qualified and experienced civil engineers
would be assigned for work on the proposed project.
Bul]. (iing Construction
7.04      There are competent local co ntractors in adequate numbers :in
West Malaysia.. Tendering and bidding for civil works follow an accept-
able system. International competitive bidding would be used for all
civil works and for the supply of fumiture and equipment.
7.05      The basis of cost estimates for canstruction for all projezt
items is a square-foot cost for the particular type of construction
involved. The basic costs were determined after consultation with the
FWD's architects and local private consultants and contractors. In
various parts of the country, due to differences in climate, topography
and transport, costs at the build:ing sites vary up to 20% above Kuala
Lumpur prices. These factors have been taken into account in the cost
estimat;es, which are considered reasonable (Annex 16).
7'.06     The building construction work in the proposed project
represents under one percent of the yearly volume of construction in
Mlalaysia so that implementation of the project should result in no cve^r-
loaJing of the industry. A study of building costs in Malaysia durf'ng
the years 1957-67 shows a trend towards annual higher costs of the order
of 2% for West M4ala-ysia. 3% for Sarawak, and 5% for Sabah; a weighte:d
average figure of 3% has been taken for the whole project.
7.07      For -the proposed projec t schools, accommodation schedules have
been nrenared and standardized, this was done after administration and
-te aching spaces had been modified to accept able standards. Student
accommodation, of the "double bunk" tvne. is satisfactory.  Staff houses
would be built only where essential and would be of modest size and cost.
7.08      Maintenance of schools is the responsibility of the Publiz
WeC.rks Trnm+.mn+. and isq 1+isfa-. An ail lwnT.Tnce fo-r maintenannc  of

it is proposed to use a percentage as the basis for withdrawals against
items in this category, i.e., 34% which represents the estimated forelgll
exchange component.  In case of an increase in the cost of the civil
works and locally manufactured furniture and equipment, the percentages
would be adjusted, at the Bank's option, in order to spread disbursements
throughout the construction periocd.
VIii.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECO-DMNDATIONS
8.01      The proposed project is well conceived to increase the type of
trained manpower most needed in Malaysia, primarily technical and agricul-
tural workers, and would help to correct the imbalance in the educationaL
system by reducing emphasis on general secondary education and increasing
that on technical education and vocational training.
8.02      The Government has agreed to review and revise, by about December,
1970, the present educational plan (1968-1972) so as to improve the balance
between general secondary education and technical/vocational education.
To facilitate t]his planning, the Ford Foundation is to provide assistance
to the Ministry of Education's Planning and Research Division.
8.03      To ensure satisfactory implementation of the project, the
Government has appointed a full-time Project Director at the Ministr;y
of Education who would coordinate the work of the Public Works Depart-
ments in West Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak with that of pertinent offi-
cials in the Ministries of Agriculture and Education. The Government
will also obtain or provide technical assistance for the development
of agricultural subjects and provide fellowships for the training of
counterparts.
8.ML      The pronosed project is suitable for a Bank loan of JSt18,8
million to the Government of Malaysia, which equals the estimated foreign
exchange comnonent; the loan wonl i be. for 2 term of 25  ears, incllding
a grace period of 10 years.

2.         In 1968, enrolments in primary and secondary schools (Annexes 2b,
2c, and 2d), expressed as a percentage of corresponding age groups, were,
with the exception of Japan and Singapore, the highest in Asia; and they
approached those in many developed countries.    Boarcing piaces are providac
for 3% of secondary school pupils to enable those living in rural areas,
mainly Malays, tn obtain secondary education.
3.        The quality and efficiency of primary and secondary schools are
good.  Retention rates are high, varying from 62% in Tamil language primary
schools to nearly 100% in English language secondary schools.     The lower
general secondary school curriculum was modernized in 1964 to include in,
dustrial arts, agricultural science, commerce and home economics.
Technical Education
4.        There are! three secondary technical schools with a total enrolment
of 1,600 students, all providing courses with an engineering bias. Admission
is from form 3 for a 2-year course but the school at Penang includes a
flourishing! sixth form (grades 12 & 13). The better graduates qualify to
follow courses leading to professional and sub-professional (i.e., higher-
grade technician) status. Those less academically inclined enter the labor
force directly and eventually become technicians or craftsmen in industry.
5.        Vocational training is given at seven secondary vocational schools;
admission is from form 3 for a 2-year course leading to apprenticeships in
industry. Present enrolment in these schools totals 2,300 students with an
output of about 1,100 graduates.
6.        The general standard of staff and equipment of the technical and
vocational schools is good and graduates are in great demand by industry and
Government departmeints.

figures for enrolments are available; one estimate for 1968 put 10,600
students in private! vocational t,raining institutions, mainly in cormierci.al
subjects.
9.        There aret three higher institutions of concern to technical educa-
tion.  Tne Engineering Faculty of the University of Malaya, recently assisted
by UIMDP, has modern buildings and equipment, is well staffed and operates
efficiently.  There were 85 graduates in 1968.   Supply and demand for young
professional engineers appears well balanced at present. The Faculty iEs
plannring its future} output to phase with industry's needs; facilities appear
adequate to cover needs for at least the next 5 years.
10.       The Kuala Lumpur Technical College offers professional engineering
courses (enrolment in 1967: 42), technician courses (658), and preliminary
science courses (152). The College occupies modern buildings and is well
equipped. However, the professional courses attempt to duplicate the
engineering courses at the University and, considering the moderate demand
for professional engineers, are not fully justified.  The preliminary courses
in science could easily be transferre(d elsewhere.  It would appear wise for
the College to concentrate its efforts on development of technician courses
which, if done-immediately, could result in an output of 400 technician,
yearly by :1971-1972.
11.       The Nara Institute of Technology provides post-secondary courses
in humanit:ies and science for about 2,500 Malays.  The Institute is to be
developed at a cost; of about US$1h.0 million to provide 4,500 fully boarding
student places bT 1J972 in accountancy, management, administration, engineer-
ing, applied arts, applied science and hotel management. Most of these
courses would be at technician level.
Agricultural Education
12.       The College of Agrictlture, Serdang, provides three-year post-
secondary courses to train sub-professional workers. Aided by a team of
agricultural. experts supplied by the Ford Foundation, the College is in the

process of doubling its capacity iroirn 265 at preSent uu 55 st-n.v      I'
pedagogical department will begin operating in 1969.
13.       Vocational agricultural education is carried out in two schoo:ls
operated by the Ministry of Agriculture.   One school, attached to -the College
at Serdang, is being developed to increase its present enrolment from 4O to
300.  The other school, at Bumbong Lima, which has recently been rebuilUl
had 200 students in 1968. Education for the agricultural community will be
strengthened by the inclusion of agricultural science in the Ministry o.
Education's lower secondary schools; agriculture also would be taught in
the secondary technical schools included in the proposed project. For
farmers, t'here are 20 rural agricultural training centers offering short
(2-4 weeks) courses. Over 15,000 have enrolled since 1960. The instructors
are experienced extension workers; up-dating courses for them are provided
at Serdang.
14.       The Agricultural Faculty of the University of Yalaya was established
in 1961 with substantial help provided by the New Zealand Government under the
Colombo Plan.   Thirty students graduated in 1968; output is planned to reach
60 by 1970. There is a need to establish a closer cooperat;ion between the
Agricultural Faculty, the Ministries of Agriculture and Education and the
College at Serdang.   A vigorous effort should be made, in conjunction with
the Economic Planning Unit, to produce a concerted plan for the developmen L
of agricultural education.
The University of Malava
15.       Malaysia's only university was established in Singapore in 19h9;
a division was formed at Kuala Lumpur in 1958 and this became a separate
university in 1962: it incIldes the favaltis nf' aprirulture and engineering
laentioned above.  Enrolments at Kuala Lumpur have grown from 323 in 1959 to
5,740 in 19_8 (AnnAw P.).   The gPnPrn1 a.nr.dmi., i  Gst nd2rd onf the nniversityv
particularly in engineering, is good., However, there is a preponderance of

secondary classes are traLned i-n six -res-en"L insti-tutes, ha-ving a maxI-
munm annual output of 880. One of the institutes, at Kuala Lumpur, speci.al-
izes in coirnerciai studies, home science, arts and crafts, and physical
education; it trains 20 teachers per year in each of these subjects.   Teachers
for upper secondary schools and sixth forms are trained at tne University
Facu:lty of Education; output has grown from 35 in 196h to 215 in
1968.  Taking all general secondary scnool teachers togetner, the totai
annual output is now nearly 1,100. This should be ample if development of
general secondary ,schools is kept within the limits indicated by the countr,y' 
manpo-wer requirements.
18.       No facilities exist for training technical teachers but plans are
well advanced for converting the secondary vocational school at Kuantan into
a practical teacher training college. Yearly output would be about 60
teachers by 1972. The buildings are suitable and substantial equipment has
been supplied by t'he Canadian Government, from whom the Malaysian Government
is receiving 30 man-years of technical assistance for assignment to Kuantan
19.       Training of teachers of agriculture will start in 1969 at the
Serdang Agricultural College.   The planned output of 20 per year would be
employed in agricultural and technical secondary schools. Teachers of
agricultural science for lowfer secondary schools are trained at the Johore
Bahru Teachers' Training College, assistence for which has recently beenI
requested from UH]P. Output of trained teachers is planned at 50 per year.
Sabah Education System
20.       The system of general education (Annex 2f) is basically the same
as in West, Malaysia.  Enrolment in primary schools has increased from 47,0C0
in 1960 to 107.000 in 1968, providing for 70% of the age group.   During the
same period, enrolment in secondary schools rose from 4,000 to 21,600 cover-
ing 30C of' the age group (Annexes 2g and. 2h).
Teacher Training
21.       In primary schools. the pupil/teacher ratio of 31:1 (in 1968) is
within the range generally considered satisfactory but only 53% of the 3,h00
rnirnrrv ts,nnh.rA arn trainnd. nCntnnt frcom thb twn nr-imarv tanhpr traininq
colleges will be increased from about 150 per year at present to 180 by 1970.
22.       Lower secondary school teachers are trained at Gaya College, Kota
Kina.balu (Jesselt!n), -where the OUtp!lt of' 21 +trained techers in 1968 i.
planned to rise to 80 by 1971.   Teachers for the upper forms are trained in
Vbest Malaysia and overseas; abont 20 return each year.  There are no
facilities for training technical or agricultural teachers in Sabah.

Vocational Training
23.       The Sandakan Vocational School provides two-year courses forlmotor
mechanics; the total enrolment in 1967 was 14 students.   The Government
wishes to expand this school but there is an insufficient supply of candi-
dates at form 3 level from the seconclary schools. Future development of
vocational, education must be preceded by an increased output from secondary
schools.
24.       The Kota Kinabalu (Jesselton) Trade School offers craft courses
for 142 post-primary students.   Outmoded school buildings and equipment are
being replaced by a new school provi(ded by the New Zealand Government, at
a cost of US$560,coo. The capacity of the new school will be 192 students.
The three-year course wnll be open initially to primary school leavers but
it is hoped to raise the entry standard as secondary school leavers become
available.  The New Zealand Government is providing a principal and five
experts, counterpELrt staff are being trained in New Zealand.
Agricultural Training
25.       No general agricultural education is provided in Ministry of
Education schools but steps are being taken to introduce agricultural subje^cts
into secondary schlools. An overseas expert is engaged on syllabus prepara-
tiorl and other planning and, subiect to obtaining qualified teachers from
West Malaysia or overseas, some schools will introduce the subject this year.
26.       The Department of Agriculture provides short courses for farmers
at 11 agr:icultural centers. The courses which started in 1966 have been
attended by nearlyr 1,000 farmers. The agricultural center at Tuaran provides
courses of 9 to 12 months to upgrade extension workers and has a capacity
of 48 students.
Sarawak Education System
27.       The system of general education (Annex 2i) is similar to Wleslt
Malaysia. Enrolment in primary schools has increased from 53.000 in 1955 to
lL3,400 in 1968, providing for 66% of the age group (Annexes 2j and 2k:).
SRendarv sc.bonl enrolment has increased from livj0n in 1962 to 250noo in
1968, covering 33%o of the age group.  Nearly half the secondary school enrol-
men-t attend private schnoolls.

part-time students were enrolled; the output is in high demand by employers.
The school is noused in modern buiidings, is well equipped, and the staff,
although numerically small, is wTell oualified.   The school has an experienced
principal.  Australian staff is supplied under the Colomoo Plan.
31.       Since 1965, the curriculum of lower secondary schools has included
agricultural subjects and 20 schools now offer the subject.    The Batu College
trains teachers of agriculture; output is planned to be 40 per year by 1970.
32.       The Department of Agriculture's School of Agriculture trains ex--
tension workers on 12-month courses with an annual enrolment of 56 studenl;s.
Shorter in-service training courses are also held.    Practical training for
farmers is offered by the Department at five Farmer Training Centers where
the 14--week courses have been attended by over 1,000 farmers since 1964.
Education Radio and1 Television
33.       Radio Malaysia broadcasts 26 hours of radio programs weekly for
primary and secondary schools in four languages for W4est Malaysia. There is
no regular education television service (ETV) though ETV programs from
Singapore are receive,d by schools in the state of Johore.   Successful pilot
ETV projects were tried in 1965, 1966 and 1967; in consequence, plans are in
hand to start a regular ETV service in 1969 to provide programs in science
and mathematics for lower secondary schools.
34.       Sarawiak has radio broadcasts directed at primary and secondary
schools for 28 hours weekly; considerab-le technical help and equipment has
been obtained from the Australian Government, vThich intends to support
further development cf radio broadcasting. A survev to investigate the
feasibility and cost of ETV is being undertaken.
35.       Sabah has no education radio or television service but considera-
tion is being given to the possibilit of developing a service sZimilar to
that in Sarawak, with the aid of the Australian Government.

Malaysia - Nlote on Method of Estimatine M,lanDower Requirements
The Bank made separate manpower projections for West Malaysia,
Sabah ancd Sarawak for the periods 1966-70 and 1971-80=
Definition of "IMEmnow.-r Rpenrir rpm.pr+.-It

as the amount of manpower required to support the maximum potential growth

and the statistical basis used for 'WIest M4alaysia's overall manpower require-
ment proJIectIrions.. The need for trai.ned teacners was uerlvuu from uthiei
education system expansion plans.
The mission's procedures are similar to those used in OECD"s
MecditerrEaean Regional Project ly, except that future occupational profiles
(compositlion of manpowJer by category) of economic sectors were determined
by a difIerent method. The OECD me-thod assumes changes in occupational
profiles based mainly on inter-country comparisons whereas the missiorn
related c:hanges In occupational profiles to current local trends in growth
rates of various categories of manpower.
The Malaysian government' s 1965 lManpower Survey includes samiple
surveys of firms' expansion plans and related manpowier requirements by
category.  From these sample surveys elasticities of demand  / for each
manpower category were derived. These elasticities by manpower category
and by economic sector were used to determine future occupational profiles,
1/ The OECD method is explained by Fred W. Scholten, "The Peruvian
Experience in Educational Manpower Projections" (UNESCO: Interna--
tional Institute for Educational Planning, Fundamentals of Educa-
tional Planning: Lecture/Discussion Series, No. ll-L).
2/ Elasticity of demand is the growth of demand for a category relati.ve
to total labor demand in the economic sector.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
Essentially the same method was used for Sabah and Sarawak, but,
in the absence of basic manpower stock surveys similar to "Manpower Survey'
(op.. cit.), the projections had to be based on more fragmentary and more
conjectural statistical rounaations.
The Mission used a different method for the agricultural manpower
projections. Malaysia's demand for trained agricultural manpower come mainly
from two sources:  extension services in the Government; and land develop-
ment schemnes by Federal Land Development Authorities (FIDA) and similar
estate sclhemes in the public and private sectors. The requirement for
extension services was calculated on the basis of the target extension
service strength per 1000 farming families in small-holder agricultural]
sector (for West Dialaysia, for example, 2 extension agents for 1000 families
by 1L970, and 4 by 1980). The need for the estate sector was derived from
projected acreage to be developed into oil palm and other plantations and
from the current development and management pattern of FLDA oil palm schemes.
Lastly, it should be emphasized that at no point in the process
of projections were results of purely mechanical calculations accepted
unconditionally; their implications, quantitative and qualitative, were
critically evaluated - and modified in some cases - against other information
including expert opinions.
