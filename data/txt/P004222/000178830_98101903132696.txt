INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMIENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR AN
EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$8.8 million to
Malaysia for an education project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        In June 1967 Malaysia applied for a loan to assist in financing
an education project. An appraisal mission visited Malaysia in August
and September 1967, and the present project was thereupon formulated,
taking into account manpower projections and other project criteria and
with the Government's agreement.
3.        During the project's appraisal, it became evident that - except
in Sabah - the education program overemphasized general secondary education
and did not sufficiently stress technical and vocational education. In
January 1968 this issue was discussed with the Government, which was asked
to revise its five-year education program with a view to reaching a proper
balance in secondary enrollments by about 1980. The issue was not easy
to resolve; thus it was only in February 1969 that the Government adopted
a policy paper to that effect. The project appraisal was updated in
March and loan negotiations took place from April 21-28. The Government
of Malaysia was represented at the negotiations by Messrs. M. Shanmughalingam
(Ministry of Finance), Sulaiman bin Abdullah (Economic Planning Unit),
S.V.J, Ponniah (Ministry of Education), Abu Bakar bin Mahmud (Ministry of
Agriculture & Cooperatives), Ajaib Singh (Attorney-General's Department)
and Saw Chu Thong (Project Director).
4.        The proposed loan would be the eleventh for Malaysia.  The Bank
also made a loan of US$6.8 million in February 1965 to the Public Utilities
Board of Singapore with the guarantee of Malaysia, of which Singapore was



thlen a part (405-MA). The following is a summary statement of the Bank
loans to Halaysia, excluding the loan to Singapore referred to above, as
of l-larch 31, 1969:

5.        The execution of projects financed under Bank loans has been
satisfactory and the rate of disbursement of these loans has been roughly
in line with expectations. Loans for land settlement, industrial develop-
ment and power are expected to be presented to the Executive Directors for
their consideration during the Fiscal Year 1970,
6.        IFC invested US$818,000 in M4alaysian Industrial Development
Finance Berhad (i'EDF) in conjunction with Loan 348-MA and in addition has
taken part in two financing operations with HIIDF: in Miarch 1966 IFC made
a loan of US$1,275,000 and an equity investment of US$284,000 in Tasek
Cement, Ltd., and in May 1967 it made a loan of US$2,451,000 and an equity
investment of US$1,016,000 in Malayawata Steel, Ltd.

Purpose:             To cover the foreign exchange cost of a
project to construct 5 new secondary tech-
nical schools, 6 new vocational schools and
extensions to one other, 3 new agricultural

Commitment Charge:   3/4 of 1% per annum
PAIRT III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report on the proposed project is attached, entitled
"Appraisal of an Education Project in Malaysia't ( PE-4aa) dated Pay 7 , 1969.
9.        The project which the proposed loan would help finance is part
of the Government's current education program (1968-1972) and consists of
the construction and equipment of five new secondary technical schools, six
new vocational schools and three new agricultural schools in West Malaysia;
the construction and equipment of one new primary teacher training college
and three new general secondary schools and extensions to two others in
Sabah; and extensions to one vocational school in Sarawak. To implement
the project, a Project Director would be employed in the MEJnistry of
Education and a suitable person has been assigned to this position. In
addition, suitably qualified and experienced teachers will be employed in
the project's secondary technical and agricultural schools in West Malaysia
to provide 40 man-years of technical assistance in agricultural training;
and the project provides for 27 man-years of overseas fellowships for the
training of counterparts. The technical assistance and fellowships will
be financed from sources other than the proposed loan.
10.       The project is designed to provide maximum expansion of output
on a sound basis over the short term. The output from the commercial and
agricultural courses of existing and project schools would largely meet



the projected manpower needs for these kinds of skills during 1971-1980O
The output from industrial courses of existing and project schools, howevrer,
would still leave unsatisfied portions of MialaysiaTs needs for technical
manpower. A faster expansion of technical and vocational schools is pre-
cluded by an acute shortage of technical teachers, but a new technical
teachers training college is being set up with Canadian Government
assistance and should make a further expansion of tectiha1ca and vocational
schools feasible after 1971.
11.       During negotiations the Government confirmed that -½e principles
and objectives in the education policy paper, which the Governimient adopted
in February, will be incorporated into a new education program which is
to be part of the proposed Second Malaysia Plan (1971-1975).
12.       The Government recognizes that the review of the education program
requires more planning. The responsibility for education in Malaysia is a
Federal matter and rests with the Ministry of Education. Its Education
Planning and Research Division is now being reorganized and strengthened
with the assistance of the Ford Foundation and will undertake as its first
assignment the review of the education program.
13.       The project cost is estimated at about US$16 million equivalent,
of which about one-half represents foreign expenditures. These figures
exclude technical assistance and overseas fellowships, which would be
financed either from bilateral aid offers or directly by the Government.
The proposed loan would finance the remaining foreign exchange component
of the project and would include an amount of US$1.4 million for interest
and other charges on the Bank's loan to July 31, 1974. The balance woul4
be met by the Government.
14.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and instructional equipmertr
would be let on the basis of international competitive bidding. Local
manufacturers have a good prospect of being awarded the contracts for
furniture and, if this happens, the Bank would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component of this item. It is intended to allow a margin
of preference for local manufacturers of 15% or the customs duty whichever
is the lower; the tariff rate on furniture in fact exceeds 15% (see
Schedule 4 to the draft Loan Agreement).  The Government is exempt from
import duties on purchases for official purposes, but its usual practice
is to allow a margin of preference to local manufacturers in bid
comparisons.
15.       The loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed by December 31.
1974, which is the proposed Closing Date. The project itself is expecte?"
to be completed by June 30, 1976, with the termination of the technical
assistance and overseas fellowships for agricultural training. As in the
case of education loans already made to other countries, a grace period
of ten years is proposed, in order to allow ample time for the project .o
start yielding economic benefits.



PART IV - LEGAL IPNSTRUMEITS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the
draft supplemental letter from Malaysia on Educational Objectives, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.       The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions usual for this type
of project and follows the general pattern adopted in recent loans to the
Borrower. The Preamble to the draft Loan Agreement refers to the educa-
tional policy paper (paragraph 11); the supplemental letter on Educational
Objectives, to which this paper is attached, sets forth the Government's
intent to incorporate the principles and objectives in that paper into
the Second Malaysia Plan. Specific procurement provisions have been set
forth in Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement. Section 5.01 (b) of the Loan
Agreement contains a provision requiring the Government to employ a Project
Director, and Section 5.09 allows the Government to provide for insurance
of imported goods during transportation through its Government Stores
Insurance 'und, which has been found sufficient to cover the foreign
exchange risk.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
18.       An economic report on Malaysia (EAP-2a) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on December 27, 1968. Thanks largely to the recent
sharp increase in rubber prices, Mialaysia's prospects appear to have
improved somewhat in the first quarter of 1969.
19.       Malaysia's economic policies and financial management are good.
The Government is committed to raising the incomes of the Malays in rural
areas through agricultural and educational investments and to meeting the
growing unemployment problem by new land settlement and industrialization.
The Bank's lending program is contributing to these objectives. Savings
and investment in Malaysia are very sensitive to export values and
prospects, and therefore, the improved outlook for rubber is important in
terms both of the internal and external aspects of Malaysia's economic
situation. The Government is increasing funds for investment by raising
more revenues, holding current expenditures in check, and by non-
inflationary domestic borrowing. Public investment in 1969 is scheduled
to increase by 14 percent over 1968. Prospects are good for sustained
economic growth in the next few years at slightly over 5 percent per
annum, provided there is a substantial increase in the gross inflow of
long-term public capital.
20.       The last economic report estimated that Malaysia will require
an annual gross capital inflow of US$120-$160 million a year from 1969
to 1974. This compares with about US$70 million a year during the last



- 6 -
three years. VThile 'Palaysia may be able to raise modest amounts on the
private capital markets, it will have to rely on official sources,
including the Bank, for a substantial part of its capital requirements.
21.       Malaysia has ample ability to service additional debt on con-
ventional terms; public debt service at present amounts to 2.2 percent
of foreign exchange earnings. If all her projected external capital needs
are met with loans on conventional terms, this ratio will probably not
increase to more than 8 to 9 percent by 1980.
PART VI - COMPIIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - R1CO101ENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
