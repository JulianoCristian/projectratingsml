Re:  Republic of Niger: Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project 
Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement (Credit Number 3856-NIR)
Excellency: 
 
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement dated March 3, 2004 (the 
“Agreement”) between the 
Republic of Niger (“Borrower”) and the International Development Association (“Association”) for the 
above-mentioned Project.  We also refer to the letter from the Borrower’s Minister of Finance, dated 
September 20, 2010, requesting the cancellation and recommitment of the Project’s undisbursed resources. 
 
Following the Bank’s policy on the “Cancellation and Recommitment of IDA Resources”, cancelled 
IDA balances from ongoing operations would be available for recommitment to other purposes in the same 
country, either to supplement ongoing successful operations or for new activities that are consistent with the 
Country Assistance Strategy instead of returning back to the general IDA pool for future redistribution. 
However you should be aware that in such cases the cancelled funds will have to be recommitted no later 
than June 30, 2011. 
 
As you are well aware, since the February 2010 military coup, the Bank has triggered its policy OP 
7.30 (Dealing with De Facto Governments). As of the date of this letter and until further notice to the 
contrary, the Bank does not extend new financings to Niger, except on a case by case basis. Therefore, we 
bring to your attention that even though the cancelled funds of Credit Number 3856-NIR could in principle be 
recommitted, the conjunction between the fact that the funds would have to be committed no later than June 
30, 2011 and the fact that under OP 7.30 the Bank is extending new financings to Niger only on a case by 
case basis, this could result in practice in a simple cancellation of funds without providing Niger with the 
possibility to recommit the cancelled resources. If you nevertheless wish to proceed with the cancellation of 
funds of Credit Number 3856-NIR under the circumstances, then the Association proposes to amend the 
Agreement as set out below: 
 
1. 
The amount of the Credit is reduced by the cancelled amount of one million five hundred 
thousand SDR (SDR 1,500,000).  The total amount of the Credit, following the cancellation, is 
nine million four hundred thousand SDR (SDR 9,400,000).  All terms and conditions applicable 
to the Credit, as set out in the Agreement, remain in full force and effect.
