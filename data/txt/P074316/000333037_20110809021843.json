Some lessons learned included: the scope of\n            the project was too ambitious in relation to the\n            implementation capacity of the Government and the history of\n            reform programs in the country. The project needed to\n            achieve fairly wide-ranging reform in various sectors.\n            Reforms such as postal services reforms called not only for\n            government commitment but also for active consensus-building\n            to ensure buy-in by key stakeholders, the need for which was\n            underestimated at the outset. Reduced government commitment\n            for reforms (following departure from the Government of the\n            project's leading champion) and weak support of the\n            proposed reform of postal services by the labor unions\n            contributed to its delayed implementation. Project steering\n            committees should be inclusive to ensure that all\n            stakeholders are represented and have high level\n            representatives able to influence and accelerate decision making."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
