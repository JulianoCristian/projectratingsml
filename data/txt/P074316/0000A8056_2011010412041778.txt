                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of the project is to improve the efficiency, reach and depth of the Niger financial system so that it can fulfill its important role of
                         contributing to growth and poverty reduction. A healthy and developed financial sector is an important contributor to economic growth and macrostability,
                         through the provision of payment mechanisms, through savings mobilization and the supply of financial instruments for consumption and investment.

                         reduction was to be achieved through five technical components: (i) the strengthening of the environment within which financial institutions operate; (ii) the restructuring and
                         development of specialized finance; (iii) the development of financial intermediation of proximity (dealing with microfinance and postal financial services); (iv) social security reform;
                         and (v) capacity building.
                         The project has made substantial progress on components dealing with "Strengthening the Environment", "Capacity Building" , and "Social Security reform". Planned activities
                         related to studies on collateral, computerization of trade and credit registries as well as a seminar on justice and financial institutions were undertaken and an action plan with
                         recommendations to be implemented have been completed. A number of commercial banks, microfinance institutions, and insurance companies were beneficiaries of the capacity
                         building activities. These trainings that were co-financed by the beneficiaries contributed somewhat to a positive performance of banks and MFIs. However, the failure to complete
                         some key activities such as the privatization of he housing bank (CDN), and the failure to create the postal Bank (FINAPOSTE) to extend financial services to low income populations
                         made it difficult for the project to achieve its PDO in the end.
