                         The proposed Project will support the Department of Antioquia's long-term vision to improve the employability of young people a nd increase the competitiveness of the
                         labor force by: (i) increasing equitable access and retention in upper-secondary education, (ii) improving equitable educational achievement in upper-secondary
                         education, and (iii) increasing the proportion of public school secondary-education graduates who continue on to tertiary education.

                         May 2013, approaching the end-of-Project target of 66%; net enrollment rate has increased from 22% to 30%, 6 percentage points short of the target. Upper secondary completion
                         rates increased from 78.5 in 2006 to 80% in 2013, advancing toward the 85 percent target. The transition rate from secondary to tertiary school has increased from 23 percent to 30
                         percent since the Project began, nearly reaching its 31 percent target rate. The gap between public school and private school achievement test scores is widening in math and
                         language. Since the ICFES test changes annually such that scores across years cannot be compared, the PDO indicator instead measures the progress of public school student test

                         scores relative to the test scores of private school student. At baseline, the gap in language test scores was 0.9 points (43.6 for public school students exceeding the 42.7 for private
                         school students), this has fallen to -0.8 in May 2013 (which indicates that private school students score 0.8 points higher than public school students), and below the gap of -0.5
                         anticipated for end of Project target scores. Similarly, the gap in math test scores was 0.5 at baseline (42.3 for public school students and 41.8 for private school students) but has
                         fallen to -1.2 in May 2013 (45.7 for private school students, thereby overtaking public school students, who are scoring 44.5) and far from the end of Project target of public school
                         students scoring 1.0 points higher than private school students.

                         Other advances since the last disclosure include: (i) 5000 students were selected to receive direct subsidies, (ii) 6.3% of the 7930 eligible students were granted Conditional
                         Scholarships for Tertiary Education (0 at baseline, 15% target for Project end), and (iii) 76% of schools are implementing competency-based curriculum, up from a baseline of 28%
                         and quickly advancing toward the Project target of 80%.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured in December 2012. The PDO remains unchanged. The major changes and the rationale for these changes are as follows:
                         � Modification of Component 1 to include: (i) design of a monitoring system for the Scholarships for Tertiary Education program and (ii) indication that the design for an impact
                         evaluation will be developed. Originally, the plan was to undertake annual impact evaluations of the program. Since the first scholarships will be distributed in 2013, it is only possible
                         to design the impact evaluation methodology before the Project closes.
                         � Modifications to the Project's implementation agreements to assign all Project implementation responsibilities to SEDUCA and to eliminate all obligations and references to the
                         Supporting Agency (IDEA).
                         � Revision of three of the Project's four PDO indicators, and eight of the sixteen intermediate indicators, in part since the government has changed its data sources to measure some
                         outcomes and has created new methods for measuring other outcomes, and in part to reflect further expected progress during the extended Project period.
                         � Change in Project costs across Components to better align with the Departmental Education Plan.
                         � Modification of the Disbursement Table to: (i) reallocate funds among categories of expenditure, and (ii) clarify that under category (2) goods procured by either the Eligible Schools
                         or SEDUCA are eligible for financing under the category.
                         � Extension of the Project's closing date by eighteen months, from the current scheduled closing date of December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2014 in order to complete the activities and

                         achieve the Project Development Objectives. This is the first extension of the closing date.
