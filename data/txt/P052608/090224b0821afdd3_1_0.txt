                         rate has increased from 46% at baseline (2006) to 56.2% (the end-of-Project target is 66%). Retention continues to improve with upper secondary completion rates increasing from
                         78.5% in 2006 to 82%, inching closer to the 85% end target. The Project has also helped to increase the number of secondary graduates who go on to pursue tertiary degrees, with
                         the transition rate increasing from 23% to 30% since the Project began. Despite the increases in access, retention, and transition, the gap between public school and private school
