                         competitiveness of the labor force by: (i) increasing equitable access and retention in upper-secondary education, (ii) improving equitable educational
                         achievement in upper-secondary education, and (iii) increasing the proportion of public school secondary-education graduates who continue on to tertiary
                         education.

                         The project has consolidated its role as the main channel for improving upper-secondary education in Antioquia. Since the last Supervision (June 2010), the project has maintained a
                         sustained rhythm of satisfactory implementation: a) the project reaches the 120 eligible municipalities and 445 schools of which 221 are rural and 224 urban. In terms of school sub-

                         projects, 206 are under implementation (first phase), 221 are in the process of signing agreements (second phase) and 18 are being evaluated (third phase). More than 5,000
                         students are the beneficiaries of conditional cash transfers to increase the level of school attendance. The project has led to a significant increase in school enrollment and
                         improvement of the learning achievement test results during the last years, especially in the 25 poorest municipalities of the Department.
