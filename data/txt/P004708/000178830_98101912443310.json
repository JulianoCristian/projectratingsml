farmers by trained extension agents. Under the\n            project, the extension program will be extended to the 39\n            provinces not covered under the first phase project (being\n            financed under Ln. 1393-Th). The project makes provision\n            for: (a) further strengthening of the Department of\n            Agricultural Extension (DAE) and the establishment of clear\n            lines of command and coordination from the national level to\n            the districts, including the establishment of nine regional\n            offices; (b) increasing the number of extension,\n            supervisory, technical and support staff by about 1,800\n            persons; (c) local training for all extension workers and a\n            limited number of overseas fellowships and training tours to\n            neighboring countries; (d) the construction of two regional\n            training centers, about 40 combined provincial and district\n            extension centers, about 270 district extension centers and\n            about 310 housing facilities (with 3 apartments each) for\n            extension agents; (e) the procurement of vehicles,\n            equipment, furniture and demonstration materials; (f) the\n            employment of agricultural and engineering consultants; and\n            (g) project monitoring."}, "docdt": "1979-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
