~m0mic performance c7lrcumcribed NUl's abilty to successfully pursue
- anticipate4 loan recovery objectives.  Subsequent effortt at stg_tutal
adjustment have been undertaken'with the support of the lank and are havis<
some positive impact.
UtiliatAon of Credit 901-O.
S.        The credit was meant to be a auick disbursing fgcilit  yet the
rate of credit disbursement was sigificantly delayed salne the Government
did not provide itt share of matchbng funds. Also, the NIl's cuibersome
loan application process contributed to unnecessary delays. The Bank's'
waiver of the matching fund requirment enabled the project to conttnue,
and the pace of disbursement increased substantially.
Sub-Pro_ie t Status
6.        Of the 70 grolects financed under Credit 9OX-GI, more than half
were in agro-based industries and wood-4elated industties.  The number of
jobs prqvided.under this credit is estimated at 5,021. As of $arch 1988.
half lof the sub-borrowers were in arrears totaling'about US$4..1 millIon, of
which,VS41.7 million was-for principal and US$2.4 tillion was for intrerst
anda'other cearges.  Themaitor  roblem  thiat affected sub-project
performance have been  (a) poor sub-borroer managemnt;  (b) lack of
working capital; (c) 'tack of skilled personnel; and (d) overall
difficultios attributed to the poor business climate. The fu,l measure of
increaset' output and foreign exchange earngipv has yet to-bso-determined -'
given that som  p 6ojEcts are still under iplementation.
311 F"Binancial Performsnce
7.        The fTinanial iterittit  ofothe NIB was nearl" ieouardized durig
the course of isbursement of Creit 901-6UW. :Ns -net worth ~roded in
\relatlpn to the major foreign cunrenc$es and led 31  to violate its
AEreemg t with the lank in which it -ws to limit Its debt-equity rtuio to
5sl, The  ank's fIcial restrwcturina proposal was accepted by t> f
Govermment. Stringent, oversight measures need to be taken in the future to
prevent the.reoccurrerste of a financially precarious NIB.
1A IWnstAtutional Performance
8.        315 made sa.so significant strides In. mp;oving its overall
operations.  The level of arrears in NSB' portfolio reached a high of 68.7
percent in December 1984. This figure ae\unacceptably high and exceeded   
the 30 nercent ceilina set in the Ptoject Agreement. Nonetheless, the-N
level of_arrears representk   siftcsntpaz*5  to th2bA
period iohen the Bank first began its associas,Lon with-IM  in the ea4y
19705 when virtually all of NIs portfolio wa  ffected by arrears. AU4s=
the establishment of a trlninw within NIB is a sign of constructive1              -
prospects for building Nr'Bs h=   capital.
_ 9.        Nonetheless, during the early part of the project, NIl'Bt                  ;
management was characteriized by a successio  of different Managing
Directors, which offered little opportunity to makp need-ad and substantive

Achi1evements of Technical Assistance
10.    - The technical assistance component had a minAmal effect on
Improving 323' a institutional capabilities. Cont ltants!chosen to advise
NIB did not meet NIB or Bank expectations.  The disbursement of technical
assistance funds was significantly delayed, vith less than hAlf the funds
disbursed as of December 1985. 'The use of funds for overseas training 4d
not always reflect the Irioritv needs of RIB. It is not evidont that NIB
has the staff capabilty to fully utilize-the capacity of the computer
system' rchased under the credit.  The efficacy of the technical

11.       While NIb-as made some ijportant improvements in its iiternal

^Lessons Learned
14.       The most -imortant lesson learned from the implementation of
Credit 901-GH is the inherent limitation of project financing in the  w
contest of financial and economic pol*cies that are not conducive to
econamic development.  *eeded ecorl*ac policy reforms are beyond the
purvie* of individugl projects. 'The ba is of the structural adjustment
*lending, which is that the nolicv conte0t must cI8anae to enable individual
projetts and institutiq)s to develop, responds to\this fundamental point in
develodient -finance.  In an inappropriate economic climate, RIB could not,
function nrogerlv as a develogment finance institution.  Hence, fundamegtal
changes that transcend project finance are absolutely critical to the  ',
success of individual ;mojects.

the vorkina capital comoonent of the loan, which_had been debatedrLor to,

by sub-projects for foreign exchange to purchase nicessary production

-I.  THE. ECONOMIC CONTEXS       
2.01  '   During the period in vh*ih the second line of credit to NIB was
disbursed, Ghana's economy underwent a major restrctur # whose objective
was- o forestall an otberwise inevitable period of \recipitous decline.
Prior-to 1978, Ghana's GDP growth was largely stagpnt,  Beginning in l*78        :
GDP growth deqlined by an annual average of 2 percent through 1983. With
the advent of the Economic Recovery Program in 1983, however, Ghana's
economic performance improved i4th a 5 percent annual growtb  rate in i984.
Economic growth was estimated at 6 percent in 1988. Given that\1983 was a
watershed sea' for thc.economy, the economic climate, prevasllng during the
implementation of Credit 901-GB is discussed accordiAg to,   time periods 
pre-1983 and post-1983.



A* Pre0*W 83-  
2.02      At the time of the project's original appraisal in April 1977,
the Ghanaian e.¢onomy had detertorated.  Progress toward meeting the
objectives of Ome Five-Year Development Plan (1975176 - 197918o0  hAd been
greatly circumscribed by the slow growth in revenues and export earnings.
The major concern regarding Ghana's economic ptospects ras the country's
foreian exchaihne Dosition. A large proportion of the invastaimt in the
'country was in import substitution, which required the importation of raw
materials at-the expense of maintainin8g investment in traditional export-
earning agricultur&il projects.  The result was that the actual production
of Ghana's main export comodities -`-tocoa, timber, and gold\-- dropped by
25 percent between 1972 and 1975.
2.03      Also, because of-the lack of new exports in addition to the
traditional comnodities, severe limitations-on the availability of foreign
exchange for the import o' raw materials greatly constrained industrial
sector production.  The limits on foreisk eschange, coupled with. a lack of
cltar and consistent economic priorities for the allocation of import
1iclenses, aid overall inefficiencies in the licensing process, yiel ed
inef-ficient foreign exchange allocation in the manufacturing sector?.
Hence, businesses sought to circumvent the limitatoios and increase their
-raw material!supply by purchasing ab onad on the black market.
2.04     \Meanshile, the inf lsion rate increased to over lOO percent in
1977 and i988. as compared to kn annual rate of 30 percent in -975. The
inflation rate vas much highet than the rate in other lest African  -
countries and was eroding the 4bility of Ghimaian exports to compete both
in West AfrLcan -nd international markets.-
2.05      Whille manufacturing accounted for 14 percent of GDP in 1971,\ it
dropped to 10 percent in 1977 because of a lack of foreign exchange to
purcbase inputs.  The majority of the pl~nts were operating at 30 percent
-capacity.  In an effort to stimulate activities in thq  nanufactuiing and
- - - -ndus torial aactO.\ .nj2 uiuedL Ite  f uaIan -of. for  an exchange was
needed for essenti4l working capital.  But given the poor ecenomic. position
aAd outlook for the\foreseeable future, and the absence of cqncrete
Government moasures.to control inflation, the Bank postponed further
lending.                         - -
2.06      In June 19?8, however, the Government began a stabilization
orogrRm in which a) the currency was devalued by 58 percent against the-
dollar as. part of an overall program of realigning the ce4i in relation to
major currencies; b) budget deficit re4ction measures were undertiaken_ c)
bank reserve iatiou were increased, along with depostit and lending rates-to
reiuce liquidity and control inflation; and d) the treasury bill discount
rate was raised from 7.75 percent to 12 percent; e) import licensing
authorities wert to channel foreign exdhange to agro-industries emphasizing
food and 14 al raw materia  processing, export-oriented'enterprises, 'and
prioriti~ companies sufftrng from underutilized capacity4 1) price
controls ot a1l but the mt ess 9itial consumer items were refmved.          \

2.07      The liberaltzation of the licensing program tesulted in licenses,V
being issued without sufficient foreign exchange. Hence, foteign banks
refused to ship goods to Ghana without a letter of credit from foreign
banks, which delayed shipments and vastly curtailed the availability of
short-term import credit to Ghanaian Importers. In response to the serious
constraints in the import licensing system, the government revoked
'unnumbered' licenses which had allowed non-essential consumer goods to be
imported by Ghanaians with foreigh exchange in exterzal banks.
2.0~8     The constructive steps undertaken by the Government bolstered the
economy's prospects.  Also, the low debt service ratio proved tW be a
favorable factor that encouraged Bank support of the country's industries.
The Government subsequently received the support of the IMF, which approved
a one-year stand-by arrangement and Trust Fund Loan, which together totaled
US$102 million. Under these improved conditions, the second line of Credit
901-GM to the NIB was approved.
B. Post'- 1983
2.09      In April 1983, during the course of the implementation of Credit
901-Gl. the Government initiated the Economic Recovery Program, or
Structural Adjustment Program. The objectives of the program were to: a)
shift relative prices in favor of production, especially for exports and
efficient import substitution; b) restore fiscal and mionettry discipline;
c) help to restore infrastructure; and d) encourage ?tivate inveptment.
The major component of the Economic Recovery Program was the introduction
of a more realistic exehanie rate.  In September 1986, the Government
Introduced a second tier auction system, and in February 1987, the auction
and official-exchange rate were unified. Also, by February 1988,\ all
interest rates.had been liberalized.
2.10      The response of the economy to these reforms was initially
thwarted by the 1983 drought and lack of sufficient aid. Nonetheless, the
achievements of the Economic Recovery Program from 1983 - 1986 have been
promising., In 1984, economic indicators improved and.showed that growth
&Veraged more than 5 percent a year, the trade balance improved, the
g vernment's budget deficit was reduced substantially, and the growth in
the money supply was curbed.
2.11      In 1987-1988, Ghana entered the second phase of its structural
adjustment. The program had five main obj#ctivess a) liberalixing trade
and exchange rate policies by expanding the official foreign exchange
market; b) maintaining cocoa production gains by providing incentives for
producers;  c) improving tax policy and administration;  d) reforming
state-owned enterprises through commercialization and undertaking a
divestiture program;  and e) reducing the number of public sector
employees.
2.12      In summary, during the period of Lmplementation of Credit 901-
GH, NIB weathered a period-in which the economy had reached its nadir.  NIB
Jis to be credited with functioning as well as it did in the conttxt of
extraor"inarily challenging circumstances. As the performance of the
economy gradually Impioves, NIB's performance in terms of its financial
position should also improve.

C. Manufact    .Sector
2.13      At the time of project Appraisal, the manufacturing sector-
accounted for about 10 percent oi CDP and about 12 percent.of the' labor
force. 'The industrial base was largely fi4anced through 4A ambitious
pdblic sector investment prograi. The,large bulk of the investment during
the post-independence period from the late 1950s to mid-1960s was in state
enterprises financed by suppliers' credits and budgetary deficits.  Since
that period. increased e6phasis has been given to developing indiSenous.
small-scale enterprises
2.14      The idustrial sector's foundation was very weak. It was
boletere&d-by hX   import tariffs and quantitative c&itrols and
cha*acteiiaed by heavy relia xce on imports. Foreign exchange 'sbortage,s
resulted tn  mnder-utilization of capacity. Few inter-sectoral linkages
with otber sectors, such as agriculture existed. At the time of the
orlginal appraisal for Credit 901-GE in 1977, capacity utilieation auted
to only 30 percent.                                                  a              ',
245       Prior to the approval of Credit 901-GE, the Government undertook
a stebilizttion program In whic4 price controls were phased-out on all but
the most esWential consumer goods, Also, a set of-incentives including an
export bonus scheme was implemented, Out the high level of inflation and
the foreign \echange shortage virtually neutrali2ed the effects of these
measures.
2.16      More recently, a Bank assessment of Ghana's industrial sector
Indicates that: a) the available foreign exchange is insufficient to meto
full "apacity utilization; b) the domestic market'is insufficient to
kbsort the full capacity utilization production in some industrial sub-
sectotss c) the lack of si?fficient availability of raw saterials precludes
\the full use of industrial \apacity;  d4) public sector investqentsi can not
be adequateiy' manag6d to assure the required level of efficiency for goods
to be price pnd quality competitiveo  and e)  h limited qualitykof
production capacity circumscribes the industrial sector's ability to
compete with imported goods.
2.17      Some positive signs are beginting to emerge as a consequence of
recent reform efforts.  n 19d5 i4pacit  ut4lAzation increased to. 25
percent from an estimated,18 percent ixFl984, and is likely to have risen
further since then   The adventWof the foreign exchange auction has
benefitted the manufacturii* sector which can be more readily assured of a
steady supply of raw materials and intermediate inputs. ,Varia*ions'in
performance exist among the subsector.s  the production of soap, be4r, soft
drinks, saw mill 'and wood products has exceeded previous production peaks.
eanwhile;, production of shoes, textiles, and gprments is -4till far'lbetow
previous levels of production.

r   Financial Secto r
2.18      The prolonged economic deterioration in Ghana and the
inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies that contributed to the decline
ttsetbee  reflected  finthe lo  level 'of'financial intermediation in th
.and  he growing financial disintermediation.
2.19      The major source of liquidlty ezjinsion during Credit 901-GH
disbuErsement was central bank financing of public sector deficits.  The
increase in the money suppLy, in conjunction with a stagnant real GDP, led'      -
to an increase in  the rate If inflation from 10 pereent in 1972 to 123
percent 'in 1983. 'Due to the over-liquid economy, ba  eldind not accept
int,*rest bearing deposits for eFtended periods and the BOG did not increase
interest rates and hence, real deposit rates were negative over a prolonged
period. Moreover,kbanks had little incentive to attract deposits since
ixvestment lending opportunities were greatly limited.
2.20      Public alstrust in the banking system grew with additional
Government measures that included the demonetization of the 50 cedi ba k
note, compulsory payment by check for all transactions ekceeding 1,000
cedis. and the freezing of all bank accoumts in excess of 50,000 cedis;
The resulting disintermediation was charac erized by an increase in the use
of the infoi a1 financial sector.
2.21      Also, Ghana's capital market was in its infancy, and was
therefore unable to prpvide a substantial contribution to mobilizing term
resources.  The National Insurance Trust Futd and Social Security funds
were requlired to purc4ase low-yilding Government stock to fi$ance
Government deficits rather than :rivate sector investmentsi                < 
2.22      pecause the poor statue of the financial sector was a major
constraint to economic expanston, the Government undertook *ome major
reforms.  In addition to full interest ra4e4libetalization in;February
1988, lending rates, which had been controlled by the BOG, were completely
liberaliaeu in September 1987. All aectoral lending targets have been
removed, escept for agricultural lendlag.
2.23      Even with these changes, the banking system is still
characterized by* a) very largq non-performiAg loan portfolios;  b)
inadequate provisions for bank loans;  c) inflated profits c) high
o0erating costs; d) foreign exchange exposure: e) insufficient capital;
and f) weak internal accouAting and management functions. Customer
sarvices are of poor quality and resource mobilization\continuei  to be
constrained by* a limited range of financial instruments.
2.24     The Bank's 1988 financial sector adjustment credit is aimdat
supporting a comprehensive Government program for rebuilding the\financial
sector.  The objectives of the credit are tot  a) reform banking begu1atioi
and restructure distressed financial institutions;  b) Imp;ove deposit
4bilization and efficiency in credit allocation;  and c) Aevelop
securities and money markets.                            -

-II.  NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK
3.01      The NIB is Ghana's primary development ftnance institution.  Itl
wis established in 1961 to finance and promote private and p4blic sector
investment.   The purpose of the NIB is to assist in the financing of the
agricultural, commercial, industrial and cooperative sectors of the economy
through term loans, issuance of guarantees and pubscription of shares. The
Government owns the vast majority of shares in NIB, with foreign
inititutions and numerous small investors holding the remainder.
3.02      As other development finance institutions were established, such
as the Agricultural Development Bank and the Bank for Housing and -
Construction, NIB focused increasingly on the industrial and commercial
sectots. Current4y, NIB is the main Ghandian institution for the term
financing of induttry. The NIB performs commercial banking functions in
addition to its development banking and investment activities. Commercial
banking account,s for approximately 25 percent of its portfolio assets.  In
1987, the NIB had 9 branches, which represents an increase from 6 branches
in 1980.
A. Financial Status of NIB
1.  Profitability and Arrears          -i
.03       One of the main objectives of Credit 901-GH was to reduce the
level of NIB's arrears by,providing credit for imported inputs for NIB
clients, thus increasing their.production levelvsand improving their debtt
servicing capabilities.. As part of the Arrears Recovery Program ii the
Project Agreement, the NIB agreed tot \ \
inform the Bank of any rescheduling of loans during any quarter
that exceeds 5 percent of M'B s total outstanding loans\ in
arrears for 3 months or more, and to furnish a quarterl.
statement o£ rescheduling that describes each project
rescheduled, the amount, and reasonsl
b. allow only those borrowers 'that fall into akrrears du; to genuine
difficulties arising from exogenous economic factors to have
their loans rescheduled;  other delinquent borrowers-were to be
induced into loan repayment through lqga1 remeuies,      .
c.   create more regional branches to asspre more.effective cov&rage\.
and supervision of borrowers; undertake regularly scheduled
supervision visits;
Implement a tiaiely billing systei.
.3.04     NIB has had a long-standing problem with arrears. ID 1973, 99
percent of 'loans' to agriculture and P2 percent of loans to in-4stry were.
affected by arrears\ of over three motiths. The Government repaid all,
arrears outstaAding an NIB's public, lending, and in *975, the Bank

subse untly' appr ved.Loaa 1180-GH upon tuB establishing a special arrears
review committee.
3.05      During the implementatikn of Loan 1180-GH, arrears had reached a
high of 68.8 percent in March 1978, primarily due to a few large public and
"private enterpd.ses whose payments had fallen behind.  By September 1978,
the exposure rate was reduced to 22.2 percent.  The reduction in the level
of exposure was achieved through two major means: 3. by rescheduling 4.
number of loans to a few large public and private enterprises; and 2) by
pursuing clients in arrears.
.06      For purposes of Creait 901-GB, NIB was to ma1tain the amount of
.ts arrears outstanding at below 30 percent of its aggregate loan
portfo.io. In January 1983, the level of arreara outstanding had not been
reduced, largely because of the considerable delays in credit diobursement
and poor loan recovery.  In June 1984, about 53 percent of NIB'99portfolio
was affected by arrears, far in excess of the 30 percent.ceiling. The
percentage of NIB's-portfolio affected by arrears increased to 68.7xpercent
as of December 31, 1984.      .
3.07      Several factors contributed to arrears: a) a shortage of foreign
exchange to purchase imported spare parts; b) weak management in the NIB
and in sub,borrowers' insti'tutionst c) poor weather conditionG, as they
relate to agro-Andustrial projects; and d) weak market conditions due to
the general economi;"climate that was deteriorating rao4dly.
3.08      NIB made some efforts to improve the quality of its loan
portf4lio througp intensified loan collection, rescheduling, management
advice to sub-borrowers., and other forms of assistance.  Yet little could
be done in those cases where projects operated at low capacity.-ue to lack
of imported raw materials, which the Bank's line of credit sought to
address. Moreover,.INB.encountered difficulty in,pursuing lega} action
ag4inst those companies in which it or the Gove X nt had equity holdings.
3.09      Although NSB had committed itself to the Arrears Recovery Program
as part. of the Project Agreement, it was- not implementod - -had beene-
agreed. for example, in some instances, ? B did not inform the Bank of its.
rescheduling of l6ans. Moreover, because rescheduling has the;inherent
limitation of addressing immediate concerns, and not the underlying
protle Nthat leaa to.. loan default, NIB was to plan a rehab#litation
program for the oajr problem fub-borrxwers and a liquidatidn plan for
those companies Which were unviable. About 1 large firms accounted for
about 70 percent of Nil's recovery problems. 'Yet NIB did,not have the
financial ov human resources to engage in such operations.  The Bank agraed
to realloca\e US$300,000 of the credit to the technical assistance
component of the project to finance feasibility studies for the
rehabilitation of larger pro3ects for which NI1 had a high exposure.. It
was antidipated that this proclss would lead to a consolidat4on of NIB's
portfolio ani financial positidn. ,While some rehabilitation-efforts',have
beet undertaken, the full-fledged tLmplementation of project rehabilitation
has yet to be forthcoming.,
3.10      espite difficult economic conditions and high levels of arrears,
NlI lreported profits during the courss of the credit disbursement.  Yet the
I  e 



l _ ~~~8 - -
Bank considered 1IB's forecasts of its profitability to be unaccep8ab1e.
The 1981 audit report prepared by NIB'f auditors did not coument o4
portfoliq quality, rescheduling practites, the adequacy of provisions, and
resource position. Moreover, the confidential management report alluded to
the problem of high overdue loans and insufficient securities, but there
was no discussion in the management report of these major issues.
3.11      NIB's piofitability was overstated because of its accounting
practices. NIB accrued as income uncollected interest on loans which were
long past due and which should have been considered as non-pp rforming
assets. Hence, actual financial results were substantially different from
those reflected i! the accounts despite the Bank's recommendation that if
'NIB recognized the,interest\income in the year of accrual, a counter-entry
had to be made to increase the level of provisions each year by the entire
amount of interest accrued but not received.
2. Foreian _xchanae Losses
3.12      T#e 1984 Bank supervision missions noted that NIB was carry"hg
substantial;foreign exchange risk exposure dating back for several years.
The purpose of the missions was to determine the degree to which NIB was
carrying foreign exchange risk, and to help NIB avoid future exposure to
foreign exchange risk, which was especially needed given the recent
devaluations of the cedi.  The NIB exchange risk resulted from sub-loans
from Bank Loan 1180-GH and a KfW line of credit, which clients had already
repaid to NIB. The average maturity of the sub-loans was substantially
less than the maturity of NIB's foreign loans which finsaced the short-
term loans to sub-borrowers.  Instead of repaying the foreign loafs as the
sub-loans were repaid, NIB held onto the proceeds to revolve them. This
practice violated NIB's agreement with the Bank under Loan 1180-GH and was
attributed tot 1) an error in interpretation of the agreement; an! b) a
lack of understanding of the implications of the risk exposure.
3.13      NIB's audited accounts for December 1983 did not include
provisions fogi foreign exch_nge losses arising from the devaluation of the
cedi. The Bank estimated tbaat the amount of NIB's excha*ge losses exceeded
its net wo;t.   Ioreover, NIB could not iithstand the burden of additional
provisions riquired to ccdunt for NIB'  portfolio losses. The erosion of
NIB's net worth in relation to-the majot foreign currencies led NIB to
violate its credit agreement with the Bank which-limited NIB's debt-equity
ratio to 5:1.  Immediate action to financially restructure NIB was
necessary, particularly in the context of NIB needing to attract foreign
shareholders like DEG.
3. Financial RestructurinA
3.14     C*tinuil supervision of the financial status of NIB, which was'
operating in a precariouw political and economic climate, was a necessary
adjunct to the supervision of credit implementation. The Bank prepared an
Aide Mtmolre-in which a financial restructuring was proposed, The Bank
discussed the restructurina  plan with NIB in October 1984.  It identified
a) the need to raise NIB's equity b8se to a level to enable it qo sustain
its lending. activities during the n6xt several years while maintaining a
reasonable debt-equity ratio;  b) the need for NIB to obtain a mix of -N



rlsources compatible with the maturities of its projected lending
o0erations;  and c) the desirability of modifying NIB's ;urrent ownership
structure with a view to inFrease shareholding by private domestic and
foreign shareholders.
3.15      The Central D*k and the Ministry of Finance accepted the
financial restructuring proposal suggested by the Bank. The proposal;
included the following changes regarding NIB: a) assuring Government '
provision of an interest-free, long-term subordinated loan from the BOG
totaling 880 million cedis which was to redress NIB's immediate liquidity
problem; b) requiring BOG to\ bear losses due to foreign exchange qxposure
by NIB, which totaled 1,100 million cedis arisgng from earlier African
Deyelopment Bank  UADR), IBRD, and Kreditanstal. fur Viederaufbau (Rf)
loans; c) increasing NIB's author*zed share capital from 40 million cedis
to one billion cedis; d) opening part of NIB's capital to external
institutional investors; and e) increasing NIB's debtlequity limits to
10X1. While the latter ratio is indeed high, it was justifild by the fact
that it was not inconsistent with ratios prevailing,in other development
finance institutions abd nonetheless represented an improvement in NIB's
debtlequity ratio at the time, which was 22:1 if the ADB loan was taken
into account.
3.16      Given the   overament's commitment to uindertake these measures.
the Bank began to initiate informal contacts with potential foreign
institutional investors to attract foreign shareholders for NIB. Indeed,
the restructuring was a critical antqcedent to NIB obtaining needed
additional resources, mainly foreign currency. At-that time, Cridit 901-
GU had been fully committed, and to enable \NIB to maintain its lending
capability, additional resources were urgently needed.
4. Joint' Portfolio Review
3.47      As part_of the financial restructuring, the Bank undertook a
joint portfolio review of all NIB accounts in June 1985,in conjunction with
NIB and its external auditors. Among the fi#dings of the joint review were
the followings 
(a)  only very, inima1 provisions had been made, despite NIB's long-
standing problem with arrears; it was recommended that NIB
substantially increase provisions;
(b)  of the 215 outstanding loans, 134 or 62.3 percent were affected
==                 by arrears;  it was recommended that NIB vigorously pursue loan
recovery.
The joint portfolio review recommended close sUpervision and technical
assistance in NIB's fiMancial r1structuring and institution building.  The
Bank strongly recommended that IDA should couple its assistance with
pressure on NIB to itqprave its loan recovery. It was further recommended
that IDA should info  tNIB, and the BOG that unless improvements'were uade,
-  IDA may ftnd~ it necessay #to exclude NIB from participating in future
lending operations.    -                                '

B.  Institutional Performance
1. tIBmaB ient
3.18'     NIB's Board of Directors did not play a striag role in expressing
the concerns and views of IB within the Government and in supporting and
directing NIB?s managSemnt.  The rather.-recessive role of.the Board can be
partly attribtted to its recomposition which was stipulated by the,
Government in 1983.   An Interim ;Janagement Commaittee was established vhich
.effectively replaced the prior BoWrd.  The eleven-member Committee
conshajted of three Government officials (representing the BOG. toe Ministry
of IndVustries, and, t4e Ministry of Finance), four NIB senior staff, threeu
employee representat4ves, and one privte shareholder representative. Of-
major concern was the degree to which a*more -internally-cosmosed Committee
detracted from NIB's ability to meet its requisite needs for additional
capital fro* private foreign and domestic invest.ort. In 1986, the Interim
Management C6mmittee membeCip' was changed and reconstituted as the Board
of Directors. The three NIB employee representatives were dropped from
board membership and among those a4ed were a representative from the,=Ghns a
Commercial Bank and from thp Bank f*zk Rousng  ant Construction.
3.19      NIB's managemevt'was subject to significant upheavals during.the,
cou se olf credit implementation.  Trom 1978 to. November 1983# three, Acting s
.aniging DireetoLs had been successively appointed. A very competent
Managing Director was appointed in November 198,3i but  l8. te4ire was
in.eterrupted by his un'timely death in March 1985. \-uring,.the, largely-
disruptive period it NIB.management, supervision missions reported that the
professioftry skills of some sectnd line\managers did not coincide with job
requirements.  Overall, NIB dnagement 4±4 not assume 8 leadership role
-regarding personnel, administrat ve, and financial problems which were
critical to NIB's solvency. 'The relatively poor management petformance may
be partially attributed to the unstablo political, coditions prevailing-in
the country.
2. Orsanizatioan
3.20      Since the project appraisal in 1979, MI! has undqrtaken a numbhr'
of positivet=4eps to-re6rganize.its operations by eitablis*ingt, a) a loan
recovery unit in the Finance Dpspatetztt  b) a unit for project supervision
of loans and a separate unit\--for project supervision of jolft ventures; c)
- a-Research and Statistics Division and an Ixternal Loan-and Axpopt Advisory
tivision; and d)   'unit that consolidates various administrative services
into one adfinistrative division.  The purpose of NIB's resear(o,division
is to perform project-velated and industrial studies.  Its first task was
to prepare a survey of 80 companies to determine the level of operations,.,,
constraints, export potential, foreign exchange needs, and-other
charactiristics, which wpuld asseit NIB in its subsequent appraisal and
'lending operations.,
3.21      Although tiese organizational.changes were consttuct ve, the
necessary follow-up to the drganiz4tional restructuring, which includes the
est4blishmenk and  zpi4entation o$ appropri^tepolicies and procedures,.
*  wtsk'acking.  Also, the t*o supervision units lacked sufficient staff to
assure full-fledged operation of the project supervision:.  Moreover, NIB's
I ,.                                        .   == , 4  . i



-               ^\~~~ -  11  -
organizational structure needed to be revamped, so as to group
operationally-related activities on a regional or functional basis to
ausure more efficiency and coordination.  NIB requested assistance from IDA
to develop a five year institutional development itrategy. The disruptions
in tenure of the Managing Directors, however, led to a hiatus in the
implementation of the action plan that incorporated needed institutional
reforms. Hence, NIB's institutional structure improved but remained weak
during the course of the project.
3. Staffing and Training
3.22      As of December 1982, NIB iad 72 professional staff.  In 1983, NIB
added 9 new professional staff (3 economists, 4 agriculturists, 1 lawyer
and 1 statistician). During this same period, NIB lost 12 other
professionals, including 2 engineers, resulting in a total of 69
professional staff at the end of 1983. Many of the staff departures were
due to the availability of more attractive opportunities outside Ghana.
Hence, NIB needed to recruit additional engineers, accountants, economists,
and financial analysts.  The Bank recoumended that NIB undertake a review
iof its employee compensation structure as a means -.o attract more qualified
staff. Such a review is necessary since NIB's salary structure and
conditions of employment are less desirable than those of institutions with
which NIB must compete for a pool of talented professionals whose numbers
have decreased with the flight of many professionals from the country.
3.43      The total number of NIB staff and total administrative expenses
appeared very high "s compared to other development finance institutions
with a similar voluuee of operations. Also, the number of highly skilled
professionals is relastively small in relation to support staff. A
reduction in the number of non-professional staff would offer NIB the
opportunity to increase benefits and thereby attract more qualified
personnel.
3.24      Tn 1985, NIB established a training section.  As of 1987, NIB was
using the BOG as a training facility and-was in\the process of establishing
its own facility to accommodate 24 traiaees. The following courses have
'been among=those organised jointly with the DOG: supervision, basic and
advanced project analysis, finincial restructuring and bookkeeping. Also,
the NIB training department sponsored a basic banking and lon-
administration course. Overall, the training program focuses tore on
clerical activities than on increasing the banking qualifications of the
professional staff. The training programs lack sufficient emphasis on
project appraisal, loan recovery, and advanced project supervision, which
are the main areas where NIB performance has been deficient.
3.25     -During the one-year period from October1986 - October 1987,
approximately 2?0 of the 750 staff (which includes 630 operational and 1201
,non-operational' staff) attended some form of training course. Total
expenditures on training increased dramatically from 200,000 cedis in 1983
to 9,100,000 cedis budgeted for 1987.  From 1983 - 1986, however, actual
tra,ning expenditures were as 14w as one-third of the training budget.

4. Accounting and Management Information
3.26      During the disbursement tf the credit, NIB's Accounting
Department deteriorated, in part because of the loss of the competent
department head. The activities of the department consisted primarily of
recording transactions. Delays occurred in NIB closing its year end
accounting, which hampered the timaly preparation of audits.  A November X
1987 study found that significant wvaknesses still characterized the NIB's
accounting department.
5. Loan Disbursements and Administratio
3.27      NIB's loan disbursement proces,9did not incorporate systematic
review of each disbursement request to determine the progress of sub-
project itplementation or to certify sub-borr9wers' disbursement requests.
NIB did not send out payment notices to sub-borrowers at regular intervais,
and hence, some of NIB'1 sub-borrowers took advantage of the lax approkAh
to prompt payment, even if they had sufficient cash flow to make regular-
payments. More recently, the NIB reports that the billing system has since
-improved, and is continuing to improve with the ongoing conversion froii a
manual to computer programed billing system.
IV.  TH! RLO_JCT
4.01      Credit 90i-O4  provided a line of credit to NIB tot&lling US$19
million, which was allocated fors  (a) term lending (US$12 2 miiion) for
expansion and rehabilitation of qualified existing-firms and new high
priority projects; and (b) short-term credit for working capital (US$6
million) to finance the Isportation, of spare parts and raw materials fer
existing enterprises that Were subjict to.foreign currency shortages; (c)
technical assistaice to the Government (US$300,000).Ior formulation and
Implementation of an export and marketing program for non-traditional
exports; and (d) technical assistance to NIB (US$300,000) for improving the
internal 4perations of NB a-ni Improving 1ts=project pomotional efforts.
The goal was to enable Ghana's industries to improve capacity utilization
in priority manufacturing and agro-industries with the objective of
increasing exports and foreign eAchange earnings. It was further
anticipated that the credit would reduce the level of NIB'3s arrears by
providing nee-ded financing for NIB clients.  In this way, tke credit was to
play an instrumental role in strengthening NIB to make it a more effective
financial intermediary that would continue to be the main source of fiiance
for the country's industrial sector.
A.  Project Com onents
1.  Term Lendina
*    4.02   US$12.2 million of the IDA credit was allocated for, term lending
by the NIB to finance the full direct and estimated4 indirect foreign
exchange capital cdsts of manufacturing and agro-industrial projects. It
was estimated that foreign exchange costs would represent aiout 65 percent
of the total sub-project investment costs. I

borrowers,. The credit would cover abolt 80 percent of the foreign exchange
rdquixetnts of'the sub-borrowers;  in turn, sub-borroWers would contribute
20.percent in cash which the,Government would conwert to foreign
exchange.
3. Revolvins Imort Fund for Workina  Canital
4.04      The Govornment was to establish a Revolving Import Fund from .the\
repayent proceedi of the first round of working capital lo ims. It was
anticipated that the funds would revolve four additional times.  The
revolving funds would be on-lent by NIB in coordination with the.Central
Bank.  It was estimated that during the eight-year life of the fund, the
initial allocation of US$12 million should have financed'imported goods of
about.US$75 million in foreign exchinge. The Government's contribution of
foreigrr exchange was to be made available through t4e foreign,exchange
earned from the exports of supported proiects.
4. TechnicalAssistance      NI

44..2     It was evident that at least in the initial stages of the credit
\disbursement, sub-borrawers seek*ug asaistarce were unaware of the terms
and conditions of applying for tetm and working capital components'> in
partikular the interest rate, maximum repayment period, the prohibition
against prepayments, the client's obligatory contribution in',local
currency, and the procedure for changing local contributions into foreign
exchange. ?or example,'some perception existed that firms that had
previously.qualified for NIB loans could be eligible automatically under
the credit. \Hence. there was a need to communicate the terms and
conditions of the credi* to NIB staff and Potential borrowers.
4.13      NIB's project appraisal reports wete submitted to the Bank for
concurrence after approval by the NIB.  The, ub-pra3ects, howevvrX,'were
usually subject to a veappraisa I by tie B3*, ;which led to queries bein8.

warranted the deAree of indeen_dent iudLement that it 9ouiht.
C. Credit Disbursement
4.14      The second line of credit was originally con6eived as a ouick
d4ifarsic facilit  to assist Ghanaian-entrepreneurs in solving their acute
fozeign exchange problems.; The original closing date of the second line of
credit was December 31, l98i. There were three extensions, and the actual-
closing date was December 1985. As of July 1981#\ virtually no
disbursements had been made, although the credit had been in effect for
more than a year.  By 1984, significant improvements in the' rate of
disbursements of credit had been achieved, with about 50 prrcent 4f
cumulative d4sbursements having been made by the end of fiscal year 1984.
The final disibursehent was ma4e on August 19, 1986.\ With the ful.
cowmitment of the credit, the hI  had virtually ruz-out of foreign exchahge
to continue its lending operations.
4.15      Severai factors accounted fo\ the slow disbursement of credit:
1. Matchint Funds
4.16      Under the terius of the Project Agreement, .9he Government was to
make available 20 percent foreign \exchange matching .unds. In February
1982, the new Government chose not to contribute -As@ matching shre and the
Bank held back approvals and disbursements., The Government subsequently
requested t it the Bank finance 100 percent of NIB's foreign exchange               -
working.capital loan's
4.17      The Bank subsequently agreed to el Lunate the matching           \    . -
requirement. The basis for the Bank's decision to provide 10( perc:nt of
N- B's foreign,exchange working capital was that a) NIB's pipeline of
ptojects contained projects worth assisting; b) NIB's-management and staff



-  16- _ 
capacity, although considerably deteriorated, was still able to select and
appraise the relatively better projects; and c) NIB's loan portfolio would
be subject to increased arrears without additional funds.  With the advent
of this waiver, loan disbursements accelerated significantly.
2. Difficulty in Meeting Lendina Criteria
4.18      Sub-borrowers were slow in meeting equity requirements on term
loans, in part because the priority criteria stipulated in the Project
Agreement required that sub-projects must have.positive balance df payments
effects and maximize the utilization of domestic raw materials.  Compliance
with these conditions was difficult for some businesses, largely because of
the overv4lued.currency.
, 3.~ Government ............and .NhBdelays ';   ...................  
Cumbersome pro edures'were employed by NIB and Government
agencier in issuing import lJcenes,s title deeds, certificates of-
incorporat,on, and other documents necessary for processing of the loans.
which caused delays in project Implementation.
D.  Sub-Proiect Su!eMgision
4.20      In 1977, subsequent to the original appraisal mission for the
second line of credit, the Bank recognized that NIB needed to improve the
quaBty o0  its sub-project supervision.  NIB's supervision missions were-
not scheduled according'to the degree of operating problems being
encountered by sub-projects.  Also,' the lack of sufficient quantitative
data precluded NIB from-making adequate assessment of sub-projects.
Training of supervisory staff was acutel -needed.
4.21  \  Weaknesses in NIB sub-project follow-up were evident in the
duration of the credit. NIB's follow-up consisted mainil of loanX
collection that was ineffective. Lacking was (a) the monitoring of project
implementation; (b) close supervision of disbursements vis-a-vis
Implementation progress an# costs; and (c) regular post-implementation
,upervision.  Organizatio ly, project follow-up was the responsibility of
tie area departmints within NIB, although this arrangement proved
ineffective.
4.22      Hence, there was a need to establish a separate unit responsible
for systematicalIy and aggressively *ositorlpg projects utring the critic 1
impZ mentation and post-implementation periods.  This need was particularly
evident in light of the large number of problem projects and the ,
substantial volume of arrears. As indicated above, such units were
established in NIB but remained handicapped due to lack of adequate staff.

characterized by contradictions betwe4n relevapt provisions in separate

agreemenAs pertaining to the same client.  Also, in the absence of an
active project follow-up unit, the loan disbursement process was weak. The
disbursement process wg ld have been\more effective if NIB had \a) analyzed
eacq  request'for disbursement; b) detenmined the degree of progress made
in the physical components of sub-projects; and c) certified each client's
disbursement request prior to disbursement.
F.  Status of Sub-Proiects
4.24      The efficacy and desirability of the working capital component,
which had been debated prior to project approval, was borne out by firms'
need for working capital.  Of the 70 sub-prQjects financed under Credit
901.4B, 21 were In agro-industries; 4 In c4nsotruction; 8 in garments; 6
; in..metal, products; in paper p;oductAs 20 in wood-related indastries; and
8 i n£ o:thr 0#cto4s.   here wre, 52 *ub-projIcts whos. total costa. were. less
than US$ -million; only 2 were over US$3 million. Annex V provides a list
of sub-projects that received.loans under.Credit 901-GH and their
-chira6teristics.
4.23      For tho*e project's that have be*e  completed, project comoletion
times were generaliy longer than had been proj3cted. In five projects,
however, the estimated time period Was also the actual time period required
f6r implementation., Some projects had especially long period of
imple e tation, with one project in particular haviug an overrun of 51
months.
4.26      Projected average finaEciil rates of return raned from 17.0
percent to a high of 50.6 per ent.  The projected average economic rates of
return for sub-projects ranged from 10.8 percent to a e\ih of 50 percent.
4.27      Some inconsistencies exist In NIB data.  Bioticesmetie, Ltd,.
reported an actual capacity utilization of 5 percent and 50 jobs having
been created. Yet appraisal projections\anticipated 60 percent capacity
utilization and only 46 jobs being created. It is not clear how the
company-could have\created as muMy jobs when-it is operating at only 5
percent capacity, given that the projections anticipated fewer jobs being-
created at a higher levrl of capacity utilization.
4.28      Tht concerns cited by NIB fir probl~ms encountered by sub-
borr wers include a) lack of working capital; b) poor mXnage*ent; c) lack'
of skilled personnel; and d) overall poor business climate. For some of
the projects that have been abandoned, NIB is pursuing court action to
recover the loan. In otheZt abandoned projects, company assets were sold to
redeem the loan.
4-i~      In some cases, the reasons for project failure are not evident.
A.E. Soud Ltd., Logs and Lumber, and Clear Type Press sub-projects were
reported to be operating normally, although--in another analysis. the
companies were report d 4s not performing due to foreign exchange
adjustments. The Pom .ds Poultry lnterprises is reported to have failed
(but is being rehabilitated) because of the lack of wvrking capital and
poor manageusent, but another report from NIB notes that the sub-project did
not perform )ecause of foreign exchange adjustments.



_ 18 -
4.30      Analysis of the status of implementation of the sub.projects
indicates that some of the problems currently being encointered should 'have
been anticipated at-the te of loan aniraisal. For example, Bibiani Metal
Ltd. received US$943,210 under the second line of credit. The NIB reports,
however, that the company ii affected by poo7 management and lack of
working capital and the company has yet to replace most of its old plants
required for production. It is not clear whether the company has not yet
rbplaced its old plants because of delays in construction or because of
lack of sufficient working capital.  If the 'latter is the reason, then the
project scale in relation to available funds should have been more
appropriately ascertained *t the time of appraisal.
4.31      In another case. the Tano Soap Limited sub-project was reportedly
abandoned because of the companzy's iLnability to compete with bigger soap
induatries.- The reasons for the lnbility of the company to compete are -
not evideut, i.e. vihether it is not competitive on the basis of price,
market share, or quality.  If the company cannot compete with the larger
companies, it vould seei that ith appropriate wArket analysis, this,
problem could have been foreseen,at the tioe of loan-ppraisal.
4.32      The Edo Zip Fastener fanufacturing comapnyfs project was
abandoned in 1984 due to lack of funds to purchase raw materials to start
operations. This implementation status report does not account for the-
manner in which the company used the loan of US$74,000 granted under the
second line of credit. Also, Oti Rice Ltd. was reported to be likely to
fail because of poor geographic location. Clearly, this deficiency could
have been forestalled through proper marketing and input s%urce analysis in
the loan appraisal.
4.33      Given that some of the projects have been reported to be non-
performing due to exchange rate adju\stments, it is uncertain from the
information provided whether the sub-borrowers were utilizin4 term loans,
in which case they would have had an option to assume the full foreign
rxchange risk or pay a for"ign exchange risk premium of 10 percent per
Annum on outstanding sub-loan balances, with the Government assuming the
full foreign exchange risk. Alteruatively, if the funds were for working
capital, sub-borrowers would assume the full foreign exchange risk. to the
extent that sub-borrowers bore the risk, at issue is whether, in the
absence of exposure to foreign exchange risks, the sub-borrowers conld have
more successfully Liuplemented their projects and repaid their loan, Also
at issue, is wliether vorking capital sub-bortowers would have benefitted
from the availability of foreign exchange 'insurance' and whether they
would have purchased it in the event it had been offered.
G. Imoact on Exoort Promotion and \Foreln Exchanae Generation
4.34      The degree to which the project lncreased e*ports and generated
foreian exchange is untertain. The slow dsburs6ment\of the credit would
havelpostponed repayment and the eventual re-uie of the funds for further
export and ¶orei$n exchange generation.

4.35      As of March 1988, half of-the sub-borrowels were In arrears
totaling about US$4.1 million, of which US$1.7 million was for principal
and US$2.4 million for interest, and other charges.'
I. Technical Assistance to NIB
4.36      The purpose.of the technical assistance.component was to a)
improve NIB's appraisal capacity\and introduce more engineering and
technical expertise into the appiaisal process;  b) reorganize and
strengthen,NIB's project i#etiiification and promption efforts to rea\tivate

componeit had not had any positive #ffect. '^Th  two advisors chosen to
provide assistance to NIB totaling two staff years, were not successful in.
meeting expectations. to the extent that the Bank recalled the first
advisor.  As of De*vember 1985, US$327,qOO. in technical assistance funds had
yet to be disbursed, out of a total of Ussao$0ooo. ''Hence, the sub-project
appraisal process apparently did not benefit from the technical assistance
component, although the assistance provided could have contributed to NIB's
long-run institutional catpacity.
.   .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~o
4.38      A portion of funds was used for overseas train '    for NIB staff.
Some NIB staff from the legal oepartment also received staff'training in
overseas law courses. 'While NtU  personnel may have benefitted from the
training, some concern arises regarding th;  priority use.of limited
ttain gg funds.  NIB is mrimarily a banking institution.- nd hence. the
benefli tto 1IB of lesal trai     is not evident, particularly in  hight of
very pressing needs for staff training in appraisal and supervision and in
basic accounting and loan administration, which are ditectly related to NIB
activities.  Another concern is the rather significant sums, up to
US$12,000 - US$14.000, that were allocated fo*i-training for indLvidual NIB
staff members.  The fuMds could have been used to\benefit a broader ranR.
of NIF staff.  N;B reported that the overseas training "went a Iong way
towards strengthebing NIB operational capabilities,' although the
relationship between the overseas training and the objectives of the
technical assistai~ce, i.e. improving prd\ ect identification and supervision
procedures,.was not clearly indicated.
4.39      The senior advisor to the lana~ing Director,  ho  8s_to serve aS
Senior Director of Finance and Administration, was hired\in February 1986,
long after the credit became effective. A number of reasons may have
accounted for this delay, 'in- luding changes in'top management at NIB in the
early years of the credit dilbursement,.and the difficulty of finding an
appropriate candidate for the position. Moreover, the terms of reference
for the 18-month assignment were too broad. A.id. fro:R responsibili ies '

departuantC, the senior advisor was to formulate and implement'a plan to
correct NIB's iastitutional weaknesse. No information was provided by NIB
on the performance of the senilor advisor.
4.40      NIB also used technical assistance funds to purchase a computer
in 1985 #ith the advice of Bank staff. It is not evident that NIB had the
staff capability to 'fully utilize the capacity of the equipment.  Nor is it
evident that the consultancy services provided yielded the opportunity for
NIB staff to develop the proficiency to do so.
4.41      Hore recent assessment of NIB's computer capabilities suggests
thbt existing computer vystems in NIB are incompatible, which results in
less than optimal benefits being reaped by NIB from the equipment putchase.
,Also, the NI - aUks a sti*xtgy for computeri;$nj ita ope*ations-  The
applicability of curreit4htwrwrresd *otwre systems for, '4i-apraisal
cicivities has not been explored.  Long-term benefits, however, may be
forthcoming if NIB' dbvelolp  the protictency to fully utilize the purchased
equipment.                                                    Q:+
3. Tecical Assutne tth   o'rmn
4.42      The poor export performanceiin Ghana was attributed to a
combination of an overvalued exchange rate and the lack of viable export
promotion policies.  Rence, the Government retained US$500,000 of the IDA
credit to hire consultants to review and make recomendations for export
promotion policy revisions and to establish markets for exports.  The
operations of the Ghana Export Company and the Ghana Export Pr= 'tion
Council were to be reviewed.  There is no indication, however, o  the role
that this technical asgistance component played in redefining and
redirecting export policy. Juxtaposed to the simultaiieous effoFts made by
both the Bank and IIF during the cour#e of the line of credit,iwhose aim
was to promote overall stabilization and commensurate policies to increase
ikxvestmevt and export growth, the efficacy of this technical assistance
c6mponent would likely have been fairly modest by comparison with the
larger efforts.
K.  haes in the Project Agreement
4.43      Three significant changes were made during project
Implementations  a) the Bank waived the requirement for 'the Gove mment to
provide 20 percent matching funds, as discussed above; b)a relat4vely
novel component of the second line of credit was its incorporation of funds
or working capital.  At the time of appraisal, there was considerable
debate regarding the efficacy of, including suc4 a component; yet working
capital appeared to be the most deeded source 6f funds among sub-borrowers.
During tIe course ~f disbursement, workilng cap*taAl funds had\been fully
committed prior to the full counitment of term loins,l A'potentiai
bottleneck was created since the majority of sub-projects required both
tirm and working capital loans to increase productior. The Bank agreed to
NIB's request' to use remaining tenm loan funds also for working capital.
Menco, in pzoviding a *orking capital component in the cred#t at the outset
of the project, the Bank correctly anticipated NIB sub-borrbwerse most
p'essing requirement, although changes in the al4ocation of funds between
term loans i d woriing capital needed-to be madeO and c) the NIB was

Ro1ped to increase its debt-j quity ratio from 5:1 to 10sl, as was

tccepted by\he Bank.

l SURY AND LESSONS LEARNED
A. Overall Performance
5.01      Credit 901-G8 was disbursed at the nadir of Ghana's econ my.
Nonetheless, NIB nerformed reasonably well. Indeed, the President's Report
had correctly a&ticipated that the uncertain economic environment posed the
sole risk to NIB sub-borrowers and, hence, ihe succe4s of the project.
5.02      The close associatio* between the Bsank and NIB has resulted in
imnortant institutional develonments within NIB. In the early 1970s,
almo8t all of the NIB's loans were In arrears, whereas the relatively lower
level    arrears accrued during the credit disbursement represents a vast
I    vpromweast, despite very difficult eircumstancls. Moreover, the
establi-shmentlof a training unit within the NIBIis a sign of constructive
pkospects for building &ad solidifying NIB's human capital.
5.03      Credit 901-GI served as an interim steo to assist industry until
longer-tern refonms that address the fundamental flaws in the econoic
incentive structure could be un#ertaken. By itself, it did not have any
significant 2olicy 1m=lication   for Ghana's export promotin or foreign
exchange policies. Subsequent Bank projects that assist the

Government in pakig the transition to growth and export-oriented pol.eies          -
through stzuct*rai adjustment, however, have included the ingredients for-
successful policy reforms.
'B. Proiect Benefits
5.04     -The imediate benefits of the second line of credit include
increased employment in the industrial sector, foreign exchange savings for
businesses, and *reater use of existing industrial capacity.. The benefits -
from increased output, including foreign exchange earnings,.have yet to be
fully reaped given that many projects are still under Implementation.   For -
those projects that have been fully implemented, it is not evident from the
data provided by NIB the degree to which foreign exchange was earned from
expots          -

problems, and hence, were beyond the control of UIB or the sub-borrower.
Also, the Goverwnment's delay and ultimate decision not to mke the i0
percent miatching funds available precluded the project from meeting its
objective of being a quick dispensing facility.
5.07      Other factors responsible for sub-project problems and project
-bandoneent are within the control of sub-borrowers" maManement.   Improved
supervisory activitiee by NIB staff cofld have forestalled some of the
problems attributed tO poor management.
5.08      Improved ammraisal by SIX of sub-projects and analysis of the
attendant demand, market condit-ions, supply of imported rai materiils, -anO
other conditions affecting pr4spective project performanqe, could have
-prevented some of-the problems encountered by sub-projects. Somv.,sub-
projects may have not been approved if more stringent appraisal ictivities
had been performed.
D. -NIB Institutional DevelovMent
5.09      The NIB has made some constructive changes in its organitation
and operations.  Yet the performance of certain operational areas
project-supervision, appraisal, acco nting, and logn administration -
remains below the level needed for NIB to maintain lts financialI integrity
as-a development finance 'institition. Some of the co#cerns arise from
fictoreslbeyond NlB's control.  The flight of talented professionals from
Ghana, and the succession of Managing Directors handicavged some of--IB's
efforts to  prove internal operations.  Other factors, however, were              -
within NIB'sg control. Internal  qorgaiai.ations that occurred for reasons
other than for achieving substatwive reforms ate a-case in point.  Also=

5.10      The techbical assistance provided to  IB proved to be of-limited
value. The majoi roles of the technical assistance experts provided to NIB
were to a) prepare detalled guidelines.for project appraisal and
supervision; b) identify theocontents of appraisal and supervision reports;
and c) identify decision criteria and detailed guidelines for market
anlysis, technical analysis, fin"nisl and econamic analysis.  The
inefficacy of the techbical assistan'ce provided to NIB would appear to have
rendered the terms of reference for the consultant unfulfilled an NIB

functions.

B. NIB ?inanc.al Performanc;
5.13     MIB's overall financa l performance was difficult to determine in
the early part of the credit disbursement, in part tecause of the
inadeauacv of NIB' audit reogrts In assessing NIl's portfolio quality and
rescheduling practices. While in 1984 bank staff ldentified the financial
problems that threatened NIB's finqncial Integrity, at Lseue  S whether the
events that led up to NIl's precarious condition coild have ben observed
at an earlier.date by the Bank. Also,. the inability of NIB staff to
percoive the seriousness of the financial sLtuation that prevailed calls
iato-question the quality of the overall banking capabilities that prevails
at NI.
*  F.  KUB's B an am Canabilities
5*14      While NIB has made substantial progress since the lank has been
supporting its operations, NB still lacks many basic bank4ng attributes.
In addition to the operational areas discussed above, the following area!
of banking activity need to be Amprovedt
(a). s sasures for insurlina aEainst e.osure to avoidable foreign
exchunge risks; whileW the 1984 restructuring plan responded to
NIB's imdiate needs, additional action is needed to monLtor,

5.16      Despite these dr**tacks to Ni1's operations, NIB has been the key
institution responsible for the estiblisebment of wortwhile Industrial and
commrcial projects. Moreover, it shows prudence -in spreading its risk
through Joint ventures.\ Yet many steps need to be taken to improve
internal cottrol and assure financial stability.
G. The lank's Role
5.17      In addition to supervising actlvities performed under credit 901-
GO, the Bank played a major role In undertakitg a detailed joint review of
NIB's entire portfolio.  Indeed, the unfvorable econmic conditions In
|Ghana, in conjunction with disruptions h the tenure of NIB management,
warranted more intensive supervision actirities by the Bank.  In helping
NIJ to assure its financial integrity, the lank played a major role in    -
maintaining NIB as a development finance institution. MoreovT, the
amenabilLty of the Obanaian Government to the lank's suggested    -
restructuring solidified NI' s financial standing. Tbe untenable
alternative would have been tq il0w NIB to collapse. which would have
'served as an extraordinarlly negative precedent in the ChanaUln financial
covmmnity, and  hlich would have reverberated throughout that community in
the form of additional institutions succumbing to the poor economic
circumstances.

5.18      During the period of ivplementation of the second line of credit,
the lank's emphasis in its overall assistance in Ghani changed.  Since 1983
tho Bank's strategy has been redirected toward structural reforms of the
teconomy thats
(a)  improve the incentives for production and investment, and
(b)  promote long-term growth and development of the economy
by support structural adjustment lending

H. Lessons Learned
5.21      The implementation of Credit 901-GH suggests t4e potential as
weli as the limitations of project finance in the context of an economic
environment that is not conducive to development. Economic issues that
need to be' addressed are generally beyond the purview of individual
projects. Indeed, the basis for the Bank's structural adjustment program
is the recognition that only the fundamental reform of fiscal and monetarva
nolicies can offer the opportunity for sustained development and viable
financial intermediaries and sub-projects.
5.22      The o#1jectives of Credit 901-GH weve fairly m19dest--to provide
working capital and term lending in response to an immediate and pressing
problem. Essentially, the credit served as a 9=-Sa measure. As such,
the credit itself did not ensure sustainabilitq of NIB, although the Bank's
overall supervision of NIB's portfolio at least restored its financial
integrity. Instead, by use of the credit, NIB servqd a basic function a;
trans#4 rring resources to the industrial sector. This;function was
executed successfully.
5.23      The importance of thelworking capital component, which had been
anticipated prior to the approval of the credit, was borne out by sub-
projects' need for foreign exchange to purchase necessary inputs. *lso,
the Bank's continua1k supervision of the financial status of NIB was a
Aecessary adjunct to the supervision of credit implementation.  In
addition, the technical assistance component was necessary to improve tIre
financial manageienf capabilities of NIB.
5.24      Wale  NIB's efforts to engage in effective banking operations
4ere hampered by the deterioration qf the economic climate, the project was
tacking in several important respctczs thlt did not pertain to economic
conditions.  Economlic analysis of the rate of return that 'was required for



-26.
certain projects was not performed since NIB did not have the capacity to
calculate shadow pricest. Sub-project 5upervision and loan collection
procedures were very weak.  The technical assistance funds were largely
allocated after the bulk of the credit had been disbursed.  Most
importantly, RIB lacked the financial management capabilities to understand
the precariousness of NIB's financial position. Moreover, NIB's ties with
the Government precluded a necessary degree of independence.  This is
evidenced by NIB being unable to collect repayments from loans in its
portfolio that were granted to industries in which it or the Government had
a stake in ownership.
5.25      In the context of Credit 901-GM, NIB's effective monoi3o  over
long-term lending remained intact. Such a status granted to NIB does not
enhanve thp 'ov6rall vigor of the financial sector, and, it could be argued,
retard any potential vigor. These considerations are consistent with -a
emerging view at the Bank that-ths support of development finance
institutions alone, may not be justifLed. Moreover, analysis of Bank
lending to small and medium-sized enterprisei  V4gst, that in oountdes
where the banking system is relatively doveiop*d, comm2rcial:tb04*, could be
more effective in channeling credlt than development finance institutLons.
Hence., efforts to develoo a strona financial sector through f nancls
refoms, without a focus on a nArticlar financial institution, may lend
themselves to gteater success. This view is evidenced by the Bank's,
support of the Ghana FLiancial Sector Adjustment Credit in 1988, which will
offer greater opportunities to undertake the sector reforms that will
engender a wore capable and vigorous financial Intermediation for the
Industrial iector.
