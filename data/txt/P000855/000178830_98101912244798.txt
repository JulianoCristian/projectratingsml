NAkTIONAL INVESTMENT BANK (NIB)
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE ENVIRONMENT
A. The Economy 1/
1.01      The economic situation in Ghana has deteriorated over the past
four years. In 1977 Ghana had a population of around 10 million with a GNP
per capita income of US$380. The decline in real per capita income has been a
function of a stagnating economic growth rate which, since 1971, has averaged
less than 1 percent per annum, while the population has increased at an
average annual rate of 2.7 percent. The underlying pxoblems of the economy
have included poor productivity in nearly all sectors, its inability to
sustain current levels of consumption, poor export performance and large
leakages due to unofficial exports.
1.02      Ghana's foreign exchange position has become the key variable in
determining development objectives and the most important factor in its eco-
nomic prospects. Historically, investment in manufacturing had gone mainly
into import substitution which relied heavily on imported raw materials and
spare parts, and thus failed to save significant amounts of foreign exchange.
This policy was pursued at the expense of maintaining investments in tradi-
tional. exports. Indeed, improved export earnings between 1972 and 1975 in
Ghana's three main export commodities of cocoa, timber and gold (represent-
ing over 90% of the value of exports), were solely the result of increased
prices, as the actual volume of production fell by 25 percent during that
period. Total shipments of cocoa, representing over 70% of exports during
1977 were about 16.5% below those for the previous year. The 1978 cocoa
crop is expected to be 260,000 tons compared to 277,000 tons in 1977, a
further 6% drop in output. In addition to drought, slack investment and low
producer prices, unofficial border shipments in search of foreign exchange,
periodic shortages of inputs and labor shortages have combined to weaken the
export capacity of cocoa. Timber exports were seriously undermined by the
overvalued exchange rate and other disincentives. Gold production fell about
8 percent in 1978.
1.03      The inflation rate increased from nearly 30% per annum in 1975 and
around 50% in 1976 to over 100% in 1977, continuing at that level through 1978.
Failure to control the inflationary spiral may be traced to the effects of an
over-valued exchange rate and to increased deficit spending by Government,

"Ghana: Economic Position and Prospects" (Report No. 1533-GH) of
June 29, 1977.

financed mainly through the Central Bank, which represented 60% of total
budgetary expenditures in FY78. 1/ During the thrqe years to 1976, money
supply had grown an average of 34% per annum; this has been followed by
further sharp increases in the money supply to 50% in 1977 and to 72.2% in
1978. Poor harvests further fueled inflation by driving up domestic food
prices. In addition, such shortages forced the Government to expend scarce
foreign exchange reserves on basic food imports during 1978. Inflationary
expectations among all segments of the population has led to negative behavior
(hoarding, anticipatory price rises, wage pressures), which has further
stimulated price increases.
1.04      Despite domestic inflation far exceeding international levels, the
Government had from early 1972 to July 1978 maintained the official exchange
rate at V 1.15 = US$1. As overall confidence in the Cedi diminished, an
active unofficial market emerged in 1974. In the absence of Government action
to devalue, the rate rose to a peak of ¢ 12 = US$1 in April 1978. With in-
creasing scarcities in the Ghanaian market and the limited effectiveness of
price controls, the Cedi prices for imported goods have been increased to
reflect the parallel market rate. Thus, any foreign exchange obtained at the
official rate involved a large subsidy for the importer and any production
using officially imported inputs became highly profitable. The effect was to
depress official exports. Producers have found that the most profitable way
to export .,as been, through contraband for which they receive foreign currency.
1.05      Under extrdaordinary economic pressure, the Government on July 19,
1978, announced its intention to introduce economic stabilization measures,
commencing with a series of exchange rate realignments, suspension of un-
numbered import licenses (para. 1.14) and a reexamination of Government
priorities in recurrent and capital expeniditures. At the end of July a new
Government took power pledging to continue these policies. 2/ As of September
1978, the official exchange rate was realigned from 0 1 =$0.86 to ; 1 = $0.36,
a 58% devaluation against the dollar. 3/ The parallel market rate has now
fallen to around ¢ 6 = US$1. The 1979 Budget Statement reflects the Govern-
ment's commitment to control inflation, increase incentives to cocoa producers,
improve non-traditional exports, phase out price controls, eliminate most
non-essential imports, strengthen fiscal procedures, and reduce recurrent
and capital expenditures.
1.06      In late October 1978, the Government received an IMF mission to
complete negotiations on a Standby Credit of SDR 53 million (two tranches)
and an additional US$45 million from Trust Funds. Agreements between the
Government and IMF involve the implementation of a stabilization program

which would support the objectives of the 1979 budget. Projected growth in
the money supply during FY79 is 30% and Government estimates that inflation
will be reduced to around 50% by the end of 1979, to 25% in 1980 and below
20% after 1981. While these target figures may appear optimistic, increased
domestic food production should stabilize prices at the marketplace and
improved producer prices should result in more local raw materials being
available for manufacturing.
B. The Manufacturing Sector
1.07      The contribution of manufacturing to GDP remained between 12 and
14% during the decade ending 1976. However, that figure fell to about 10%
in 1977 due to insufficient foreign exchange for imported spare parts and
raw materials. Scarcity of foreign currency also accounted for the slight
decline in the value of industrial output from ¢ 725 million in 1976 to
¢ 705 million in 1977. The average annual growth of manufacturing between
1971 and 1974 had been 4.5% in constant 1968 prices; however, from 1975 onward
the growth rate became negative in constant terms compared to less than 1%
for the economy as a whole. Severe shortages of foreign exchange have led to
extensive underutilized capacity and the Government estimates that most firms
are currently operating at an average of about 30% of installed capacity.
The major challenge for the Government will be to restore sectoral growth and
to restructure Ghana's manufacturing sector, directing more toward export-
oriented activities, with emphasis on linkages between domestic agricultural
production and local industrial development. Success in achieving these
objectives will depend on Government's ability to adhere to industrial
investment and credit guidelines in the allocation of foreign exchange and
on cooperation from financial institutions, particularly the National Invest-
ment Bank (NIB). (Ref. para. 1.16).
1.08      Government estimates that manufacturing provides full- and part-time
employment to about 10% of the 5.5 million labor force. Past financial and
low cost credit policies have favored the importation of capital intensive
technologies, resulting in reduced capacity in the manufacturing sector to
generate employment. The new Government has recognized these policy deficien-
cies and attention is being focussed on the need to stimulate employment.
Specifically, the import license authorities and financial institutions have
been directed to allocate more foreign exchange and credit to labor intensive
activities. The Five-year Development Plan (1976-80) indicates as a policy
objective the stimulation of small-scale enterprises to generate through
fiscal and credit incentives a wide range of job opportunities in manufactur-
ing. The most recent Budget Statement (1979) supports this priority. Although
the most immediate Government sectoral strategy aims at revitalizing produc-
tion and earning foreign exchange, employment issues continue gaining greater
prominance. In 1975 the Bank, with UNDP funding, conducted a preliminary
survey of the small-scale manufacturing sector in Ghana as a first step in
formulating a project. Preparatory work is proceeding, with the Bank also
coordinating closely with Government to develop appropriate sectoral policies.
The recent devaluation and new credit policies will support efforts of institu-
tions such as the NIB in emphasizing more employment creation and reducing
average investment cost per job.



-4-
1.09      Private and Foreign Investment.   The private sector continues to
play a vital role in the manufacturing sector of Ghana. The contribution
of public investment to increasing production capacity in the economy has
been, for the most part, limited to larger parastatal corporations (such as
GIHOC-Ghana Industrial Holding Company), otherwise it is usually indirect.
Despite the key role of the private sector, private capital formation is low
(particularly in productive capacity) due to foreign exchange constraints,
inappropriate investment policies and a general lack of business confidence.
To demonstrate Ghanaian interest in foreign investment, the Central Bank of
Ghana had introduced a five-year program for the repatriation of about ¢ 312
million in blocked dividends and profits, offering favored treatment to
foreign investors operating in economic priority activities and those re-
investing in agriculture. The program, introducpd in 1977, was never fully
launched because of foreign currency constraints and a change in Central Bank
management. Government intends to reactivate the scheme during 1979. However,
the recent devaluation has significantly reduced Ghana's obligations to
investors without exchange indexing agreements.
C. Financial Sector
1.10      Monetary policy in Ghana during 1978 has aimed at achieving two
objectives; (a) to contain overall expansion of the money supply; and (b) to
influence the direction of credit to priority sectors. However, the first
measure proved unsuccessful as new currency was being issued during the year
to finance the Government's V 2.2 billion budgetary deficit. The banking
system's credit to Government increased by 74% (¢ 1.4 billion) over 1977;
conversely, credit to the private sector was held to 37% (S 172 million).
Under a recent set of Guidelines, Government has increased the average cash
reserve ratio of banks to 48% (from 20% in 1976 and 42.8% in 1977), a measure
which should prove more successful within the recent framework of a new
stabilization program. In further support of recent fiscal and exchange
rate policies interest rates were raised. Government has also now tightened
credit allocation guidelines to banks, with agriculture, export trade and
industry being allowed the greatest degree of credit expansion. Bolstered
by an IMF supported program, it is expected that new Government measures in
restricting growth in the money supply and in directing resources to high
priority sectors will succeed where previous attempts have failed.
1.11      New interest rate and credit allocation policies were introduced in
September 1978. Deposit rates in Ghana now range from 12% on savings accounts
to 13% on time deposits of over 12 months. Former rates were 4-1/2 and
8 percent respectively. New Central Bank lending rates are 12 to 14-1/2%
while new lending rates of banks are 13% for seasonal credit to agriculture
and export credits, 15% on Government guaranteed loans and 18-1/2% on all
other loans. Previous lending rates were 8 to 12-1/2%. Based on their level
of lending as of June 1978, banks have been authorized under new credit
guidelines to increase lending to agriculture and exports by 100%, to manu-
facturing by 50% and to mining and quarries by 30%. Banks are required to
limit their lending in commerce, consumer credit and import trade to Ore-June

1978 levels. Utilities and construction were authorized small credit in-
creases. As of September 1978, aggregate credit from commercial banks amounted
to d 881 million, of which V 692 million went to the private sector, mainly in
the form of short-term advances. Contrary to the new guidelines, commerce had
received the largest portion, 28.4%, with manufacturing getting 19.2%, agri-
culture 11.1% and mining and quarrying 7.4%.
1.12      Financial Institutions.   Currently 12 banks, including the Central,
are operating in Ghana. 1/    The following are the maiin banking institutions
in Ghana whose activities parallel those of the NIB.
(a)  Development Finance Department of the Central Bank (DFD) was
established to implement the small-scale industries and agri-
cultural credit guarantee scheme for the purpose of encouraging
commercial bank lending in those priority areas. As of March
1977, loans in the amount of ¢ 38 million had been guaranteed.
The DFD also guarantees mortgage loans for low and middle income
housing and has a Technical Division which provides advice on
Government projects and offers services to business for a fee.
A new and important function of the DFD is its sponsorship of a
Lural banking system. Five banks have al-ready been established
under local management and control to mobilize rural savings for
local lending.
(b)  Agricultural Development Bank (ADB).   Established in 1965 as a fully
government-owned institution for smallholder and commercial farmers,
the ADB had authorized and paid-in capital of V 45 million as of
December 1977. Resources are derived from public long-term loans
and ADB's own deposits. It has also acted as intermediary for an
IDA credit to agriculture. Of its 0 44 million in loans outstanding,
16% were long-term, 27% medium-term and 57% short term.
(c)  Bank for Housing and Construction (BHC).   BHC is a government-
controlled bank which began operations in 1973 to promote and
finance housing, civil works and building materials industries
in the public and private sectors. Authorized share capital is
¢ 10 million while paid-in capital as of December 1977 was ¢ 9.6
million. As of the same date, term portfolio outstanding was ¢ 42.8
million and short-term financing was 0 23.7 million. The Bank's
Second Highway Project has provided $7.5 million for a line of
credit through BHC for equipment subloans to domestic contractors
and quarry firms. Subloan commitments are now under way. Hire-
purchase and medium-term industrial loans carry interest rates
between 13-1/2 to 15-1/2%, but will be adjusted upward to conform
with new Central Bank regulations.
1/   Development banks are: the NI5B, BHC and ADB.  Specialized banks are:
the Merchant Bank (Ghana) Ltd., National Savings and Credit Bank, Social
Security Bank, Cooperative Bank and the Premier Merchant Bank; Commercial
Banks are: the Ghana Commercial Bank, Standard Bank (Ghana) Ltd. and
Barclays Bank.



-6-
(d)  The Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB), the largest commercial bank in
Ghana, is a government-owned institution with a paid-in capital
of 0 25 million, and authorized capital of 0 50 million. As of
June 30, 1978 GCB held 0 1,876 million in total deposits, a 36%
increase over the previous year. Loans and advances amounted
to ¢ 802 million, 41% higher than 1977. Return on investment was
31% in FY78. Over 80% of GCB's lending has been short term,
with most of funds in support of agricultural production (equip-
ment and inputs) GCB's agricultural lending prompted Government
to provide relatively generous foreign exchange allocations to
its clients. A Development Research Unit spearheads the drive
for agricultural lending and smaller-scale, usually service
enterprises. GCB lends at the maximum allowable interest rates.
(e) Barclays Bank (Ghana) Ltd. and Standard Bank (Ghana) Ttd. are
both incorporated in Ghana. Government controls over 50% of
Barclays and 27-1/2% of Standard's shares. The two institutions
have been most affected by excess liquidity in the banking
system, and have virtually ceased accepting deposits. A com-
bination of extreme caution and a decline in credit demand has
resulted in reduced lending levels during 1978. Whereas about
10-20% of lending had previously been medium-term, almost all
recent business has been in short-term advances and overdrafts
to preferred clients.
D.   Import Licensing
1.I3      The import license system which began in 1961, had been operating
under increasing pressure due to the overvalued exchange rate. Even with
the recent devaluation, a backlog of demand for foreign exchange from all
segments of the economy has built up over the years which cannot be fully
satisfied in the foreseeable future. Despite past attempts to allocate import
licenses according to economic priorities, many important industries and
subsectors have received insufficient foreign exchange to operate profitably,
or even to achieve break-even levels. The shortage of foreign exchange to
finance imported inputs ior local industry has led to chronic underutilization
of installed industrial capacity, aggravated in some instances by inadequate
technical management. During 1978, the Government prematurely liberalized its
import program by issuing more licenses than there were funds available. 1/
The move failed to increase the volume of essential imports. Instead, foreign
suppliers refused to ship goods without letters of credit from foreign banks,
thus delaying many shipments and virtually eliminating the availability of
l/   Government import program earmarked $785 million equivalent in foreign
exchange for imports in 1977, with about 51% being allocated to manu-
facturing and mining. In 1978, foreign exchange available has been
around $800 million equivalent, although import license authorities
issued licenses equal to approximately $1.4 billion. The 1979 Import
Program constitutes ¢ 2.433 million ($885 million) with 10.3% for the
export sector, 19.5% agriculture, 10.5% manufacturing, 20% transportation
and the remainder allocated to social sectors and basic consumer goods.
Licenses this year will conform to resources available.

short-term import credit to Ghanaian importers and businessmen. This experi-
ence has highlighted the serious deficiencies in the import licensing system.
The Government recognizes that improvement is a matter of urgency and has
formulated criteria aimed at the strict allocation of foreign exchange to high
priority activities (Ref. para. 1.16).
1.14      A significant measure thus far taken has been the Government's
cancellation of so called unnumbered licenses which had allowed Ghanaians
holding foreign exchange in external bank accounts to import large quanti-
ties of mainly non-essential consumer goods for local resale. As such
importations occurred outside the official framework, goods were introduced
in the economy at black market prices, thus reawakening demand and accelerat-
ing domestic inflation, while underpinning the curb market rate. Suspension
of this privilege has weakened the black market considerably and allowed
greater control of the importation system by Government.
E.   Government Strategy and Prospects
1.15      In 1977, the Government had formulated a policy framework for
manufacturing which aimed at correcting misallocation of foreign exchange
resources. The import licenses authorities were directed to channel foreign
exchange to agro-industries emphasizing food and local raw material processing,
to export-oriented enterprises, to priority companies suffering from under-
utilized capacity, and to labor-intensive activities. A set of incentives,
including a 30% export bonus 1/ and an import bonus tax structure favoring
firms using domestic inputs was meant to support the program. A special ¢ 30
million export credit facility was set aside for manufacturers with export
contracts. Unfortunately; the magnitude of the overvalued exchange rate, the
lack of improvement in foreign exchange availability and the continuing high
level of inflation combined to neutralize most of the Government efforts over
the past year.
1.16      The macro-economic policy changes over the past few months have
improved the sectoral outlook and the investment climate. The priority
objectives in manufacturing, which have undergone significant changes over
the past years, now have'very good prospects of being achieved. The deva-
luation combined with a reduced 10% export bonus has already begun to
influence potential exporters. In addition, steps have already been taken
to phase out price controls on all but the most essential consumer items, as
part of a policy to progressively place greater reliance on market mechanisms.
Wlhile continuing to stress the industrial priorities enumerated above for
existing enterprises, the Government will limit the creation of new indus-
tries to the following categories:
(a) Agro-industrial and fishing enterprises, including plantations,
processing and storage facilities;
(b) Enterprises, particularly small-scale using local materials;
(c) Export-oriented industries based on local inputs;
1/   In addition to the official price paid to exporters (at prevailing
exchange rate) Government added 30%.



-8-
(d) Local building materials industries; and
(e) Foundry and engineering works producinig replacement parts.
1.17      However, conditions in Ghana will not improve immediately.    Economic
pressures in both the public and private sectors which have built up in recent
years will clash initially with the Government's stabilization programs, par-
ticularly wage policies. Efforts to limit the 1979 budgetary deficit will
require cutbacks in existing Government programs and significant reduction
(33%) in real terms of expenditures on new programs. In terms of private
investment, devaluation and restricted credit flows should introduce much
needed discipline into investment decisions. Ghana is perhaps at its most
important juncture since independence. Vigorous assistance from external
lenders is needed to support Government policies. As for Government's medium-
term targets set out in the Five-Year Development Plan (1976-81), there is
little hope that the goal of an annual growth rate in GDP of 5.5% can be
achieved. Nor is it realistic to expect an average annual growth in manufac-
turing of 7.5%, as projected. However, the final two years of the Plan period
could possibly witness these respective growth levels if the Government's
program is successful. The assumptions and goals of the Plan will have to be
revised on the basis of changed conditions and the new policies. The task
ahead is a formidable one for the Government:   however, the package of new
measures constitute an impressive move in the right direction.
1.18      Export Program.   The Bank's recent Economic Report (No. 1533a-GH) is
devoted to a discussion of expanding Ghana's processed exports. Measures pro-
posed by the Bank sought to provide a viable framework within which progress
might be called despite the Government's refusal to devalue. With the recent
exchange rate adjustments and the Government's intention to pursue a flexible
exchange rate policy, the potential for developing a dynamic non-traditional
export sector has improved considerably. A major recommendation of the Bank
which is still relevant was that exporters receive a portion (50%) of their
net foreign exchange earnings for their future import needs. The Bank's
Economic Report (No. 1533-GH) provides extensive background on the subject.
The appraisal mission raised the possibility of assistance in an actual export
and marketing program, which was fully endorsed by top Government officials.
The program would consist of a team of consultants to first advise Government
policy makers on the range of export incentives. The next phase of the
program would be to identify the best products for export expansion (wooden
furniture, textiles, palm kernel cake, rubber and botanical products and
others have been mentioned). These two stages would be short-term, drawing
on the findings of past studies. Major focus will be on establishing a
Government apparatus to move exports into the markets, and a promotion/
marketing phase which would be undertaken, in large part, outside of Ghana
in potential market areas. The program is further discussed in para. 3.10.
II.   THE INSTITUTION
2.01      The National Investment Bank (NIB), a publiclv-owned development
finance company, was created in 1963 to promote and finance mainly private but



-9-
also public enterprises in all productive sectors. It is the main Ghanaian
institution for providing medium- and long-term financing to the manufactur-
ing sector which, as of September 30, 1978, had 2eceived over 85 percent of
NIB's investment approvals. NIB lends to a wide range of sub-borrowers of all
sizes. In 1978, over 50% of its loans went to small enterprises including
farms; however, these constituted less than 7% of aggregate loans by amount.
NIB has not yet become iavolved in financing large numbers of artisans, nor
has it been active in promoting industrial estates. Funds are extended
through term loans , subscription shares in enterprises, or both. Guarantees
have not been available since 1974. NIB also provides short-term financing
to term borrowers through the institutions's commercial banking facilities.
In addition, NIB also performs preliminary project reviews and feasibility
studies to identify and promote investment opportunities. Project advisory
services are offered to both new and ongoing projects,
A. Ownership
2.02      The Government authorized in January 1978 an increase in NIB's share
capital from ¢ 20 million to ¢ 40 million. Paid-in share capital is currently
M; 29 million. The Deutsche Entwicklung Gesellschaft (DEG) of Germany has
agreed to subscribe DM2 million (to be converted at the rate prevailing on
the date of payment) 1/ and Government also intends a further subscription;
combined these should increase NIB's paid-in capital to 0 35 million by
mid-1979. NIB hopes that improved profitability resulting from arn increased
lending program and higher dividends will be sufficient to attract private
investors to take up the remaining 0 5 million in mid-1980. NIB's present
capital structure is as follows:

2.03      Board of Directors.  NIB's Board consists of six members with the
Managing Director acting as Chairman. Other members include the Managing
Director of Ghana Commercial Bank, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank,
the Principal Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance and Industry and a
representative from the private sector. Membership will be increased to
eight to accommodate the DEG representative and the Deputy Director of NIB,
when appointed. Four Board members, including the Managing Director, are
appointed by the Supreme Military Council. The Board which meets once a
month, approves all loans and investments above ¢ 250,000. Applications
below that amount are approved by the House Committee (para. 2.04).   The
Board has played a productive and supportive role in NIB's operations.
B. Organization, Management and Staff
2.04      Organization.  Annex l(b) shows the organization chart of NIB.
NIB's basic structure has remained unchanged since establishment, with the
nucleus of the organization consisting of the three Regional Operations
Departments representing Greater Accra, the Southern and Northern regions,
the Development Service Institute (DSI), the Financial Department and the
Legal Department. This organizational structure continues to be effective fc-
NIB. A Commercial Banking Department serving NIB's term clients operates
under the Financial Department (para. 2.19).   The Regional Departments share
the tasks of project promotion and identification with DSI (para 2.06).
Supervision and follow-up are carried out by the Regional staff and branch
offices. The Financial Department plays a major role in financial monitoring
and data collection. The House Committee is the main internal organ of NIB
and is chaired by the Managing Director. The Committee which meets two to
three times per month to screen and approve loan applications, review port-
folio and handle financial and administrative matters, is comprised of the
Regional Directors, the Director of DSI, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Chief Legal Adviser and Chief Administrative Officer.
2.05      Decentralization of operations has become an important objective
of NIB. Six branch offices in the major centers outside Accra provide com-
mercial banking services to NIB's clients, receive and screen loan applica-
tions, supervise ongoing projects and do some project promotion. Branches are
authorized to process loan applications up to 0 50,000, otherwise the Regional
Departments and DSI take full responsibility for processing after initial
creditworthiness screening by branches. About half of all loan applications
received by NIB now pass through the branches. The current number of field
staff of around 20 will increase as more branch offices open. Management
intends to establish four more branches by 1980 including a small one, outside
headquarters, in Accra.
2.06      The Development Service Institute (DSI).   The DSI is responsible
for NIB's project preparation capability and project appraisals which are of
relatively high quality. It also conducts project reviews and feasibility
studies on a fee basis for public and private clients who are not NIB's
borrowers. At any given time, NIB has an average of 250 loan applications
under consideration, of which about 25 are screened out by the branches before
reaching DSI. About half of DSI staff's time is devoted to projects which



eventually qualify for NIB financing. DSI operates through four units:
Investment Development, mainly for NIB's participation in joint ventures;
the Agriculture and Industry divisions, conducting project analysis of new
or rescheduled projects; and the Statistics Division.
2.07     Management and Staff. NIB has a total staff of 374, of which 80
are at the professional level. NIB's management and senior staff are highly
qualified and capable of operating effectively under a variety of difficult
sectoral conditions. E.R. Obeng Ansong succeeded J.S. Addo as Managing
Director in January 1978. Mr. Obeng Ansong, the former Deputy, has worked in
NIB with a three-year interruption, since 1962 and intends to continue NIB's
operational and financial policies supported by the Bank. He is supported by
competent and experienced senior staff, including the Chief Financial Officer,
Director of DSI and the three Regional Directors. NIB's senior posts have
usually been filled through internal appointments. It is expected that the
position of Deputy Director will also be filled from within. NIB's management
staff serve on the Boards of various financial institutions (including the
Bank for Housing and Development) and public and private companies, and have
acquired the reputation for financially and technically sound judgements.
2.08      Overall quality of the professional staff remains quite good in
most areas of activity with the possible exception of internal auditing.
This key function which monitors the substance of financial reports will need
to be improved thro'igh the injection of more qualified personnel. Despite
some turnover at lower levels, NIB continues to recruit and train new staff
both through in-ho;ise programs and through courses offered abroad. Former
NIB staff hold top management positions throughout the banking and business
communities in Ghana. NIB has ol7ercome staff resistance to being posted in
branch offices by offering more rapid promotion to non-headquarters staff;
this policy combined with greater responsibility offered in the branches is
inducing more NIB staff to seek such assignments. Staff salaries have
remained competitive with those in the banking system, but slightly below
those offered by private businesss. NIB intends to maintain this parity.
2.09      Training.  In addition to in-service training by DSI, NIB staff
have participated in foreign programs offered through the Bank's Economic
Development Institute, West German bilateral assistance, USAID and the UN
Specialized Agencies. NIB maintains direct relations with a number of
foreign banks and, through cooperation with the Central Bank, has sent staff
on courses abroad. In this way, NIB had long ago eliminated its dependence
on expatriate staff. While the organization of NIB has proved flexible and
effective over the years, some staff weaknesses have begun to emerge, particu-
larly during the past year as active demand for high priority investments has
diminished. Specific areas have been identified for improvement. The empha-
sis should be directed at training in more dynamic approaches to project
identification and promotion and in strengthening the analytical capabilities
of supervision personnel. Most staff already working in these areas only
require occasional seminars to sharpen skills; however, the new officers
(around six) who will either be reassigned or recruited to operate in these
functions should undergo an in-service training program of at least one year.

Such staff would work in the area departments, branches and DSI, and would
strengthen NIB's capacity to rebuild its project pipeline with priority
operations. In addition, with the introduction of stricter project selection
criteria, NIB will have to strengthen its capability in project analysis (para
2.35). Here the situation mainly requires on-the-job training of existing DSI
staff through seminars. The proposed technical assistance to NIB (para 3.09)
is designed to cover NIB's 'training requirements.
C. Policies and Procedures
2.10      Financial Policies.  NIB's lending, investment and borrowing
policies are contained in its Bylaws with the exception of the debt-equity
ratio limit currently 3:1 which is in NIB's Act and the upper limit of inter-
est rates, determined as a matter of overall policy by the Central Bank and
Ministry of Finance. The Act was amended in February 1978 to allow for a
capital increase and to provide the Board with discretionary powers to deter-
mine the appropriate level of dividends. NIB currently lends for projects of
all sizes, with a lower limit of 0 5,000 and upper limits established in
its Bylaws. NIB's financial exposure is usually limited to 75 percent of
the total cost of a project, but may be raised to 90 percent when covered
by security (of not less than one and one-half times project cost) and
guarantees. NIB may take controlling interest or primary management respon-
sibility ini an enterprise only in exceptional circumstances related to the
protection of NIB's investments. Majority participation by NIB should be
relinquished as soon as possible. All equity investments are made for pro-
motional purposes and with a.view to reselling to Ghanaian investors. The
Commissioner of Finance must authorize resale of equity in public enterprises.
Equity investment in any single enterprise is restricted to 10 percent of
NIB's own equity, and total equity investments are limited to NIB's paid-in
share capital plus reserves.
2.11      Current Interest Rate and Exchange Risk.  Since September 1978,
NIB charges 18-1/2% interest on local currency term loans and 17-1/2% on
local currency agricultural loans; both carry a 1 percent commitment fee on
undrawn balances; a one-time 1 percent service fee is also charged. Short-
term borrowers pay 18-1/2% with no charges. These rates conform to Central
Bank regulations. The maximum lending rate is calculated as a floating rate,
maintained at 5% above the present Central Bank rate of 13-1/2%. Whiile an
18-1/2% rate is still completely negative when measured against current
inflation, it represents an improvement over former rates (para. 1.11) and a
move in the proper direction. Over the next four years the rate is expected
to become positive (para. 1.06). In addition, although NIB's average cost
of local money has increased from around 6 percent to 13%, the institution
enjoys a comfortable average 5-1/2% spread on its local resources.  Under
the first Bank loan (1180-GH) subborrowers are paying 12-1/2% on foreign
currency loans and are assuming the full foreign exchange risk. In view of
the Government's policies of exchange realignments, these terms represent a
significant move toward the real cost of foreign exchange in Ghana. Deposit
rates offered by the Commercial Banking Department range from 12 to 13 percent
on fixed-term deposits, in line with current interest rates of commercial



- 13
banks in Ghana. Bylaws require NIB to lend at fixed interest rates with
regard to NIB's cost of capital, its operating expenses, maintenance of a
sound financial condition and NIB's competitive position among domestic
financial institutions.
2.12      Project Promotion and Identification.   NIB never had to aggressively
pursue new business, as clients always sought NIB's assistance. Equity invest-
ment and joint ventures have represented the main promotional thrust of NIB
directed mainly to larger enterprises. As of December 1977, NIB had promoted
42 projects, all involving equity participation by NIB. Total project costs
were around ¢ 200 million, of which NIB financed about 24% through loans and
10% through equity. Projects range in size from ¢ 28 million for a rice and
grain scheme to ¢ 440,000 for a light fixture company. Most ventures were
jointly undertaken with Government or foreign private interests. Half are
wholly privately-owned. Some 19 projects were in the manufacturing sector
and three involved establishing Linancial institutions. Agro-industries,
commercial plantations and food processing account for another 19 projectso
One printing and publishing firm represented the only service ,aterprise.
Projects have tended to be larger than those normally financed and NIB wishes
to promote a wider range of smaller and fully Ghanaian-owned projects,
developing more linkages between agriculture and industry. Since NIB's
promotional role has been traditionally a passive one, a number of sound
project ideas which should have been actively promoted by NIB had gone
unrealized, or in a few cases were financed by commercial banks. In addition,
over the past year NIB's active pipeline of projects had run down due to the
lack of foreign exchange and.a general mood of discouragement in the manufac-
turing sector. Loan approvals as of September 31, 1978 were ¢ 6.7 million
compared to V 26.6 million in 1976. A major issue for NIB is how to restore
its operational activities to pre-1978 levels through active project promotion;
another issue is how to focus attention on only the highest priority schemes.
With the introduction of stricter project selection criteria (para. 2.35),
NIB must move vigorously to revitalize business interest and encourage project
ideas through an aggressive promotional program. This will require greater
attention on improving promotional techniques. NIB itself must demonstrate
through public information its willingness to assist and finance priority
enterprises. To achieve this objective, NIB will need additional technical
and engineering skills to properly identify and promote new ventures. NIB
should be prepared to consider unconventional approaches, such as Hire-Purchase
arrangements which would allow the institution to operate in new activities
while minimizing its exposure. Groups of small-scale manufacturers of spare
parts might be mobilized and grouped under such an arrangement, thus taking
advantage of economies of scale in both production and in NIB's operational
costs. The proposed consultants working directly with NIB staff would provide
assistance in identifying priority activities in which the bank could direct
the newly acquired promotional expertise (para. 3.09).



14 -
2.13      Appraisal.  About half of the prospective projects come to NIB
through the branch offices, and the other half through regional departments
and DSI. After initial screening by branch offices and regional department
staff, DSI maintains full responsibility for appraising loan applications
above ¢ 50,000. DSI often provides technical assistance to prospective
clients and undertakes most of the technical and analytical work required
to prepare the project. The Bank has found the quality of appraisal work to
be thorough and dependable. The Loan Analysis Report of DSI forms the basis
for decisions on project lending by the House Committee and the Board. DSI
staff conduct project reviews in accordance with investment guidelines of the
Government (paras. 1.16 and 2.35).
2.14      Supervision.  NIB has concentrated with notable success considerable
effort on strengthening supervision procedures over the past year. Area
Directors now visit the field twice a month, personally following up on major
problem projects and loan collections, and overseeing the activities of
regional department and branch staff. As of September 1978, there were 358
loans outstanding; every officer assigned to supervision takes primnary
responsibility for about 12 projects, scheduling visits to each project
once a quarter unless more frequent technical or managerial advice is needed.
Supervision staff also determine which projects should be reviewed by DSI
for possible rescheduling or legal action. Project visits are now basically
determined by the level of problems to be resolved. Problem projects are
visited far more regularly on a special schedule formulated in cooperation
with DSI and the Financial Department which receives and monitors loan repay-
ments. The House Committee reviews a list of problem projects at every
session and initiates appropriate action. The Financial Department prepares
monthly statements on loan collections in the three administrative regions
(Greater Accra, Northern and Southern) and at the end of each quarter, submits
to management a summary of arrears. The use of accounting information to
identify possible problem projects has become a common practice. Supervision
officers, with assistance from DSI, have begun collecting more quantitative
information including production costs, break-even analysis and financial
projections for their reporting. To a large extent, staffing and coordina-
tion problems noted a year ago, have been overcome. The proposed technical
assistance (para. 3.09) will further support efforts already introduced to
upgrade quantitative skills of supervision staff.
D. Operations and Financial Performance
2.15      Characteristics of Operations, The level of NIB's term lending
operations, as shown below, has fluctuated between 1971 and 1978, reaching
approvals of ¢ 26.6 million in 1976. The level of approvals has depended to
a great extent on the timing of large projects and, of course, on the avail-
ability of foreign exchange, the key factor in the decline of the 1978 lending
levels.

Cumulative approvals (Loans, Equiity and Guarantees) as of September 30, 1978
totalled about 0 177 million, representing 843 operations, of which 8o
percent by value amounting to ¢ 157 million were loans, 9 percent equity
investments, and 3 percent guarantees. About 87 percent of the value of loan
approvals were for industry, representing 462 loans totalling ¢ 136 million.
The remainder went to agriculture with 316 loans amounting to ¢ 20 million
and loans to financial institutions. The main industrial subsectors for which
loans were approved involved tiles and ceramics (16 percent), agro-industries
(12 percent), mining and quarries (12 percent). Metal industries, wood
working and food processing are also important subsectors. In line with
Government priorities, 57 loans have been extended to expand production of
industrial raw materials with an average loan size of V 150,000.
2.16      As of September 1978, NIB had extended loans of over ¢ 1 million
to 25 companies, representing a total of 0 84 million or 56% of total loan
approvals. The remaining loans numbering 754 tended to smaller operations
with an average loan size of 0 87,000. Of total industrial loan portfolio
outstanding as of the end of September 1978 (including projects under cons-
truction), 88 percent of loans by value went to the private sector. This
compares with 80 percent. at end 1976 and 63 percent in 1974. Loans to
agriculture which had increased regularly since 1971, began to decline in
1977 as a result of NIB's policy to scale down agricultural lending. NIB
will attempt to limit its role in agriculture to commercial scale ventures,
particularly those producing raw materials for domestic mai,ufacturing and
those in the private sector engaged in large small scale food production.
Agricultural lending as a percentage of portfolio outstanding was about
18% as of September 1978. Most agricultural loans were for rice and maize
operations in the Northern region and for cash crops in the Southern region.
2.17      Geographical distribution of NIB's loan portfolio has never posed a
major problem. Since inception NIB has attempted to diversify its operations.
As a result, about 31 percent of loan portfolio outstanding has been in the
Greater Accra Region, mostly in industry (Accra/Tema), 47 percent has gone



- 16 -
to manufacturing and agro-industries in the Southern Region, which includes
the developed coastal areas, while the remaining 22 percent has gone to the
North where agriculture and agro-industries dominate. There is considerable
scope for increasing NIB's manufacturing lending in this latter area.
2.18      Equity. NIB's approved equity investments amounted to ¢ 15.0
million in 42 projects as of September 1978, of which ¢ 13.3 million had been
subscribed. Majority positions were taken in five companies, a food processing
company which has now become profitable, a foundry (with foreign partnership)
which is under construction, two rice plantations and milling enterprises and
a large brick and tile plant; the latter three recently commenced operations.
Thirteen of the enterprises in which NIB participates, representing 27% of
the capital paid in by NIB were profitable in 1977 and 5 firms, representing
¢ 990,000 or 7.4% of NIB's subscribed capital, were operating at a loss. The
remainder of the projects were either under construction or were too new to
judge. Aggregate dividend income from nine companies amounted to ¢ 1.7 mil-
lion in 1977, compared to 0 148,000 in 1976, and represents the largest
dividend earnings of NIB since inception. Due to overall economic conditions,
1978 dividends are expected to decline.
2.19     Commercial Banking. The Commercial Banking Department which
opened on April 1, 1975 had received demand and time deposits of 0 36.4
million as of December 1977, compared to 0 23.6 million a year earlier.
According to recent Central Bank regulations, which are slightly less con-
fining for development banks than for commercial banks, NIB is iLequired to
keep 30 percent of deposits in cash or with the Central Bank and must in-
vest between 20 percent to a maximum of 40 percent in treasury bills and
Government securities at NIB's discrietion leaving between 50 to 30 percent
for short-term investments. Short-term approvals were 0 5.9 million in 1976,
0 6.4 million in 1977 and 0 8.4 million as of September 1978. It should be
noted that during the first three quarters of 1978 commercial banking loans
had exceeded term lending. During that period of economic recession, ma-nu-
facturers have required more than usual short term advances for bridging
operations and working capital. Commercial banking has not only proved to
be a useful and profitable adjunct to NIB's operations, but NIB has displayed
a high degree of competence in its management. As of the most recent audit,
December 3, 1977 earnings from commercial banking constituted 36 percent of
gross profit, but 65 percent of NIB's profit after appropriations for reserves
and provisions.
2.20     Arrears and Provisions.  Since the Bank's initial contacts with NIB,
arrears have presented a major problem. An important contributing factor has
been the shortage of foreign exchange for spare parts, raw materials and
equipment. Other reasons for arrears have been marketing and technical
:                                                    B i :  l   N ev> t > -S. : i LE l ... . ............ =XW> .. > StZ... Lt ai->b .N.eNtS U.L.

- 17 -
problems, weak company management and the impact of bad weather on agricul-
tural loans. Recently, NIB has demonstrated a strong capacity to control
arrears through improved supervision and collection procedures (para 2.14) and
a program for rescheduling projects confronted with difficulties beyond their
control. As a consequence of these efforts, the percentage of portfolio
affected by arrears of more than three months excluding projects under con-
struction, (exposure rate) was reduced from 77% by the end of 1975 to 31.2%
as of December 1977. The most recent exposure rate as of September 1978
was 22.3%, an impressive accomplishment given the economic environment
(Annex 8).
2.21      During 1977 and 1978, 83 loans had been rescheduled amounting to
0 19.1 million. Of these, 55 were agricultural loans, representing 20% by
value of portfolio affected, whose repayments were affected by poor weather
conditions. Manufacturing loans constituted 53% of portfolio rescheduled
(16 loans), the majority of whose problems were caused mainly by the short-
age of foreign exchange. The remaining 12 projects operating in service
industries, faced managerial and technical problemm as well as foreign ex-
change scarcities. Of the loans rescheduled, 5 projects had fallen behind
in repayments as of September 1978; one industrial project had clearly overcome
problems and it was too early to judge the performance of the remaining 77.
NIB has agreed to notify the Bank immediately of any rescheduling of loans
during any quarter, exceeding 5 percent of NIB's total outstanding loans in
arrears of more than three months and to furnish a quarterly Statement of
Rescheduling describing each project, amounts rescheduled and reasons for the
actions.
2.22      Of 338 loans outstanding, excluding projects under construction,
as of September 1978, there were 139 loans amounting to 0 15.6 million
affected by arrears of more than 3 months, representing 22.3% of total port-
folio outstanding*. all of them in the private sector. The absolute amounts
in arrears was ¢ 6.0 million or 8.5% of portfolio outstanding.  Of these 139
loans, legal action has been contemplated against 56 clients representing
loans totalling approximately 0 2.5 million.  As for the remaining 83 clients,
NIB is reviewing the situation every month to determine appropriate action if
no progress is made on repayment.
2.23      To cover these arrears, and equity investments exposed in projects
operating at a loss (para 2.18), provisions had been increased to ¢ 7.2
million as of the most recent audit (December 31, 1977), representing 6.3% of
outstanding term loan and equity portfolio. Provisions more than adequately
cover absolute amounts in arrears, and are considered sufficient by NIB's
management and the Bank to cover possible defaults on existing loans. Another
important factor in NIB's coverage against arrears has been the large increase
in the Cedi value of NIB's loan security and fixed assets, the result of
inflation and the recent devaluation.



- 18 -
2.24      The Bank encourages NIB's management to continue pressing for
recovery of arrears. The Government and NIB agreed at negotiations that
appropriate measures, satisfactory to IDA, would be undertaken by NIB to
maintain portfolio affected by arrears of more than 3 months at below
30%. Arrears recovery procedures to be employed by NIB were also discussed
and agreed at negotiations. Given the Ghanaian envirornment, NIB deserves
considerable credit for its significantly improved supervision and
collection procedures and for actively pursuing defaulters into court,
when necessary, despite at times having been under political pressures.
2.25      Auditors.  Pannel, Fitzpatrick and Company Ltd. have audited NIB's
accounts annually for the past eight years and have performed their task
satisfactorily.
2.26      Financial Position. As of September 1978, NIB's financial condition
remains basically sound with equity and reserves totalling ¢ 35.2 million
and term borrowing of V Ill million (adjusted for the latest devaluation)
against a total term loan and equity portfolio of V 135.6 million (adjusted).
NIB's audited financial statements for the period 1971-77 are summarized in
Annexes 4 and 5. Gross income as a percentage of total assets rose from 7.3%
in 1974 to 10.6% in 1977, and is estimated to be 10.7% in 1978, largely as a
result of a marked increase in return on loan portfolio. NIB's annual net
profits have increased substantially and consistently throughout the period.,
but not as rapidly as total assets. As a result, net profit as a percentage
of average total assets was 1.7% as of December 1977, compared to 1.3% in
1976, due to the high level of provisions. However, in 1978 profitability
begins to improve (3.3%) as a result of increased interest rates. Annual
appropriations for provisions increased from V 232,000 in 1973 to 0 3.2
million in 1977. However, net profit as a percentage of average net worth
(return on equity) rose from 6.5% in 1976 to 9.4% in 1977 and 18.5% in
1978. Administrative expenses as a percentage of average total assets re-
mained steady at about 2.6% through 1977 (Annex 9). Substantial increases
in provisions required and financial charges have not allowed for major
increases in net profitability of the portfolio.
2.27      Debt-Equity Ratio.   NIB has operated with a debt-equity ratio of
3:1 since inception. The recent authorized increase in NIB's share capital
was meant to allow NIB to remain within its statutory limits for the for-
seeable future. However, the recent devaluations have considerably increased
the value in Cedis of its foreign exchange borrowings and of that proportion
of NIB's loan portfolio outstanding denominated in foreign exchange, repre-
senting about 15% of loans outstanding prior to devaluation and about 30% of
portfolio under the current exchange rate. Prior to the recent appraisal
mission, NIB management had not considered the implications of the exchange
realignment on NIB's financial position. Rough calculations indicate that
the devaluation has moved the ratio from 2.3:1 to 3.2:1. Full subscription
of all remaining authorized capital would reduce the ratio sufficiently to
allow a margin for the proposed line of uredit (resulting in a 3:1 ratio),
but would be insufficient to cover the effects of further possible exchange



- 19 -
adjustments or any additional external and domestic borrowings which are
expected by 1980. NIB has been operating commendably for 15 years at a 3:1
ratio. The institution's sound leadership and firm commitment to good finan-
cial management has been amply demonstrated under difficult economic and
sectoral conditions and in particular, through its arrears recovery program.
NIB and the Government have agreed to increase the official debt-equity ratio.
The issue is further discussed in para 3.18.
E. Prospects
2.28      NIB's Strategy.  NIB's impact on the economy and future volume of
activities will depend essentially on its ability to find adequate additional
external resources. On the quantitative side, given foreign exchange avail-
ability, NIB has been able to finance economically sound projects despite the
economic environment. Most of its funds will continue to be allocated to
manufacturing and agro-industrial projects. While the largest proportion of
funds will be for medium and larger enterprises, NIB will continue its active
support of smaller-scale enterprises. Promotiaioal efforts should allow
greater innovation in types of projects to be financed. NIB limits its role
in agriculture so as to avoid duplication with the Agricultural Development
Bank, but would continue to finance support services, such as land clearing,
land preparation and harvesting equipment essential for concentrations of
farmers producing similar crops. In this way its control and supervision
responsiblities could be reduced to more standardized arrangements, with
supervision emphasis continuing to be focussed on manufacturing.
2.29      Pipeline.  Management, having used the period of reduced lending
during 1978 to consolidate and review operations and supervision procedures,
is now concentrating its efforts on revitalizing a pipeline depleted through
inactivity. In addition to identifying new term lending, NIB staff have
surveyed existing manufacturing and agro-industrial firms whose operations
either have been disrupted or are threatened by foreign exchange shortages
for working capital.
2.30      As of December 1977, NIB had identified some 45 manufacturing,
agro-industrial and related service projects requiring term-financing which
warranted examination by DSI. However, due to the absence of further Bank
or other external assistance, NIB had been unable to follow-up on most of
these and when appraisal mission reviewed NIB's most recent pipeline as of
September 1978, it contained 25 projects. All except four of the projects
are in the private sector; 16 project applications are to assist existing
enterprises with acquiring machinery and equipment to either resume or expand
operations. These projects amount to ¢ 89.3 million, of which ¢ 57.2 million
($20.8 million) is foreign exchange (Annex 6).
2.31      In its review of existing companies encountering production and
operational problems due to foreign exchange working capital shortages, NIB
has identified 62 fIrms, most of which are currently or have been previously
associated with NIB. Of these, NIB estimates that 52 companies requiring
¢ 28 million ($10.2 million) in emergency foreign exchange for working capital



- 20 -
would immediately qualify for assistance under Government's and NIB's guide-
lines (para. 2.38). About 20 of these companies represent export projects,
representing 36% of the amounts required. As NIB staff continues exploring
the demand for such short-term financing, it is estimated that additional
eligible companies requiring at least a further $10 million will be identified
within the coming months (Annex 7).
2.32      Resources. Based on its pipeline, NIB expects to approve about
¢ 72 million in term financing during 1979 and 1980, representing about $16
million in foreign exchange (¢ 44 million). The term lending component of
the IDA credit would provide $12.2 million which would cover-NIB's require-
ments through late 1980. With the resumption of Bank Group lending we expect
additional foreign exchange term resources to become available to NIB by 1980.
OPEC has already expressed interest in extending $1.3,million equivalent to
NIB. To meet the estimated foreign exchange working capital requirements of
existing manufacturing and agro-industrial firms thus far identified, NIB would
on-lend $12 million (O 33 million at the current rate) under the proposed
IDA/EEC line of credit which after the first round of sub-loans, would be
relent through a Revolving Import Fund four additional times before being
repaid to Government (paras 3.06 and 3.07). NIB has the appraisal capacity
to handle the upsurge in business resulting from the proposed term lending
and working capital components of the IDA/EEC supported line of credit.
2.33      NIB's resource position as of September 1978 is presented in the
Basic Data Sheet at the beginning of this report. NIB's local resources are
composed primarily of equity., borrowings from the Central Bank of Ghana and
USAID, and its own bond issues. Foreign exchange borrowings outstanding
include the African Development Bank (ADB), KfW and the first Bank loan,
totalling about ¢ 53 million (as of the most recent devaluation). Both ADB
and KfW loans have been committed. About $500,000 remained uncommitted on
the Bank loan, DM2 million expected from DEG's equity investment and about
$900,000 equivalent to be on-lent by Government from the European Development
Fund Indicative Aid Programme, constitute the only foreign exchange available
to NIB. The proposed Bank Group line of credit would represent the only
expected major source of foreign exchange during 1979. Public sources of
external financing have been awaiting a resumption of Bank lending to Ghana,
specifically to NIB, before venturing forward with new assistance.   NIB's
management intends to take the initiative in reestablishing contacts with
other possible lenders to fill the foreign exchange resource gap which
would begin emerging during 1980.
2.34      Financial Forecast.  Over the period to 1982, NIB's financial
performance is expected to be satisfactory despite the prevailing difficult
economic environment. Net profit as a percentage of average total assets is
projected to rise to 3% by the end of 1979, while net profit as a percentage
of average net worth is estimated to increase to 15%. Growth in profitability
will be due to increased earnings on an expanded loan portfolio and also to
commercial banking profits. Higher lending rates (para 2.11) will more than



- 21 -
offset the effects of increased costs of NIB's borrowed resources.   Liquidity
is adequate; debt service coverage remains at a minimum of 1.5 throughout the
period. NIB will continue its policy of maintaining adequate provisions and
plans to increase general reserves. Annex 10 provides the underlying assump-
tions of the forcasts and Annex 9 provides financial ratios analyzing NIB's
performance.
F. Investment Guidelines
2.35      NIB has considerably strengthened and tightened its project invest-
ment guidelines to conform with new credit regulations and the.Government's
investment priorities in allocating foreign exchange.   The guidelines con-
stitute an important device by which NIB can ensure that it is financing
projects of the highest priority. All projects receiying loans or equity of
over $200,000 equivalent undergo an.economic rate of ret&rn.analyis-.
Financial analysis is conducted on all projects involving loans above $50,000.
For both term and working capital financing under the proposed IDA credit,
projects would be screened and reviewed in accordance with criteria favoring
enterprises which would efficiently earn or save foreign exchange and, as
such, would support the following:
(a) Export-oriented projects in which incremental foreign
exchange earnings are proven to be significantly in
excess of foreign exchange used in production.
(b) Utilization of indigenous raw materials: preference
will be given to projects utilizing at least 40% local
raw materials in production.
(c) Maximization of installed industrial capacity will
be favored in credit allocation, so long as other
economic and financial efficiency standards are
met.
(d) Import substitution schemes would be screened to
ensure net foreign exchange savings in subsectors
not experiencing excess capacity.
In general, NIB will give priority to enterprises whose production output con-
tains 40% domestic value added. In certain firms which offer other economic
advantages, such as high export earnings, ernployment creation or linkages
within the economy, NIB will accept 30% local value added.
2.36      These priorities focus on dealing with the economy's severe foreign
exchange shortage. In addition, projects should show evidence of creating
employment at a reasonable investment cost per job. In the Bank's first line
of credit the average cost of job creation was about V 66,000 (US$24,000) per
job, or ¢ 38,000 (US$14,000) foreign exchange cost per job; for the kind of
medium-sized projects financed these are reasonable figures when viewed in



- 22 -
the West African context. These levels compared favorably to NIB's overall
investment cost per job in 1978 industrial approvals which was about $25,000
and $18,000 foreign exchange cost per job. The average cost per job created
on NIB's future projects is not expected to exceed these figures. NIB has
initiated a review of how its activities might maximize employment generation
and reduce the cost of job creation without fundamental changes in the types
of clients it serves, i.e. excluding artisans and industrial estates. Pro-
vided Government continues its policy of realigning the Cedi vis-a-vis major
currencies, the capital costs should move more in line with real values and
facilitiate the greater use of labor in manufacturing and agro-industries.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background and Objectives
3.01      Background.  The Bank's contacts with NIB began in November 1973.
A loan of US$10 million equivalent, approved in December 1975, aimed at in-
stitutional improvements and provided much needed foreign exchange for NIB's
industrial term borrowers. The loan, made effective in March 1976, has
progressed satisfactorily with about US$100,000 remaining uncommitted and
approximately US$7.1 million thus far disbursed. 1/ Some 30 sub-projects have
been financed under the loan representing total investments in the order of
US$29 million. Eight projects were in manufacturing, half of which depended
mainly on local inputs and ten projects were in agro-industries.   Eight
sub-loans supported services and the remaining four financed quarries. The
institutional and procedural improvements introduced during the first loan
have withstood strenuous tests over the past two years and NIB's operational
performance has been noteworthy, given the continued economic decline in the
country.
3.02      A second line of credit was originally appraised in April 1977 just
prior to a serious economic downturn in Ghana. Overtaken by economic deter-
ioration and in the absence of concrete Government measures to deal with
the economic situation, the Bank decided to postpone further lending. However,
given the country's improved outlook due to the decisive policies of the new
Government, a NIB Project, can now contribute more effectively to Ghana's
long-range economic development.
3.03      Project Objectives.  A second line of credit to NIB -would support
the institutional development begun under the first loan and restore NIB's
operational activities, mainly in manufacturing and agro-industries, which
have been sharply curtailed due to the suspension of Bank lending over the
past year. It would also provide emergency assistance to maintain produc-
tion in the manufacturing sector. Bank Group assistance would be used to
1/   As of 3/1/79.



- 23 -
strengthen NIB's project promotional efforts. Specifically, the line of
credit would provide foreign exchange for (a) term lending for expansion and
rehabilitation of qualified existing firms and for new high priority projects,
and (b) short-term credit to finance the importation of spare parts and raw
materials for existing enterprises in priority activities which have either
currency shortages. An additional aspect would be direct assistance to
Government in the formulation and implementation of an export and marketing
program, considered vital as a first step in developing non-traditional
exports.
B. Project Design
3.04      A line of credit of $25 million is proposed.   This would incorporate
an IDA Credit of $19 million and $6 million equivalent from the EEC Special
Action Fund which would be fully administered by IDA. Of this line of credit,
$12.2 million would be for term financing, $12 million would cover foreign
exchange working capital and $800,000 would finance technical assistance for
NIB ($300,000) and the Government ($500,000). The following paragraphs
describe the operations to be supported.
3.05      Term Lending.  Financed completely by the IDA Credit, up to $12.2
million would be lent to NIB by the Government to finance the full direct
and estimated indirect foreign exchange capital costs of manufacturing,
agroindustrial and related service enterprises of all sizes, whose operations
are consistent with agreed economic criteria (paras. 2.35). Foreign exchange
costs would represent approximately 65 percent of the total investment costs
of subprojects. As under the previous operation, the foreign exchange re-
quirements would be determined on a case by case basis. Firms selected would
be both existing companies requiring equipment and machinery for expansion
and rehabilitation, as well as new projects eligible under recent Government
guidelines (para. 1.16). Special emphasis would be given to export oriented
schemes. A maximum maturity of 15 years, including three years of grace would
be authorized, however, the average life of a sub-loan would be seven years.
It is estimated the proposed amount would be fully committed by early 1981.
3.06      Foreign Exchange Working Capital.   The lack of foreign exchange for
working capital for essential spare parts and raw materials has adversely
affected the operations of increasing numbers of otherwise sound high priority
enterprises in Ghana. The majority of firms are receiving only a small pro-
portion of their working capital needs through the Government's allocative
system. It is thus proposed that $12 million of the line of credit, combin-
ing $6 million IDA and $6 million from the EEC Facility, would be on-lent by
the Government to NIB to help finance an emergency short-term credit program
involving the importation of spare parts and raw materials for NIB's clients
and other priority enterprises. The component would cover eighty percent of
each subborrower's foreign exchange requirements and the Government would pro-
vide the twenty percent balance. In effect, NIB would provide each subborrower
with a sub-loan for 80% of the foreign exchange needs and the client would
contribute 20% in cash (Cedis) which would be immediately converted into
foreign exchange by the Government. Sub-loan requests submitted under this



- 24 -
component would be reviewed on a case by case basis in the same manner as term
subloans and enterprises would have to satisfy NIB's in7vestment guidelines.
The actual foreign exchange requirements would be confirmed by NIB during
the sub-project analysis. The average life of each sub-loan under this
component would be 18 months, up to a maximum maturity of two years, with no
prepayment privileges.
3.07      Revolving Import Fund for Working Capital.   In order to achieve
maximum impact of the foreign exchange working capital component, the Govern-
ment would be required to establish an Import Fund from the proceeds of the
first round of working capital loans (repaid under the short-term working
capital component) which would revolve four additional times. In effect, the
Fund would become operational through the repayments of the first round of
working capital loans. All such loan repayments would be deposited in the
Fund to be on-lent by NIB in coordination with the Central Bank. New appli-
cations for foreign exchange under each of the four lending cycles will
continue being 80% covered by NIB's credit (through the Fund) with the
20% balance constituting the clients' cash contributions, and the entire
amounts converted by the Government into foreign exchange. The Government
has given assurances that all the local currency amounts received in the
Fund would be converted in this manner. Over the approximate eight-year life
of the Fund the initial allocation of US$12 million should generate about
US$75 million in foreign exchange allocations for high prority manufactur-
ing and agro-industries. 1/ The Government's foreign exchange contribution
would be made possible due to the additional foreign exchange earned or saved
by the high priority enterprises supported under the program. The Government
intends to integrate the Fund (and its replenishments) into its regular system
of import license allocations in order to ensure the full foreign currency
amounts required during each of the four loan cycles. NIB would thus be
responsible for managing a portion of the foreign exchange earmarked under the
Government's own program for manufacturing and agro-industries. During the
fourth revolution of the Fund, NIB would open an account on behalf of the
Government into which all subloan repayments would be deposited. Subloan
collections under this final lending cycle would thus constitute automatic
repayments to Government by NIB under this component. NIB would assume the
commercial risk on its sub-loans with Government ensuring that NIB does not
take the foreign exchange risk. The Government has agreed to establish a
mechanism by which sub-loan collections will be immediately converted into
foreign exchange by the Central Bank so as to prevent NIB from bearing any
exchange loss on funds held on account between repayments and on-lending
during each sub-loan cycle.
1/   Breakdown:
US$12 m. IDA/EEC line of credit
3 m. client contributions converted by Government into foreign currency
US$15 m. Workinig Capital component
$48 m. Revolving Import Fund contributed by Government in foreign
exchnaige (four loan cycles)
--l12 m. client contributions converted by Government into foreign currency
$60 m. Revolving Fund



- 25 -
3.08      In order to justify the Government's releasing $15 million in foreign
exchange for each revolution of the Fund, NIB, at the Government's request,
has agreed to introduce a system which will attempt to quantify the foreign
exchange earned or saved from the enterprises assisted under the Working
Capital component. Exporting companies, estimated to use about 36%o of the
component during the first lending cycle, pose no problem as their earnings
are a matter of record. However, in the case of enterprises producing for
domestic consumption, demonstrating foreign exchange saved, i.e. dislplacing
imports, will present a more arduous task. NIB's staff are devising a system
based on average annual imports by sub-sector to calculate the impact of
increasing productive capacity for selec'Zed firms in their respective sub-
sectors. A lag in import data collection by the Ministry of Trade will
preclude the formulation of a foolproof system, however, the Bank agrees
that the exercise will be a useful one in developing better information on
capacity utilization.
3.09      Technical Assistance to NIB. Although, NIB has operated effectively
under difficult circumstances in recent years, its management has requested
technical assistance to help achieve further insitutional improvements. A
primary objective will be to reorganize and strengthen NIB's project identi-
fication and promotion efforts to permit it to reactivate and improve its
project pipeline which has rundown over the past year. A second aim is to
bolster NIB's appraisal capacity with respect to application of methodology
consistent with new investment priorities, and to introduce more engineering
and technical expertise into the project appraisal process. NIB wishes to
improve the collection and use of data accummulated at each stage of the
project cycle as a basis for organizational and operational planning. Manage-
ment wishes to engage ouitside assistance in reviewing improvements in super-
vision already introduced and to work with NIB staff on future procedures.
Finally, NIB would like to set up a program of training which would allow
for the continuance of overseas courses as well as more short-term inhouse
seminars on various operational aspects. To meet these objectives, it is
estimated that the foreign exchange requirements of the component financed
by IDA, will be $300,000 representing between 36-40 man-months of expert and
short-term consultant services, plus support equipment. The NIB would finance
local costs of the advisers and experts. Such costs include housing and could
reach 0 300,000.  The following tentative breakdown has been agreed vith NIBS
(a) Industrial Economist, with operational, particularly
promotional and appraisal background (24 man-months)
working with the Managing Director and DSI.
(b) Short-te'rm Consultants, engineers and technicians
(8 man-months) in selected active sub-sectors to assist
the promotional program.
(c)  Short-term consultants (about 8 man-months) for training,
organizational development, and information processing.



- 26 -
On the basis of NIB recruiting the industrial economist directly and approach-
ing consulting firms for the short-term experts, average cost per man-year is
estimated at $80,000. Three vehicles and office equipment will be purchased
for the purpose of facilitating promotional and supervision work. It was
confirmed at negotiations that Government will pass on the funds for this
component to NIB on a grant basis.
3.10      Technical Assistance to the Government.  As discussed earlier, the
overall capacity of Ghana to export non-traditional goods has been seriously
eroded by years of an over-valued exchange rate, the lack of incentives, the
inability to establish markets and weak Government administrative support to
exporters. In response to a request by the Government, US$500,000 of the
IDA Credit will be retained by the Government to provide approximately sixty
man-months of technical assistance for the formulation and implementation of
an export promotion program, with emphasis on non-traditional exports. A firm
(or firms) of consultants will be appointed to carry out, with Government
counterparts, the following program which will operate from the office of the
Commissioner for Economic Planning:
(a) Review of existing export policies, programs and
institutions in the light of recent Bank reports;
(b) Propose immediate export policy and program changes;
(c) Assist in establishment of an actual export program,
stressing the mechanism to facilitate exports and
timely delivery of essential imported inputs;
(d) Establishment, through joint consultant-Ghanaian teamns
working abroad, of actual markets, exploring long-term
contractual agreements.
In the process, the operations of the existing agencies (Ghana Export Company
and the Ghana Export Promotion Council) will be reviewed; and recommendations
would be forthcoming for strengthening and/or merging the institutions, or
even their elimination in favor of a new one to execute policies and pro-
grams. Draft terms of reference were agreed at negotiations and Government
has already begun making contacts with consultants.
C.   Terms and Conditions
3.11      General Terms.  The proposed line of credit of $25 million, will
be lent by Government to NIB with the exception of US$500,000 retained by
Government for an export program and US$300,000 granted to NIB for technical
assistance. The conventional term loan component will carry a rate of
13-1/2% (prevailing Central Bank rate) and will be on-lent by NIB to sub-
borrowers at 18.5% interest with a maximum maturity of 15 years, including
3 years of grace; the average life of a subloan being seven years. A free
limit of US$200,000 and an aggregate free limit of US$5 million are recom-
mended on the term capital financing component. This will permit the Bank
to review about 60% of the subprojects by amount and approximately one third



- 27 -
by number. Short-term working capital will also be lent by Government to NIB
at 13-1/2% for relending at 18-1/2%. For this component, a free limit of
US$50,000 per enterprise and an aggregate free limit of US$3 million are
proposed. A 5 - 5-1/2% margin earned by NIB on both on-lending components
is considered reasonable and.appropriate.
3.12      Amortization Schedules.   The Government has agreed that repayments
from NIB under the term lending component be made on an adjustable composite
amortization schedule, based on the aggregate of the sub-loan repayment
schedules. NIB's repayments under the working capital component will be
directly channelled to the Government through an account into which all
sub-loan collections will be placed during the final revolution of the Import
Fund (para 3.07).
3.13      Foreign Exchange Risk on Term Loans.   It is proposed that NIB give
the option to its term sub-borrowers of either assuming the foreign exchange
risk between the US dollar and the Cedi and paying the maximum allowable
interest rate of 18-1/2% plus fees; or of not taking the risk and paying, in
addition to the standard interest rate of 18-1/2%, an annual foreign exchange
risk premium of 10% on term loans outstanding. This 10%, collected by NIB,
would be passed on directly to the Government as compensation for carrying the
full foreign exchange risk and would raise the effective financial charges
paid by the term sub-borrowers to 28-1/2% plus fees. The introduction of the
premium is justified when considered in the context of the Government's policy
of continuing with a flexible exchange rate and the potential inpact of such
realignments on term sub-loan principals denominated in US dolLars. While
it is not possible to predict the frequency and magnitude of the devaluations
over the life of sub-loans, further adjustments could result in severe finan-
cial losses for clients.  The Bank Group feels that the clients, in consulta-
tion with NIB, are best able to assess their respective financial positions
in the light of exchange rate uncertainties, and the option would permit clients
the right to make such risk judgments on t:heir own.
3.14      The premium fee serves a number of important objectives in that it
moves the effective interest rate in the dlirection of real positive rates
and renders the cost of foreign exchange more consistent with realistic cost-
price relationships in Ghana. Furthermore, it is appropriate that enter-
preneurs benefiting from Government coverage against risk should pay for
such "insurance". For those clients assumling the foreign exchange risk,
the 18-1/2% rate in US dollars also appropriately reflects the scarcity
value of foreign exchange in the country. Either option uses the financial
charge as a screening and rationing device to supplement NIB and Government
investment criteria.
3.15      As discussed earlier in this report the promotion of exports is a
major policy objective of the Government. The Government views this second
line of credit as an important step in the revitalization of the non-
traditional manufacturing and agro-industrial export sector. There has been
apprehension on the part of Government that the introduction of the effective
28-1/2% interest rate resulting from the application of the foreign exchange
premium would favor production for the local market while discouraging exports



28 -
through higher, uncompetitive prices. In order to provide special incentives
to enterprises with export potential the Government, NIB and Bank Group have
agreed that sub-borrowers opting to pay the foreign exchange premium shall be
eligible to receive a rebate on the premium equal to 5% of their export sales
(derived from production of their respective enterprises), but not exceeding
the aggregate actual premium having been paid over the entire period of the
sub-loan.  The 5% coefficient is based on a working assumption that total
investment costs usually represent one-third of an average enterprise's
turnover (annual sales) at production and that an NIB loan would finance
65-75% of total investment. Such enterprises exporting 50% of their produc-
tion (total sales) could recuperate the entire annual premiums paid during
that year. Since it will take time to reorient domestic manufacturing to
the export sector as well as to find new markets abroad, subborrowers will
be eligible to collect refunds over the entire life of the loan for up to the
actual aggregate amounts of the premiums paid over this period. This provides
incentives for NIB clients to move into the export market at any time and
depending on the volume of their exports, to recover amounts previously paid
in premiums to Government. In cases of enterprises with smaller investment
cost/production ratios or with less than 50% of sales in exports, recouping
the premiums will be spread over a longer period. Larger percentage turn-
overs and exports will, of course, yield refunds more quickly. The NIB will
be responsible for reviewing export receipts and verifying other shipping
documentation, prior to authorization of refunds. As premium payments will
be held by the Central Bank, NIB's role will be that of collection agent and
administrator.  The premium Cand the interest rate on sub-loans) will be
reviewed periodically, to determine its appropriateness and whether a downward
adjustment in its level would be warranted. Changes would be introduced only
after prior consultation with and agreement between NIB, the Government and
the Bank Group. Some clients may attempt to refinance their sub-loans through
commercial banks in order to avoid the premium fees.   To prevent this and
to allow NIB to recover its loan processing costs, appropriate prepayment
penalties will be introduced by NIB during the first 3-5 years of each term
subloan.
3.16      Foreign Exchange Risk on Working Capital Loans.   Sub-borrowers under
the short-term working capital component (average maturity 18 months) will
bear the foreign exchange risk and pay the full 18-1/2% interest rate, with
no prepayment privileges. It -is appropriate for borrowers under the Working
Capital component to assume the foreign exchange risk in view of a) the
limited period exposed (average loan life of 18 months during which the sub-
borrowers would be at risk); b) the immediate impact on the production and
profitability of the enterprises resulting from the resumed inflow of raw
materials and spare parts; and c) the foreign exchange risk would be limited
to 80% of the foreign exchange provided, corresponding to the proportion
covered by sub-loans.
3.17      EEC Financing of the Working Capital Component.   Under the procedures
for utilizing EEC Action Funds the EEC credits would be lent to Government in
a mix of European currencies based on the European Unit of Account and the
repayment obligations would be in the same mix of currencies. In order to



- 29 -
avoid creating administrative complications for NIB relating to repayment in
several currencies and also to simplify matters with respect to sub-borrowers
bearing the foreign exchange risk under thie Working Capital component, the
Government would on-lend the EEC funds to the NIB denominated in US dollars.
The NIB, receiving funds from Government at 13-1/2% would similarly re-lend
the funds at an 18-1/2% interest rate in sub-loans denominated in US dollars
as previously discussed. Unider this arrangement Government will take the
foreign exchange risk related to exchanige rate adjustments between the US
dollar and EEC currencies while the NIB Working Capital sub-borrowers would
bear the risk in relation to exchange rate adjustments as between the US
dollar and the Cedi.
3.18      Debt-Equity Ratio (para 2.27).   The proposed term and working
capital components of the line of credit ($24,2 million) would result in NIB's
exceeding its debt equity limit of 3:1. Even if share capital were fully
paid-in and reserves increased to ¢ 7.3 million, as projected, NIB's debt-
equity ratio incorporating IDA borrowings would still be pressing the 3:1
limit, thus allowing insufficient margin for further borrowings or for the
affects of further possible devaluations. As already indicated, NIB will be
facing both prospects in 1979. The options for NIB include increasing the
debt-equity ratio, authorization of a further capital increase, or conversion
of Government loans into quasi-equity. During a period of budgetary austerity
the two latter options would be unacceptable to the Government, particularly
since a capital increase for NIB was only recently approved (January 1978).
The most appropriate alternative and one which is justified on the basis of
NIB's operational performance and sound management would be to increase NIB'.s
debt-equity ratio to 5:1, a move which would be expected to relieve pressure
through 1979, after which a further capital increase could be considered.
Furthermore, since NIB has operated under the same statutory limits since
inception, an increase is believed to be warranted and a move to 5:1 would
be the minimum needed to allow normal operations until 1980. Government and
NIB have agreed to take the necessary actions to adjust this limit by July 31,
1979.
3.19      Procurement and Disbursement.   NIB's subborrowers generally employ
local procurement procedures standard in Bank DFC projects to ensure that
goods and services are suitable and reasonably priced. These procedures are
acceptable for both the term lending and working capital components. The
latter activity will be monitored closely by NIB. On the Working Capital
Component it is proposed that foreign exchange disbursements from the EEC/M11
line of credit would. in the case of each sub-loan, represent eighty percent of the
sub-loan amount with the Government providing twenty percent in foreign exchange;
EEC funds would be disbursed by the Bank Group as Administrator against
purchase of EEC goods only and IDA funds would be disbursed in accordance with
standard Bank Group procurement procedures for DFC operations. Provision of
satisfactory documentation would be required as to the country of origin of
the goods. All requests for disbursement must be fully supported by invoices
and other evidence satisfactory to NIB and the Association.
D.   Benefits and Risks
3.20      The benefits of this project, elaborated throughout the report, are
summarized as follows:



- 30
(a) Continuing World Bank Group support will permit a resumption
and expansion of operations of one of the most capable and
competent institutions in Ghana. In helping NIB to be main-
tained as a viable institution, the Bank Group ensures that
it will be able to play a significant role in the economic
recovery of the country.
(b) The proposed Credit represents an important infusion of
foreign exchange into vital manufacturing, agro-industrial
and related service enterprises. It supports new Government
and NIB resource allocation criteria, and would constitute
the reactivation of high priority manufacturing in Ghana.
(c) The contribution of manufacturing and agro-industries to
economic growth and the development of non-traditional ex-
ports is directly dependent on the availability of foreign
exchange channelled selectively through the proper financial
intermediary. The project draws together both the institu-
tional and financial elements,
(d) The preparation of an export program combined with new economic
criteria could help Ghana to embark on a new course involving
the eventual transformation of the manufacturing sector to one
with greater links to the domestic inputs and external markets.
3.21      Risks.  The greatest risk is economic and sectoral, relating to the
Government's capacity to implement its stabilization program. The measures
to be undertaken are difficult ones. If budget expenditures cannot be con-
strained, growth in the money supply held to targeted levels, and production
cannot be stimulated, the economic situation could continue deteriorating.
The effects would be higher inflation, a loss in external assistance, a
drop in exports (and thus import capacity), resulting in continued economic
depression. Given relative success on the economic front, the potential
problems relate to the unavailability of foreign exchange to support the
Bank Group working capital program and, secondly, the impact of devaluations
on NIB's clients assuming the foreign exchange risk, which in turn could
affect the level of NIB's arrears. NIB management and the Bank Group are well
aware of these issues and arrangements for periodic consultations will be
agreed upon. Initially, at least, the project would require more than normal
supervision.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      This report recommends a line of credit of US$25 million to the
Government (incorporating an IDA credit of $19 million and $6 million equiva-
lent from the EEC Special Action Fund), of which $24.2 million would be
on-lent to NIB. US$800,000 would finance technical assistance, with the
Government retaining $500,000 and granting US$300,000 to NIB. Term funds
representing $12.2 million and working capital funds constituting $12 million



- 31 -
would be lent to NIB at 13-1/2%. A Revolving Import Fund would be established
to revolve working capital resources over four loan cycles. Term sub-borrowers
will be given the choice of either bearing the foreign exchange risk and
paying an 18-1/2% interest rate or of paying a 10% premium fee, in addition
to the interest rate, as compensation to the Government for carrying the full
risk. The foreign exchange risk will be passed on to the sub-borrowers of
short-term working capital who will pay 18-1/2% interest, with no prepayment
privileges. NIB would retain an approximate 5% margin on both components.
Government should cover the foreign exchange risk on (a) any exchange losses
on the Revolvinig Fund and (b) losses related to changes in the dollar - EEC
currency parity.
4.02      During negotiations assurances and agreements were obtained on the
following points:
(a) The Government would lend $24.2 million to NIB at the
proposed rates and terms (paras 3.13, 3.14, 3.15 and 3.16)
and grant $300,000 to NIB for technical assistance
(para 3.09).
(b) The Government will assume the foreign exchange risk for those
term sub-borrowers who opt to pay a 10% premium fee in addition
to the interest rate of 18-1/2% (paras 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15).
(c) The Government would refund the premium to NIB clients in
amounts equal to 5% of their export sales, based on the
agreed formula (para. 3.15).
(d) The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government
on any local currency held in the Import Fund and on the risk
related to exchange rate adjustments between the US dollar
and EEC currencies under the EEC Special Action Fund.
(e) The Working Capital Component will be financed on an 80%/20%
basis (para 3.06), as would the Revolving Import Fund (para
3.07), when established. The foreign exchange to be provided as
matching funds during the initial subloans and replenishments of
the four subsequent lending cycles under the Import Fund will be
made available promptly, as required.
(f) Government and NIB will amend NIB's Act before July 31, 1979,
permitting an increase in NIB's debt-equity ratio to 5:1
(paras 2.27 and 3.18).
(g)  Government will accept repayment from NIB of term loans through
an adjustable composite amortization schedule (para 3.12). The
repayment arrangement under the Working Capital Component has
been confirmed (para 3.07).



- 32 -
(h) NIB will on-lend IDA resources to qualified sub-borrowers
on terms and conditions proposed by the Bank Group and
collect all sub-loan repayments, including the premium
which would be channelled directly to the appropriate
Government account.
(i) An exposure rate of below 30% will be maintained on loan
portfolio outstanding (para 2.24) and an arrears recovery
program has been agreed (paras. 2.21 and 2.24).
4.03      With these conditions fulfilled, the project is suitable for a line
of credit of US$25 million (incorporating an IDA Credit of $19 million and an
EEC Special. Action Credit of $6 million equivalent).
4.04      During negotiations on the line of credit, it was agreed that a
Subsidiary Loan agreement, acceptable to the Association, will have been duly
executed by the Government and NIB as a condition to the effectiveness of the
IDA Credit and the EEC Special Action Credit.
