PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
PUERTO PLATA TOURISM PROJECTS
(LOANS 1051-DO AND 1699-DO)
PREFACE
1.          The following is a Project Completion Report on the Puerto Plata
Tourism ProJects in the Dominican Republic financed under Loane 1051-DO and
1699-DO for US$21.0 million and US$25.0 million, respectively. Loan 1051-DO
was approved on October 29, 1974, and the project carried out from 1975 to
1982. After a period of six months beyond the Closing Date granted to
finalize disbursements, the loan account was closed, leaving an undisbursed
balance of US$80,000, which was cancelled.
2.          Loan 1699-DO was approved on May 17, 1979.  The loan became
effective on September 9, 1980 and the project was carried out through 1987.
A period of nine months beyond the Closing Date was granted for final
disbursemonts, at which time US$3.54 million remained undisbursed and was
cancelled.
3.          This report was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy
Division, Country Department III, of Latin America and Caribbean Regional
Office. It is based on information gathered from the project files for the
two loans, project completion reports prepared by the borrower, and materials
obtained during a Project Completion Mission in July 1990. On March 5, 1991,
the Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III with the request to prepare Part
II, but no reply was received.
4.          It should be noted that the completion reports for the two
projects are both more than two years overdue, that much of the project
documentation has been retired to Bank storage facilities, and that the data
available from the borrower is fragmentary. Consequently, in accordance with
Bank Guidelines, the scope of this report has been limited to a critical
review of the information at hand.

EVALUATION SUMMIAY
Obiectives
1.        Together, thi two projects were intended to help the Dominican
Republic tap into the lucrative tourism trade of the Caribbean and to develop
its economically depressed north coast. The objectives of the first project
were to provide the necessary infrastructure to establish a tourist pole near
the city of Puerto Plata, including basic works, a terminal building and
navigational aids for the Puerto Plata airport, and technical assistance for
the Central Bank. The objectives of the second, follow-on project were (i) to
assist the private development of tourist accommodations through a line of
credit administered by a division of the Central Bank; (ii) to provide
training end employment opportunities on the north coast; and (iii) to support
the Government's efforts to formulate sound tourism sector policies.
Impleme_ntation Experience
ii.       Implementation of the first project encountered several delays, none
of them serious. Apart from the usual variety of physical, contractual and
import setbacks, hotel room development also fell behind schedule as a result
of the problems inherent in this type of tourism development when the.
destination is a new one not known to hotelierr e  tourism promoters.
iii.      Implementation of the second project was beset by more serious
delays, largely arisin8 from the Borrower's lac&C of experience with this sort
of operation. Neither the public nor private sector was accustomed to the
formalities of financial intermediation. The Borrower needed time to learn
the particulars of subloan identification, appraisal, c -itract negotiation and
technical supervision. A deteriorating economic and monetary climate also
prompted the Central Bank to delay several times, either to request
reassessment of land values or because of liquidity shortages. Staff turnover
was high. In addition, although enough private investors eventually came
forward to complete the project, interest developed slowly, reflecting the
lack of track record for a major tourism development in the country. The
major change during implementation was the concentration of the project itn
Playa Dorada and the postponement of any development in Playa Grande.
Investment in the latter did not materialize because of its distance from the
airport and expected dependence on the small, luxury segment of the market.
Results
iv.       The economic reevaluation shows an internal rate of return on the
two projects combined of 12%, compared with 17.5X forecast at appraisal of the
second loan. The return was hurt by the lengthy delay in opening hotels and



- fii -
resultant increase in cost per room, and the lack of development in Playa
Grande. Despite the lower return, however, the combined result of the two
projects has been a substantial and enduring success. A credit mechanism is
in place, the tourism potential of Puerto Plata has been established,
investment and employment are high, and sector administration has improved.
Moreover, growth in associated nonhotel jobs has extended all along the coast.
It can reasonably be assumed that little or none of the tourism development of
Puerto Plata would have occurred in the absence of the investments, credit
lines and demonstration effect of the two projects. The main negative effect
has been a marked increase in area food prices. The projects also attained a
more far-reaching objective: demonstrating the viability of tourism in general
in the Dominican Republic. From 1971 to 1989, tourist arrivals to the island
increased tenfold, and in 1989, the number of foreign visitors surpassed one
million for the first time. Consequently, the projects have had significant
spinoff effects elsewhere in the country; the number of rooms nationwide
increased an average 15Z a year in the 1980s to reach 18,500 in 1989. This
gave the Dominican Republic the largest tourist capacity in the Caribbean.
What is more, from an environmental perspective, the projects have had a
largely positive and harmonious impact on the surrounding natural areas.
Sustainabilitv
v.        Tourism has become an integral sector of the Dominican economy.
From a minor industry 20 years ago, it has grown to the largest earner of
foreign exchange and a driving force in national income. From US$123.9
million in 1979, tourism receipts reached US$912 million in 1989 and should
_-.-eed USS1 billion in 1990. Relative to income from sugar exports, tourism
income rose from 50Z in 1978 to 5001 in 1988. During the downturn in the
sugar market from 1984 on, tourism receipts first offset and then surpassed
the shortfall in foreign exchange earnings. As the island's tourism
reputation grows, the industry promises even more substantial future returns.
Findings and Lessons Learned
vi.       There were six salient lessons specific to tourism development.
First, funds should be made available for at least one publicly-financed pilot
accommodation at the outset, since no private concern will want to be the
first to invest in a new destination. Second, a considerable lag should be
expected between the opening of the pilot hotel and the construction of
private accommodations. Third, the community should be included in planning
and decisions as early as possible. Fourth, more attention should be devoted
to promoting agriculture and fishing to help limit increases in food prices.
Fifth, 'immigration and customs services at airports should be streamlined to
minimize delay to travelers. Sixth, it is essential to endow a new
implementing agency with sufficient, trained professional staff, control over
the financial side of the operation, and enhanced capability to collect and
analyze data.
vii.      There were also several points of broader applicability.  First and
most important was what the projects showed can be the role of Government in
proving the viability of a previously undeveloped sector. Before these loans,
no private investor was willing to hazard a long-term investment in the



- iv -
nation's untested tourist market. Stcond, undertaking a complex financial
operation in a system wlth little experience requires considerable technical
assistance. Much Implementation delay could havu boon avoided by better
structuring of the credit line and improved fikancial monitoring and
enforcement. Finally, well-designed and enforceable environmental regulations
have been easential both to protecting the natural setting of the projects and
to ensuring their continued profitability as sites of scenic beauty

Sector:             Tourism
B. Background
l.        Despite its many attractions, the Dominican Republic vae a late
starter in the Caribbean tourism trade. Through the 1960s, the Government
attached little importance to tourism, and as late as 1973, the nation's
accmmodation capacity amounted to 1,600 rooms catering primarily to business
traffic. Growth in travel to the region began to spill over to-Dominican
shores in 1968; in the aext five years, foreign visitor traffic incroased at
an average annual rate of 192. In the same period, the numbor of cruise
visitors grew from 3,200 per year to 47,900. Nonetheless, the country's best
tourism asset, the north coast, remainod largely undeveloped.
2.        Recognizing the potential impact that theso trends could have on the
island's economy, the Government created a national tourism directorate (DNTI)
in 1968 and began considering ways to develop the sector. The first formal
request to the World Bank came in 1970, when tho Government asked for help in
financing infrastructure that would be necessary to establish a tourist hub.
A UNDP study had identified five promising regions for tourism. In 1971, the
Monetary Board delegated primary revsonsibillty for tourism development to the
Central Bank through a new division, the Departamento para e1 Desarrollo do la
Infraestructura Turistica (INFRATUR). A tourism incentives law (Law 153) was
enacted, whiph exempted hotels in designated zones for a minimu of ton years
from virtually all taxes, license fees and import duties. Construction of en
international airport to servo the north coast began with Government funding.
In September 1971, the Government hired consultants to identify the areas in
the economically depressed but attractive Puerto Plata best suited for first-
phase tourism development. An integrated resort was proposed for the sitae of
Playa Dorada and Playa Grande, located 5 and 80 km east of the city of Puerto
Plata. The project proposal emerging from these studies was submitted for
consideration by the Bank in fall 1973.
3.        The Bank appraisal mission took place in early 1974.  The US$21
million loan received Board approval on October 299 1974 as Puerto Plata
Tourism Project, Loan 1051-DO. The Loan Agreement was signed with the
Dominican Central Bank in November 6, 1974, with the Government of the
Dominican Republic as guarantor. A second, follow-on loan for US$25 million
(Second Puerto Plata Tourism Project, Loan 1699-DO) was approved in May 1979.



-2-
This second loan provided a line of credit with which INFRATUR served as
intermediary to finance, through commercial banke, the first wave of tourist
accommodations, pr:.marily hotels.
4.        In as much as these loans together supported a single, integrated
tourism development, this PCR concentrates primarily on the outcome of the two
projects as a whole. For the same reason, the economic analysis takes both
projects into account. This report draws on information obtained from the
borrower's two reports, project appraisal and supervision roports, project
correspondence and materials compiled on a comnletion missiom in July 1990.
C. Proiects Obiectives and Description
5.        The first loan was intended to finance the infrast:ucture works and
common facilities for the two sites, as well as core facilities for the Puerto
Plata airport. It was designed with the following components:
(a) infrastructure and other facilities for the Plava Dara6a and
Playa Grande project areas;
(b) site works for a low-income housing program near Playa Dorada;
(c) water supply and sewerage systems for the village of Rio San
Juan near Playa Grande;
(d) an access road, terminal building, navigational equipment and
other facilities for the Puerto Plata international airport;
(e) hotel training facilities; and
(f) technical asistance and study funds.
6.        In early 1977, the Central Bank sought the Bank'. assistance in
establishing a credit facility for investors in the Puerto Plata area. An
identification mission visited the island in May 1977 and recommended Bank
financing of the hotel development planned through 1983. In subsequent
discussions with Government authorities, it was agroed to broaden the scope of
this second project to include civil works in the city of Puerto Plata and to
provide for training in handicrafts and for technical assistance to INFRATUR
and DNTI.
7.        The project's objectives, as described in the appraisal report,
werae
(a) to assist the Central Bank in setting up a proper hotel credit
mechanism to finance construction of tourism accommodation
facillties in Playa Dorada, Playa Grande and Puerto Plata;
(b) to enhance tlk tourism potential of Puerto Plata for cruise
ship passev-    and visitors to Playa Dorada and Playa Grande
alike;



4                                  -~~~~~~~~~~~3 -
(c)  to provide investment, training and employuenc opportunities in
the tourism sector and aelected handicrafts activities for the
population of Puerto Plata;
(d) to strengthen the administration of the sector; and
(e) to provide assistance to the Dominican authorities in
eqtablishing sound tourism policies.
8.        The project was designed with four components:
(a) a line of credit to finance tourist accommodations and services
in Playa Dorada, Playa Grande and Puerto Plata;
(b)  urban works in the lov-ly:ng area of Puerto Plata near the
tourism pier;
(c) an artisan center to teach handicraft construction; and
(d) technical assistance to INFRATUR and DNTI.
9.        The project was appraised ia September 1978, and negotiations took
place in Washington from April 18 to 2.4, 1979. A loan of US$25.0 million was
approved by the Executive Directors on May 17, 1979. Six months later, on
November 12, 1979, the Loan Agreement was signed.
D.   Proiects Implementation
10.       ?coiects Delays.  Under the first loan, project implementation
encountered several delays, nonr of them serious. At the outset,
effectiveness was postponed :or eight months and there were delays in
negotiating the contracta for the training school and golf course. The firm
retained to build the access roads and drainage systems was a year late in
delivering, with cost overruns of 502, due to inefficiency and a low initial
bid. The water supply system was likewise delayed more than a year. After
the golf course was opened, it was discovered that it would be periodically
flooded by area rivers, so a dike and diversion canal had to be built at on
additional coet of RD$800,000. In airport construction, the civil works were
completed on time, but the terminal building was beset by liquidity problems
and holdups in imports, which produced an 18-month delay and a RD$0.S million
overrun. The navigational aids encountered regulatory lags which delayed
their installation by 18 months. In Playa Grande, the firm contracted to
build the sewerage system did not have the capacity to carry out the work
promised. Its contract was cancelled and the work reassigned to another firm.
As a result. the construction period and final cost were more than double
original estimates. Room development also fell behind schedule, an indication
of the problems inherent in this type of development when the destination is a
new one not known to hoteliers or tourism promoters. Eventually, the project
closing date, originally set at December 31, 1979, was moved to December 31,
1982.



11.       Like the first loan, the second loan also met with several delays,
and at project closing there was an undisbursed balance of US$3.54 million,
which was canceled. The commitment date was moved back more than ten times
and the closing date extended three times for a total of three years, from
December 31, 1984 to December 31, 1987. The reasons for the slowdowns were
many and variois. At the beginning, Congress delayed in approving the loan
and passing a necessary regulatory decree, which pushed effectiveness back
nearly a year. The general lack of experience with this type of operation in
the Dominican Republic was another constraint. The Borrower needed time to
learn the particulars of subloan identification, appraisal, contract -
negotiation and technical supervision. At times, performance was afflicted by
clientelism and excessive bureaucracy, and Bank supervision missions on
occasion had to pressure INFRATUR staff to move implementation forward. The
cumbersome processing of disbursement applications prevented any significant
disbursements between December 1986 and June 1987. As the projoct neared
completion, a cement shortage caused delays in construction.
12.       The deteriorating economic and monetary situation--including a mid-
project devaluation--also required the Central Bank to delay several times,
either to request reassessment of rapidly increasing lend values or because of
acute liquidity shortages. The Central Bank charged intermediaries 92 or 9.52
on subloans (depending on their purpose), but the interest intermediaries
could charge was limited to 122 by the Repub!.4c's usury laws. The Loan
Agreement provided that if inflation exceeded 122, intermediaries could attain
a positive interest rate by adding a 3-42 closing cost. Inflation so far
exceeded expectations, however, that frequent squabbles arose over how the
subloans, for which the Central Bank was paying only 7.9Z, would be allocated.
As the commercial cost of-money reached 241, the Central Bank grew
increasingly reluctant to commit concessionary loan funds. In addition, the
costs of construction also rose dramatically amid the unprocedented inflation
and devaluation of the mid-1980s, causing further delays. Finally, although
enough private investors eventually came forward to complete the project,
interest was slow to develop, reflecting the lack of a track record for a
planned major tourism development in the Dominican Republic.
13.       As a result, accommodation development, the linchpin of the project,
fell significantly behind schedule. At appraisal of the second Loan, it was
foreseen that there would be 1,200 available rooms in 1981 and 1,900 by 1983.
In fact, only 300 rooms wero open in 1981 and fewer than 600 in 1983. One
hotel was still under construction in fall 1990.
14.       Proiects Chanees.  During implementation of the first loan, it
became clear that the level of need for low-cost housing for hotel employees
would not be known until accommodations were actually in operation. It was
also determined that the real need would arise when Playa Grande was
developed, since it is a considerable distance from any town. Accordingly,
this component of the project was eliminated. During the design of the
sewerage system for Rio San Juan, it was also decided to eliminate this
component, since the cost estimate came in much higher than had been
anticipated. Renovation of the town's vater supply system intakes and
distribution was deemed a more urgent necessity; this work was completed



without major problems. In addition, a planned shopping center and vacation
village waro ultimately canceled as a resolt of project delays.
is.       In the second loan, the line of credit, originally forecast to be
US$23.6 million, underwent two changes in the course of implementation. At
appraisal, it was assumed that the Central Bank would have to build and sell
some hotels itself to develop momentum in the sector. Accordingly, the line
of credit was designed to help finance the Central Bank's expenditures on its
own hotels as well as INFRATUR subloans to private investors. As
implementation proceedid, however, it was evident that there would be
sufficient private investors, so in February 1985, the Bank agreed to make the
full line of credit availablo for subloans. Becauso most hotel construction
was late to bogin, however, a significant part of loan funds remained
undisbursed as the final closing date neared. Thus, in June 1987, the Bank
-agreed to increase the percentage of Puerto Plata Port Park civil works it
would finance to 1002.
16.       The ovorwholming majority of the line of credit (962) was used to
finance part of INFRATUR subloans. These funds were on-lent through eight
commercial intermediaries to eleven hotels and aparthotels in an integrated
complex of accommodations at Playa Dorads.  The hotels are arrayed in a
horseshoe pattern around a central area that includes a golf course and a
convention center now under construction. The semi-circular design, by
keeping activities localized to the complex, minimizes the environmental
disturbance and preserves more open beachfront. In total, the number of rooms
far exceeded the 1,600 originally foreseen. About 2,700 rooms are currently
open, and with the completion of the remaining units in 1992, an estimated
3,292 will be available. Because the original infrastructure was designed tc
serve only about 2,000 rooms, however, large expansions of the Playa Dorada
water and sewerage systems are now in the planning stage, and development of
the three remaining lots in the complex has been suspended pending the
installation of increased capacity. The reminder of the funds went to the
Port Park and to assist construction of four shops in Puerto Plata's free-
trade zone and the completion of a dike.
17.       The major substantive deviation from the second project's appraisal
forecast was the concentration of the project in Play, Dorada and the
postponement of any development in Play, Grande. Under tho first loan, a
water supply system and a sewage treatment plant were installed at Playa
Grande. The development foroseon there did not materialize in the second
loan, however, largely because of tho economics of its location and intended
clientele. Situated 80 km from the airport, Playa Grande is considerably less
accessible than Playa Dorada. In addition, the hotels planned for Playa
Grande were targeted to the luxury segments of the market, with lower building
densities and fewer rooms. Consequently, despite the success of Playa Dorada,
private investors remained reluctant to invest in the more remote Playa
Grande.
18.       Technical assistance was geared primarily toward strengthening
aspects of INFRATUR's financial operations and offering courses in hotel
management. The hotel training school opened in March 19e3; in November of
that year, its administration was transferred to a local university. It has



-6-
been very successful in training hotel technical personnel, to date graduating
more than 1,300 trainees. The record of assistanco granted to INIRATUR, by
contrast, has been mixed. It came in staggered phases and suffered from
INFRATUR's high personnel turnover and little institutional memory.
19.       The artisan center, meant to train 50 Dominicans a year in
handicraft artistry, did not succeed in attracting much interest. The
Fundacion Dominicana de Desarrollo opened the center in September 1982 but
roturned it to Central Bank administration in June 1988 after several
disappointing years. By the end of 1989, the center had graduated a total of
only 80 people. To a large degree, lack of interest in the center derived
from the overall project's success, since the accommodations boom in Playa
Dorada and neighboring Sosu4 made unskilled labor jobs in hotels more
attractive to workers than attending a year of school.
E. Proiects Results
20.       Achievement of Prolects Ob1ectives.  Despite delays, cost overruns,
and institutional difficulties, the combined result of the two tourism
projects has been a substantial and important success. Virtually all the
specified objectives of the loans have been achieved. A credit mechanism is
in place, the tourism potentia: of Puerto Plata has been clearly established,
investment and employment are at high levels, and sector administration has
improved markedly. After operating at a deficit in its early years, the
Puerto Plata airport has produced consistent surpluses since 1983. Moreover,
the socioeconomic study of the ptoject zone financed under the first loan
proved quite useful in making the community aware of the benefits tourism
would bring to the region, as well as in pinpointing what would be needed to
keep tourism expasision orderly. The only objective that may remain to be
realized is the adoption of sound tourism policies, particularly in relation
to tax incentives. Under current policy, several of the Playa D3rada hotels
may not pay any taxes until the next century, despite high occupancy rates and
lucrative operations. That aside, however, the loans more than achieved their
8oal of setting a successful precedent for controlled tourism development on
the north coast.
21.       More important, however, the projects also attained a much more
ambitious objective: demonstrating the viability of tourism in general in the
Dominican Republic. From 1971 (when preliminarv work began on the first loan)
to 1989, tourist arrivals to the Dominican Republic increased tenfold, from
137,000 to 1,450,000. In 1989, under the nation's "open skies" policy, the
number of foreign visitors to the island exceeded one million for the first
time. (See Annex I.) In Puerto Plata, arrivals more than doubled between
1986 and 1989, reaching 360,000. Canadians constitute the largest group of
foreign visitors, accounting for 42Z of Puerto Plata air arrivals in 1989.
U.S. citizens account for about 36Z of the market each year. Europeans
provide most of the rest of the traffic to the north coast, with about half
(IIZ in 1989) from the Federal Republic of Germany.
22.       The Puerto Plata development has also had significant spinoff
effects elsewhere in the country, most notably in Sosua. The number of rooms
nationwide, which was 1,300 in 1971, rose an average 15S a year from 1980 to



-7-
1989 to reach 18,500. This gave the Dominican Republic the largest tourist
capacity in the Caribbean, well ahead of the Bahamas (14,800 rooms) and
Jamaica (13,000 rooms). The Puerto Plata area itself offors some 7,500 rooms.
What is more, the rapid growth in accommodations has not brought about
overcapacity. Occupancy rates have remained acceptable or high, at least 65%
for the last four years and at times as high as 762.
23.       Even the problems still nagging the project are in large part the
results of its success. The two biggest complaints from visitors are directed
at the long lines for processing at the Puerto Plata airport and at the
sporadic supply of water and electricity. These bottlenecks arise in large
part from the unexpectedly high number of arrivals; neither the airport nor
the water supply are equipped to handle traffic of the magnitude now arriving.
Power outages are another matter, reflecting occasional shortages of fuel used
to generate electricity and, more fundamentally, serious problems in the power
company (which the Bank is addressing through a power rehabilitation project).
24.       Costs.  Under the first loan, the tota.l project cost, projected to
be US$36.0 million, ended up at US$49.5 millioci, an overrun _f 37.62. The
largest overruns occurred in the Playa Dorada infrastructure and the airport,
primarily because of change orders on both work and equipment and because of
delays in contract completion. The Playa Grande works came in under projected
costs after the proposed golf course and club there were canceled for lack of
hotel development. Overall expenditures in U.S. dollars were much lower than
expected, since most contracts were granted to local firms. On completion of
most project works in 1982, total disbursements amounted to only US$18.5
million, so the Bank approved reimbursement of the expense incurred by the
Central Bank in building and equipping the first hotel at Playa Dorada, the
Jack Tar.
25.       Under the second loan, although it is clear that the project
suffered cost overruns, it is difficult to ascertain precisely the final cost.
Subloans under the line of credit were intended to accompany investors'
equity, and determining how much investors contributed is fraught with
problems. Since tax exonerations applied to nearly every aspect of hotel
constructitdn Lnu opeoatl%on, the information the hotels have provided has been
sparse, infrequent and widely regarded as unreliable. The tentative figures
INFRATUR has compiled therefore have to be regarded with considerable
reservation.
26.       According to INFRATUR's information, the overall investment in the
project has reached US$251.6 million to date. Since the complex is far larger
than what was originally envisioned, the investment is considerably greater
than the appraisal projection of US$71.0 million, and the numbers are not
directly comparable. By the more accurate comparison of cost-per-room, it
appears that instead of the roughly US$44,000 per room estimated at the
project's beginning, the average room cost was just over US$75,000, an
increase of about 722. This is attributable to a combination of factors.
First, the complex includes more large hotels and fewer smaller hotels than
was foreseen at appraisal, which drove the average investment cost per room up
considerably. Second, the prices of imported materials rose more than
expected between appraisal and construction. Third, the Dominican economy



- 8 -
passed through a major devaluation in 1985 and high inflation rates through
much of the construction period. Although prospective inflation was taken
into account at appraisal, the levels anticipated were based on historical
rates and were not expected to exceed 9. In reality, since 1984, Dominican
inflation rates have surpassed 25% in all but one year and topped 40% three
times. The delays at the project's start deferred most construction to the
high inflation years of the mid-1980s.
27.       Economilc ReevaluatIon.  Constrained by the severe limitations on
cost data and the unreliability of hotel financial statements, it is simply
not possible to conduct an economic reevaluation of the project as a whole.
The best that can be attempted is an illustrative evaluation that draws on the
few figures that are known and extrapolates in conformance with conservative
parameters. This is largely the approach the Dominican Government has taken
in trying to determine such basic information as average room rates and the
level of tourist traffic. Information has been culled from several
independent sources: hotel financial statements; advertisements in North
American and European periodicals and trade journals; consultant reports; and,
most usefully, data from the DNTI's quarterly tourist survey. The available
information has been cross-checked in an attempt to reach realistic estimates
of costs and revenues. The evaluation errs on the conservative side with
respect to revenues, however. It has been assumed, for instance, that room
rates will not rise in real terms, despite being only 50% of the Caribbean
average right now. Moreover, given the significant uncertainty surrounding
all the data, no shadow pricing has been done. The resulting analysis should
be regarded, therefore, as a low case. It is reasonable to conclude that it
represents the minimum possible rate of return of the project, and that the
actual return could well be much higher.
28.       The reevaluation produces an internal rate of return on the two
projects combined of 12%, compared with 17.5% forecast at appraisal of the
second loan. (See Annex I). The return was hurt by the lengthy delay in
opening hotels and resultant increase in cost per room, and the lack of
development in the Playa Grande area. Rooms became available much later than
the appraisal report estimated, which kept arrivals lower than expected and
meant fewer revenues from nonhotel activities or tourist taxes.  Sin.  the
bulk of the investment costs of the first tourism project had been incurred in
the late 1970e, the negative consequences of delays were magnified still
further. In addition, the mix of accommodations built under the line of
credit included more large hotels than was assumed at appraisal, which reduced
net benefits. The appraisal report cautioned that "Type A" hotels--those of
200 rooms or more--would produce lower operating profits than smaller units
because higher investment costs would not be fully compensated by higher
tariffs. It was expected that only one or two of the larger variety would be
built. In reality, of the seven new hotels financed by the line of credit,
four had more than 200 rooms and the other three had 150 or more.
29.       This evaluation, however, falls far short of including all the
economic benefits of the combined projects. In keeping with the format of the
second project's appraisal report, the calculation includes only those public
and private revenues imputable to the hotel3 of the Playa Dorada complex.
Thus, not all the benefits attributable to the international airport are



reflected, nor are any of the tax or hotel revenues from accommodations
outside Playa Dorada.
30.       In its PCR for the first loan, the Borrower estimated that 40,000
jobs had already been created in total, 12,000 of them direct.  Some 8,800 of
these were in the Puerto Plata area itself, 2,500 of them direct. With the
second loan completed, these figures have increased at least 50%. In terms of
employment, assuming a cautious 1.3 employee-per-room ratio suggests that the
projects have created a minimum of 4,300 jobs in hotels. They have also had
profound effects on the economy of Puerto Plata, where tourist services such
as vehicle rentals and transportation, and sales outlets for food, handicrafts
and equipment line the streets. Growth in nonhotel jobs has extended all
along the north coast, especially in Sssua. The main negative effect of
tourism in the region has been a pronounced increase in food prices.
31.       In reality, it can safely be assumed that little or none of the
tourism development of Puerto Plata would have occurred in the absence of the
infrastructure investments, credit lines, and demonstration effect of the two
projects. A reasonable, alternative way of viewing the projects' return,
therefore, is to impute to them the incremental value added of all tourism in
the Puerto Plata area. Following this approach produces a return on the order
of 26Z. Accordingly, the economic reevaluation should be considered the lower
extreme of a range of potential benefits created or induced by the project.
32.       The environmental impact of the projects has been both positive and
instructive. The beaches and water surrounding the complex remain clean,
densities relatively low, and, except where waivers from building codes were
granted, hotels stand well away from fragile coastline. The ordered and
harmonious development of Playa Dorada stands in marked contrast to the
uncontrolled crowding, unsightly structures, beach encroachment and
overbuilding that has occurred in Sosua, where tourism has been a mainly
private domain. This underscores the environmental importance of adopting and
enforcing strict zoning and regulations, especially since much of the tourist
appeal of a beach community derives from its natural surroundings.
F. Projects Sustainabilitv
33.       The enduring success of tourism as an integral sector of the
Dominican economy is evidenced by its growth from a minor industry 20 years
ago to the primary earner of foreign exchange and a driving force in national
income. Tourism receipts, which were US$123.9 million in 1979, reached US$912
million in 1989 and are expected to top US$1 billion this year. Relative to
income from sugar exports, income from tourism rose from just over 50Z in 1978
to 500% in 1988, when tourism brought in US$616 million compared with USS123.2
million from sugar. During the downturn in the world sugar market that began
in 1984, tourism receipts at first offset, and later exceeded, the shortfall
in foreign exchange earnings. As a proportion of exports of gS'ds and non-
factor services, tourism nearly doubled in three years--from 13.6S in 1980 to
26.1% in 1983--and in 1989 reached 42.6%. Largely because of tourism,
Dominican export earnings from non-factor services has exceeded those from
goods in two of the last three years. Tourism has also had a large, positive
budgetary impact. The majority of foreign travelers to the island must buy a



- 10 _
US$10 tourist card upon entering and pay a US$10 airport tax on departure. In
1989, revenues from Canadians and U.S. Americans alone, who together account
for three-quarters of foreign traffic, exceeded US$16 million.
34.       Tourism development is also continuing.  INFRATUR is looking to
complete the unfinished subprojects at Playa Dorada once expanded
infrastructure is in place. It is proceeding with construction of a
convention center in the heart of the complex which will accommodate up to
3,000 people and employ 700 full-time workers. In addition, Playa Grande
remains to be developed; the Central Bank now hopes to sell the entire 240 ha.
parcel to a single buyer and reports interest on the part of a Germar. concern.
G. Borrower Performance
35.       INFRATUR suffered from three principal problems in its role as
intetmediary. The most important Was lack of experience, both in the agency
and among its borrowers. Neither the public nor private sector in the
Dominican Republic was accustomed to the numerous and exacting formalities
this operation required. Beneficiaries often did not provxLde the proper
documentation; INFRATUR frequently responded with excessive bureaucratization
and diffusion of responsibility. Among the most common complaints levelcd at
the agency was the sheer number of signatures required for routine approvals.
A second problem was staff turnover. For most of the project, the average
stay for INFRATUR directors and managers was estimated to be eight months.
The third problem was financial.  As a result of the unforeseen devaluation of
1985, the Central Bank had to cover large exchange losses. In addition, since
the Central Bank did not pass on the World Bank's 0.75: commitment fee, its
losses grew steadily as disbursements fell ever further behind schedule. At
the date of final disbursement, September 30, 1988, the Central Bank
registered a minor loss of RD$489,034 on the project.
36.       INFRATUR and the Central Bank have learned from these experiences.
With the help of technical assistance financed by IDB, INFRATUR established a
financial coordination division in 1988 to concontrate on performing financial
evaluations. Beginning in February 1986, the Monetary Board required that a
clause denominating subloans in US dollars at the prevailing exchange rate be
included in all subloan agreements. Likewise, the Central Bank now charges A
1.25: commitment fee on subloans financed through an IDB line of credit.
37.       From the banks' perspective, intermediation was widely regarded as
successful. The main complaint concerned the small margin--fixed at 2.5: to
32--and the long term of the subloans. Since, for purposes of this project,
subloans were granted only to banks that had current accounts with the Central
Bank, there have been few problems with repayment. One additional problem
concerned the surrender of foreign exchange by the hotels. By law, hotels
were required to turn over all their foreign exchange to the Central Bank, but
in practice, the persistence of a sign&'icant gap between the official and
parallel rates and weak enforcement resulted in the hotels' surrendering only
a portion of their foreign exchange. This practice occasionally worked to the
detriment of on-lending banks, since a clause in subloan agreements stated
that the subloan would become due in full if the hotel withheld foreign



- 11 -
exchange. Banks complained about being punished for the actions of their
borrowers.
38.       The Central Bank hopes to avert the problem with an agreement it
signed with hoteliers in July 1990. From now on, hotels must deposit all of
their foreign exchange in a commercial bank, but will be permitted to withdraw
up to 50X of it without first cycling it through the Central Bank. This
coincides with the Government's decision to align the official exchange rate
much more closely with the parallel rate. The Government believes this will
be sufficient to cover hotels' expenses for imports. In addition, from July
15, 1990 on, most tourists to the island have been required to exchange
US$100, in order to give the Government greater control over foreign exchange
as it enters the country.
H. Findings and Lessons Learned
39.       As the Bank no longer supports tourism projects per se, there are
few directly relevant lessons of the Puerto Plata experience. Specific to
tourism development, the following experiences bear noting:
*    Funds should be made available for at least one pilot
acemodation, since no private concern will want to be the
first to invest in a new destination;
-    A considerable lag shculd be expected between the opening of
the pilot hotel and the construction of private accommodations;
-    The community should be included in planning and decision-
making as early as possible in the process;
-   More attention should be given to promoting agriculture and
fishing in the region, to help prevent pronounced increaGes in
food prices;
*    Immigration and customs services at airports should be
streamlined to minimize bureaucratic delays for arriving
passoengerat and
*    Where, as here, the implementing agency is a new one, it is
essential to endow it with sufficient, well-trained
professional staff, give it greater control over the financial
aspects of the operation, and improve its capability to collect
and analyze data.
40.       There are also several points of broader applicability.  The first,
and most important, is what the projects suggest can be the role of Government
in demonstrating the viability of a previously undeveloped sector. Neither
private banks nor investors in the Dominican Republic were villing to risk a
long-term investment in the unproven tourism market of the island. The public
sector therefore playetd a critical catalyst function in promoting an



- 12 -
essentially private sector activity in its infancy that is now likely to take
an enduring place in the country's economy.
41.       Second, undertaking financial operations of this complexity in a
system with little experience in such matters requires considerable technical
assistance. Some of the delay in implementation could have been avoided had
INFRATUR's administration of the credit line been better structured. Better
financial monitoring and enforcement could have captured more foreign exchange
from the project and would have put the Borrower in a better position to
assess project impact now, as well as hotel tax liabilities in the future.
42.       Third, well-designed and enforceable onviroimental regulations are
essential both to protecting the natural setting of a project and to ensuring
its continued profitability as a site of scenic beauty.
43.       IL sum, for all its delays and-difficulties, the integrated Puerto
Plata tourism project has been a significant success. The Bank, by providing
vital capital and technical expertise, played a prominent role in this
accomplishment and deserves a measure of credit for contributing to one of the
most important recent economic developments in the Dominican Republic. While
returns on the project itself may have fallen somewhat short of expectations,
the example it set has served both to diversify the *conomy away from
dependence on primary agricultural commodities and to help stimulate private
investment and employment in a sector that is likely to prove self-sustaining.

ANNEX I
Economic Analysis
1.        A general lack of reliable data concerning hotel operating expenses
and revenues hinders the attempt to evaluate the Puerto Plata projects.
Hotels have operated under a tax holiday since the inception of the project
and have provided financial information that is on the whole regarded with
skepticism. (One hotel claimed its average nightly room rate was US$8.) To
circumvent this problem, the DNTI and other agencLes of the Dominican
Government have drawn on varied sources in an attempt to arrive at broadly
accurate figures for room rates, occupancy rates, operating costs and other
data. The most ambitious such attempt is the national tourist survey,
conducted of outgoing travellers four times each year for one week in the
nation's three major airports. This survey, which has been carried out for
several years, provides a general sketch of the composition of spending by
tourists. The Government has also looked to advertisements in North American
periodicals, travel agencies, and tourism trade journals in an effort to
cross-check the figures generated by the tourist survey. In addition, the
Government retained the consulting firm of Horwath & Horwath International in
1989 to perform an analysis of the nation's hotel industry. The result was a
pro forma financial statement for the entire industry.
2.        This economic analysis has been carried out by integrating data from
these varying sources. By comparing ratios in hotels' actual financial
statements with those in the Horwath study, a pro forma income statement was
drawn up for the Puerto Plata hotels. (See Attachment 1.) So as not to
overstate hotel profitability, every effort was made to err conservatively
with respect to revenues. Takinq occupancy rate, average spending and
occupancy figures from the tourist survey, an approximation of bednights sold
and revenues per bednight were derived, as was the breakdown of revenues. The
resulting room rates were checked for general consistency with the Horwath
report, the Government's own estimates, and information obtained from U.S.
travel agents.
3.        The analysis of the two projects combined (Attachment 2) includes
the investment cost and revenue streams of both tourism loans. Annual
replacement costs have been estimated at 2% for the infrastructure financed
under the first loan, 3% after three operating years for hotels, and 1S% for
nonhotel investments after three years in operation. Consistent with the
survey and Horwath data, nonhotel spending has been estimated at 25% of
overall spending by tourists; the average operating costs of activities
outside hotels are estimated at 70% of sales. Investment costs of nonhotel
activities in a given year were taken to equal 60% of incremental tourist
expenditures outside hotels in the subsequent year. Tourist taxes include the
1 room tax paid by foreigners, the USS10 tourist card that must be purchased
by 70% of those visiting Puerto Plata (all of them foreign) and the US$10
departure tax which is levied on everyone who flies out of Puerto Plata
airport.
4.        The estimates generated by these calculatLons are all in line with
available actual data. Occupancy ratoe are expected to stabilize at 70%.
Double occupancy rates are assumed to have remained steady at 1.8 throughout

the project. The average stay has increased from 7.3 nights in 1981 to 9.2 in
1990, where Lt is projected to remain. Room rates, which were about US$22.0
per bedntight ln 1981, are estimated at USS2S.7 from 1990 on. In light of the
sLgnificant doubts concerning nearly all the data, no shadow pricing has been
undertaken. The analysis, however, reflects a conservative bias. Both
overall spending and room rates are projected to remain at current real
levels, although the latter are only about half the Caribbean average.
Occupancy rates are likewise forecast to stay at 70%, even though in recent
years sevaral Puerto Plata accommodations have posted rates of 80% or higher.
Finally, the analysis does not Lnclude any revenues from users of the on-site
infrastructure who do not stay at one of the project accommodations.
S.        The cost and benefit streams resulting from the above assumptions,
projections and estimates are presented in Attachment 2. Assuming an economic
operating life of 30 years, the internal rate of return for the entire
integrated project is 12.1%.
