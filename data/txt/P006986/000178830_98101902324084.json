{"cdata!": "The Second Tourism Project includes four\n            components: (a) a line of credit for the construction of\n            tourism facilities of about 1,600 rooms, of which about\n            1,200 will be in Playa Dorada, 300 in Playa Grande and 100\n            in the City of Puerto Plata, and for tourism services such\n            as restaurants, shops, tourism transport, and a 30 - boat\n            marina; (b) urban works in Puerto Plata; (c) a handicrafts\n            center where about 50 artisans will be trained each year;\n            (d) a total of about 132 man-months of technical assistance\n            to DNTI for sectoral planning and economic evaluation of\n            projects, and to INFRATUR for land development, hotel\n            construction and equipment. In addition, the project\n            provides for three instructors for two years for the\n            handicraft center. A major increase in operating costs,\n            unmatched by revenue increases, is the principal project\n            risk. This, however, will imply an unlikely decline in hotel\n            operating efficiency."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
