REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in vorious currencies equivalent to $18.3 million to
the Republic of Colombia, the proceeds of which are to be made available
to the Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero ("Cajaf') to finance
livestock development.
PART I   HISTORICAL
2.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's sixth loan for agriculture
in Colombia. Two loans (18 CO and 108 CO) for $5 million each to finance
the importation of agricultural equipment have been fully repaid. A loan
(502 CO) of $9 million was made in June, 1967 to the Colombian Agrarian
Reform Institute (INCORA) for the first phase of the Atlantico No. 3
Irrigation Project. Another loan of $17 million was made in June, 1969,
for an INCORA agricultural credit project. In May, 1966 the Bank made
a loan of $16.7 million to finance the first stage of a long-term livestock
development program and has now been requested to assist in financing the
continuation of this program.
3.       A Bank mission to Colombia appraised the proposed loan during
January-February, 1969 and negotiations were held in Washington during
July 28-30, 1969. The Government of Colombia was represented by Dr. M1isael
Pastrana Borrero and Dr. Eduardo Gaitan Duran (Ambassador and Counsellor
respectively of the Colombian Embassy in Nbshington), the Caja by Dr. Eduardo
Vega Franco (Financial Manager), the Banco de la Republica by Dr. Rafael
Gama (Assistant Manager) and the Colombian Planning Office by Dr. Alfonso
Mbjia (Director, Projects Department).
4.       The proposed loan would be the thirty-ninth made to Colombia
and would increase the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to $618.3
million (net of cancellations). IDA has made one credit of $19.5 million

5.       Twenty-three loans have been completely disbursed.   On the remainder,
disbursements are now proceeding normally. The Executive Directors pre-
viously approved an amendment to the Loan Agreement for Loan 369 CO, under
which the Loan was split into two tranches and the Closing Date was post-
poned by two years to December 31, 1970 (R67-136). Effective December 26.
1968, $3 million of the undisbursed balance was cancelled, and on present
indications a further $4-5 million will be cancelled prior to the new
Closing Date.



6.        IFC has made 31 investments and underwriting commitments in
sixteen enterprises in Colombia totalling $17.5 million (net of
cancellations).

PART III: THE PROJECT
8.        An Appraisal Report on the project entitled "iColombia: Livestock
Development Project" (PA-18a) is attached.



9.        Agriculture accounts for about 30 percent of Colombia's gross
domestic product, 75 percent of total exports and 50 percent of the labor
force. Almost two-thirds of total export earnings are generated by coffee
which has induced the Government in recent years to promote export
diversification as a basis for long run export growth. An appropriate
focus for this effort is livestock, particularly beef cattle. The cattle
industry presently occupies some 30 million hectares or about 90 percent
of the land now used by the agricultural sector. Further extensive areas
suitable for cattle grazing in the tropical lowlands and temperate high1end,
await exploitation. Productivity on beef cattle ranches, however, has been
relatively low and domestic demand consumes most of what is produced. In
recent years the Colombian Government has adopted a more flexible exchange
rate policy, granted a special tax advantage for exports(other than coffee
and petroleum) and adopted special credit, meat inspection and other programs
designed to improve the prospects for meat exports. To be effective, how-
ever, these measures need to be accompanied by major improvements in ranch
and herd management and development, and there still is an insufficient
supply of the long-term credit which, together with technical assistance,
is required to bring about such improvement.
10.       The first livestock development loan (448 G0) of $16.7 million
provided credit primarily for beef cattle ranches in the North Coast region,
which has favorable prospects for increasing productivity and access to
export markets through the slaughtering and shipping facilities of the
port of Barranquilla. As of September 30, 1969, approximately 380 loans
had been approved for beef production in this region.   About another 150
lcans were approved for beef production in the newly developing Eastern
Plains region, 90 for dairy operations,pnd 7 for sheep operations.
Virtually all'loan funds have been committed, and it is estimated that
they will be'completely disbursed byiDecember 1970, one year ahead of the
schedule originally contemplated.' Because the execution of farm develop-
ment plans is still in an early stage, it is too early to'make a complete
evaluation of the first project, but the evidence to date shows that the
sub-loans approved have been for soundly based farm development plans.
12.       Total conta of the proposed project are estimated at about $44.1
million.  Of this,'the Caja would contribute 21 percent, the ranchers 37
percent and the Bank 42'Percent.   Approximately $17.8 million of the Bank
loan would be for on-farm investments and the establishment of'a sheep
development center and the remaining $3.5 million for technical- services
to strengthen Caja?s management resources-for administering the project.
The project's'foreign costs are estimiated-at 28 percent, which means that'-
the proposed Bank'loan would include $5.9 million in local cost financing.
This eppears to'be fully justified, bearing in mind that"the Bank's share
in the total'cost of the project would be'only 42 percent and that'the
project'is of strategic importance"in the critceal area of-export diversi-
fication. As set forth in some detail in the Bank's latest Economic



Report on Colombia (WH-188a of December 30, 1968), Colombia has a well-
conceived development progrmm, is making every reasonable effort to
mobilize local resources in its support, but requires external assistance
in excess of the foreign exchange component of development projects
suitable for external financing.
13.       As mentioned in paragraph 1 above, the proposed loan would be
made to the Government. The Government, in turn, would channel the loan funds
through its agricultural financing fund (t'Fbndo Financiero Agrario")
to the Caja, which would administer the project. The Caja would receive
the loan funds on the same repayment terms as the Government receives them
from the Bank, but the Caja would pay interest of up to 10L percent to
the Government with the latter bearing the exchange risk. Loans to
farmers would be for 12 years with four years' grace (except for sheep
farmers who would be allowed six years' grace because of anticipated
slower returns on investment) at 14 percent interest. In addition to the
loans partly financed by the Bank, Caja will make out of its own resources
short-term loans to beef producers for the purchase of feeder steers for
fattening. All loans to farmers will be made on the basis of farm plans.
Within the Caja, technical management of the project would reside in the
special livestock development department established in connection with
the first loan and composed of the Technical Director, two regional
Chief Technicians and a Technical Supervisor of the sheep development
program, all internationally recruited, as well as local staff.
14.       The execution of the project is dependent upon the adequacy of
technical and supervisory services. These were satisfactory at the time
of negotiations save with respect to parts of the project accounting for
$2.6 million of the proceeds of the proposed loan, namely, beef producers
in the Magdalena Valley, wool producers in the highlands and the
sheep development center.   However, it is expected that these lagging
services would improve to an adequate level during the disbursement period
of the proposed loan; and withdrawals from the loan account in respect of
the above mentioned parts of the project would therefore proceed only when
the Bank is satisfied that this level is achieved. In addition, the
acquisition of land required for the sheep development center would be
a condition for disbursement specifically with respect to the cost of the
sheep development center and loans to wool producers.
15.       Goods suitable for bulk purchasing under the proposed loan
(fertilizers, pasture seeds, chemicals for weed control, fencing wire
and steel fencing posts) would be procured by the Caja on the basis of
international competitive bidding, in accordance with Section 2.03 of the
draft Project Agreement, with domestic producers participating with a
preference margin equivalent to the actual incidence of customs duties
up to a maximum limit of 15 percent of the cif price of these goods.



Procurement of other items promptly available through suppliers in
Colombia would be through such suppliers; but the Caja would have the
particular responsibility for importing inputs needed for the project
which were not available through these channels. The Borrower would
permit the importation of project inputs promptly upon the request of the
Caja.
16.       The average financial rates of return per annum from the project
are about 20 percent to beef producers, 25 percent to dairy farmers and
25 percent to wool producers. The internal rate of return to the economy
is estimated at 22 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMEiNTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Colombia, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Caja, the
draft form of Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia
and the Caja, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
18.       The draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in
agreements for agricultural credit projects. The proceeds of the loan
will be relent by the Government to Caja under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
to be executed and delivered in the Spanish language in Colombia before
the loan may become effective (Section 7.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
PART V - THE ECONOM1Y
19.       Colombia's economic situation was fully analyzed in the IBRD
Economic Report of December 1968 (WH-188a), entitled "Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Colombia". The major conclusions of this
Report are that economic performance has improved markedly in recent
years and that there are reasonably good prospects for this improvement
continuing. Recently, an economic mission returned from Colombia, and
its preliminary analysis confirms the conclusions of this Report.
20.       The expected growth of GDP in 1969 is around 6.5 percent, which
represents a further acceleration in the rate from an average of 4.4
percent between 1950 and 1967 and the rate of 5.5 percent in 1960. The
rate of price increase has been held down to about 7 percent annually
in the last three years, as compared with increases of 15 to 20 percent
in the years 1963-66.   The Central Government's savings on current account



- 7 -
in the last four years have increased at an average rate of 20 percent
in real terms. There has been notable improvement in a wide range of
sector policies. Exchange earnings, still principally from coffee,
have been the major constraint upon economic growth during the past
decade. However, export diversification, which has been proceeding
steadily for some years, has now been made a major objective of
Colombian policy. Exports other than coffee and petroleum have grown
from US$73 million in 1964 to US$117 million in 1967, US$178 million
in 1968 and are likely to reach US$190 to $200 million in 1969. The
Government has resolved to take the measures needed to sustain a
vigorous growth rate of minor exports.
2l.       Given the continued prospect for the fulfillment of the fiscal
and export targets as outlined in the economic report, which the Govern-
ment recognizes are needed to sustain its investment and external
borrowing intentions, the Government's external financing plans seem
reasonable and appropriate even though they imply an increase in external
public debt from US$1.2 billion at the end of 1968 to US$2.3 billion by
1973. The average ternsof the present debt are favorable. Even if terms
harden slightly, as they might, the burden of this debt should remain
manageable. If exports and domestic savings develop as intended, the
debt service ratio would increase from 12.7 percent in 1968 to between
16 and 17 percent in 1973 and tend to level off thereafter. With the
continuation of present policies, Colombia should, therefore, be judged
creditworthy for the external borrowing in prospect.
22.       Economic developments in Colombia in the near future may be
strongly influenced by an unexpected increase in the world market price
for Colombian coffee. (The current price is 57 cents, which compares with
a price of 42 cents projected in the last economic report). A'a long as
prices remsin substabtiilly above the 42V- level, this tiruld tend to support
a higher rate of economic growth.
PA,RT VI - CCMPLTANCE WITH THE ARTICUS OF AGMEENWf
I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECONMENDATION
I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
