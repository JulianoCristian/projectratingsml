PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAIRE - GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Zaire,
GECAMINES Expansion Project for which a Bank loan in the amount of
$100.0 million was approved on March 8, 1975 to the State-owned
La G&nerale des Carrieres et des Mines (GECAMINES). The Project
was co-financed by the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (US$100 million) and
the European Investment Bank (US$20 million). Subsequent to a rebel
invasion of the Shaba province in 1978 and the resulting work stoppage
and delay in project implementation the project scope was amended on
November 16, 1979 to focus on priority rehabilitation and expansion
investments, with a reallocation of US$24.6 million of the Bank loan.
Following the closing of the Loan on June 30, 1981, Bank
staff visited Zaire and held discussions with the Government, SOZACOM
and GECAMINES for the preparation of this PCR. The report reflects
findings of the various missions that visited Zaire since that date
as well as the on-going review of GECAMINES' performance under a
Technical Assistance Credit (No. 1336-ZR). No comments were received
from the Borrower or the co-financiers.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAIRE - GECAMINES EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1090-ZR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       Zaire's mineral industry is the most important sector of its modern
economy, accounting on average for about 18 percent of GDP, 25 percent of
public revenues and 65 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
The country's largest mining and industrial concern, GECAMINES is the world's
leading producer of cobalt as well as one of the major producers of copper,
zinc and cadmium. In 1982, GECAMINES' metal production amounted to 466,000
tons of copper, 5,600 tons of cobalt and 64,400 tons of zinc for total sales
revenues of approximately US$1.1 billion, i.e., is about equivalent to
performance at appraisal in 1974 (PCR, para. 1.01).
2.        The GECAMINES expansion project was identified in 1973 and
appraised in April 1974. In August 1974 a post-appraisal mission visited
Zaire to finalize all matters related to the project. The Expansion Project
aimed at increasing the Company's annual production capacity from 470,000
tons to 590,000 tons of copper and from 16,000 to 20,000 tons of cobalt. The
Project was supposed to be completed by mid 1978. Based -r the
recommendations of the SAR, the Board approved in March t, 1975 a Bank loan
to GECAMINES, with the guarantee of the Government for US$100.0 million
repayable in 15 years with a grace period of 3.5 years bearing an interest of
8% p.a. (and a 2% guarantee fee payable by GECAMINES to the Government). The
loan became effective on December 2, 1975 (PCR, paras. 2.01, 2.02).
3.        In order to achieve the planned production increases, the project
consisted of (i) the development of two new open-pit mines capable of
producing an average of four million tons of ore per year, (ii) primary
crushing facilities and a 100,000 tons per year concentrator with the
necessary concentrate dewatering and storage facilities, (iii) the
construction of a flash-smelter and electro-refinery together with the
required ancillary facilities such as a lime kiln, oxygen plant, sulphuric
acid plant and a coal gasification plant, (iv) modification of the existing
hydrometallurgical plants, (v) expansion of existing industrial
infrastructure, work-shops and administrative infrastructure, and (vi)
construction of 2,330 additional houses for GECAMINES' employees and
extension of social and community facilities   (PCR, para. 2.03).



- vi -
4.        Initially the expansion project proceeded as planned but soon
substantial delays occurred in its execution as compared to original targets
due to the following external and internal difficulties:
(i) the closing of the Benguela railway (in Angola) in November 1975
resulted in a significant increase in transit times and transit
costs for 'e Company's metal exports;
(ii) starting in 1975, copper prices dropped drastically from US$0.93
lb. in 1974 to US$0.56 per lb. in 1975 and remained at low levels
from the longest sustained period since the Depression to average
US$0.64 in 1976, US$0.59 in 1977 and US$0.62 in 1978.  This
together with increasingly inefficient marketing by SOZACOM, the
Zairian marketing agent, had a preponderant impact on GECAMINES'
ability to provide adequate internally generated project financing;
(iii)  the Company's internal cash generation was further reduced at the
height of Zaire's economic crisis in 1976, when no foreign exchange
was allocated to GECAMINES, leading to a serious depletion of
inventories of materials, supplies and spare parts;
(iv) project funding was also reduced by increasing Government
interference in the Company such as barter sales without proper and
timely compensation, fund withdrawals and imposition of demands for
goods and services. The limited resources of adequate project
management and staffing was weakened by imposition of limits on
salaries and increasing politization of the Company's top
management;
rv) an inequitable taxation system based primarily on export duties and
turnover taxes; and
(vi) on May 13, 1978 rebel troops invaded the Shaba province and
brought project execution to a standstill. An estimated 800 people
were killed including 150 Europeans   (PCR, paras. 2.05 - 2.07).
5.        After security had been reestablished in the Kolwezi area, alterna-
tives for continuing with project implementation were discussed between the
Bank, GECAMINES, the Government and the co-lenders leading to the Amending
Agreement of November 16, 1979. In light of GECAMINES' financial, technical
and managerial constraints and the urgency for both rehabilitating the
Company's deteriorated operating facilities and reconstructing Kolwezi, the
original project scope was amended and the undisbursed balances of the IBRD
and the LAFB loans of US$24.6 million each were reallocated. The undisbursed
balances were reallocated to in effect enable (i) a continuation of financing
of those goods and services required for an expansion of mining and
concentrating capacities as well as financing of other equipment already
ordered under the original Expansion Program; (ii) financing of needed mining



- vii -
equipment and (iii) financing of consultants to carry out organizationa.l
studies and the introduction of a computerized accounting system in SOZACOM.
In addition, the closing date was postponed from December 31, 1978 to June
30, 1981. The amended project scope was essentially completed as scheduled
with the exception of the SOZACOM component which encountered a 2 "ear delay
(PCR, paras. 2.08 - 2.17).
6.        At appraisal %ICCAMlNES' Expansion Program was estimated to cost
US$403.6 million exclusive of working capital and interest during
construction. At the time of the Amendment in November 1979 the full
completion of the project was estimated at US$598.7 million. In December
1981, the actual expenditures for the project amounted to US$365.1 million of
which 76.1% were in foreign exchange. As completion of the original project
has been postponed indefinitely, no meaningful estimate can be given at
present for its completion. With regards to project management, although
GECAMINES' project management structure has not been entirely adequate,
notably in coordinating the various sub-projects units, it cannot be faulted
as a prime reason for the project's problems and delays as described earlier
(PCR, paras. 2.18 - 2.28).
7.        Since the project as conceived originally has not been completed
the economic benefits have been well below expectations' at appraisal. Final
benefits of the completed project components are estimated at US$300 million
for the 1980-94 period and annual net foreign exchange earnings at $50
million. The financial and economic returns for the completed components are
12% and 14%, respectively, but the returns on the entire investment are
barely positive   (PCR, para:. 5.08 - 5.14).
8.        The GECAMINES project had been prepared well.  The assumptions
on which the technical, financial and economic viability analyses were based
were realistic, perhaps the anticipated implementation schedule somewhat too
ambitious. The stipulated covenants of the original Loan Agreement and the
Amended Loan Agreement were detailed and specific, but did not focus
sufficiently on marketing/sales proceeds aspects and copper pr-ce
assumptions. The set-aside arrangements were effective, the Bank's
supervision extensive. Why then had the performance under this Loan been
doubtful?  Why have only a part of the objectives been met with two major
components of the project remaining unfinished, thleir equipment being stored
in warehouses? This report describes in detail the external attributable
factors such as the Shaba hostilities, the closing of the Benguela railroad,
tne poor performance of t1e copper market, the collapse of the cobalt boom,
the severe and incessant economic crisis of Zaire, and the Government's
non-compliance on financial and marketing covenants under both the original
Loan Agreement and the Amended Agreement   (PCR, para. 7.01).
9.        The Bank's role clearly changed during project implementation from
that of a financier of a well-managed international mining company to that of
an advisor to a country and company in financial and managerial crises.
Major progress has been made since loan closing in defining the framework of



- viii -
GECAMINES' operation which will maximize short, medium and long term resource
transfer to the economy and the Government budget. These positive
developments include:
(a) adoption of a more rational tax regime;
(b) abolishment of SOZACOM and discontinuation of diversion of
GECAMINES sales receipts; and
(c)  improved management, organizational structure and cost control.
The dialogue with GECAMINES and the Government continues under the Technital
Assistance Credit No. 1336-ZR approved in 1983   (PCR, paras. 6.01 - 6.04).
10.       The lessons learned are discussed in paras. 7.02 - 7.05.

1.01      La GEnerale des Carriare et des Mines (GECAMINES), was created in
1967, following the nationalization of the Belgian owned Union Miniere du
Haut Katanga (UMHK). GECAMINES operates a 20,000 km2 mining concession in
the Shaba province containing some of the richest stratiform copper
deposits in the world with grades of 4-5 percent. All of Zaire's cobalt
and zinc and most of its copper are produced by GECAMINES. It has, at
present, a concentrating capacity of about 530,000 tons per years (tpy) of
copper and a smelting capacity of 470,000 tpy of copper. However, the
mining capacity has, in the last three-four years, been around 450,000 tpy
of copper, mainly because of the lagging of over-burden removal. In
addition, GECAMINES has production capacities of 15,000 tpy of cobalt and
70,000 tpy of zinc, but refining capacities are limited to 250,000 tpy of
copper and 6,000 tpy of cobalt. The remainder of the output has, so far,
been refined primarily under tolling arrangements in Belgidm. In addition
to its main metals, GECAMINES produces cadmium, gold and silver as
by-products. With average sales revenues of about $1.0 billion per year
and a net foreign exchange generation of about $600 million GECAMINES plays
an overwhelming role in the economy of Zaire.
1.02      The GECAMINES Expansion Project was the Bank Group's first
involvement in the Zairian mining sector and has been f--'owed by an IDA
Credit (No. 1336-ZR GECAMINES-Technical Assistance CreLit, October 26,
1983) to assist the Company in streamlining marketing, management and cost
structure.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Project Objectives
2.01      On March 8, 1975, the Bank extended to the state-owned La
C;n6rale des Carriares et des Mines, a loan of US$100 milion equivalent to
assist in financing the expansion of the Company's copper-cobalt-zinc
mining facilities of Kolwezi in the Shaba Province in southern Zaire. The
project was co-finar-ad by the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank (US$100 million
equivalent) and European Investment Bank (US$20 million equivalent). The
expansion project aimed at increasing the Company's annual production
capacity from 470,000 to 590,000 tons'/ of copper and from 16,000 to
20,000 tons of cobalt. By mid-1978, all project components including
social infrastructure were supposed to be completed. Full production of
refined copper and copper-cobalt alloy was expected starting 1979.
2.02      Traditionally, GECAMINES has played a major role in the Zairian
economy accounting on average for 25% of the country's tax revenues and two
thirds of net foreign exchange earnings. Aichough GECAMINES' contribution
to the economy has fluctuated in recent years in response to metal prices
and declining efficiency, foreign exchange earnings in 1980 amounted to
TJS$1,378 million and tax revenues to US$232.7 million as compared to US$887
million and US$55 million, respectively, in 1983.
B.   Project Description and Implementation
1.   Scope and Completion of Original Expansion Project
2.03      In order to achieve the planned production increases, the project
consisted of (i) the development of two new open-pit mines capable of
producing an average of four million tons of ore per year, (ii) primary
crushing facilities and a 100,000 tons per year concentrator with the
necessary concentrate dewatering and storage facilities, (iii) the
construction of a flash-smelter and electro-refinery together with the
required ancillary facilities such as a lime kiln, oxygen plant, sulphuric
acid plant and a coal gasification plant, (iv) modification of the existing
hydrometaliurgical plants, (v) expansion of existing industrial
infrastructure, workshops and administrative infrastructure, and (vi)
construction of 2,330 additional houses for GECAMINES' employees and
extension of social and community facilities. A detailed listing of the
originally planned production facilities is given in Annex I and their cost
estimates are shown in Annex IV. The proceeds of the loans were co finance

2.04      Although the project was approved in December L974, the Loan
Agreements signed in March 1975 and procurement procedures completed in July
1975, the Loan Agreement did not become effective until December 2, 1975 as a
result of delays and difficulties in finalizing the set-aside arrangements
which were set up to ensure availability of funds for the debt service
payments to the IBRD, LAFB and EIB. Consequently, actual project
implementation started 16 months behind schedule, in July 1976.
2.05      Initially the expansion project proceeded as planned but soon
substantial delays occurred in its execution as compared to original targets
due to the following external and internal difficulties;
(i) the closing of the Benguela railway in November 1975 resulted in a
significant increase in transit times and transit costs for the
Company's metal exports, and necessitated the rerouting of imports
and exports by alternative routes such as the Voie Nationale"
within Zaire and through South African and Tanzanian ports;
(ii) starting in 1975, copper prices dropped arastically from
US$0.93/lb in 1974 to US$0.56/lb in 1975 and remained at low levels
from the longest sustained period since the 1930's depression to
average US$0.64/lb in 1976, US$0.59/lb in 1977 and US$0.62/lb in
1978. While copper prices during 1979-82 averaged again $0.82/lb,



-4-
copper prices have fallen again to $0.58 in mid-1984. This
together with increasingly inefficient marketing arrangements
through SOZACOM had a damaging impact on GECAMINES' ability to
provide adequate internally generated cash for project financing;
(iii)  the Company's internal cash generation was further
reduced at the height of Zaire's economic crisis in 1976, when no
foreign exchange was allocated to GECAMINES. The Government
subsequently agreed to allocate to GECAMINES 45 percent of the
latter's export revenues in foreign exchange.2/ This also proved
to be insufficient primarily during periods of low metal prices;
(iv)  project funding was also reduced by increased Government
interference in the Company such as barter sales without proper
and timely compensation, fund withdrawals and imposition of
demands for goods and services. The limited resources of
adequate project management and staffing were weakened by
imposition of limits on salaries and increasing rolitization of
the Company's top management; and
(v)  an inequitable taxation system based primarily on export duties
and turnover taxes3/. Declining metal prices would have made
this level of taxation confiscatory without ad hoc tax credits
allowed by the Government to offset cash flow deficits.
Nonetheless the relief was insufficient to provide adequate
funding for the expansion project.
2.06      On May 13, 1978, rebel troops invaded the Shaba Province and
brought project execution to a standstill. An estimated 800 people were
killed including 150 Europeans. Although the invasion caused little direct
damage to GECAMINES' production facilities in Kolwezi as opposed to housing
and transportation equipment (total direct damage has been estimated at
US$27.3 million), the evacuation of project contractor and expatriate
personnel including the project supervision team and their subsequent
dismissal had a substantial impact on project execution. All contractors
working on the Kolwezi site declared "force majeure" and project
implementation remained halted for nine months. Loan disbursements by the
co-lenders were suspended.
2.07      At the time of the invasion 48% of total project costs had been
paid by the co-lenders (71.6% of the total IBRD loan was actually disbursed
compared to the 96.0% expected at appraisal) and out of GECAMINES'
internally generated funds. The physical status of the major project
components was as follows:
2/  Following an agreement with thu EEC in 1982, and as a condition for a
SYSMIN loan to the Company, the Government agreed to allocate a monthly
amount of US$24 million equivalent (or US$288 million p.a.) equivalent
to GECAKTNES in foreign exchange to cover its foreign exchange needs.
3/ As part ot Credit 1336-ZR--Gecamines--Technical Assistance Credit
dated October 26, 1983, the Government adopted in 1983 a new taxation
system based on royalties and profit taxation. For details see
President's Report P-3474-ZR.



-5-
(i) about 40 percent of the planned mining equipment had been
supplied or was on order;
(ii)  for the crushing facilities all equipment was on site and half
of the civil works completed. The concentrator was about 90%
complete with almost all equipment on site, the remainder stored
in Europe, and most major civil works and erection finished. No
equipment erection had taken place. For the concentrate
*                    dewatering and storage facilities about one-third of the
equipment was on site, the remainder was in transit or under
construction. Major civil works were 80% completed. No erection
had been initiated;
(iii) for the flash smelter 95% of the equipment had been ordered
while manufacturing of the remaining 5% had be2en suspended.
AJmost all finished equipment has been stored in Europe.
Engineering had not been completed. Only 25% of the foundations
had been finished and erection had only just started. However,
overall 75% of the electro-refinery lmad been finished with 50% of
the equipment on site and almost all civil works and erections,
except equipment erections, completed. Of the ancillary
facilities in Kolwezi about 50% had been completed. The coal
pulverization plant and lime kiln are outside the Kolwezi area
and had not been affected by the invasion;
(iv)  engineering for the modification on the hydrometallurgical
plant (Luilu) had been completed and a small r--t of the
equipment had been ordered.  Hardly any civ4i   works had been
started;
'v) progress or the industrial infrastructure had been estimated at
around 50%; and
(vi)  only around 25% of the social infrastructure was ready for
use, i.e., only 120 of the 1,600 workers' houses and 160 of the
250 staff houses. Virtually no work had started on the community
infrastructure.
2.   Scope and Completion of Amended Project
2.08      After security had been reestablished in the Kolwezi area,
alternatives for continuing with project implementation were discussed
between the Bank, GECAMINES, the Government and the co-lenders leading to
the Amending Agreement of November 16, 1979. In light of GECAMINES'
financial, technical and managerial constraints and the urgency for both
rehabilitating the Company's deteriorated operating facilities and
reconstructing Kolwezi, the original project scope was amended and the
undisbursed balances of the IBRD and the LAFB loans of US$24.6 million each
were reallocated.
2.09      Since it was realized at the time that no financial and human
resources were available to complete the original project scope and, at the
same time, carry out an urgently needed rehabilitation program, it was
hoped that within two years security, recruitment and market situation



-6-
would have stabilized and work on the full original project scope would be
resumed. Consequently, the Expansion Project was modified, and a high
priority rehabilitation program and critically needed consultant studies
added. Thus, the amended project scope consisted of four distinct parts:
'a) a Rehabilitation Program to be completed by the end of 1981;
(b) a Phase I Expansion Program also to be completed by the end of
1981;
(c) a Phase II Expansion Program to be resumed not later than
July 1, 1981 and completed by early 1983; and
(d) Consultant studies.
2.10      The Rehabilitation Program was designed to restore the
established capacity of its production facilities and included (i) the
rehabilitation of deteriorated assets including the replacement of mining
equipment; the restoration of the Kolwezi concentrator and the
metallurgical plants of Luilu, Lubumbashi and Shituru; the improvements of
the internal transport infrastructure; the modernization of the Shituru
sulphuric acid plant; and the replacement of tools and equipment in the
central workshops; (ii) the replenishment of stocks and essential supplies
and spare parts; and (iii) the reconstruction of destroyed houses and the
replacement of lost equipment in Kolwezi.
2.11      Phase I, designated as  P470" by the Company, included the
development of two open pit mines, construction of the primary crusher,
concentrator, and concentrate dewatering and storage, as well as the lime
kiln and its coal pulverization plant.
2.12      Phase II consisLed of the completion of the original Mining
Expansion Project with the objective of raising the Company's annual
production of copper to 570,000 tons (Company designation (CP570") which
included primarily the flash-smelter and electro-refinery, the remaining
ancillary facilities and industrial and social infrastructure).
2.13      The Consultant Studies were to review GECAMINES' organizational
and training needs as well as to install an automated financial and cost
accounting system in SOZACOM, the Zairian metal marketing firm, in support
of its marketing activities.
2.14      To ensure completion of the most critical components of the
Rehabilitation and Phase I Expansion Programs as well as completion of the
organizational and marketing studies, the undisbursed balances of the IBRD
and LAFB loans were reallocated to allow (i) a continuation of financing of
those goods and services required for the Phase I Expansion Program as well
as financing of other equipment already ordered under the original
Expansion Program; (ii) financing of needed additional mining equipment and
(iii) financing of consultants to carry out the organizational and
marketing studies. Compared to the original agreement, the funds were
reallocated as shown in the following table.

The balance of the Libyan loan was reallocated in the same manner. In
addition, the closing date was postponed from December 31, 1978 to June 30,
1981.
2.15      The Rehabilitation Program, Phase I Expansion and the Consultant
Studies have been completed in line with the agreed Amendment, in
particular: the two new open-pit mines at Dikuluwe and Mashamba with an
annual capacity of 12 m3 million of ore have been fully developed and
provide ore to the crushing facility which was commissioned on April 25,
1981. The oxyde and mixed ore sections of the new DIMA concentrator with a
capacity of 2 million tons of ore each have been fully operational since
March 20 and May 15, 198J respectively. The opening of this facility
incraased GECAMINES' total concentrator capacity to 530,000 tons of
contained copper per year. The concentrate dewatering and storage
facilities ('Poste 3') at Luilu has been started up on December 27, 1981.
The new, third lime kiln in Kakontwe was put in service on March 6, 1980
fired by coal from the coal pulverization plant which began operation on
August 31, 1979. The acid plant, originally to be located in Luilu, has
been installed in Shituru (Likasi) and provides now 45% of GECAMINES' total
acid production. Moreover, all mining equipment, primarily the 150-ton ore
trucks and sub-assemblies, have been purchased and integrated in the
operations.
2.16      The organizational study was completed on schedule and GECAMINES
implemented the major recommendation.  In contrast the attempt to introduce
an effective commercial accounting system in SOZACOM experienced more than
2 years delay. The system has been operating with great difficulty since
1983.
2.17      GECAMINES in agreement with the Government had, however, decided
to postpone the Phase II Expansion Program indefinitely because of the
Company's and Government's financial problems. In retrospect, in light of
the persistent copper oversupply it appears that this decision was
justified. Despite a short reprieve, primarily as a result of a boom in



-8-
cobalt prices, the Company had been affected by an unabating, severe
liquidity crisis since mid-1980 due to (i) declining cobalt sales and
prices, and low copper prices; (ii) diversion of sales receipts by the
Government; and (iii) supply problems. Details are discussed in 3.07-3.14.
C. Project Management
2.18      Project management was provided by a separate unit within
GECAMINES' Engineering and Construction Department.  This unit had overall
responsibility for supervision and coordination of the various contractors
as well as construction of project components such as modification of the
Luilu plant and industrial and administrative infrastructure.  It received
assistance from the Company's operating and service departments as well as
outside firms. The Expansion Project was divided into twelve self-
contained plant units and about forty-five other equipment and construction
packages. For each of the twelve ulLits with the exception of the flash
smelter, bids were requested on a turnkey basis whereby the contractor
would provide engineering design, procurement and erection of equipment,
building construction and plant start-up, with the appropriate input and
approvals from GECAMINES. For the forty-five other packages, GECAMINES
would order the equipment directly, and erect and construct these with its
own staff or through contracts with local entrepreneurs.
2.19      In general, the contractors for the plant units constructed on a
turnkey basis, although delayed initially by the Government's tardiness in
meeting the Bank's conditions under the Joint Financing Agreement for the
loan to become effective, were able to meet their objectives with little
additional delay until work was interrupted by the Shaba invasion in May
1978. Those plant units which are now complete such as the DIMA concentra-
tor, crusher, lime kiln, coal and acid plants are operating satisfactorily
after experiencing relatively few start-up problems.
2.20      The flash smelter posed a particular problem since the EIB
procurement rules precluded a turnkey contract. Therefore. a British
engineering firm was selected to provide detailed engineering design and
equipment selection, procurement services, and construction supervision.
Reportedly the services provided were unsatisfactory primarily because the
consultants did not assign qualified personnel to the project. Various
deadlines agreed to with GECAMINES passed unmet without comment or
reaction. As a result, the scheduled completion date was continuously
delayed. In May 1978, when work was stopped, there was an estimated
twenty-two months left to physical completion.
2.21      Despite the external factors affecting the project, it is evident
that the agreed project management structure was not adequate to permit
timely completion. Either increased outside assistance or a substantial
strengthening of authority and staffing of GECAMINES Engineering and
Construction Department would have been required in hindsight.

D. Project Capital Cost
2.22      At appraisal GECAMINES' Expansion Program was estimated to cost
US$403.6 million before working capital and interest during construction.
At the time of the Amendment in November 1979 the full completion of the
project was estimated at US$598.7 million. At the beginning of October
1981, the actual expenditures for the project amounted to US$365.1 million
of which 76.1% were in foreign exchange. A summary comparison is given in
the following table.

2.23      Since the completion of the full scope of the original Expansion
Project has been postponed indefinitively, it is not very meaningful to
prepare estimates for its completion. Nevertheless, in order to gauge
the accuracy of the appraisal estimates such a hypothetical case has been
calculated.   Accordingly, under the assumption that the entire program
could be completed by 1987, overall project cost is estimated to increase
to US$769.9 million, a 28.6% increase compared to the Amendment estimate
and a 90.8% increase over appraisal.
2.24      The following table compares the hypothetical completion project
cost figures with the estimates at appraisal and at the Loan Amendment.

a/ Mm hypothetical canpletion is based on October 1981 estimates ad adjusted for loal and foreign
prioe inflation. The Expansion Project is assumed to be completed over the period 1983-87, the
Rehabilitation Project over the period 1983-85.
2.25       The estimated increases are to an almost full extent attributable
to delays in project implementation. Recalculated4/ in constant 1981
terms, the capital costs for the Expansion Project excluding working
capital and interest during construction would amount to US$688.6 million
(US$769.9 million in current terms) compared to an appraisal estimate
US$653.7 million (US$403.6 million in current terms) or a 5.3% cost
increase. The Rehabilitation Program in constant 1981 terms would cost
US$93.9 million compared to US$111.7 million in current terms. Details are
shown on page 2 of Annex IV.

2.27      As of the closing date GECAMINES has expended from all sources
US$492.5 million on the Expansion and Rehabilitation Programs which is 107%
of forecast at appraisal for full project completion by end 1978, namely
US$460.4 million. Another US$120 million has been spent on replacement and
rehabilitation investments in 1982/83.
2.28      The original Loan Agreement of March 8, 1975 as well as the
Amending Agreement of November 16, 1979 obliged the Government to ensure
project completion by making available to GECAMINES the necessary
additional funds either in foreign exchange or local currency irrespective
of whether that was caused by cost increases or cash shortfalls. The
Government did provide GECAMINES with tax relief in the amount of US$899.4
million from 1975-81 to avert cash deficits, but (i) continued diversion of
sales receipts and (ii) was unable to provide cash injections because of
Government budget constraints. Following high level Bank representation
starting in 1979, major focus of Government-Bank dialogue was, thus, not
provision of funds for project completion but (a) introduction of a logical
taxation system, and (b) limitation of diversion of funds to ensure
GECAMINES' financial health and ability to at least maintain presently
achieved production levels.

F. Procurement and Disbursement
2.29      The proceeds of the Bank and LAFB loans (under a 50:50 joint
financing arrangement) contributed towards the construction of crushing,
construction of concentration, refining and flashsmelter facilities and
supporting the purchase of miscellaneous equipment for workshops, and
electricity supply. Under parallel co-financing arrangements from the
European Investment Bank (EIB) funds were earmarked for the erection and
equipment supply of the flashsmelter.
2.30      Both the equipment packages and contracts financed under the IBRD
loan have been procured by international competitive bidding and consultant
services have been retained by GECAMINES and SOZACOM under the Amended Loan
Agreement in accordance with the Bank's consultant guidelines. The
following table shows the national origin of the items financed under the
IBRD loan.

Belgian firms with 66.8% of the total loan funds were by far the most
successful contractors and equipment suppliers. This reflects both Belgian
expertise in metal processing and intimate knowledge of Zairian working
conditions. In particular, they were awarded the major contracts for the
DIMA concentrator; the sulphide concentrate, fuel and flux storage
facilities; the electro-refinery; and the oxygen, sulphuric acid, water
treatment and coal pulverization plants. The U.S. with 10.8% was the
second largest supply country providing primarily large mining equipment



-13-
(mine trucks and shovels). Comparatively smaller imports were provided by
the United Kingdom (4.3%), France (4.3%), FR Germany (4.2%) and South
Africa (3.4%).
2.31      Withdrawals under the IBRD Loan were made as shown in Annex VI.
Although the appraisal had forecast the loan to be fully disbursed by the
end of 1978, the actual final Bank disbursement was made on April 30,
1981. This considerable variance in the disbursements reflected the
substantial delays which occurred in the execution of the expansion project
as compared to original targets. Firstly, the loan did not become
effective until December 2, 1975 due to delays and difficulties in
finalizing the set-aside arrangements.  As a consequence, project
implementation was sixteen months behind schedule and the first                       -
disbursement was made almost a full year later than anticipated. Secondly,
delay occurred due to the closing of the Benguela railway and due to major
design and coordinating problems regarding engineering and procurement for
the flashsmelter. Thirdly, subsequent to the Kolwezi invasion in May 1978
most expatriate personnel including the project management team were
dismissed and GECAMINES decided to suspend project execution. After
amendment to the Loan Agreement in November 1979 work on the Expansion
Project resumed and disbursement proceeded speedily.
2.32      Due to the rephasing of the Expansion Project and the addition of
the high priority Rehabilitation Program as part of the Amending Agreement,
it became necessary to extend the closing date from December 31, 1978 to
June 30, 1981. As indicated, the Bank loan was fully drawn down before the
deadline of the extension. Similarly, the LAFB loan has also been fully
aisbursed with the last payment made on May 15, 1981. The EIB Loan,
cancelled an undisbursed balance of ECU 4.2 million (US$4.0 million), i.e.,
25.3% of the total loan.
2.33      Under the Joint Financing Agreement (Section 13.01) dated March
8, 1975 the Bank agreed to represent the LAFB in all matters relating to
the administration and implementation of the two loans. This included the
Bank's handling of disbursements of the Libyan Loan on their behalf.
2.34      Repayment of these three loans started in June 1979.  To date,
despite GiCCAfti.;S' severe financial difficulies no problems have been
encountered in this respect. This is to a large degree to the credit of
the set-aside arrangement for debt-service payments which has worked satis-
factorily. This arrangement ensures that portions of the sales
proceeds received by SOZACOM/GECAMINES are deposited regularly into a
special account managed by UBAF, a U.K. based commercial bank, for the
necessary debt service payments.

III. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   GECAMINES
3.01      GECAMINES' organizational structure is characterized by
functional centralization and geographic separation of three production
centers at Lubumbashi, Likasi and Kolwezi. At appraisal it was intimated
(but not covenanted) that Lhe Company would review this organizational
set-up within 2-3 ye.,Ls in order to determine the advantages of functional
relationships versus independent production and cost control centers. This
review was, however, not carried out and management, staffing,
communication and coordination had deteriorated gradually since appraisal.
In addition, the Shaba invasion, the subsequent dismissal of a large number
of project personnel together with inadequate salary, promotion and staff
development policies had created a marked uncertainty amongst the Company's
staff personnel. The Bank required CECAMINES in the 1979 Loan Amendment to
employ a consultant firm to review organization, staff requirements,
training and recruitment activities of the Company's management level
personnel. The consulting firm indicated in its report of November 1981 a
growing lack of control and information flow within the Company, disparity
between authority and responsibility of various organizational units, an
inadequate delineation between staff and line function and a too higlh
degree of functional centralization. Furthermore, non-productive
activities were using valuable financial and human resources. To overcome
these organlzational weaknesses, the firm proposed a major reorganization
and training scheme. These recommendations were accepted by GECAMINES'
Board of Directors in December 1981 and implemented since.
3.02      Progress has been made in reestablishing management control.  In
particular,
(i)  GECAMINES is implementing a reorganization program which includes
full decentralization on a cost center basis, together with the
installation of a comprehensive control s-stem for both top
management and cost centers;
(ii)  a new managing director was appointed in May 1982 and
subsequently changed in early 1984; and
(iii)  a Technical Assistance Credit (Loan No. 1336-ZR) has been signed
with the Bank which aims at helping to consolidate the
reorganization effort; undertaking financial and engineering
studies to improve technical efficiency and cost control; and
strengthening CECAMINES' management in the production, financial,
marketing and legal fields.



-15-
B.   Societe Zairoise de Commercialisation des Minerais (SOZACOM)
3.03      Starting 1976 all GECAMINES' production was marketed through
SOZACOM (established in 1976 as the state mineral marketing agency). In
April 1981, this mandate was extended by the Government to Include MIBA's
diamond production.
3.04      Relations between GECAMINES and SOZACOM have been difficult.
First, GECAMINES perceived SOZACOM as an additional Layer between itself,
management and its final clients. As a result, GECAMINES was paying double
commission on the majority of its sales. An analysis of CECAMINES' sales
revenues shows that since 1976, the ratio of the realized copper price by
GECAMINES to the prevailing world market price decreased from about 90%
during 1972-76 to about 81% during 1976-80.  While this sttuation has its
origin in GECAMINES' changing product mix, it has also been thc result of
increasing marketing costs paid by the Company. Second, a marketing system
whereby SOZACOM assumed ownership of the metals at the time thley are
shipped from African ports, left GECAMINFES in total ignorance of all
matters regarding terms of sales until the final transfer of sales receipts
to its accounts. Furthermore, some metal sales were not credited by
SOZACOM to CECAMINES but to Government or other accounts transactions, thus
reducing the total sales proceeds remitted to the Companiy.
3.05      In September 1982, the Government approved a new Marketing
Agreement between GECAMINES and SOZACOM. Under this new agreement,
GECAMINES retained ownership of all metals it produced urntil final sale.
SOZACOM was supposed to act purely as an agent with all sales accounts in
GECAMINES' name. The Marketing Agreement also included the transfer of all
SOZACOM sales accounts to GECAMINES, the establishment of a GECAMINES
representative in SOZACOM offices, agreement by both parties on a marketing
strategy defined in commcn, and the participation of CECAMINES in new
contract negotiations starting in 1983.
3.06      Implementation of the new Marketing Agreement did not proceed as
envisaged: in particular, (i) SOZACOM did not act only as agent upon
instructions bY GECAMINES, and (ii) sales receipts totalling about $103.0
million where diverted during 196i-83. To rectify the situation, the
GovernmenL, the Bank and the IMF agreed to allow GECAMINES to take over its
marketing activities. SOZACOM was abolished as of June 29, 1984.

a/ Results are not comparable because of the 1982 asset revaluation.
b/ Because of asset revaluation and devaluation of the Zaire, 1983 results are substantially different fron

3.08       Although the severe and persistent slump in metal prices have
affected the Company's financial situation throughout, one of the primary
reasons behind GECAMINES' liquidity and cash flow problems has been the
inefficiency of SOZACOM's marketing system and sales receipts management.
Yearly profits shown by the Company since 1975 do not represent
cash available for operations ard investments as yearly sales receipts are
only a fraction of the yearly sales revenues. This is illustrated by the
fact that in 1982 while sales revenues shown in the Income Statement
amounted to US$1,086 million, GECAMINES' net sales receipts after deduction
of marketing expenses and prefinancing charges were only US$654 million.
3.09       In addition to market factors which impacted on GECAMINES, its
financial performance was also affected by: (i) shortage of foreign
exchange; (ii) the fiscal system the Company operated under; (iii)
diversion of sales receipts and other payment demands by the Z-airian
authorities.



-17-
3.10      The dramatic increase in receivables further underscores this
situation. Typical lags between copper and cobalt shipments and sales
proceeds transfer which were at the time of appraisal of three and nine
months for copper and cobalt, respectively, increased to nine and 30 months
in 1980-81. While market conditions, especially in the case of cobalt have
had an impact on these lags, they were attributable to a large extent to
SOZACOM's inefficient handling and follow-up of sales and misappropriation
of foreign exchange due. To cover its cash needs during the interval
between metal shipments and sales proceeds transfer by SOZACOM, GECAMINES
had to increase the prefinancing arrangement with SGM at commercial rates.
D1uring 1981, copper shipments were prefinanced at 70% of their value
estimated on the basis of the average monthly price prior to the shipment
and cobalt shipments were prefinanced at 35%. For 1981 some US$62 million
of interests payments were due from prefinancing alone. This situation was
rectified in 1982-83, as GECAMINES initiated an effort to scale back
prefinancing to three months export financing. The dissolution of SOZACOM
should provide scope for significant improvement in cash management.
3.11      After no foreign exchange was allocated to GECAMINES during the
1976 economic crisis the Government agreed to establish a foreign exchange
allocation system under which the Company would receive 45% of its net
sales in foreign exchange. In practice. however, not only did the actual
allocation remain well below this proportion except during the 1978 cobalt
boom, (1976: 38.0%; 1977: 39.0%; 1978: 45.2%; 1979: 42.0%; 1980: 39.4%;
1981: 41.1%; 1982: 42%) but even the full 45% would have been insufficient
during periods of depressed metal prices to meet the Company's demands for
debt servicing, operating needs and project completion. Since 1982, the
remittance of the foreign exchange from GECAMINES' sales  o) the Company has
been stabilized at a fixed level (following an agreement with EEC for a
Sysmin Loan) and regularly paid.
3.12      During the periods of low metal prices, i.e., during all the
years except 1979 under review here, GECAMINES was unable to meet its tax
liabilities and had to obtain relief from the Government. Due to the
relatively high level and inadequate flexibility of the past tax laws with
its heavy reliance on export duties without taking due regard of Companies'
financial viability, GECAMINES' tax system became inoperative and was
replaced de facto by fixed tax amounts resulting from annual ad hoc
negotiations. To ameliorate the situation, the Government agreed at the
Loan Amendment in November 1979 to carry out a study on a tax reform.
GECAMINES' tax regime has been changed as of September 12, 1983. The new
tax regime involves, in addition to the corporate profits tax, two export
levies: a basic royalty at a proportionate ad-valorem rate on the total of
GECAMINES' exported production creditable against the profits tax, and a
progressive export duty on sales of copper based an an indexed threshold
price, fixed so as to permit a reasonable profitability for the Company
without overtaxing it in periods of low prices; the surtax is deductible
from the taxable base. The new system is more flexible and more conducive
to the long-term growth of the industry as it implies a more equitable and



-18-
predictable fiscal burden on the industry, in particular in times of low
metal prices and increasing costs, but ensures regular tax income for the
Government.
3.13      An additional factor attributable to the tax regime in force'up
to 1983 arose from the substantial devaluations of the Zaire currency since
1978 accompanied by considerable price increases for foreign goods and
services. Since allowances for depreciation provisions were limited by the
method of asset valu-,ion on a "historic cost basis" (although a limited
revaluation of assets was carried out as of March 13, 1976), GECAMINES was
unable to set aside sufficient funds for its fixed assets replacement.
This necessarily had to lead not only to high levels of profit tax
obligations but over the long run threatened to fully decapitalize the
Company. Effective 1982, GECAMINES' assets were revalued based on full
replacement value providing for substantial depreciation induced cash
generation.
3.14      Despite the Bank's repeated intervention and the introduction of
Article 7 of the Amending Agreement stipulating arm's length transactions,
GECAMINES has been subjected to continued violations on the part of the
Government. As documented by special audits, uncompensated sales, barter
operations without prompt and adequate reimbursement as well as payments
made or services rendered upon Government request increased and became a
substantial burden (see para 3.06). With transfer of all accounts to
GECAMINES, the abolishment of SOZACOM and the provision of the TA Credit
No. 1336-ZR, it is hoped that further drain of GECAMINES funds can be
stopped.
IV. THE COPPER AND COBALT MARKETS
A.   Copper
4.01      The SAR stressed the high degree of uncertainty about the future
copper market in the seventies. Many major copper producing countries had
started to expand their production in the early 1970s. Despite a sharp
downturn in consumption in 1974, many producers maintained high production
levels and some continued to expand. This created a substantial inventory
overhang exerting strong downward pressure on prices from 1975-78. By 1979
the supply/demand imbalance was corrected and stocks were absorbed. Prices
began to improve and climbed to US$1.32 per pound on the LME in February
1980 but as world economic growth subsequently again faltered, demand for
refined copper dropped and market imbalances reoccurred.  Again, copper
prices sharply decreased and were in the region of US$0.59 per pound in
June 1982 and US$0.58 in July 1984. The table on the next page compares
the appraisal assumptions ulth actual world production and consumption in
contrast to GECAMINES' expected and actual copper sales.

4.02      It must be noted that GECAMINES has not encountered any major
problems in marketing its copper production. Inventory build-up in the
past has primarily been the result of transportation problems within and
outside Zaire. As to the future, major doubts have been raised whether the
recovery in world economic activity in 1983-85 will provide a base for a
substantial increase in the demand situation for copper to quickly absorb
present copper oversupply. While price increases are expected, copper
prices may well average below $1.0 per pound, in current terms, during the
eighties.
B.   Cobalt

a/ Estimate.
With cobalt as a by-product and comparatively low production costs,
GECAMINES has been the cobalt market and price leader. Up to May 1978,
Zaire, the world's largest cobalt producing country acted as cobalt price
leader pursuing a moderate pricing policy with gradual increases from
US$2.70/lb. in early 1973 to US$6.4/lb. at the end of 1977. In the wake of
the Shaba invasion, in May 1978, Zaire changed its pricing strategy and
adopted an agressive short term price maximization strategy. SOZACOM
adjusted its producer price to US$20/lb. in October 1978 and to US$25/lb.
in February 1979. In addition, SOZACOM founded a subsidiary in
Switzerland, SOZAREX, to take advantage of the very high spot prices. The
incremental benefit of this operation did, however, not accrue to
GECAMINES.
4.04      Accordingly, revenues from cobalt sales which amounted to 21.3%
of GECAMINES' total turnover in 1977, increased to 49.9% in 1978 and 50.8%
in 1979 even exceeding the total sales value of copper in those years.
However, the expected supply shortfall did not materialize after the Shaba
events but production continued to increase in Zaire, Zambia and the other
producing countries in the hope to cash in on the cobalt boom. As
consumers, under slowing economic activity and increasing interest rates,
were able to live from their build-up inventories (supplemened by
sufficiently available spot sales at prices well below the Zaire/Zambia
producer prices) and to increasingly substitute cobalt with materials with
less geo-Dolitical risk (e.g., nickel, molybdenum and tungsten for
superalloys; barium and strontium-ferrite in magnets; copper chromium and
manganese in paints), an immense overcapacity in cobalt occurred, forcing
prices on the free market to deflate quickly.



-21-
In February 1981 the producer price was reduced to US$20/lb. in August 1981
to US$17.50/lb., and in February 1982 to US$12.50/lb. In 1983 the producer
price averaged US$6.0/lb. with substantial discounts given to large
buyers. The year-to-year cobalt price development is compared in the
following table:

Industry experts expect prices in the US$8-12 range in current terms for

4.05      Zaire's, i.e., SOZACOM's marketing strategy of maintaining a
producer price well above free market prices at undiminished production
levels had the effect of (i) encouraging long-term substitution and
conservation; and (ii) inducing new cobalt production projects (Zambia,
Finland, Australia, New Caledonia, Japan, etc.). Concurrently, Zaire began
to build up huge cobalt inventories estimated at over 20,000 tons and
gradually lost its dominant leadership position in the cobalt market. At
present, Zaire can count on a 35% market share and seems to have lost its
former role as a price leader.
V. PROJECT OPERATION AND RESULTS
A.   Production and Shipments
5.01      At appraisal it was envisaged that all components of the project
would be in operation by July 1978 with production amounting to 70,000 tons
of copper during this year and full production of 120,000 tons of copper
per year to be attained from 1978 on. In addition, the Expansion Project
was expected to produce 7,400 tons of white alloy containing 55% cobalt and
10% copper.
5.02      In actuality, completion of the Phase I plant units had a
positive impact on production. Development of the Dikuluwe open pit mine
in 1975 and the Mashamba open pit in 1978 permitted GECAMINES to mine ore
with a lower stripping ratio than would have been possible in the existing
mines. As a result, the mines were able to ensure an adequate supply of



-22-
ore to the concentrator. Completion of the primary crushing and conveying
unit, the DIMA concentrator, and the corncentrate dewatering and storage
facility eliminated the serious bottleneck in concentrating capacity
existing in the Company. GECAMINES has been able to shift its emphasis
from production to efficiency in the concentrators leading to a marked
improvement in their performance since start-up of the DIMA concentrator.
An evaluation by GECAMINES indicates that annual copper production
increased by 58,000 tons as a result of the completion of the DIMA
concentrator. Contil'uing transportation problems, among others, has
prevented the Company from achieving the full expected benefit of
completion of the DIMA concentrator, which was export of copper in
concentrate form until the completion of the flas- smelter and
electrorefinery.
5.03      The relocation of the acid plant to Shituru permitted the Company
to scrap obsolete small capacity units. Plant availability will be higher
and operating costs lower with the new conversion tower, permitting the
Company to better satisfy its needs for sulphuric acid. Moreover, the
completion of the third lime kiln and the coal pulverization plant to feed
local Luena coal to the three lime kilns has eliminated the problems of an
inadequate supply of good quality lime. Lime is used in all of the
Company's metallurgical plants but proportionally has more importance in
the recovery of cobalt.
B.   Production Costs
5.04      The lower stripping ratio of the two new open pit mines, Dikuluwe
and Mashamba, together with the use of new, more efficient mining equipment
financed under the project had an overall favorable effect on the
Company's mining costs. Similarly, the installation of the DIMA
concentrator with its ancillary facilities enabled the Company to lower its
cost for concentrate treatment. The reported operating costs for Section I
of the DIMA concentrator which treats oxyde ore may serve as an indication
for the realized savings. Comparing its results with those of the aging
Kolwezi concentrator, which handles the same kind of mineral, demonstrates
that DIMA I produced at 8% lower costs already during the start-up period
in 1980 and 38% lower costs during 1981.
C.   Training and Development
5.05      The facilities completed in Phase I are similar to plants already
in operation elsewhere in the Company. Through transfers and training in
existing plants, GECAMINES was able to staff these new facilities with
little difficulty. The relatively smooth start-up of the plants attests to
this. Nonetheless, because of the hiring constraints resulting from the
Company's financial situation there continues to be shortage of qualified
supervisors to ensure efficient operation of the plants.
D.   Environmental Aspects
5.06      Overall those components of the project which have been completed
have relatively little negative impact on the environment. However, the
land in the area is rolling savannah which is sparsely populated and of low
agricultural value. GECAMINES has refilled exhausted open pits with waste
rock from nearby mines.



-23-
5.07      Rejects from the DIMA concentrator together with tailings from
the adjacent Kamoto concentrator are pumped to a tailings pond south of the
open pit mines. The water overflow is of better quality than the intake
water. Since pR is slightly alkali, dissolution of copper and other metals
in high concentration is precluded.
E.   Financial Rate of Return of Project
5.08      On the assumption that the full production capacity of the
Expansion Mining Project would be achieved in mid-1978 with 120,000 tons
additional copper and 4,000 tons of cobalt, a financial rate of return of
21% for a base case had been presented in the SAR.  The report did also
present a sensitivity analysis and included the caveat that under extreme
adverse conditions the project could show an unacceptable, low return.
5.09      A detailed analysis of the facilities which have been completed
to date under the project shows that these investments have resulted in an
immediate increase of GECAMINES' copper capacity by 57,700 tons primarily
as a result of the construction of the DIMA concentrator along with its
ancillary crushing and storage facilities. It is expected that over the
next five years the incremental capacity has reached its full level of
100,000 tons as the older concentrators, especially Kolwezi and Kamoto,
become less productive. Isolating project expenditures to the mines and
DIMA concentrator and its ancillaries, would thus yield a recalculated
financial rate of return of 12.5%. However, if the recalculation includes
all investment expenditures, i.e., including those which are presently not
productive, the financial return would be barely positive (0.2%).
F.   Economic Benefits
5.10      Despite depressed metal prices and substantially lower than
expected output, GECAMINES remains the backbone of the Zairian economy. As
the country's largest enterprise the Company contributed during the last
six years about 13% of gross domestic product (GDP), provided 25% of the
total budgetary revenue and 64% of net foreign exchange earnings. Since
the project as originally conceived was supposed to expand GECAMINES'
oroduction by 20%, its impact on the country's economy and development
would have been substantial. Nevertheless, while Phase II of the project
remains unfinished, the completion of Phase I of the project increased the
Company's annual copper production capacity from 410,600 tons to about
470,000 tons by removing the critical bottleneck in the mining and
concentrates areas.
5.11      The fiscal benefits the Government is estimated to receive from
Phase I of the project are some USS300 million over the period 1980-1994.
This estimate does not include the indirect benefits to the country which
arise from the partial completion of the social infrastructure (housing,
schools, hospitals, etc.) and the reconstruction of Kolwezi after the 1978
hostilities. The appraisal had estimated fiscal revenues from the total
Expansion Project to amount to US$1,146 million to accrue over the period
1974-88.



-24-
5.12      In relative terms, the foreign exchange surplus generated by the
completed Phase I of the project is expected to be very small compared to
the fiscal benefits. Although US$89.0 million in gross foreign exchange
revenues would be attributable to Phase I in a typical year, say 1985, but
replacement expenditures and debt service arising from the total
investments of the Expansion Project, reduce this foreign exchange surplus
to about US$40 million in this year. At chis level, the total accrued
capital expenditures in foreign currency for the project (US$277.9 million
z.s of end of September 1981) will be recovered within 6-7 years.  This
contrasts with the original appraisal estimate which had assumed a payback
period of three years after project start-up.
5.13      Similarly, since only Phase I of the project is operative, the
employment effect for the completed portion of the project is also well
below the levels expected at appraisal. The mine openings, the DIMA
concentrator with its ancillary facilities and the additional plants, such
as lime kiln, coal pulverization and acid plants added approximately 150
jobs including about 30 managerial personnel, almost all of whom are
Zairian personnel.
5.14      Without completion of the entire Expansion Project in the near
future, which cannot be assumed as a realistic assumption at the present
time, the expected accumulated economic benefits from the Phase I
investments over the next 15 years do offset the expenditures incurred so
far. Thus, the economic rate of return of the entire project, assumed to
be +28% at appraisal, is barely +1% and the economic return on the
completed project is estimated at 14%.
VI. THE BANK'S ROLE
6.01      The Bank's loan to GECAMINES was the first and largest Bank loan
to Zaire and the first direct industrial loan to a Zairian company. At
appraisal GECAMINES had just successfully and timely completed its first
expansion plan (1970-74) doubling the Company's refining capacity and
increasing its annual production capacities by 100,000 tons of copper and
5,000 tons of cobalt. In the same manner, the Company had prepared the
much more complex Second Expansion Project ("P2"). In this endeavour the
Bank's input was primarily a review of the soundness of the proposed
project. At the Bank's initiative, however, investments for social
infrastructure were raised to levels commensurate with the size of the
Expansion Project.
6.02      After the Shaba events in 1978, the Bank played a much more
active role in (i) the rephasing of the Expansion Project; and (ii)
establishing the need for formulating the scope of the consultant studies
for the organizational review of GECAMINES and the review of marketing
arrangements with SOZACOM.



-25-
6.03      GECAMINES' reporting and documentation on project progress and on
the Company itself has been extensive and completely satisfactory.
The project has been supervised by missions to the country at about half
year intervals. On several occasions high level Bank officials and/or the
Resident Representative in Zaire met with the President of the Republic to
resolve major issues. In addition, Company representatives have visited
the Bank frequently to exchange views.
6.04      In the face of Zaire's economic crises, the Bank's major role in
this project became assistance to the Government to define the framework of
GECAMINES/SOZACOM's operation which will maximize short, medium and
long-term resource transfer to the economy and the Government budget. The
major changes of (i) the tax regime, (ii) the marketing arrangement and
(iii) the management/organization during the recent years are the results
of close collaboration between the Government, GECAMINES and SOZACOM.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.01      The GECAMINES project had been prepared well.  The assumptions on
which the technical, financial and economic viability analyses were based
were realistic, perhaps the anticipated implementation schedule somewhat
too ambitious. The stipulated covenants of the original Loan Agreement and
the Amended Loan Agreement were sufficiently detailed and specific. The
set-aside arrangements were effective, the Bank's supervision extensive.
Why then has the performance under this Loan to date remained poor? Why
only part of the objectives been met with major components of the project
remaining unfinished, their equipment stored away away in warehouses?
7.02      This report described in detail the external attributable factors
such as the Shaba hostilities, the closing of the Benguela railroad, the
poor performance of the copper market, the collapse of the cobalt boom, the
severe and incessant economic crisis of Zaire. However, despite
substantial preparation and supervision efforts and external adversities,
there must be a basic commitment and understanding that draining a
Company's resources is not limitless, that at times it is even necessary
for the Company's owners to provide additional financing and other support
and that an autonomous, well-managed and properly controlled Company with
the capability to adapt to changing market trends and the determination to
introduce cost cutting measures will over the long-term contribute most to
a country. The lesson to be learned from this is that all the covenants in
the world and our best supervisory efforts will be in vain if there is a
lack of this understanding, a lack of a spirit of compliance.
7.03      As the Bank was unable to obtain full compliance with the
Agreements except in terms of future commitments to do so, the question
must be asked whether improvement of performance under the Loan could not
have been better achieved by bringing to bear more sweeping reforms at an
earlier stage.



-26-
7.04      In addition, it is extremely important that there be always a
close coordination amongst co-lenders, the IMF and other institutions
(international or bilateral) to optimize the development effort and to
present a fully common approach towards the borrower. This was not always
the case, as indicated by GECAMINES tax payments of US$615 million in 1979
or 50X of sales revenues.
i.05      Efficient marketing arrangements aad organization are critical
factors for a mining project to be successful. Since SOZACOM had not been
created at the time of Loan approval, it did not become a party to the
Agreements. Subsequent supervisions lacked, thus, the leverage to address
the distortion created by or through SOZACOM. It is essential that in all
future mining projects more attention be paid to appraisal and supervision
of metal marketing arrangements and strategy.
