Country systems need to be fully understood\n            if they are to be incorporated into design. The team was\n            aware that components will be subject to the Technical\n            Project Proposal (TPP) approval process, and made\n            suggestions as to how that process could be simplified. In\n            the event, improvements were not taken up, and the slow\n            working of TPPs was one of the main factors in\n            unsatisfactory project performance. There are existing\n            public administration constraints to how effectively a\n            Government uses external Technical Assistance (TA).\n            Bangladesh civil service's frequent rotation of staff\n            undermines continuity of management, resulting in\n            implementation delays. The practice of embedding project\n            component management in existing agency structures is in\n            principle sound, but in practice is undermined by\n            counterpart staff holding several jobs at the same time,\n            leading them to see project management as an extra\n            responsibility. The procurement of consultant studies,\n            training, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n            purchases should be routine functions of Government\n            agencies, but were viewed additional burdens. Awareness of\n            these constraints should inform the future design of\n            projects. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems need\n            to be simple and meaningful. A diversified TA project with\n            components of modest size and dependent on country systems\n            for implementation can become unwieldy and beyond\n            implementing agency capacity, if the Bank's standard\n            approach to M&E is applied to each component.\n            Furthermore, applying the Bank's results based approach\n            to monitoring a project where the focus is on improving the\n            machinery of government (as opposed to direct service\n            delivery) is inherently difficult."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
