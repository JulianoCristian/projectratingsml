eucalyptus of approximately 400 ha of clearfelled\n            plantations (total for the project period: 2,000 ha); (c)\n            maintenance of all IPD plantations; (d) doubling of\n            IPD's logging and transportation capacity from about\n            60,000 cubic meters to about 120,000 cubic meters of\n            roundwood per year; (e) constructing and equipping a sawmill\n
