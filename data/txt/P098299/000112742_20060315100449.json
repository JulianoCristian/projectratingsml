Mexico's lagging competitiveness.\n            Specifically, the loan aims to: a) Build on past\n            competitiveness efforts, strengthen new and existing\n            programs, and promote a holistic, cross-governmental\n            approach to improving productivity in order to accelerate\n            growth and increase export and employment levels; and b)\n            Contribute to the formulation of a medium-to-long term\n            competitiveness policy agenda and help lay a solid\n            foundation of competitiveness programs in advance of the\n            next administration, which takes office in December 2006.\n            This loan builds on Bank support to Mexico on\n            competitiveness issues since 2003. Since that time, the Bank\n            has conducted competitiveness focus groups, helped the GOM\n            formulate its Competitiveness Agenda, and completed the\n            first phase of competitiveness analytic and advisory\n            activities that involved a wide range of technical\n            assistance and analytical work."}, "docdt": "2006-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
