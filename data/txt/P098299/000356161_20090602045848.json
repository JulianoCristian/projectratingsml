the project were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the quality of the technical analysis underpinning a policy\n            based operation is crucial to engage the borrower's\n            commitment to the reform agenda. The high quality of the\n            technical analysis was crucial to make increased\n            competitiveness a key priority of both, the fox and the\n            Calderon administrations. During preparation of a\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL), a formal agreement should be\n            reached with the authorities on the collection of data on\n            the selected indicators. A recurrent problem in DPL in which\n            the Bank loan goes for budgetary support is that the bank\n            team does not usually establishes a close working\n            relationship with all the agencies that implement the policy\n            actions supported by the DPL. As a result, these agencies\n            tend not to be aware of the need for them to provide\n            information on the triggers or outcome indicators agreed\n            between the Government and the Bank. This makes it difficult\n            to obtain information on the indicators particularly if\n            these are not based on information that the agencies collect\n            and publish in their web pages on a regular basis."}, "docdt": "2009-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
