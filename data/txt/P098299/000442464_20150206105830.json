Productivity growth has also\n            been disappointing and Mexico has been losing its share of\n            the United States (U.S.) import market, mainly to China. All\n            of these results point to an urgent need to enhance\n            competitiveness in Mexico if the country is going to further\n            reduce poverty. The World Bank is supporting this goal\n            through a three-phase programmatic competitiveness\n            development policy loan (DPL). It was expected that\n            regularizing businesses should increase local government\n            revenues and provide the fiscal space for municipalities to\n            increase social investments."}, "docdt": "2006-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
