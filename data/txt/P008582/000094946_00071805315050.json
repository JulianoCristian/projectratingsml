"Project outcome is rated as highly\n            satisfactory. Most outcomes will be sustained and will have\n            a long-run impact of the development of respective labor,\n            social assistance, and training institutions in the country.\n            With project sustainability likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are adjudged satisfactory overall. The\n            main lessons include the following: The information\n            generated on the efficiency of labor programs by the\n            management information system should not be used in a\n            punitive manner but to help offices redirect resources in a\n            more cost-effective manner. It is also difficult to\n            implement an MIS program if client records are not\n            automated. Implementation of an automation subcomponent was\n            complicated by uncoordinated automation at the local level,\n            changes in ministry staff due to changes in government,\n            changes in employment and social assistance legislation,\n            decentralization of social assistance offices, and\n            development of the national labor office. Information was\n            hindered by the fact that existing statistical agencies are\n            coming from a history of central planning and unused to\n            being client responsive. Other obstacles included\n            organizational changes, political interference with staff,\n            competition for automation staff, and delays in contract\n            compliance. Positive features included stakeholder\n            involvement and openness, the involvement of nongovernmental\n            organizations, and the participation of an excellent\n            technical assistance contractor."}, "docdt": "2000-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
