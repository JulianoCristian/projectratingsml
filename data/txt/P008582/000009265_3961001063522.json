The project consists of\n            five components.  The management infrastructure component\n            will improve the administrative efficiency and coverage of\n            programs supported under the Employment and Social Welfare\n            Laws.  The income support component will improve the\n            efficiency of income support programs by:  (a) establishing\n            criteria for client means testing; (b) developing and\n            implementing Social Welfare Offices (SWO) staff training;\n            (c) improving SWO facilities; and (d) creating an\n            unemployment benefit and financing system.  The employment\n            services component will expand and improve existing services\n            by supporting: (a) development and implementation of\n            industrial adjustment services to assist with mass layoffs;\n            (b) improvement of occupational counseling; and (c)\n            improvement of labor staff training.  The adult training\n            component supports establishment of national guidelines and\n            procedures and development of local training programs for\n            unemployed adults.  The last component, micro-enterprise\n            development, will strengthen the ability of local\n            nongovernmental organizations to provide improved services\n            to:  (a) the unemployed who have shown aptitude to start\n            micro-enterprises; and (b) to local labor offices to\n            strengthen the existing entrepreneurship program."}, "docdt": "1991-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
