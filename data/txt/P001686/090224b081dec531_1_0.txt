Project or any
Sub-project
TOTAL         2,500,000
2.    For the purposes of this Schedule, the term "total expenditures" means the
aggregate of: (i) expenditures for goods produced in, or services supplied from,
the territories of any country other than the Borrower; and (ii) expenditures for
goods produced in, or services supplied from, the territories of the Borrower.
3.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no withdrawals shall
be made in respect of:
(a)   expenditures prior to October 15, 1973;
(b)   payments for taxes imposed under the laws of the Borrower or laws
in effect in its territories on the importation of goods or services to the extent
that any such taxes are levied on goods and services imported directly for purposes
of the Project. To the extent that the amount representated by the percentage
set forth in the third column of the table in paragraph I above in respect of
any Category would exceed the amount payable net of all such taxes on the
importation of any such goods and services, such percentage shall be reduced to
ensure that no proceeds of the Credit will be withdrawn on account of payments
for such taxes; and


﻿14
(c)   any expenditures in respect of any Sub-project unless the Borrower s
request for authorization to make withdrawals from the Credit Account shall be
supported by contract, shipping and other appropriate documents satisfactory to
the Association, provided that, in the case of small items, for which presentation
to the Association of such documentation shall not be practical, requests for
authorization to make withdrawals from the Credit Account on account of
expenditures in respect of any Sub-project shall be supported by statements certified
by BDM that such amounts to be withdrawn from the Credit Account have been
paid in connection with Sub-projects approved as provided under Section 3.05 of
this Agreement.
4.    Notwithstanding the amount of the Credit set forth in the second column
of the table in paragraph I above, if the Association shall have reasonably
determined that the procurement of any item is inconsistent with the procedures
set forth or referred to in Section 2.03 of this Agreement, no expenditures for
such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit and the Association
may, without in any way restricting or limiting any other right, power or remedy
of the Association under the Development Credit Agreement, by notice to the
Borrower, cancel such amount of the Credit as in the Association's reasonable
opinion, represents the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise have
been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Credit.

construction of new water supplies, the construction of storage facilities for farm
inputs and produce to serve the needs of not more than one village, or relating

1.   With respect to any contract for any item included in the table set forth
in paragraph I of Schedule 1 to this Agreement estimated to cost the equivalent
of $100,000 or more:
(a)   Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to the Association,
for its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and the specifications and
other bidding documents, together with a description of the advertising procedures
to be followed for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedure as the Association shall reasonably request. Any further
modification to the bidding documents shall require the Association's concurrence
before it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b)   After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower shall, before
a final decision on the award is made, inform the Association of the name of
the bidder to whom it intends to award the contract and shall furnish to the
Association, in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report, on the evaluation
and comparison of the bids received, together with the reasons for the intended
award. The Association shall, if it determines that the intended award would be
inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to in Section 2.03 of this
Agreement, promptly inform the Borrower and state the reasons for such
determination.
(c)   The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, without the
Association's concurrence, materially differ from those on which bids were asked.
(d)   Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished to the
Association promptly after its execution and prior to the delivery to the Association
of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Credit Account in respect
of any such contract.
2.    Identical or similar items shall be grouped together to form economic bid
packages for purposes of bidding.
B.    Supplemental Rules on Bid Evaluation and Comparison
1.    For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids, customs duties and
other import taxes on imported goods, and sales and similar taxes on locally


﻿17
supplied goods, shall be excluded, except to the extent hereinafter provided. Bidders
shall be required to state in their bid the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported
goods, or the ex-factory price for locally manufactured goods. The cost to the
Borrower of inland freight and other expenditures incidental to the delivery of
goods to the place of their use or installation shall be taken into account in the
evaluation of bids in accordance with paragraph 4.7 of the Guidelines for
Procurement.
2.    For goods included in the table set forth in paragraph I of Schedule I to
the Development Credit Agreement, the Borrower may grant a margin of preference
to goods manufactured in Mali in accordance with, and subject to, the following
provisions:
(a)   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified in one of the
following groups:
(1)   Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in Mali, if the bidder shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and the Association
that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes a value added in
Mali equal to at least 20% of the ex-factory bid price of such goods.
(2)   Group B: bids offering goods manufactured in Mali, other than bids
classified in group A.
(3)   Group C: bids offering any other goods.
(b)   All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared among
themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import taxes in goods to be
imported and any sales or similar taxes on goods to be supplied locally, to determine
the lowest evaluated bid of each group. The lowest evaluated bids of each group
shall then be compared with each other and if, as a result of this comparison,
a bid from group A or group B is the lowest, it shall be selected for purposes
of award.
(c)   If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph (b) above, the lowest
bid is a bid from group C, all group C bids shall be further compared with the
lowest bid from group A, as determined under paragraph (b) above, after adding
to the c.i.f. bid price of goods to be imported offered in each group C bid, for
the purpose of this further comparison only, an amount equal to the smaller of
(i) the amount of customs duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt
importer would have to pay for the importation of goods offered in such group
C bid, or (ii) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods. If the group A bid in
such further comparison is the lowest, it shall be selected for purposes of award;


﻿18
if not, the lowest bid from  group C, as determined under paragraph (b) above,
shall be selected for purposes of award.
3.    The bidding documents shall clearly indicate any preference which will be
granted, the infornation required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such
preference and the methods and stages that will be followed in the evaluation
and comparison of bids to give effect to such preference.
