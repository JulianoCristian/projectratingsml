marginally\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned are: 1) National\n            Finance Corporation's (CFN's) mandate and ability\n            to provide not just discounting operations but a broad\n            spectrum of financial services to its client banks\n            significantly increased its effectiveness as a second tier\n            institution. 2) The staffing and competence of the Treasury\n            and Financial departments are key to the success of a second\n            tier institution such as CFN. 3) In order to measure\n            adequately the development impact of financial credit\n            programs and PSD projects, it is necessary to build in\n            monitoring and evaluation activities as part of the project\n            design. 4) Though lines of credit operations can provide\n            much needed, but temporary, term financing to domestic\n            industry, the development of a market for medium term\n            financing is a much more complex task. 5) It is important to\n            distinguish conceptually between the pre-conditions for a\n            project's success with its objectives. 6) In order to\n            overcome the reluctance of financial institutions and\n            private enterprises to implement measures to mitigate the\n            environmental impact of productive investments, it is\n            essential to establish adequate regulations and enforcement\n            mechanisms and to provide special resources to finance the\n            mitigation investments."}, "docdt": "1998-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
