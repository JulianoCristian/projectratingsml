World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are generally satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned from this project's implementation are:\n            In designing projects which are expected to induce\n            institutional reform, a phased, realistic implementation\n            time frame which can adjust to changes in government will\n            and commitment should be given. Technical assistance can be\n            effective in providing analysis and guidance to government.\n            However, the actual implementation of genuine reform depends\n            on clear commitment to action from Government and other\n            stakeholders. Conditionalities have not worked, and\n            strengthening analytical capacity has not yielded the\n            intended impact in an environment in which all aspects of\n            the reform process are politicized. The complexity of\n            agro-industrial reform, particularly in the sugar industry,\n            was underestimated at appraisal. There were technical,\n            financial, industrial policy, and political factors which\n            have caused the delay in reforms to this sub-sector. The\n            lesson is that planning the reform of such industries\n            requires stronger government commitment and the\n            participation of key stakeholders."}, "docdt": "1999-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
