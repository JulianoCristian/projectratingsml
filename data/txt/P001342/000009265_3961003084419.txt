MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    The following report on a proposed development credit to Kenya for SDR 13.8 million
(US$19.4 million equivalent) to help finance a Second Agricultural Sector Management Project is
submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of
40 years.
2.     Background. The proposed project would be the third IDA funded technical assistance
intervention in the agricultural sector in Kenya. IDA assistance commenced with the Agricultural
Technical Assistance Project (ATAP - Credit 1277-KE). ATAP was aimed at strengthening
Government capability to plan and implement policies, improving management and budgeting in
key ministries, and strengthening the institutional capacities of key parastatals. The follow up
First Agricultural Sector Management Project (ASMP I - Credit 1718-KE) was aimed at further
strengthening capacity of public sector institutions to deliver key services and to formulate
agricultural policy. While some managerial and analytical capacity was developed, and basic
reforms in budgeting and management were achieved, the capacity in key ministries to deliver
technical services, manage projects and programs and formulate policy initiatives in a coherent
and integrated fashion, though strengthened to some extent, still remains inadequate. This lack of
capacity has prevented the Government from undertaking policy and operational initiatives to
exploit the potential of key, currently under-exploited, subsectors such as cotton, sugar and
oilseeds and from taking radical steps to restructure the poorly functioning cooperative subsector.
Above all the key ministries involved in the sector do not demonstrate an institutional vision of
their role in the sector based on organizing their activities around providing strategic services to
farmers, to take account of a changing operating environment which is being increasingly
influenced by a tightening fiscal situation and greater private sector involvement.
3.    The Agriculture Sector. The performance of the agricultural sector since Independence
has been better than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, the agricultural growth rate
of 3.5 percent per annum during the 1980s has not been sufficient to keep up with the high
population growth of close to 4 percent per annum. Consequently, it has proven difficult to raise
per capita income levels and protect the natural resource base. The situation has worsened
recently as Kenya's agricultural performance declined sharply; estimates indicate that the
agricultural growth rate in 1991 was negative and the prognosis for 1992 is not much better. In
addition, the sector's vulnerability to adverse weather conditions also appears to have increased.
Given this situation it would take a major managerial and technical effort, underpinned by an
appropriate policy framework to raise the agricultural growth rate. The challenge is further
compounded by the fact that the major sources of past agricultural growth which had been land
expansion in the more fertile areas in the country, the switch to high value coffee and tea
production for export, and limited increases in crop yields and livestock productivity, no longer
offer potential for future sustainable agricultural growth. The whole pattern of agricultural
production would have to change radically with future growth depending almost entirely on yield
and productivity increases. This raises the management and technical capability stakes
considerably in planning for future development of the agricultural sector. In addition, the current
fiscal constraints which have become a key feature of the Kenyan economy, require that managers
in the institutions dealing with the sector focus on discerning key projects and programs for
support, taking steps to reduce costs (including staff reductions), removing parastatals from the
budget either by restructuring, reducing their role and enhancing their efficiency or by
privatizing, and following through with policies aimed at increasing private sector involvement in
the provision of services to farmers to compensate for the reduction in the public funded provision






of services. At present, MOA and MOLD are deficient in the requisite skills to enable them to
meet these emerging challenges.
4.     Project Objectives.  The main project objectives would be to: (i) develop key
agricultural subsectors by fostering greater private sector involvement; (ii) reform the cooperative
sector to make cooperatives more efficient and responsive to member needs; (iii) increase the
overall efficiency of MOA and MOLD by rationalizing their role, structure and strategic
functions; and (iv) ensure the sustainable use of Kenya's physical resources by strengthening the
capability in Government to factor in the impact of agricultural programs and policy initiatives on
the environment.
5.     Project Description. Project components would include the following. (a) Developing the
cotton subsector by financing TA, training and equipment to: (i) establish an appropriate legal and
institutional framework for the cotton industry; (ii) facilitate reforms in the processing and
marketing of cotton in the country (including the privatization of six Cotton Board ginneries); and
(iii) improve the technological support to cotton farmers. (b) Restructuring the sugar subsector by
financing TA for: (i) carrying out a Sugar Sector Restructuring Study; (ii) implementing
privatization/restructuring programs for five sugar factories; and (iii) strengthening the regulatory
framework for the industry and developing the capacity in the Kenya Sugar Authority to fulfil its
functions. (c) Developing the oilseeds subsector by financing TA, training and equipment as
necessary to: (i) establish a legal, institutional and policy framework for the sustainable
development of the subsector; (ii) formulate appropriate research programs and extension to
provide technological support to oil seed farmers; and (iii) improve skills amongst key personnel
involved in oilseed research, extension and processing. (d) Restructuring the cooperative
subsector by financing TA to carry out: (i) a review of the cooperative legislation and recommend
changes to the legislation with the aim of making cooperatives independent member-controlled
organizations; (ii) a study to determine the phased transfer of MOCD functions; (iii) a study on
the strategic functions of MOCD; and (iv) studies on critical cooperative policy related areas. (e)
Developing capacity in MOA and MOLD by financing, limited civil works (a prefabricated
building to house key project and TA staff), TA, training, equipment and operating expenditures
to: (i) strengthen operations in select technical units in MOA and MOLD (such as crops and
veterinary services); and (ii) facilitate commercialization and privatization of appropriate
functions. (f) Strengthening the Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing (DRSRS
by financing: (i) a detailed management study of DRSRS; (ii) the Geographical Information
System in the form of a long term technical advisor and essential new equipment; (iii) operation
of aerial services, including salaries of pilots and aircraft operations; (iv) the establishment of
information services; and (v) the improvement of data quality and staff productivity by providing
office equipment and limited, clearly specified training. (g) Developing the institutional capacity
to prepare and implement a National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) .
6.     The total cost of the project is estimated at US$21.5 million, with a foreign exchange
component of about 52 percent. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 11218-KE dated November 23, 1992 is also attached.
7.    Project Implementation. Project implementation would have three distinct facets. First,
three of ASMP II's components (cooperatives, DRSRS and NEAP) are "stand-alone" components
and would be organized, managed and implemented independently. The cooperatives component






- 3 -
would be implemented by MOCD, with the head of the Development Planning Department as the
project coordinator. The director of DRSRS would be responsible for implementing the DRSRS
component, under the overall direction of a Steering Committee. The NEAP process to be
followed in two stages would be a multisectoral approach with wide in-country participation both
from within and outside of Government. Stage I would focus on getting agreement in Kenya on
the process itself and the institutional framework to carry it out. Stage II would be the actual
carrying out of the agreed process and would be the responsibility of the NEAP coordinator.
Second, the MOA/MOLD capacity building component and the cotton, sugar and oilseeds
components would be implemented under the overall guidance of an Agriculture Sector
Committee which would be co-chaired by the permanent secretaries of MOA and MOLD. Day-
to-day implementation of these components would be the responsibility of the ASMP Management
and Implementation Committee with the chairperson of this committee being the project
coordinator. This committee would be assisted by appropriate technical assistance financed under
the project. Third, the privatization of cotton ginneries and sugar factories would conform to the
basic policies, procedures and institutional arrangements articulated in the government's Policy
Paper on Public Enterprise Reform and Privatization of July 1, 1992, and to be followed under
the Parastatal Reform and Privatization Technical Assistance Project. The overall responsibility
for managing the privatization process would vest with the Executive Secretariat and Technical
Unit of the Parastatal Reform Program Committee appointed by the President of Kenya under the
chairmanship of the vice President after which the privatization processes under the Technical
Assistance project would apply.
8.    Project Sustainability. The project, by fostering the sustainable development of the
cotton and oilseeds subsectors and by restructuring the cooperatives and sugar subsectors, both
with an emphasis on greater private sector participation, would contribute to their financial and
commercial sustainability. In addition, by laying the foundation for restructuring MOA and
MOLD into leaner and more strategically focussed institutions, requiring less budgetary resources
to provide key services to farmers, the project would inherently support financial and institutional
sustainability in the agricultural sector in Kenya.
9.     Lessons From Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. ATAP, which closed on November
30, 1986 was successfully implemented, and resulted in many long term initiatives in institution
building in the sector. As recognized in the Project Completion Report (Report No. 8798) the
impact of these activities, measured in terms of improved financial management, sectoral
management capabilities, and agricultural policy formulation was relatively significant. ASMP I
was designed to consolidate the efforts initiated under ATAP, and expand the focus to include
other institutions. ASMP I has continued the strengthening process but it is clear that institution
building is a long term process and the agenda with regard to the agricultural sector in Kenya is
still incomplete. One of the key lessons learned from the above projects is that without a clearly
thought out institutional development strategy, capacity building could end up as a piecemeal
exercise unable to achieve sustainable results. A second main lesson learned is that TA is
crucially needed to underpin policy and institutional changes, particularly those emanating from
adjustment/policy based operations.
10.   Rationale for Bank Group Involvement. The project is consistent with the country
Assistance Strategy to be discussed at the Board on December 1, 1992. It would complement
ongoing and planned IDA operations which support the three priority areas of: (a) improving
public sector efficiency; (b) developing the private sector; and (c) strengthening the basis for
equitable and sustainable development, by addressing human resource and environmental issues.
IDA involvement in this project is necessary to address specific constraints in each of these






- 4 -
priority areas. Weak sector management capacity, which is reflected partly in the lack of
commitment by Government to carry out critical structural reforms in the agricultural sector, is
seriously impeding agricultural growth and stifling farmer initiative. There are also emerging
challenges in redefining the institutional structure of MOA and MOLD and in formulating a role
for these ministries in an environment where the private sector will increasingly take over the
service provision responsibilities in the sector. In addition, assistance is required urgently to
support the preparation and initial execution of reform programs to enhance competition and
greater private sector involvement in processing and marketing of key agricultural commodities.
Last but not least, there is a crucial need to strengthen the capability within government to
continue with, and eventually deepen and widen the policy and parastatal reform programs
currently being undertaken under the Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operations (ASAO II
Credit 2204-KE). The proposed support in environmental capacity building will reinforce earlier
IDA support through the Special Project Preparation Facility and in formulating strategies for
developing the arid and semi-arid lands in Kenya. Given the foregoing, IDA is best placed to
provide the requisite assistance, crucial to enhancing the sector's ability to manage resources
efficiently and piloting the fundamental rest-ucturing process. The proposed project would also
provide a key link at the sectoral level for the Parastatal Reform and Privatization Technical
Assistance Project to be presented to the Board on December 1, 1992.
11.    Agreed Actions. (a) Privatization of Cotton Ginneries and Sugar Factories. At
negotiations agreement was reached with the government that three privatization transactions with
regard to cotton ginneries would be completed by June 30, 1994 and two privatization
transactions for sugar factories by December 31, 1994; (b) Key Institutional Actions. There are
four key institutional actions which are required under the project. At negotiations agreement was
reached that: by credit effectiveness (i) the DRSRS steering committee would be established, and
(ii) the NEAP Coordinator would be appointed; during project implementation (iii) the Cotton
Board would be restructured by December 31, 1993 and (iv) an Oilseeds Development Council
would be set up by December 31, 1993; (c) Procurement of Technical Assistance. There are five
key technical assistance packages under the project. The scope of the TA under each of the
components and the relevant terms of reference was agreed with the Government at negotiations
and agreement reached that the letters of invitation for each of these TA packages would be
submitted for IDA review and clearance by credit effectiveness. Preparation of the training
program for the first year of implementation would also be a condition of credit effectiveness. (d)
Financial reporting. A key feature of this project is the pioneering financial reporting structure
that would be established. A key action required is the appointment of the project financial
controller; at negotiations agreement was reached that the financial controller would be in place
by credit effectiveness.
12.    Environmental Aspects. The project has a "C" environmental rating; it is largely a TA
and training initiative with no direct impact on the environment. However, by focussing on
developing the capability in Kenya to factor in the impact of developmental programs on the
environment the project would contribute to the use of Kenya's physical resources in an
environmentally sustainable manner.
13.    Program Objective Categories. The project would target a number of key prograrn
objectives. First, it would foster private sector development by stimulating greater private
initiative in key agricultural subsectors. This in turn is expected to increase the incomes of both
small holder farmers involved in these subsectors (sugar, cotton) and of entrepreneurs who will be
attracted to the emerging enterprises. Second, the project would also foster public sector reform
by initiating the restructuring of the key ministries involved in the agricultural sector, leading to






- 5 -
more efficient use of fiscal resources and greater accountability. Finally, the project would also
promote the environmnentally sustainable use of Kenya's natural resources through the NEAP
process.
14.   Benefits. The project would have five main benefits. First, strategies would have been
determined and key actions taken (including the divestiture of a number of public sector
enterprises) to develop key cash crop subsectors such as sugar, cotton and oilseeds within an
appropriate policy and operating environment and with greater private sector involvement;
second, a strategy would have evolved and action taken to re-orient agricultural cooperatives to
being more member controlled, effectively run entities less burdened by Government intervention;
third, the role, structure and functions of MOA and MOLD would be rationalized and supported
by strengthened capacity to deliver services; fourth, the capacity in Kenya to collect, collate and
analyze information on the physical resource base would have been rationalized and strengthened;
and fifth, a NEAP for Kenya would have been formulated.
15.   Risks. There are three main risks. The first is the ability of the Government to
coordinate the various technical assistance initiatives under the project. A clear assignment of
ministerial/departmental responsibilities, and the whole process being overseen by an effective
Agricultural Sector Committee, would mitigate the project coordination problem. The second risk
is the unsustained and fragmented Government commitment to effectively utilizing the technical
assistance to improve its institutional and management capacity. The project is partly designed to
assist the Government to carry out reforms which have already either commenced or have been
agreed to in principle; consequently, with regard to the cotton, sugar, DRSRS and the NEAP
components Government commitment has already been satisfactorily demonstrated and the project
will assist in deepening and strengthening that commitment to implement key actions and reforms.
With regard to the other components, particularly the capacity building initiative in MOA and
MOLD, the participatory and consensus building approach to identifying key actions would build
commitment as the process evolves and implementation experience deepens. In addition, periodic
and close supervision of the project coupled with the continued dialogue on the need for improved
capacity within Government to manage the ongoing reform program would attempt to sustain
Government commitment during project implementation. The third risk is the Government's
ability to motivate and/or retain trained staff. This issue would be addressed in a comprehensive
manner as part of a civil service reform program. Under ASAO II, some interim measures were
already introduced to increase staff productivity by increasing operation and maintenance support
and initiating staffing norms studies which would provide the basis for rationalizing the staffing
complement within MOA and MOLD. MOA, MOLD and to some extent MOCD would be the
best placed ministries to undergo reform (which is likely to include both a reduction in staffing
levels and a positive adjustment of professional staff remuneration) when the civil service reform
program becomes a reality.
16.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed Credit.

Disbursement Issues
1.     Overall disbursements of the 24 investment projects in the Kenya portfolio are about the
same as anticipated under the disbursement profile for such projects, though for the last two years
actual disbursements have lagged by 21 percent in FY91 and 24 percent in FY92.
2.     Two projects financed prior to FY84 (Credit 1238-KE, Population II and Credit 1390-
KE, Secondary Towns) closed on December 31, 1990, but are still showing up in the Schedule D
because of delays in reconciling the balance under the special accounts.
3.     Several older projects can be considered as slow disbursing. In the case of the Second
Highways Sector project (1984), lack of counterpart funding has been a major cause of
disbursement lags, while increasing construction contract prices and has required two extensions
of the closing date for the project which is now expected to be on December 31, 1992.
Regarding the Sixth education project (1986), which is generally progressing well, the main
source of delay has been the slow tendering and contract award procedures relating to one of the
project components. Slow disbursements on the Animal Health Services project (1987) are due in
part to the restructuring of the project which will henceforth provide services through the private,
rather than the public sector; and in part to IDA being the financier of last resort under this
cofinanced project.
4.     Counterpart funding issues and implementation issues in general, will be reviewed with
the government during, respectively, a Public Expenditure Review, and a Country Implementation
Review, both of which are scheduled for the second half of FY93.
