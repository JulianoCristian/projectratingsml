Key lessons learned were: The World\n            Bank's response to new priorities in a changing policy\n            environment can make possible achievements greater than had\n            been originally anticipated. However, this response does\n            come at a cost and can increase project complexity, which\n            can strain supervision resources. Another cost, especially\n            in supporting new institutions, is delayed implementation.\n            Because institution building is a long and sometimes complex\n            process, delays should not be seen as evidence of\n            implementation failure per se where a project is achieving\n            substantive institutional change. Directed lines of credit\n            focusing specifically, for example, on small and medium\n            enterprises are unduly restrictive and do not necessarily\n            encourage participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) to\n            develop business in this area. Limited interventions in\n            institution-building projects are acceptable only if they\n            form one part of a larger program. Where there are no clear\n            best practices, as was the case with the technical\n            assistance component, special attention should be given to\n            establishing monitoring and evaluation systems. A pilot\n            approach that allows for experimentation is recommended."}, "docdt": "1998-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
