LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a livestock development project in Honduras.
This would be the first Loan/Credit made by the Bank Group to Honduras in the
agricultural sector. It would also be the country's first project in the
agricultural-livestock sector that vould provide long-term private commercial
bank loans to ranchers on terms and conditions appropriate for the develop-
ment of their ranches.  The banks vould make a sizeable contribution to the
Project in the form of capital for ranch investments and operating capital,
plus technical and administrative services.
ii.       The principal objectives of the Project are to assist Honduras in
its national agriculture policy to raise its extremely low level (3.7 kg per
capita, 1967) of beef consumption and to assist in its diversification of
agriculture with particular emphasis on production for exports. Today, its
principal export earnings are from bananas, followed in much lesser amounts
by coffee, timber and cotton.
iii.      The objective of the Project vould be achieved by financing the
development of approximately 135 beef ranches and dairy farma. Investment
inputs, expert technical services and good management would increase na-
tional livestock production by about 15% as compared with pre-project con-
ditions.
iv.       The Project would be country-wide, but vould be carried out prin-
cipally in the North Atlantic zone vhich has the greatest concentration
of suitable ranches and most favorable resources for development.
V.        The coordination of Project policies would be by a Project Comnis-
sion representing the various institutions concerned with livestock develop-
ment in Honduras. The management and execution of the Project vould be
under a Project Director, assisted by livestock technicians employed by
participating banks but seconded to his office for purposes related to the
Project.
vi.       Total Project cost, estimated at US$5.2 míllion, would be financed
approximately as follows:
Amount         Percent
(US$m)
IDA Credit             2.6            50
Comercial Banks        1.8            35
Ranchers               0.8             15
5.2           100



- ii -
The estimated foreign exchange component is US$1.1 millíon. This repre-
sents about 20% of total Project cost and 40% of the Credit.
vii.      Goods required for the Project vould be obtained through exist-
ing comercial channels in Honduras.  Several retail sources are available
and active competition exists to assure an adequate supply as vell as satis-
factory servicing. Input items such as agricultural machinery and equip-
ment, vire fencing, and veterinary supplies are imported from United States,
Japan, Western European countries and are distributed through local fran-
chised dealers. Disbursements from the Credit for ranch development would
be a percentage (75%) of ranch development loans disbursed by participating
banks. Such loans, based on ranch development plana approved by the Project
Director, vould be granted by the banks at 9% interest for terms of 8-12
years including grace periods of 3-5 years.
viii.     The rate of return to the economy vould be about 18%. Partic-
ipating ranchers would earn about 16% to 21% on their incremental invest-
ments under the Project. Substantial increased net earnings vould begin
around Year-10 when full ranch development would be achieved.
ix.       The Project i8 suitable for an IDA credit of US$2.6 million.  The
Government vould on-lend about US$2.4 million of these funds to the Central
Bank for channeling to private commercial banks and a private finance company
for long-tern ranch development loans. The other US$0.2 million would be
a grant by Government for technical services. Surplus funda not required
to amortize the IDA Credit during the first 16 years of the Credit vould be
relent by the Central Bank to participating banks, or other qualified finan-
cial institutions, for livestock purposes.

LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Honduras has requested financial assistance to
provide long-term funis for financing livestock development, mainly beef
cattle. An IBRD mission helped prepare the Project in March 1967. At that
time a broadly-based Government committee vas established which prepared
the Project under direction of the Central Bank.
1.02      The original investment program developed by the committee totaled
about US$14 million and an external fíinacing of about US$8 million vas re-
quested. The other US$6 million vas to be provided by livestock producers,
commercial banks, Central Bank and Government.  The program involved a
country-wide development of about 300 ranches; each ranch would be e.bout
300 ha in size, carrying on average 300 head of cattle prior to development,
and about tvice this number at full development.  The IDA found thae. this
type of ranch was not suffíciently characteristic of the industry and pro-
posed to Government three types of ranching enterprises. Furthernore, in
viev of the limited number of suitable ranches and the limited suppiy of
female stock for breeding, and steers for fattening, the IDA agreed vith
Government on a reduction of the investment program to about US$5.2 million
and about 125-150 ranches. Although the Project vould cover the whole of
Honduras, about 85% of the ranches vould be in the North Atlantic zone.
1.03      This appraisal report is based on the findings of a mission led by
F. Knobel and composed of D. Argyle and A. Otten (IDA) and F. Thomas (Consul-
tant), vhich visited Honduras in January/February 1969.
II. BACKGROUND
A.  General
2.01      Honduras is the poorest of the Central American countries U/.
The countrfi is small and quite mountainous vith a total land area of
115,000 km  (45,000 sq mi).  Of this only 15% is tillable.  Bounded by the
Caribbean Sea, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the Pacifie Ocean, the
principal economic activities are centered around banana exports from the
2/   GNP per capita expressed In US dollars:  Costa Rica $410, El Salvador
$270, Guatemala $310, Honduras $240, Nicaragua $360, Panama $550.

coastal plain along the Caribbean coast.  Recent road and port develop-
menta vith considerable Bank Group assistance 1/ have contributed to uni-
fication of the country, developed additional accese to the Pacific and
into El Salvador, and opened up new agricultural possibilities.
2.02      The country can be divided into three zones - Atlantic, Central
and Pacific - (see Map):
(i)  The Atlantic zone comprises 46% of the total land area and
contains the most productive and extensive valleys in Honduras.
The zone runs in a broad belt along the Caribbean coast. It
has a reliable rainfall of 1,500 - 2,000 m= per annuim with a
semi-dry period of tvo to four months.  Soile in the valleys,
coastal plaina and low hills are fertile and vell suited to
intensive cropping, livestock production and the banana indus-
try. The area ls vell serviced with infrastructure and com-
mercial facilities; hoaever, a considerable portion of the
eastern end í8 virtually uninhabited, providing Bcope ín the
long-run for new development.
(ii) The Central zone is generally hilly to mountainous and com-
primes 41% of the total land area.  The valleys are generally
amall and discontinuous, making cormunications difficult.
Soils are generally of loy fertility, but much of the area í8
cropped on a shifting rotation. Rainfall varles from 900 -
1,100 mm per annum, but there la a severe dry season of about
five months from January to June.
(iii)  The amall Pacific zone, making up the rest of the total land
area, is largely arable land vith average fertility. Rainfall
varies from 1,000 - 1,800 =m but there is a pronounced dry
season of approximately five months during January-June.
2.03      The Honduran economy i8 predominantly agricultural vith agriculture
- lncluding forestry and fishing - contributing 40% of Gross Domestie Product
and occupying about 70% of the 2.4 million population.  Bananas are the most
important single crop, accounting for about 35% of agricultural produetion.
The banana industry is concentrated ln the Atlantie zone on plantations
largely owned by two companies.  Livestock production la about one fifth of
total agricultural production. Principal farm cash crope include coffee,
cotton, corn and tobacco.  Three-fourths of the farm units are under six ha
snd many contain hilly slopes. Larger farns usually have more than one
enterprise, but only a limited number of faraers depend on livestock opera-
tiona for the major source of income.

2.04      Agricultural products account for 75% of total exports, of which
about half ís bananas. The country experienced a satisfactory ínerease in
Gross National Product averaging 5% per annum over the 1964-1968 period,
partly absorbed by a population increase of around 3.4% per year.  Growth
was mainly export induced; banana exports more than doubled due to a quick
recovery of banana Droduction in this period following replacement of di-
sease infected plantations (Annex 1). Ample foreign exchange reserves en-
abled Government to promote industrial growth successfully by liberalizing
imports of raw materíals and equipment.
2.05      The outlook for the future is somewhat less promising.  Banana
production would still inerease during the next three years, 1969-72, but
at a slover rate than in the past. It is likely that production would level
off after 1972 as it is exoected that export prices vould decline. Further-
more, the country is faced with uncertain world markets for two other lead-
ing exnort conmodities:  coffee and cotton.  Increased export demand la ex-
pected to continue for livestock, in particular live cattle and beef, but
cattle production has not been incneasing. There ís wide scope for an ex-
panded production of good quality cattle through improvement of animal
husbandry, whlch can be realized by an adequate supply of ranch development
credit combined with technical services.
B. The LiveBtock Sub-sector
2.06      The cattle population ls estimated at 1.3 million head of beef,
milk, and draft animals.  However, most of these animals (75%) are on small-
scale mixed farms which average about 10 head each.  These farma generally
have limited scope for livestock expansion but many are receiving assistance
from the National Development Bank (NDB) through programs supported by the
United States Agency for International Development and the Inter-American
Development Bank. The larger and more efficient ranchers have received
little credit except for short-term production purposes. It ie estimated
that less than 5% of all farms vith cattle have the potential for econo-
mically expanding beef production. Consequently, the number of eligible
farms limits the scope of the Project.
2.07      In terms of land area, cattle are distributed fairly evenly:
Atlantie zone accounts for 41%, Central zone 43%, and the Pacifie zone 16%
of total population. Traditionally, most cattle are dual purpose (milk and
meat), even on larger ranches, but there is a trend tovard grealer beef
specialization, especially on ranches with more than 500 head. In recent
years there has been a nominal increase in swine production and a marked
inerease in poultry production, especially broilera for domestic consumption.
2.08      The beef cattle industry is best developed in the Atlantie zone.
Most of the larger ranches are found in this area and the quality of cattle
is better than ín other zones. The area is the main source of export beef
and whole milk production. Stocking rate i about one animal pér ha but,
with good management, this could be increased, over much of the zone, to
two animals per ha.



-4-
2.09      Most cattle in the Central zone are on small non-commercial type
farms, providing draft pover, meat and milk for home consumption, or cheese.
The quality of stock is generally poor. Overall stocking rates are about
one animal per ha. The variable rainfall pattern and infertile 90ils gi .
a safe carrying capacity of not more than one animal per ha.
2.10      The Pacific zone carries a surprisingly high number of cattle in
ratio to land area, particularly in view of the dry season, and stocking
rates of one or more animals per ha on many properties are above safe carry-
ing capacities. Hovever, by-products from cotton and sugarcane are avail-
able for supplemental feeding, and green feed is produced by irrigation
on some ranches. Production is more commercially oriented and cattle qual-
ity 15 somewhat better than in the Central zone.
2.11      Most of the cattle are of the native or criollo type.  In recent
years there has been considerable introduction of improved breeds from the
United States in the Atlantic zone and some introduction in the other zones.
The most favored improved beef breed ia the Brahman, followed, to a much
lesser extent, by Santa Gertrudis and Charolais. Por dairying, Brown Swiss
is the most popular followed by Holstein and Red Polled. Purebred bulls are
available fron the Government's Comayagua Stud Farm, United Fruit Company
and several private studs, at prices below imported animals. Artificial in-
saemination services are available for most major dairy herds.
2.12      Commercial offtake has averaged only about 13% since 1950, but with
the national herd showing very little increase. This is mainly the result of
inadequacies in animal husbandry, nutrition and parasite control resulting ,
in iiigh calf losses, slow growth rates and an effective calving rate of only
35-40%. The average age of slaughter steers is 4-5 years with an average
liveweight of about 275 kg (600 lb), being higher in the Atiantie zone.
2.13      Livestock exports have increased in recent years.  With production
not rising (para 2.12) there has been a fa). in domestic consumption of beef
from the low level of 6 kg per person in 1961 to 3.7 kg per person in 1967.
This has been due mainly to the rising price of beef, resulting from the
higher prices being paid for the cattle by the meat exporters and cattle buy-
ers from Guatemala. Strong export demand for beef wil). probably continue to
limit the availability of beef for domestic consumption.
2.14      There are ample slaughter plants in the country for slaughtering
and processing of boneless frozen beef for export. Processing facilities
would be adequate for the Project since about 70% of the beef produced
vould be exported (para 5.01). Slaughterhouse facilities for local con-
sumption are poor and many aninals are illegally slaughtered for local
consumption.
2.15      The only modern milk plant is at San Pedro Sula in the Atlantic
zone. Demand for its products has been steadily increasing and should con-
tinue. Raw milk is collected from a considerable part of tbe zone, and the
products are distributed to a wide area of Honduras including Tegucigalpa,
300 km dístant.



-5-
C.  Animal Health
2.16      Poor nutrition and failure to follow basic principles of good live-
stock husbandry are the most iLtportant factors contributing to poor animal
health and performance. The most serious deficiency is the inadequate nutrí-
tion of calves which normally receive only a portion of the motherlB mulk.
This practice results not only in heavy calf mortality but slow growth, poor
reproductive performance and susceptibility to disease. Poor pastur-e man-
agement practices and lack of forage conservation for dry periods also con-
tribute to poor nutrition.
2.17      The most important diseases are brought about by a variety of
internal parasites:  calf scours, and such infectious díseases as blackleg,
hemorrhagic septicaemia and anthrax. Tickborne diseases are hazarda to lm-
ported cattle but can be controlled by pre-immunization. Infestation by
varble fly can cause high physical and economic losses. This and other in-
festations can be controlled by dipping or spraying. Facilities for this
purpose on Project ranches are provided in the Project.
2.18      There is no foot-and-mouth disease as a result of effective quaran-
tine restrictions. This is of particular signifícance in the development of
ftuture exports to Europe or United States.
D. Agricultural Services
2.19      The national institutions responsible for the development of the
livestock sector are primarily the Ministry of Natural Resources, operating
through its specialized departments and its semi-autonomous Extension Serv-
ices (DESARRURAL), the National Development Bank, and the National Agrarian
Institute. There are, hovever, numerous other national and international
institutions which both directly and indirectly provide services and credit
to the livestock industry (Annex 2).
2.20      The general organization of the Ministry and the Extension Service
is good. There is also good liaison at senior and fíeld levels between the
National Development Bank and the Ministry. The specialized departments of
the Ministry dealing wlth animal health, varble fly control and artificial
insemination have specific programs to follow. Hovever, these institutions
should give more emphasis to defining long-term livestock development poli-
cies.
2.21      Graduate professional staff for work in the livestock sub-sector
is limited. A recent detailed study 1/ shows that in Honduras there are 35

October 1968 Vol. 1.



-6-
professionally qualified veterinarians. General agriculturists vrith
formal training are in greater supply. These largely form the fleld
staffs of the National Development Bank and Extension Service, which
now have about 100 such personnel. The Extension Service intends to in-
crease its staff from the present 60 to about 100 in 1971.  In addition,
the Ministry of Natural Resources has about 75 trained vorkers in re-
search.  Technical services that would be required for the  Project vould
be supplied by the participating banks (para 3.22) and there are adequate
resources, both private and government, to provide any specialized serv-
ices, e.g., veterinarian.
E. A&ricultural Credit
2.22      Institutional agricultural credit, vhich includes l.ivestock credit,
18 provided principally by a government development bank, aix private com-
mercial banks and one private finance compeny.  The aount of credit granted
more than doubled during 1964-1968, rising fron L30 millíon (US$15 million)
to L72 million (US$36 million). Hovever the ratio of agricultural credit to
total creX4t for all sectors has remaíned relatively the same, being around
30% (Annex 3, Table 1). About two-thirds of the agricultural credit comes
from the National Development Bank (Government), 30% from private conmercial
banks, ana the other 5% from the private finance company.  Agricultural sup-
pliera' credit ¡e nominal, but borrowing from traditional private lenders is
common smong low-income rural farnilies.
i:
2.23     .Credit for agriculture and livestock is mostly short-term.  Very
few medium-term loans, perhaps leas than 100, have been granted for livestock
developnent, almost entirely by the National Developme-nt Bank.  A sizeable
amount of.credit i8 furnished by the banking system for financing the pur-
chase of iature steers for fattening.  This in 1968 amounted to about L10
million (US$5 million). The Central Bank provides short-term credit by re-
discounting agricultural `paper` not exceeding 360 days at 4% interest.  The
interest rate for all types of rural credit averages about 9%.  This com-
pares with credit for cormercial purposes at around 8%.
2.24      The private commercial banking system i8 vell developed.  It is
agressive, competitive, and covers the entire country. All the principal
banks have headquarter offices in Tegucigalpa. Credit. for agriculture and
livestock i8 principally short-term for purposes of production, marketing
and financing feeder cattle. The amount of agricultural credit held by the
banks has steadily increased from about L19 million (US$9.5 million) in 1964
to L27 million (US$13.5 million) in 1968 (Annex 3, Table 2). The banks are
becoming inereasingly avare of the importance of broadening their agricultural
credit service by making long-term development loans. It is expected that
three to five of the banks and a private finance company, nov extending
agricultural credit, vould participate in the Project. They vould be in a
position to contribute a portion of the financial requirements as vell as
providing the necessary administrative and technical services.

2.25      Although the National Development Bank (NDB) is the principal sup-
plier of rural credit (para 2.22), it would not participate in the Project.
It obtains capital from Government and external sources, principally the
Inter-American Development Bank and the US Agency for International Develop-
ment. Its credit operations, which principally are vith lo income farmera,
have not been satisfactory. Financially, NDB has experienced arnual oper-
ating losses and there is need for better technical services. Annex 3 con-
tains further information on the banking system in Honduras.
F. Government Policies on Livestock Development
2.26      A three-year development plan, 1969-71, prepared by the National
Planning Council, is being considered by the Cabinet.  It states that the
goals of Government policy toward agriculture, among others, are:  "t-o
raise the supply of livestock products for domestic consumption" and "to
diversify agricultural production vith particular emphasis on production
for export". This program calls for an increase in agricultural inveat-
mente from the present 4% of total public investments to a level of' 12%,
most of the inerease going into irrigation and land settlement schemeR.
2.27      With respect to livestock, the Plan envisages a continuation of on-
going programs in the fields of animal health, livestock improvement and
animal breeding. In 1969 Government budgeted L2.6 million (US$l.3 Million)
Lor these programs or slightly more than 1% of the total budget (current
and capital expenditure combined) of which about L880,000 (us$44o,ooo) re-
presented capital investments in the livestock sector, or 1% of total public
investments. Thi8 share for the livestock sector is not commensurate with
the stated objectives. The pressing need to increase livestock production
la demonstrated by the loy and declining beef intake per capita, and the
groving contribution of both the beef and saine industry to exports.
2.28      The Project would support livestock development through an inte-
grated approach to ranch development, based on a combination of, capitsl
investments and technical services, and would make an important contribu-
tion tovards the objectives of the National Development Plan.
G. Land Tenure
2.29      An Agrarian Reform Lay vas passed in 1962.  It declared that pri-
vately owned ranches vould not be expropriated provided that they vere prop-
erly managed.  The law defines "proper management" as a minimum stocking rate
of 0.5 animal unit per ha. Since all ranches participating in the Project
vould reach a stocking rate vell beyond this minimum rate, they vould not be
adversely affected by the Agrarian Reform Lay.
2.30      Many state and conmunal lands have been oecupied in the past for
private use. In many cases, clear titles of private ownership have not been
established by the users, but if land pressure develops, such lands could be



claimed by the National Agrarian Institute for redistribution among peasants.
A cadastral survey is being carried out by the Institute to determine the
extent of this situation.
2.31      Loans to ranchers participating in the Project would be baseá on
lande with clear titles.  The participating banks do not aaticipate eny
serious difficulty in this respect.
III. THE PROJECT
A.  De!scç    n
3.01      The Project vould be a five-year program for the development of
about 135 existing ranches vhich by type and size vould range approximately
as follows:
- 75 beef breeding/fattening ranches, 400 ha
(Model 1, Annex 4? Tables 1-i4)
- 50 dairy-steer/fattening ranches, 150 ha
(Model 2, Annex 5, Tables 1-4)
- 10 beef breeding ranches, 1,500 ha
(Model 3, Annex 6, Tables 1-4)
The development program would be carried out through the provision of long-
term development credit vith funds from IDA and private commercial banks
together with short-term operating credit from the banks, supported by
technical services.
3.02      The ranch development program would include financing of limited
land clearance for new pasture establishment, but major emphasis would be
placed on the improvement through cleoring of regenerative bush and reseeding
of large areas of existing pasture lands.  Other ranch development vould in-
elude fencing, water supply, facilities for handling stock and controlling
disease, farm machinery, purebred bulls, improved commercial breeding COWs,
and feeder steers.
3.03      The coordinating and supervisory authoríty for the Project would
be a Project Commi±ssion.  The technical services would be headed by a Project
Director, assisted by a staff of qualified livestock technicians who vould
be employed by participating banks.
3.o4      Working capital for purchase of feeder steers, for fattening on
surplus pastures available during development, vould be supplied by partie-
ipating banks. This finance is important to the success of the Project since
it would ensure better use of pasture resources, thereby giving higher eash
incomes to ranchers during the time required to build-up their breeding herd
inventories.



-9-
B. Pr2oect Area
3.05      About 85% of the ranches participating in the Project would be in
the Atlantic zone and vould be concentrated in Sula Valley in the Departments
(provinces) of Atlantida and Cortes (see Map). Most of the beef breeding/
fattening (Model 1) and dairy-steer/fattening (Model 2) types of ranches
vould be in this zone. It i9 the most favored area in the country for live-
stock production due to climate, topograxhy and soil. It has a vide variety
of natural and introduced grasses including guinea, molas8es, para, pangola
and elephant. It also has better types of cattle than other areas, and has
ready access to markets.
3.06      Participation in the Central zone would be limited, and would be
principally in the eastern part vhere ranching operations on an extensive
scale are found (see Map, Departments of Olancho and El Paraiso).  The require-
ments in this zone are mainly to improve the quality of breeding stock, to
increase pasture production, and to improve its utilization by conservation
of fodder for dry season feeding.  Most of the beef breeding ranches (Model 3)
would be in this zone.
3.07      The Pacific zone is largely utilized for cropping and mixed farm-
ing.  Physical problems of livestock production in this zone are similar to
those in the Central zone (para 3.06), but in some areas there are ample
supplies of groundwater vhich could be further developed for supplementary
irrigation of fodder crops. Development in this zone would include a few
beef breeding/fattening (Model 1) and beef breeding (Model 3) types of ranches.
3.08      The Project management office would be in the Central Bank,
Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras, so that a strong liaison vould be maintained
with governmental services and banking institutions.  Although about 85% of
Project loans would be made in the northern Atlantic zone, accessibility and
communícations between Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula (trade and commercial
center of Atlantic zone) are good by telephone, cable and several daily com-
mercial airline flights.
C. Cost Estimates
3.09      Cost estimates are based on prices prevailing in Honduras.  An
additional aiount of about 10% 18 included to cover unforeseen costs.  The
estinat.e of total Project cost ls US$5.2 million, which is summarized in the
folloving table:

- 11 -
3.12      On the above basis, IDA funds would finance 60% of on-ranch in-
vestments and 80% of technical services or about 49% of total Project cost.
This would mean that in addition to the foreign exchange component of US$1.1
million (para 3.10) IDA would finance about US$1.5 million of local curreney
expenditures.
3.13      Participating commercial banks would finance 20% of on-ranch in-
vestments and 100% of working capital requírements, or, on average, about
35% of total Project cost. The short-term credits provided by the banks
would also be used to purchase feeder steers. To ensure availability of
funds for short-term credit, assurances vere obtained during negotiations
that the Central Bank would redíscount short-term credit paper if not
otherwise available from the banks' own resources.
3.14      The ranchers would contribute, on average, 20% of estimated on-
ranch development costs in the form of cash, labor and materiíal..  In some
instances they would make a further contribution because their annual net in-
come during the early stage of ranch development is reduced due to retention
of breeding stock which otherwise would have been sold (Annex 6, Table 2).
3.15      Funds from the IDA credit would finance the cost of the Project
Director including salary, international travel, family end housing allow-
ances, and the foreign exchange component of goods associated with his serv-
ices, e.g., a vehicle. Other costs including in-country travel, salaries of
office staff and miscellaneous office expenses would be paid by the Central
Bank. The Central Bank would also provide office facilities.
E. Procurement
3.16      Goods required for ranch development, including fencing, agricul-
tural machinery and equipment, materials for ranch structures, pasture seed,
and livestock would be obtained through existing commercial channels. These
channels are adequate for the Project. Since there are several retail sources
for most goods, both imported and local, sufficient competition in the supply
of goods is assured. Inputs having a high foreign exehange component such as
agricultural machinery, equipment, fencing, fertilizers and veterinary sup-
plies are imported from countries in Western Europe, the United States and
Japan. Charges on imported goods and dealers' markups are within an accepta-
ble range (15-25%), and there are no discriminatory import quotas or controls.
Adequate facilities exist for the servicing and maintenance of agricultural
machinery and equipment.
3.17      All purchases of breeding stock required for the Project would be
subject to the approval of the Project Director with respect to the quality
and suitability of such stock. Since the type and quality of anímals required
can only be obtained from specific regions of the world, international com-
petitive bidding would not be appropriate for livestock procurement. Because
of its proximity to Honduras, United States has been the principal source of
imported cattle.



- 12 -
F. Disbursements
3.18      Disbursementa from the Credit would be made to the Central Bank
against 75% of the ranch development loans (60% of ranch development cost)
disbursed by participating banks upon documentation submitted to the Central
Banko. Such documentation would include disbursements by development categor-
¡es, country of origin of goods, certification by the lending bank that dis-
bursements irere made for approved ranch development purposes, and approval
of the Project Director. The documents would be submitted by the Central
Bank to IDA to support withdravals from the Credit account., Disbursements
from the Credit for services of the Project Director (para 3.15) vould be
made upon appropriate documentation submitted by the Central Bank on behalf
of Governnent.  Full disbursement of the Credit vould be achieved w'ithin five
years although around 80% of the Credit would be disbursed by the end of the
third year.  See Annex 9 for phasing of Project investmenta.  Any unused
funde should be channeled to the Central Bank for livestock purposes.
G. Auditing
3.19      There are several independent auditing services which would be
acceptable to IDA, both the official Government auditing bodies such as
the Superintendent of Banks and External Auditor, and at least two inter-
national auditing firms, Price Waterhouse and Company, and Peat, Marwick,
Mitehell and Co. (USA). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the Central Bank and each participating bank would maíntain separate ac-
counts for the Project activities, that these accounts would be audited
annual2ly by an accounting service acceptable to IDA, and that the audit
report would be submitted to IDA not later thian four months after the close
cf the respective insti.tutionla fiscal year.
H. Organization and Managlet
Project Adminístratíon
3 20      The Government would be the Borrover and the Central Bank would
act as Administering Agency for the Project. Coordinating and supervisory
authority would be vested in a Project Commission created by Government
decree.  Thís Commission vould formulate policies and procedures and approve
the Project Director. The Commiesion vould be composed of representatives
from various Government entities, participating banks, and the National
Cattlemenls Association.  Government would be represented by the Central
Bank, Ministry of Natural Kesources, Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance,
Zational Agrarían Institute, National Planning Council and, as an observer,
the National Development Bank because of its important role in agricultural
credit.  The Project Director would act as Executive Secret ary. The organi-
zational structure of the Project Comnmssion (Annex 10) together with its
funetions would be subject to the approval of the IDA. Assurances to this
effect were obtained during negotiationa.
I



- 13 -
Technical Services
3.21      The Project Director would be responsible for the execution of
the Project, dealing particularly with the technical, financial and eco-
nomic aspects. He would approve or reject ranch development plans and would
submit approved plans to participating banks for lending.  He and his tech-
nical staff vould supervise the execution of ranch development plans. This
technical staff of livestock technicians would be employed by the partici-
pating banks and seconded to his office for purposes of the Project; he
would train and supervise their work. The duties, responsibilities and
authoritíes of the Project Director are set forth in Annex 11. During ne-
gotiations, it vas agreed that a Project Director would be employed through-
out the disbursement period (5 years); that his qualifications, duties,
responsibilities and terms of contract would be subject to IDA approval;
and that his appointment would be made before thé effective date of the
Credit Agreement.
3.22      Government agreed that recruitment of a Project Director outside
of Honduras would probably be necessary.  No difficulty ¡a expected on the
availability in Honduras of four to five livestock technicians that would
be required from the participating banks. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that participating banks would employ and second to the Proj-
ect livestock technicians acceptable to the Project Director.
I. Lending Operations
Policies
3.23      Applications and loans would be processed and serviced by private
commercial banks and the private finance company. Loan applications would
meet the creditworthiness criteria of these institutions which would bear the
full loan risk. Security for loans vould include real estate mortgages
based on acceptable titles, and if needed, chattel mortgages on livestock and
equipment. Increased real estate value resulting from ranch development im-
provements would be reflected in the values established for collateral pur-
poses.
Terms and Conditions
3.24      Government would make available to the Central Bank the proceeds
of the IDA credit to be used for on-ranch development purposes in local cur-
rency at 4.5% interest per annum for a term of 16 years. 1/ The Central
Bank would repay the principal to Government at 1% per year during Years 11-
15 (same as IDA terms) and the balance at end of Year-16. Since surplus
1/   A 16-year period is used to cover 12-year ranch loans made in the
third year of the Project plus one year for slippage.



- 14 _
funda vould acerue from the payments received from the participating banks
(para 3.25) these funds would be made available to participating banks by
the Central Bank for livestock credits. The rollover would add about Lll
million (US$5.5 million) to the Lending Program (Annex 12). At the end of
the 16-year period, all IDA funds used for ranch development would be re-
paid to Government. During negotiations, assurances as to these terms and
conditions were obtained.
3.25      The Central Bank would establish and maintain a Livestock Project
Account to relend the Credit funds to each participating bank approved by it,
equal to 75% (60% of ranch development costa) of the loans disbursed by the
participating banks for ranch development purposes. These funds would bear
5% interest per annum and would be repayable on terms similar to those grant-
ed by the banks to ranchera. The spread of 0.5% between the cost of Credit
funds from Government and the on-lending rate of 5% vould be used by +he
Central Bank to pay the local and office costs of the Project Director and
for reimbursement of its administrative services related to the Project.
Duríng negotiationa assurances vere obtained vith respect to these terms
and conditions.
3.26      Development loans, based on ranch development plano approved by the
Project Director, vould be made to ranchers by participating banks at 9% in-
terest for terms of 8-12 years including grace periods of 3-5 years. An in-
terest rate of 9% is in line wíth the prevaílíng rate for rural credit (para
2.23) and vould be an acceptable rate to the ranchers. The difference between
this on-lending rate and the rate of 5% at which IDA funda vould be obtained
from the Central Bank (para 3.25) would give the banks a spread of 4%. This
would be adequate to cover the cost of technicians seconded to the Project
(para 3.22), the loan risk, the admininstrative cost and profit. Loans
greater than US$100,000 would require prior approval by IDA. The application
of funda generated by the Project is shown in Annex 13. During negotiations,
aseurances as te these lending terma and conditions were obtained.
IV.  MARKETS, PRICES AND PRODUCERS' BENEFITS
Marketa
4eOl      Until recently the beef cattle sub-sector produced mainly for do-
mestie consumption, which ís still low. In 1961, beef consumption was only
6 kg per capita compared with an average of 11 kg for all Central American
countries, and 70% of production was for the domestic markets; the remaining
30% consisted of live cattle exporta to neighboring countries for fattening.
Beef production has since found additional outlets, principally in the form
of bonelase frozen meat exports to the United States. Honduran exports to
thís market have risen much faster than the increase in United States imports.
While vorld-wide meat imports almost doubled in the 1960-68 period, imports
from Honduras increased fourfold. At present, 53% of Honduran cattle pro-
duction is for the export market, of which 36% is processed into boneless
frozen meat, and 17% is exported on the hoof - mainly to Guatemala.
1402      Meat importe into the United States are subject to import control
legislation. At the end of 1968, the United States applied the Meat Import



- 15 -
Act 1/ for the first time, limiting boned frozen meat imports to a 4% inerease
in 1969.  The allowed increase is applied equally to all exporting countries.
Extraction from the national herd, however, has reached its upper limít under
present production practices. Projections on the basis of historic trends
indicate that without implementation of the Project, production vould not in-
crease over the 1966 level during the next five years. Under such conditions,
even a small increase in exports of 2.5% annually would further reduce avail-
ability of beef for local consumption (Annex 14). With the Project, an in-
crease over present production levels from 4% in the fourth year up to about
15% in the tenth year is estimated. Of this approximately 70% would be ex-
ported. The Project would contribute in the tenth year about 30-35% of the
increase in exports.
4.03      There is a free market movement of cattle vithin londuras, and no
sales or export taxes are levied at any point. Export packing plants pay
slaughter taxes averaging L4.20 (US$2.10) per head as compared with taxes
and fees of up to L8 (uS$4) being paid at municipal slaughterhouses which
supply the domestic market. Largely as a result of these charges there is
an extensive illegal slaughter of cattle for local consumption.
4.o4      The present market system has several deterrents to more prof it-
able livestock production. They include:
(i) on-ranch purchases of live animals by middlemen on an
estimated carcass weight basis;
(ii) lack of a grading system that vould enable price differ-
entials for better quality cattle;
(iii) inadequate municipal slaughtering facilities; and
(iv)  poor communications to outlying areas, resulting ín
price variations up to 20%.
This situation has been improved to some extent by the privately owned export
meat packing plants.  They publish price listinga for purchase of slaughter
cattle, have adequate slaughter facilities, provide some credit for steer
fattening, and offer higher prices per pound for heavier animals.
Prices
4.05      An increase of approximately 58% in export prices from 1960 to
1968 stimulated an expansion of boneless meat exporta. (FOB prices in Cen-
tral American countries increased from US$0.68/kg to US$1.08/kg during this
period). In Honduras, the price increase vas largely pasead on to the pro-
ducer, because more export packing plants vere built and competition for
cattle increased betveen the plants and Guatemalan cattle buyers.  Average
Uj  Public Lay 88-482 of 1964 regulates US meat imports in accordance vith
increases in domestic production.



- 16 -
national producer prices went up from about L100 (US$50) to L150 (US$75) per
animal or US$0.14 to present prices of US$0.22 per kg liveveight.  The re-
action from producers has been to increase the rate of extract ion from the
national herd but with little, if any, improvement in herd productivity. It
is unlikely that a downward trend in prices would occur in the future as the
application of import quotas by US would not lead to surplus beef production
under present and projected supply conditions (para 4.02).  Under the Project,
producer prices are estimated to be the same as present prices paid for better
quality cattle and vould range from L170 (Us$85) to L200 (US$100) per animal.
Producer Benefita
4. o6     Substantial increases in net annual income would be derived from
investments under the Project (Annexes 4-6, Table 4).  After 10 years, annual
net incomes prior to debt service on a 400 ha breeding/fattening ranch (Mode)
1) vould increase from about L3,000 (US$1,500) to L30,000 (US$15,000); on a
150 ha dairy-steer/fattening ranch (Model 2) from L4,000 (US$2,000) to
L15,000 (US$7,500); and on a 1,500 ha breeding ranch (Model 3) from L14,000
(US$T7000) to L52,000 (US$26,000). After the same time, incrementol increases
in the capital value of the herd would be 118%, 66% and 61% respectively.
The financial rates of return on the ineremental investments under the Proj-
ect, giving livestock producers a strong incentive to participate in the
program, would range from about 16% to 21% for these types of ranches (Annex
15).
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Project vould asesist Honduras in increasing its supply of beef
and milk for domestic consumption and beef for export. After full develop-
ment, incremental production w<ould amount to 10,000 tons of beef (live-weight)
and 1.4 idiLíon litera of milk annually with a total value of about L4.8 mil-
lion (US$2.4 million) at current domestic prices to the producer. The incre-
mental beef produced vould represent 15% of the present total annual beef
production. About 70% of the beef would be exported, most of it being better
quality; e.dditional milk production would serve as a substitute for milk
powder importa. The combined gross increase in foreign exchange earning
(beef) and savíngs (milk powder) would average approximately US$1.7 million
ennually.
5.02      The Project's benefits to the economr have been set out in Annex
16. To this effect, the cost of technical services from project staff and
participating banks have been added to costs, and the import substitution
effect of increased milk production has been valued at world market prices.
Increased goverument revenues from the Project such as slaughter taxes and
duties levied on imported capital goods have been included in the benefits
to the economy. On this basis the rate of return to the econonr would be
about 18%. In addition, several non-quantifiable benefits would be realized:
the Project would introduce improved animal husbandry production techniques,
would provide technical services of a type that has been virtually unknown
in Honduras and the commercial banks would be involved for the first time



- 17 -
in extending long-term credit to agriculture; also the Project vould help to
reduce the country's dependence on banana exports which is a primary goal of
Government policy towarda agrículture.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During Credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following principal points:
(a) The Government would be the Borrower and the Central Bank of
Honduras vould be the Administering Agency. Coordination and
supervision of the Project would be vested in a Project Com-
mission (para 3.20); technical services would be provided by
a Project Director and qualified livestock technicians (para
3.21);
(b)  Government vould on-lend to the Central Bank the Credit funda
used for on-ranch development at 4.5% interest per annum
(para 3.24); Central Bank would re-lend these funds to partí-
cipating banks at 5% interest on terms similar to those grant-
ed by the banks to ranchers (para 3.25).
6.02      The Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$2.6 million.  The
Republic of Honduras vould assume the foreign exchange cost.

ANNEX 3
HONDURAS
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMEIT PROJECT
The Banking System
A. Introduction
1.   Hondwran banks, both private and governnent, play an important role
in providing credit to the agricultural industry. Of total credit,
approximately 30% go96   to agriculture, compared with 20% for induistry,
17% each for housing and commerce, 6% each for consurmption and transport,
and 3% for services (Table l).  Traditionally, 65-701 of the agricultural
credit has been provided by the Governnent's National Development Bank
and the other 30-35% by the private commercial banks. This proportion
shifted somiewhat in 1968 when a higher percentage was provided by the
private banks (37%) and a private finance corporation (h451) (Table 2).
B. Central Bank
2.   The Central Bank of Honduras heads the banking system.  It is an
autonomous governmental institution established by National Congress in
February 1950. Its headquarters are in Tegucigalpa; it has a branch
office in San Pedro Sula and eight agencies country-wide.
Organization of the Board of Directors
3.   Monetary, credit and exchange policies as well as administrative
and operational policies are entrusted to the Board of Directors. The
Board is composed of five members, as follows:
The President of the Bank, principal member of the Board,
appointed by the President of the Republic;
The Minister of the Economic Affairs and Finance, an ex-officio
member;
Representative frorn the National Development Bank;
Representative from the private commercial banks;
Representative from the private sector of the econony.
Each member has an alternative representatíve.
Administration and Management
b.   Among other duties, the President of the Bank, who holds tenure of
office for a 7-year term which may be extended (current President has
been in office 18 years), proposes to the Board of Directors the measures
and resolutions which, according to his judgment, are needed for the
execution of the monetary, credit and exchange policy of the institution;
informs the Board of issues most relevant for the operation of the Bank;
performs the legal representation, together with or apart from the
Management; and directs the relations of the Bank and Board wjith public
authorities, with the banking system and wjith international organizations
for which the Central Bank has been assigned to represent Government.

5.   The Manager of the Bank is in charge of its direct administration
and day-to-day operations. He is appoínted by the Boarcd, being
responsible to it as well as the President. He is assisted by an
assistant manager and several department managers v¡ho, upon his
recommendation, are appointed by the Board (see organization chart).
6.   An Internal Áundtr, appointed by the Board, is responsible for the
inspection &,d conÚinituom audit of the accounts of the Bank.  An  bcternal
Auditor, appointed by the President of the Republic and administratively
responsible to Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, annually audits
the departmenta of the Bank for legal and financial compliance with the
Banking laws and regulations. The Superintendent of Banks, appointed to
the Board and administratively responsible to the i4anager of the Bank,
is responsbile for examining private banks, finance companies and
government banks.
Functions
7.   Characteristically, the Central Banks acts as bankeri  fiscal
agent and economic and financial adviser to Government, to its ministries
and departments, and to official and semi-official entities. Primarily,
its purpose is to promote monetary, credit and exchange conditions
favorable to the developnent of the national economy.
0.  The Central Bank may grant advances and rediscount at 100% credit
instruuments not exceeding 360 days for financing the initial stages of
agricultural, stock raising and industrial production at 4% interest
per annum and other types of paper at 5%. It establishes the interest
rate structure for bank deposits and loans as well as the reserve
requirements against deposits.  The current interest rates for saviigs
and time deposits are   7.OcI. reserve requirements are 25% in cash plus
10% in bonda-or cash for.demañd deposits (chécking) and 5% in cash plus
10% in bonds or cash for time deposita.. The Bank can also establish
limits  on advances and rediscounts to private banks.
9.   The Central Bank can borrow from international lending institutions,
It would act as fiscal agent for Government and as Administering Agency
for the proposed Project.
Financial Operations
10. The Central Bank allocates its net earning to its capital and to
a Securities Fund. None of its earnings, therefore, flow into the
National Income and Expenditure Budget. Its summbry financial
aecount f<P  1968 is sho-m in Tible 3.

C. Private Commercial Banks
U. The Honduran econony is cormpetitively serviced by nine private
commercial banks. Ranked in size according to total resources, they aro:
(i)       Banco Atlantida, an affiliate of Chase Manhattan Bank;
(ii)      Banco de Honduras, an affiliáte of First National City Bank;
(iii)     Banco de El Ahorro Hondureno;
(iv)      Banco de Londres y Montreal;
(v)       Bank of America;
(vi)      Banco c'!Capitalizador Hondurena (BAfNCAHBA)
(vii)     Banco de Los Trabajadores;
(viii)    Banco de Comercio;  and
(ix)      Banco de Occidente.
Banco Atlantida holds about 45% of total resources and .deposits in the
conmercial banking system. See Table 4 for consolidated balance sheeta
of the six principal private commercial banks.  The banks generally are
becoming increasingly aware of the need to broaden their agricultural
credit services, particularly in the field of medium to long-term credit
for agricultural development. The investnent of capital and management,
in some of the banks, from external sources (mainly the United States) is
stimulating changes in loan policies from traditional short-term lending,
largely for trade and commercial purposes, to more emphasis on development
lending. Such policies fit into an appropriate credit mechanism suitable
for carrying out the Lending Program of the Project. The banking system
covers the entire country with an extensive network of main offices,
branches and agencies which adequately would service the Project area.
The first five banks listed aboye expressed an interest in the Project, and
it is anticipated that three or four of them would participate. The others
(except Banco de Occidente which is connected with Banco de Ahorro
Hondurena) are small banks providing services outside of agriculture.
D. Specialized Institutions
12. Four institutions fall within this category, namely:
(i)       Banco Nacional de Fomento (National Development Bank);
(ii)      Financiera Hondurena;
(iii)     Banco Municipal Autonomo;  and
(iv)      Insituto Nacional de la Vivienda (ILVA).
Only Financiera Hondurena would participate in the Project.  However,
National Development Bank would be a member of the Project Commission
since it is substantially involved in providing agricultural credit, some
of which is for development. The consolidated balance sheets for these
two institutions are also shown in Table 4.
National Development Bank (NDB)
13. NDB was established in 1950 as an autonoraous governmental agency. Its
fundamental purpose is to promoto -development and production in the agricul-
tural and industrial sectors. It has an extensive country-wide system of 20
branch and agency offices. NDB provides 60-65% of total institutional
credit f>r agriculture and considering this importance, the mission reviewed
its organization, policies, lending experience and financial operations.






ANNEZ 3
14. The operations of NDB cover several funetions outside of its credit
and banking activities. It is concerned with the operation of smail
agricultural supply stores;  operates the Government's floor price
progran for purchase of corn, rice, beans and sorghum together with 17
storage and marketing facilities;  operates the country's principal
milk pasteurization plant at San Pedro Sula and a cotton gin;  is
involved in tobacco operations and administers the National Coffee Fund.
By-and-large, these operations have not been profitable. The most
profitable operations have been the San Pedro milk pasteurization plant
and the Coffee Fund. It ia likely that the income from these activities
will be sharply reduced in the future since there is a plan for NDB
to relinquish its interest in the milk plant to private shareholders.
As for the Coffee Fund, about 70-80% of the proceeds are to be used
in the future for a program of agricultural diversification.
15. NDB's credit operations have been weak. It has a serious record
of past-due accounta.  Of its total agricultural loan portfolio
(December 31, 1968) 46% of L42.7 million (US$21.3 million) was either
past-due, temporarily extended, or had been re-written.  Reserves
agaínst doubtful accounts and probable losses were not set-up until
1968, following a special audit review by the Superintendent of Banks
of all loans with respect to age of delinquency, probability of re-
paynment, and collateral value of security. These reserves are now
about 5% of gross loan portfolio but this still n'- bo inicdequate
especially in view of the substantial amount of delinquencies and weak
collection policies.
16. NDB is well capitalized, having about L22 million (US$11 million)
in paid-in capital. This has come principally as interest free grants
from Governnent.  In 1968, LL million (US$2 million) was received and
an equal amount is expected in 1969. Also it has received funds from
US-AID (US$2.0 million) for housing, about US$8.0 million is expected
out of a ne* loan anicuntiíig to US$9.5 mil lion and three
loans have been grantad by the Inter-American9Davel.opment Bank aggrega-
ting US$15.5 million. It is expected that the balance of the third IDB
loan will be disbursed by the end of 1969.
17. The financial operations of NDB reflect continuous annual losses.
Losses during 1965-1968 ranged from about L370,000 (US$185,000) to
Ll million (US$0.5 million) annually. The highest loss was experienced
in 1968 after provision was made for more adequate reserves against
doubtful accounts. (Under proper accounting practices such reserves
should be distributed over previous years rather than charging the full
amount against one year's operationsa) Annual losses have caused NDB
to live on about one-half of the capital contributed by the Government,
which from 1965-1968 totaled L13.2 million (US$6.1 million).
18. NDB would not participate in the Project as one of the partici-
pating banks.  It has several on-going and prospective credit projects,
financed in part by IDB and US-AID.  Although some improvement in its
operations is underway, its credit and financial operations are not
considered to be satisfactory.
