Philippines: Investing in Children's Education                                                               July 1,2002
                       Through the Third Elementary Education Program, the most disadvantaged schools and communities in
                       26 poor provinces received assistance, with the construction of 240 new classrooms and the repair of
                       214 classroom units. Nearly 6 million textbooks and close to 2 million teacher’s manuals in four subject
                       areas — English, Math, Science and Filipinos — have so far been delivered to the target provinces,
                       which also received 200,633 standard school and classroom kits and 26,217 customized kits. A total of
                       2,366 INSET training courses have been conducted involving 89,409 teachers and school
                       administrators. Likewise, the program’s School Improvement Innovation Facility has awarded 823 grants
for projects on improving reading comprehension and the development of indigenous teaching materials. These
accomplishments show a marked improvement in the Philippine government’s capacity to improve learning achievements and
expand access to quality education at the primary level in the public school system.
