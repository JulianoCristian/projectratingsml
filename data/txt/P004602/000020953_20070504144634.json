Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) Visible successes are a key motivator\n            for change; demonstrate results with a few pilots first.\n            School-based management (SBM) was rapidly accepted by all\n            stakeholders, because it was tried and was successful in a\n            few schools on a piece-meal basis first; 2) Information\n            dissemination and capacity building play a significant role\n            in the successful implementation of decentralized systems\n            such as SBM; 3) Local empowerment for planning and\n            implementing locally developed plans, even with small\n            amounts of money, results in greater ownership and\n            transparency; 4) Accountability systems, with clear\n            performance criteria, are critical factors for effective and\n            efficient project implementation; 5) Readily available and\n            targeted technical assistance (for example, for school\n            building program as it was being done) is important in\n            achieving timely and quality outputs; 6) The credibility of\n            the results of any national assessments for students is\n            enhanced when its administration involves independent\n            examiners and monitors; 7) The presence of a legal or policy\n            cover to support new ways of doing business is essential for\n            experimentation; and 8) A focus on identifying problems and\n            seeking solutions as a coherent, collaborative Bank-client\n            team is important for achieving results."}, "docdt": "2007-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
