While the intention of the law was\n            to end a government monopoly and open the textbook industry\n            to competition, the implementation of the law resulted in\n            the protection of a few suppliers of low quality and high\n            priced textbooks. A Bank-financed Third Elementary Education\n            Project had funds available for textbooks - but required\n            competitive bidding procedures. With the support of\n            high-ranking officials from DECS and the department of\n            budget and management, the project team was able to reach\n            agreement with DECS to purchase textbooks through\n            international competitive bidding. A total of 50 million\n            textbooks have been purchased so far under these two Bank\n            financed projects. The Bank is now helping the government\n            formulate a long term textbook policy and plan the\n            distribution, tracking, and use of textbooks in the classroom."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
