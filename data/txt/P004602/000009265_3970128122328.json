To achieve its\n            objective, the project will have a policy and institutional\n            framework (PIF) and two investment components.  The PIF\n            will: a) improve the adequacy, efficiency and equity of\n            sub-sector funding; b) ensure that basic inputs are\n            delivered; c) introduce systems and procedures to\n            decentralize selected education functions and corresponding\n            resources; d) measure the impact of project interventions on\n            cost and learning; and e) provide a framework for handling\n            resettlement issues.  The first investment component is\n            capacity building at the national and regional levels which\n            will: create a national structure for project management and\n            capacity strengthening; build capacities in support of\n            policy and decision making; and build capacities in support\n            of decentralized implementation and effective schools.  The\n            second investment component is educational improvement in 26\n            poor provinces.  This will: a) strengthen capacities in the\n            divisional offices, local government units and other TEEP\n            stakeholders; and b) develop and implement Divisional\n            Elementary Education Development Plans which will improve\n            learning, raise completion rates and expand access."}, "docdt": "1996-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
