The project will\n            finance the following three subcomponents: 1) upgrading of\n            credit risk and borrower arrears information; 2) training in\n            banking; and 3) study for the formulation of a strategy for\n            the second phase of financial sector development. With\n            respect to the private sector institutional and regulatory\n            framework, the project will finance the following: 1)\n            upgrading of the accounting and auditing framework; 2)\n            support to the Chamber of Commerce; 3) strengthening of\n            legal and judiciary framework; and 4) feasibility study of a\n            tax free regime for exporters. In the fishing and mining\n            sectors, the following components will be financed by the\n            project: 1) strengthening of the regulatory and\n            institutional framework of the mining sector; 2) survey of\n            fishing resources, establishment of a monitoring mechanism\n            for fish exports and strengthening of environmental and\n            quality control capabilities."}, "docdt": "1995-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
