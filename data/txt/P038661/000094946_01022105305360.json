In the context of\n            this project, Mauritania has managed to carry out the\n            modernization of its business law without any conflict with\n            the Islamic law thanks to the involvement of the traditional\n            magistrates in the process of law preparation. b)\n            Coordination is not a substitute for selectivity in project\n            design. While the preparation of the project took into\n            consideration lessons learned from previous operations and\n            put in place sound coordination mechanisms, the large number\n            of components and institutions involved in this project\n            entailed complexity and supervision difficulties. It would\n            have been helpful to limit the number of executing agencies\n            to facilitate project coordination and implementation. c)\n            Institutional change, particularly where capacities are\n            limited, require long-term actions. d) Business incentives\n            should not be reduced to a special tax regime. Experience\n            has demonstrated that the best climate for encouraging\n            private investment implies a stable low-tax, low-subsidy\n            environment which is also free of tax disincentives.\n            Investment codes should not focus on special tax regimes\n            which are difficult to administer, often lead to abuses, and\n            narrow the tax even further."}, "docdt": "2000-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
