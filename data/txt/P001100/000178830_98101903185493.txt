REPORL-T AND RECO;iAEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST FOR
THE SECOND HIG1I-IAY PROJECT
1 e       I submit the follouing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of UTS$20.5
million.  The loan would bear interest at 7¼ percent and be repayable 1975
to 1995 (see Annex I). This loan will finance a substantial part of the
Ivory Coast's program to modernize its highway netwiork.
PART I - HISTURI2AL
20        The Ivory Coast became independent in 1960 and a member of the
Bank in 1963. The first loan to the Tvory Coast uas made in 1968 for a
program of highwray construction, feasibility studies and detailed engi-
neering of selected roads. Since t-hen, five additional loans have been
made, three for the first oil palm and coconut project and one each for
cocoa p;'oduction and education. Two additional loans totalling US$7.0
ri1lion were submitted to the Executive Directors on June 3, 1971 for a
Second Oil Palm ant. Coconut Project. The total of the first siY loans to
the Ivory Coast is US$hI.h4 million (see Annex II).
3.        The first highway loan to the Ivory Coast (542-IVC) for US$5.8
million assisted in financing the construction of the Abengourou-Agnibi-
lakrDu  road (60 km.), supervision of construction, and feasibility studies of
700 Im. of roads to be followed by detailed engineering of 500 km. if
justified.  The Abengourou road connects the north-eastern section of the
country with the port of Abidjan and is a maui road link with Ghana.  The
start of construction was delayed almost a year because of the Borrower's
slow administrative procedures.  IJork on the road is now nearing completion
and tle performance of the Borrower is satisfactory.
4.        The feasibility studies financed by the first road loan were
carried out in two separate regions: 500 mcn. of roads in the Eastern part
of the country and the Yabayo-Duekoue-Man road in the West.  The Yabayo-
Duekoue-1-lan road (238 km.) twras found to have a satisfactory rate of return
and the detailed engineering of it was, therefore, undertaken and completed.
Lhe roads in the East proved to have a lower return than expected and only
100 km. of these roads were selected for detailed engineering. In March of
this year, the loan was amended with the approval of the Executive Directors
to allow about US$600,000 of surplus funds in it to be used for additional
detailed engineering of roads selected from those studied in Phase II of
the UT'\DP Transport Survey.



- 2 -
5.         The UNDP Transport Survey, for which the Bank is the Executing
Agency, provided in Phase I the financing for an overall study of the
country's transport requirements. It was approved by the Governing
Council of the UNDP at about the same time as the Bank's road loan and
was completed in September 1969. Pha6e I of the Survey concluded that
there were no serious capacity shortages in the transport system. How-
ever, for the future, it recommended a major program of road construction.
Phase II of the Transport Survey which consists of feasibility studies
of 1,100 km. of roads identified in Phase I was started in the spring
of 1970 and is now nearing completion. Also included in the Second Phase
was the detailed engineering of the Bouake-Katiola road, which was found
to have a very high priority. Its construction is included in the present
loan.
6.         Because of the Ivory Coast's creditworthiness and relatively
high per capita GDP, all lending to the Ivory Coast has been on Bank
terms. The sectors which are expected to benefit most from Bank assist-
ance are transport and agriculture because of their importance to the
economy of the country. In fiscal year 1972, it is expected that two
loans, one for a rubber project and the other for road construction and
maintenance, will be submitted to the Executive Directors for their con-
sideration.
7.         As stated above, performance on the first highway project is
satisfactory. Similarly, the oil palm and coconut projects are either
completed or nearing completion. On the other hand, the education and
cocoa projects have barely been started due in large measure to manage-
ment problems on the part of the Borrower.
PART II - COUNTRY BACKGROUND
8.         The latest economic report on the Ivory Coast, "Economic Growth
and Prospects of the Ivory Coast", Vols. I-IV (AW-17a), was distribulted
to the Executive Directors on August 21, 1970. An economic mission,
which visited the country in January-February of this year, is preparing
its report. Its preliminary findings confirm the Ivory Coast's continued
creditworthiness. A Basic Data sheet and map are attached (Annex III).
9.         Economic Situation and Policies - The economy of the Ivory
Coast has grown rapidly in recent years with GDP increasing by about 12
percent per year at current prices and about 7.5 percent in real terms.
By 1970, GDP per capita had risen to US$286. The principal factor in this
rapid growth has been agricultural and forest product exports. However,
due to projected world commodity price declines and limitations on timber
resources, export revenue will in the near future probably grow at a
slower rate. GDP should nevertheless continue to grow at an annual rate
of 5 to 6 percent.



10.        Owing to favorable export prices, the Ivory Coast's balance of
trade showed sizeable surpluses which, together with the inflow of foreign
grants and loans, allowed a substantial increase in net external assets.
By 1973, these amounted to the equivalent of 4 rmonths of imports. On the
other hand, public debt has increased rapidly and the debt service ratio
(8 percent in 1970) is expected to begin a sharp rise unless the Govern-
ment reduces its use of short- and medium-term financing.
11.        The Government is strongly committed to economic and social
development and continues to mobilize domestic resources for this purpose.
Public investment has been rising rapidly. Most of the investment program
appears well justified, particularly investments for agricultural diversi-
fication, regional development, education, and improvements in infrastructure.
In recent years, however, the Government has undertaken large public in-
vestments of lower economic priority, for example, the Kossou dam and the
so-called African Riviera (urban development and tourism). I^th the in-
clusion in the public investment program of such projects, total public
investment could well exceed the financial capacities of the Government,
leading to a rapid increase in external debt.
12.        Through regional development, the Government has attempted to
redress the unequal rate of income development between North and South
and facilitate access to agricultural areas in the South-West. A number
of programs for cotton, sugar, rice, food crop production and cattle
ranching are planned or underway in the northern areas. In the South-
West, the Government will soon begin to implement a program for the
development of cocoa, oil palm, coconut, forest production, rice and
rubber cultivation in the area to be served by the new port of San Pedro.
Both of the project roads will assist the Government in these efforts.
13.        Although most segments of the population have benefited from
economic growth, certain economic and social problems have emerged. For
example, the participation of Ivorians in private sector management and
employment is still quite limited and the level of literacy and skills
is low. Thus, there is a continuing dependency on expatriate managerial
and technical cadres. Uneven distribution of regional income throughout
the country has contributed to the rapid development of Abidjan. Urbani-
zation and urban unemployment are becoming important problems. The large
influx of foreign African labor coupled with the lack of housing and urban
amenities has aggravated the situation. The Government is seeking to
alleviate these problems through larger social investments and a policy
of dialogue with all major groups in the population.
14.        In the future, the Ivory Coast faces the problem of maintaining
a high growth rate and a high level of investment in the face of less
favorable export conditions and the need to choose between competing
investment possibilities. The Bank is discussing with the Government the
policy options involved.  In any event, the high level of investment ne(d-d
to achieve sound growth objectives in the Ivory Coast will require a



- 4 -
substantial inflow7 of public and private capital, as well as the best
efforts of the Government to increase and retain domestic savings in the
country. There are mood prospects for a continued large-scale inflow of
capital on public account from France and the EEC as well as from other
sources. Given sound fiscal management and appropriate resolution of its
investment priorities, the Ivory Coast will remain creditworthy for further
borrowing on appropriate terms, including substantial Bank lending.
15.       Transport Sector - Due -co the wide dispersion of economic
activities and the heavy transport requirements of forestry production,
the contribution of the transport sector to GDP -- about 7 percent
throughout the 1960's -- is fairly high. The road system of the Ivory
Coast comprises about 14,000 km. of all weather roads, 1,300 km. of which
are paved, and about 20,000 km. of unimproved earth tracks.   I]hile this
network provides reasonable access to most parts of the country, it is
insufficient for the increasing demands made on it by the rapid development of
the Ivory Coast. The Government's road investment program calls for im-
proving the links between Abidjan and the principal population concen-
trations in the North, Center and. Jest of the country and opening up the
hinterland of the new port of San Pedro in the South-West. The development
of the country's road infrastructure and improvement of its road mainte-
nance is likely to call for substantial support from the Bank Group.
16.       While roads form the major transport infrastructure of the
country, the main link with the North of the country and Upper Volta is
the railway line between Abidjan and Ouagadou%ou. The railroad is a
single metric gaug-e line 1145 km. in length, which is managed by an
autonomous international agency -- the R6gie du Chemin de Fer Abidjan
Niger. Expansion of the railway system is not planned unless exploi-
tation of the Bangolo iron ore deposits in the Western region should
warrant it.   External commerce is carried out principally through the
modern port of Abidjan which is adequate for current demand. The new
port of San Pedro which will commence operations in late 1971 is expected to
lessen the need for major extensions of the port of Abidjan in the irmme-
diate future.
PART III - THE PROPOSED PROJECT
17.       The project consists of the following principal elements:
a)  construction of the Yabayo-Duekoue-Nlan road (219 km.) and
a branch of this road from Pinhou to Guiglo (19 km.);
b) construction of the Bouake-Katiola road (49 km.),
c) supervision by consultants of works under Parts a and b above!
and,
c) detailed engineering of about 300 km. of roads.



- 5 -
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$35.5 million including
20 percent provided for physical contingencies and price escalation. The
Bank will finance the foreign exchange costs which are estimated at US$20.5
million or 58 percent of total project costs. Direct and indirect taxes
and import duties represent about 25 percent of the construction cosits and will
constitute, therefore, more than half of the local contribution to the cost
of the project. Disbursement under the loan is expected to commence in
mid 1972 and be substantially completed by the end of 1974.
18.       The Directorate General of Public Works in the iiinistry of Public
vlorks and Transport will be responsible for the execution of the project
and will be assisted by consultants. Iioreover, provision is being made in
the project for the training of Ivorian personnel in the supervision of
construction.  All construction under the project will be by contractors
selected through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank,
IDA guidelines. Construction work in the Ivory Coast is largely carried out
by foreign contractors, most of whom have established local branches.
However, the Bank-financed Abengourou-Agnibiiekrou road is being constructed
by a firm which is partially Government owned in a joint venture with an
Israeli firm. The joint venture will probably be in a position to bid on
elements of this project.
19.       The Yabayo-Duekoue-ivian road will provide the timber producing
region of Duekoue and Guiglo with improved access to San Pedro. Forest
production from the Western region, wihich is presently exported through
Abidjan, is expected to shift to San Pedro when the port and the new San
Pedro-Yabayo-Issia road are opened. The Yabayo-Duekoue section will thlen
provide a much improved and 30 km. shorter route to the timber producing
areas of Guiglo and iIan and allow important savings in vehicle operating
costs.  The Duekoue-lan branch of this road serves a populated area which
is of agricultural importance. The Bouake-Katiola roacd is a well travelled
section of the main North-South axis from Abidljan to Jpper Volta and IHali.
The 3C0 km. of detailed engineering provided for in the project wjill be
selected principally from roads found to be of high priority in Phase II
of the UNDP Transport Survey.
20.       The internal economic return has been calculated for both roads
on the basis of savings in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance.
For the Yabayo-Duekoue-;4an road with its branch to Gu-glo, economic
analysis showcs that the three sections analyzed separately would all have
internal economic returns of about 16-17 percent.  Construction of the
Bouake-IKatiola road to paved standards has been estimated to yield an
internal economic return of 26 percent. Both roads have been subjected
to sensitivity analysis and, using rather unfavorable assumptions, both
still provide satisfactory rates of return.



- 6 -
21.        During the preparation of the feasibility study of the Yabayo-
Nan road it was learned that a U.S firm, Pickands-Mather, was in the
process of evaluating iron ore deposits in the region between Duekoue and
Man. The company is presently delimiting its concession. In view of the
large tonnages which may eventually be transported -- 10 million tons per
annum -- the Government has expressed an interest in building a railroad
into the area, which would probably parallel the proposed road and offer
a cheaper means of transport for logs. Discussions with the Government
and Pickands-Mather lead to the conclusion that the mine and the railroad
would. not, even under optimistic assumptions, be functioning before 1977.
Furthermore, the prospection company is studying a pipeline for the trans-
port of the ore. Even if the railroad were built and entered service in
1977, the rate of return on the proposed road would still be not less
than 10 percent.
22.        The consultants recommended that the Bouake-Katiola road be
designed with a roadway of 9 meters and a pavement width of 6 meters.
The Government requested standards of an 11-meter roadway and 7-meter
pavement in accord with guidelines it has adopted for all road construction
in the Ivory Coast. The Government claimed that roads designed to the
lower standards showed a greater incidence of accidents and additional
maintenance costs. After careful review and discussion with the Govern-
ment and the consultants, the Bank agreed to the Government's request to
use the higher standards since the difference in the economic returns for
the two standards was small. The Governmnent also agreed to evaluate the
economic justification of standards for the construction of further roads
on a case-by-case basis.
23.        The Ministry of Public Works and Transport which is responsible
for the road network has been unable to perform fully its regulatory
functions. It has so far failed to assure reliable traffic counts and
has only recently started adequate enforcement of the load limits. More-
over, regulations pertaining to the licensing of public carriers, freight
rates and road user taxes may require further study. The Government has5
therefore, agreed that load limits will be enforced, that a traffic
counting unit will be established in the Directorate of Public Works and
that additional studies on transport regulation and taxation will be under-
taken if required.
24.        To keep pace with the rapid increase in traffic, highway main-
tenance will have to be increased if deterioration of the road network is
to be avoided. Road maintenance is being studied in Phase II of the UNDP
Transport Survey and it is expected that the consultants will recommend
a road maintenance program. The Government has agreed to propose a program
to the Bank for mutual agreement and subsequent implementation. A suit-
able maintenance program would be an appropriate project for future Bank
assistance.



- 7 -
25.        Phase I of the UNDP Transport Survey identified a program of
high priority road construction and road improvements covering about
1,600 km. of primary and secondary roads at a total cost of US$80.0
million. On the basis of the recommendations of Phase I, the Government
has tentatively proposed an investment program for the Five-Year period
1971-1975 of US$76 million for highways -- about 10 percent of the total
public investment budget, which is, however, already being revised up-
ward. The present loan will tie up a large part of the Government's funds
for road construction through the end of the present plan period. Since
continuing Bank assistance for road construction is envisaged, the Govern-
ment has agreed to close consultation with the Bank on its road construction
program.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
26.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Ivory
Coast and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
27.        The Loan Agreement substantially conforms to the pattern of
recent agreements used for highway projects.  As conditiofis of effective-
ness of this Loan, the Borrower is required to employ consultants acceptable
to the Bank for the supervision of construction of the roads included in
the Project, and to employ an engineer in the Department of Public Works
with special responsibility for the execution of the project.
28.        I am satisfied that the proposed Loan for the Second Highway
Project would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
29.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.
