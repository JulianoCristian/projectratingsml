NMEORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR tECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Korea for US$16.4 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be payable in 15 years including 5 years of
grace at the standard variable interest rate and would help finance a
technology advancement project.
2.        Background.  Korea has expe-ienced remarkable economic growth over
the past quarter-century characterized by increasing diversification and
strong export orientation. Rapid industrialization was based initially on
light industrial goods such as textiles, apparel and wood products followed by
a shift to heavy and chemical industries in the 1970s. The industrial
structure has shifted again in the 1980s to give priority to technology
intensive development (electronics, transportation equipment and fine
chemicals) in order to gain continued improvements in labor productivity and
to secure the long-term advantages of technological and innovative capacity.
Underlying these developments has been a strong commitment by the Government
to technology promotion. This has been achieved through the rapid development
of R&D capacity by means of expanding higher education institutions for
training scientists and technologists and the development of national research
institutes--nine of which now exist. At the same time incentives were
provided to the private sector to expand R&D expenditures through tax
incentives, accelerated depreciation etc., with the result that the private
sector now accounts for more than two-thirds of total R&D spending. The
Government has also made a strong commitment to the development of small and
medium industries (SMIs) to play a pivotal role in expanding the industrial
base. An enhanced role for SHIs will reduce industrial concentration and the
reliance of large enterprises on imported parts and materials, improve
regional growth, expand employment and increase exports.
3.        These policy trends help to identify three major areas of critical
importance to Korea's industrial transformation. First, the need to continue
to upgrade R&D if Korea is to retain its competitive edge in export markets;
second, the need to progressively upgrade and restructure skill mix require-
ments to ensure that skills are relevant to the demands of an increasingly
technology-intensive market; and third, the promotion of SMIs as suppliers of
basic materials and parts to larger industrial enterprises and as self-reliant
export industries. The proposed project would assist in achieving the
Government's objectives in all three areas. Underlying these policies, the
Government's strategy under the Sixth Plan (1987-91) is to continue industrial
restructuring towards more technology-intensive manufacturing, especially in
such lead sectors as electronics and machinery. Continued emphasis will be
placed on the expansion of R&D activities with the goal of raising expendi-
tures from 2% of GNP in 1986 to 3% by 1990 and 5% by 2001. Higher technical



- 2 -
education will continue to expand in order to raise the number of scientists
dtd engineers from 13 per 10,000 population in 1986 to 30 per 10,000 by 2001.
The priority for developing SKI& will b- supported by increased financial
assistance and improvement of the technical services provided by the research
institutes in order to raise the quality of products produced by the SMIs.
4.        Rationale  orL BAnk luvolvement.  The Bank has been assisting the
development of technology in Korea over the past decade in a series of
operations.  The Bank inter alia has provided support to SMIs and substantial
assistance in financing risky R&D projects; major assistance has also been
provided for the development of technical and scientific education. Under-
lying these operations has been a continued dialogue between the Bank and
Government which has had an important influence on Korea's industrial
development. The Bank's operations have been consistent with the Government's
priorities and evaluation reports indicate that their objectives have
generally been met successfully. The proposed project continues to support
the Government's priorities by providing further assistance to technological
education and by enhancing the capacity of two R&D institutes to offer tech-
nical advice and services to SNIs. Two education sector loans have addressed
policy issues in education for science and technology and have contributed
significantly to developing a sound policy environment in the sector. The
present project addresses the needs of specific institutions which the
Government has identified as requiring additional quality-improving
investments and which the Bank, with its long experience in education and
technology development in Korea, is well-qualified to provide. Furthermore,
since Bank experience in lending for technology development is relatively
limited, the project offers an opportunity for the Bank to learn lessons from
the Korean experience which can be utilized elsewhere.
s.        Project Objective.  The basic objective of the project is to
continue to reinforce the Government's priority for development in technology-
intensive sectors through assistance to improve the performance of three
national institutions involved in technological education and technical
support services to industry. The project would assist in strengthening
Korea's ability to retain its competitive edge in export markets, contribute
to providing high-level skills which are relevant to an increasingly
technology-intensive market and support the development of SMIs.
6.        Proiect Descriotion.  The project, to be carried out over three and
a half years, would involve acquisition of specialized equipment, to be
financed by the Bank and complementary inputs comprising civil works, and
installation costs, O&M and consumables related to the equipment, to be
financed by the Government. The project would: (a) improve the quality of
teaching and research at the Korea Institute of Technology (KIT) by permitting
greater focus on experimental and practical work and allow senior students to
participate more fully in faculty research programs; (b) enhance the ability
of the Industrial Technology Center (ITC) to provide advice and technical
services to SMIs through strengthening basic R&D capacity and improving
quality testing and inspection services; and (c) strengthen the R&D capacity
of the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) to support the
development of SMIs in the electrical industry as suppliers of parts and



materials to major manufacturers. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$30.0 million es.livalent with a foreign exchange component of US$20.7
million ((A).  The proposed loan of US$16.4 million would finance about 55%
of total project costs net of taxes. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Korea are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7482-KO dated March 1, 1989, is
being distributed separately.
7.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that KIT, ITC and KERI
would each open a special account prior to loan disbursement.
8.        Benefits.  The project would raise the quality of science and
engineering education at KIT. This in turn would raise the quality of inputs
to graduate programs and ultimately benefit technology-intensive industry.
The project would also strengthen the capacity of ITC and KERI to provide
technical advice and services to SMIs which would improve the quality of their
products and result in expanded and more efficient utilization of technical
manpower. The SMIs would serve more effectively as suppliers of components
and materials to large enterprises thus reducing imports. The export capacity
of the SMIs would also be enhanced under the project.
9.        Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the project.
10.       Recommetidation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
