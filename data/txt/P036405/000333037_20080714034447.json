Some lessons learned included: the project\n            design should have considered how to achieve the project\n            development objectives in the most effective way based on\n            realistic water demand projection. More careful\n            justification of the investment size should have been\n            undertaken taking into account the water savings from new\n            technologies and more stringent environmental regulations,\n            and possible policy interventions to prevent the serious\n            over-design in capacity from happening. To improve the\n            effectiveness and sustainability of public service delivery,\n            it is clearly desirable to incorporate elements of cost\n            recovery in the pricing of the utility, though this should\n            be phased in gradually. In the institutional set up the\n            provincial water resources bureau (instead of the Wanjiazhai\n            Yellow River Diversion Project Corporation) should have been\n            put in charge of the institutional reforms as per its\n            mandate stipulated in the National Water Law with strong\n            support and coordination from the Provincial. It is legally\n            responsible and best positioned to lead the proposed\n            institutional, policy and pricing reform, which deals with\n            large scale water resources administration, allocation and\n            strategy issues in the province. It is important to ensure\n            that the hard infrastructure aspects remain coordinated and\n            synchronized with the equally important soft aspects of\n            institutional and pricing reform. This should have been\n            addressed right from the beginning of the implementation to\n            achieve maximized project benefits and long-term impact. An\n            opportunity was missed in the early years, which has led to\n            de-linking of the two aspects and less than satisfactory\n            outcome in institutional reform."}, "docdt": "2007-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
