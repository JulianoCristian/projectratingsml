Specific objectives include: a)\n            reducing water supply infrastructure bottlenecks; b)\n            increasing employment and incomes; reducing the urban\n            distress caused by insufficient and intermittent water\n            supplies; d) environmental improvement by ending the over\n            extraction of groundwater and treating all waste; e)\n            creating a system to rationalize water use and reduce\n            greater shortages and f) promoting integrated management and\n            financial independence for water institutions.  The project\n            will include the following components: a) Yellow River\n            Diversion Project Corporation (YRDPC), providing the\n            physical works needed to transfer water from the yellow\n            River through a system of tunnels, aqueduct pipelines and\n            reservoirs; b) water resources institutional reform; and c)\n            water pollution control and industrial waste management."}, "docdt": "1997-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
