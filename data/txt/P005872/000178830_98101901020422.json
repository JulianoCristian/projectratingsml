Regional Water Supply Project\n            constitutes the first construction stage of a long-term\n            water supply master plan. It seeks to increase the\n            critically short supply of potable water, and meet the peak\n            demand up to 1995, in Seiyun, PDRY's third largest\n            town, and in thirty-nine surrounding villages in the eastern\n            part of Wadi Hadramawt. It provides for the construction of\n            a wellfield and the installation of water distribution\n            networks in the Greater Seiyun area. The project also\n            provides for the carrying out of water supply studies in\n            Aden, the capital city of PDRY, for a second phase project\n            and in other parts of the Wadi Hadramawt, and of sanitation\n            studies in Seiyun. It includes management assistance and\n            staff training of a PWC operating branch in the Wadi\n            Hadramawt and the provision of operational equipment and\n            facilities for the branch office. The project intends to\n            provide substantial health and environmental benefits to the\n            population in the Greater Seiyun area. It presents no\n            special risks."}, "docdt": "1983-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
