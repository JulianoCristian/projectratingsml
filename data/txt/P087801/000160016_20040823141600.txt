           EDTL ­ ELECTRICIDADE DE TIMOR - LESTE

1 - Environmental Impact to replace one Diesel Engine (Mak4), at Comoro Power

Plant.




Justification


Considering the environmental concerns of the projects supported by World Bank, the Timor

government authorities and the sensibility and concernment of EDTL for this maters,

becomes necessary the development of this environmental analysis.

This to assure that eventual impacts in the environment aren't harmful and this project will

provide environmental and economical benefits for the people of East - Timor.

The environmental analysis presented has is incidence in an engine replacement, at the

present moment broken, to occur in Dili at the Comoro power plant.

The replacement corresponds simultaneously to a technological upgrade, since the new

engine to acquire is made with a very recent technology that has a better environmental

performance in several aspects.


The actual production of high speed engines (2004 average) are 1.800.000Kwh/month with

0.27l/Kwh consumption.

If 1.000.000 Kwh can be performed by new engine at 0.22l/Kwh, we save:

       1.000.000x0.05l/Kwh=50.000l/month

The actual diesel price in East Timor is 0.384USD/L, This means that we can save

19.200USD/month, more or less 200.000USD/year




Environmental Assessment


The existing engine corresponds to a Mak 4, installed in 1995 and braked more than two

years ago, that has never been repaired because the enormous costs of the repair.

It's an Mak 8M453C model with a serial number 27187, and has 2,940 kW output with

600rpm speed.




                                                                                         2

To this engine the only environmental performance data that exists, reports to the

installations tests made in 1995, and the parameters appointed were exhaust gas

temperature, fuel oil and lube oil consumption. At the time:

    ·      The maximum temperature registered was 410ºC, but at 75% load the temperature

           was around 350ºC;

    ·      The fuel oil consumption registered was 200,9 g/kWh with a 75% load, to a fuel
           density of 0,8598 g/cm3;
    ·      The lube oil consumption to this engine was 1,15 g/kWh.


The engine to acquire should be similar to the previous model and the technical

characteristics of the new engine must be a technological improvement has showed in next

board.


                 Engine specifications                                   Unit                Value

                 Engine output                                           MW                 2,8 ­ 3,0

                 Speed                                                   Rpm                  600

                 Engine radiation heat                                    kW                  136

                 Fuel oil consumption ( at 75% load)                    g/kWh                 181

                 Lube oil consumption                                   g/kWh                 0,6



The new engine environmental performance must be available with emissions acc. to IMO

(international Marine Organization) and at 75% load, this is the load that EDTL expects the

engine to work, less than has registered in the next board for exhaust gases, emissions and

noise.

The next specifications should be introduced in the tender, has max. levels admitted, and

confirmed with site tests afther installation.

           Obs: World Bank Groups Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook, part III
(1998), emissions limits for plants smaller than 50 MWe, are: Particulate ­ 100mg/Nm3 (or
150 in special circumstances), NOx ­ 2.000mg/Nm3, SO2 ­ 2.000mg/ Nm3.                                 Therefore,

specified emissions levels will be within World Bank standards.




                                                                                                              3

In the present moment, due to the broken engine, there are in working conditions 4 medium

speed diesel engines similar to Mak4 and 8 high speed diesel engines, these ones whit 10%

consumption higher than the medium speed ones.

These high speeds engines presently, work in average 10h/day instead the 4h/day that they

should work, between the 19h - 22h the highest electricity consumption period in Dili and in

the pick load instead of working 3 or 4 units in the present situation it's needed 6 or 7 units.

The medium speed engines work in average 19h/day.

Because the specifications of the tender in progress to the alternative purchase of

Pertaminas fuel are stricter than the present ones, as so less in sulphur contents, the new

engine emission values will also be lower. The previous specifications for sulphur are 1 %,

and new specifications 0.5 %, according next table:

With the installation of a new engine to replace the broken one, there will be several positive

benefits, which repairing the old engine wouldn't offer:


    ·   A lower fuel consumption;

    ·   A lower lube oil consumption;
    ·   Exhaust gases whit a lower temperature and concentration of NOx, particles, CO and
        SO2

    ·   The project objective is to replace only the broken engine and maintain the other

        system parts, this include the reutilization of the ground support by so reducing the

        civil construction works required.




                                                                                              4

Since all the peripheral systems will be maintained there's only need to flush clean them, this

operation is similar to an engine overhaul done for every 12000 work hours, where the oil

spill opportunity is very much less than in normal operation.

The overcoming waste will be directed to the waste oil collection tanks provided by EDTL,

and properly disposed has other waste oil produced during engine operation.

In the present all waste oil produced is stored in proper containers and kept in the power

plant, EDTL is working out to be possible that the oil supplier receives this waste oil in a near

future, or an other company appointed by government authorities.


EDTL will demand that contractor applicants present one environmental management plan

for all the works to be done, always attending to the working conditions and skills existing in

Comoro power plant. One other condition to be presented concerns the existing engine,

since there is in Comoro power plant one equal engine, all pieces in god conditions will be

cleaned, marked and stored as spare parts and the remaining parts must be scraped by the

contractor.


Capacity building and training will be maintained as they are, suffering only refreshment

adaptations to the new engine operational demands.


Conclusions


The new engine is an opportunity to increase the generation in power plant, to prevent some

fault of the other ones, to have the possibility prevent the increasing demand and production

of power with lower costs.

The new engine acquisition brings environmental benefits that the old one repair wouldn't

bring, the repair or installation works aren't very different, the major benefits are given by the

new engine recent technology and her environmental performance.

The new engine and the EDTL new management contract is an opportunity to improve the

existing procedures in the power plan operation, maintenance and environmental

performance.

The new engine meet the Indonesia standards or others specified by WB, and they should

be in the bid document.

The Environment Management Plan needed to be implemented and a monitoring program,

according our possibilities, to assure that the relevants emissions are obtained and

maintained, is necessary. The responsibility for this monitoring is the power plant manager.

2 ­ Compact Fluorescent lamps (CFLs)


The government of EastTimor was decided to install pre-payment meters. The WB have

90.000USD to bye CFLs to distribute at pre-payment consumers, to reduce electricity bills,

as a contribute for this type of payment.

The CFLs use ¼ of electricity of a standard bulb. One family of tree lamps can save

150USD. This to Timor families is very important.

The CFLs have match long life than standard bulbs.

One 15W CFL are equivalent to a 60W incandescent lamp, and reduce CO2, CO, SO2 and

avoid burning 1 barrels of oil.

EDTL intend to have a container in payment shop to receive used CFLs, and with this

example can start to change the people ideas about environment.




3 ­ Materials and parts to distribution lines in Dili


That materials are already listed and all of them are metallic material isolated or not and

ceramic isolators, and can be reutilised or recycle.

Don't any situation related with oil transformers, with or whit out PCBs.

The replaced parts have local market to sell.

This means that this investment don't have environment impact.
