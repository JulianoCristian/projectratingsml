Because the newly\n            acquired engine is made with recent technology is expected\n            to have better environmental performance with respect to\n            exhaust gases, emissions, and noise that conform to World\n            Bank standards. Sulphur content will likely be lower with\n            lower fuel consumption, lower lube oil consumption, exhaust\n            gases will have lower temperatures and concentrations of\n            nitrous oxide particles and carbon dioxide, as well. Since\n            it is only the diesel engine that is being replaced, the\n            other peripheral systems have to be maintained: they will\n            need to be flushed clean, to prevent oil spills. Waste oil\n            will be collected and stored in proper containers in the\n            power plant for now and properly disposed of. Training will\n            be provided in order to help workers adapt to the new\n            engine's operational demands."}, "docdt": "2004-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
