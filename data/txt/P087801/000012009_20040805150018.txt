A.      STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1.      CountryandSector Issues

Country Context

The economy of Timor-Leste i s still recovering from the difficult period following its
independence, In 2002, GDP was approximately $390 million. Given the small population of
750,000, the GNI per capita was $460. The violence and unrest surrounding the country's
independence in 1999 brought destruction of public and private property and of much of the
infrastructure as well as significant disruption to the agricultural and trade cycles. Since then
there has been a slow rebound of the economy. The medium-term outlook i s for gradual growth
andimprovement in social conditions. Large-scale emigration after 1999, particularly of skilled
labor, has left a human resource gap affecting all sectors. The Government's dependence on
donor support i s high as exemplified well by the electricity sector. With aid support decreasing
and low levels of local and foreign investments, the Government is concerned about closing its
financing gap.     I t s options are: reducing expenditure, seeking additional funding agency
financing, borrowing against future income, or a combination of these. Government policy to
date has been to rely on grants rather than loans from donor agencies.

Sector Context

Significant burden of power sector on limited govemment resources. Primary responsibility for
electricity service provision rests with Electricidade de Timor-Leste (EDTL) which has been a
significant burden on government resources since its formation in 1999, despite relatively high
tariffs (20 cents a kilowatt-hour for commercial consumers and 16 cents for government and
other customers-costs     are estimated at about 14 cents). This can be attributed to a combination
of factors:   (a) dependence on diesel generation burning expensive imported fuel; (b) low
generation efficiencies because of excessive reliance on high speed generating plant not designed
for base load duties; (c) low distribution efficiencies because of an ageing distribution network in
the main load center of Dili; (d) inefficiency of energy use by commercial and residential
consumers; (e) low collection rate for delivered energy largely arising from the non-payment
culture that was an unexpected outcome of the initial "free energy policies" of the UN
Transitional Administration. The total installed peak load capacity i s 19MW. Between 1999 and
2003, a total of $42 million was spent on Timor-Leste's power sector, $25million of which was
accounted for by the operating costs of EDTL. Most of the remainder went to rehabilitation of
the power infrastructure. Donors provided direct financing of approximately $14 million, almost
 all of which was for rehabilitation. Donors also contributed about $13 million towards the
 operating deficit of ETDL.

Low Quality of Electricity Service: Until recently, Dili has had 24-hour service while all other
 grids have operated for limited periods each day. But this situation took a turn for the worse in
March 2004 when power supply in Dilibecame erratic because of generation equipment failures
 at Comoro Power Station and distribution problems (generally overloading).              Generation
 capacity has been maintained by using six Norwegian-financed 1MW high-speed diesel units
 designed for peaking service. Continued base-load use of these units i s costly and will shorten



                                                   1

their lives considerably. To conserve fuel, power service in Dili has been reduced to 20 hours
dai1y (4am-midnight)  .

Incomplete rehabilitation of regional systems: While the generating capacity in Dili remained
largely intact during the disturbances surrounding independence, most of the power stations
outside Dili suffered extensive damage. Despite intensive donor supported rehabilitation efforts
(mainly aimed at generation), the operational level of power systems inthe regions remains very
low. Only 45 of the 57 isolated systems in other formerly electrified areas are operational, and
only partially cover originally served areas in most of these systems. Service i s usually limited
to 5-6 hours per day. Completion of the rehabilitation of these systems, if associated with
financial sustainability measures, could create opportunities for productive uses of electricity at
relatively low cost.

Low coverage of access: Accurate data i s not available on the extent of access to electricity in
Timor-Leste. Current estimates suggest that approximately 40,000 households have access to
electricity, implying an electrification ratio of 21percent. EDTL serves 20,000 connections in
Dili which means that the majority of electrified households in Timor-Leste are in Dili. Only
five percent of rural households are electrified (approximately 7,000 households) with the
remaining 13,000 located in other cities and towns.        About 80 percent of the population i s
currently not served with electricity. Many of the centers of population inthe south coast area of
Timor-Leste are widely dispersed andrequire a highcost of connection.

Government Initiatives inthe Electricity Sector

Significant progress has been made in the energy sector since the independence of Timor-Leste.
In addition to the significant rehabilitation effort discussed above, the government has been able
to:

    A. proceed with legal andregulatory development;
    B. develop a Power Sector Development Plan (PSDP) covering a 20 year period;
    C. develop a Sector Investment Plan outlining priority investments for the short and medium
         term;
    D. employ amanagement contractor to operate EDTL;and
    E. improve collections for electricity bills through the installation of 8,000 pre-payment
         meters among EDTLcustomers inDili (total customers: 20,000).

A.       Legalhegulatory development: Progress in re-establishing electricity services after the
events of 1999 was hampered by a legal vacuum that was not fully addressed by early
regulations issued by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).
UNTAET therefore established Electricidade de Timor-Leste (EDTL) from the remnants of the
pre-1999 power system and associated staff, placing international personnel in managerial
positions. The UNled intensive efforts to restore the power system. It was not until June 2001
that EDTL's relationship to the East Timor Public Administration (ETPA) was legally defined,
 and not until August 2001-immediately       prior to the end of the UNadministration-that   EDTL
gained the right to charge Dili consumers for electricity. This right was extended to customers in
the districts only in February 2003. The ETPA's Ministry of Transport, Communication, and



                                                   2

Public Works (MTCPW) administers the power sector. The Basic Law for the National Power
System, enacted inMay 2003, defines the role of the Government in the power system, delegates
most of its tasks to a regulatory authority, and favors outsourcing of electricity services to the
private sector. Draft decrees for the establishment of a regulatory authority awaits Government
approval. The Government has decided that the draft decree for the corporatization of EDTL
will remain in suspension until the end of the EDTL's current management contract (March
2007).

B.      Power Sector Development Plan (PSDP):          Following the approval of an Electricity
Sector Policy Paper in September 2002, a Power Sector Development Plan for Timor-Leste
covering a 20-year development period was prepared in 2003 under the direction of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB). The study establishes the basis for future development of the power
sector including generation, transmission, distribution and electrification, and additionally
discusses institutional and policy issues. The PSDP includes plans, cost estimates and economic
analyses for various scenarios.

C.      Sector Investment Plan (SIP): In the context of the PSDP, the Ministry of Transport,
Communication and Public Works released a Power Sector Investment Plan: Priorities and
Proposed Sector Znvestment Program in Novemberhlecember 2003 (updated March 2004) with
input from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The power SIP identifies the
following short-term investments as priorities for the power system:

    (a) improvement of fuel oil procurement for EDTL;
    (b) construction of an oil pipeline from the wharf to Comoro Power Station (oil is currently
        transported b y trucks over a 2-3 kmdistance at an annual cost of $370,000);
    (c) supplement to generation capacity at Comoro Power Station;
    (d) reinforcement andreliability improvement of Dilidistribution system;
    (e) energy efficient lamp/light bulbreplacement program; and
    (f) districthub-district rehabilitation program.

The Environment and Natural Resources SIP also includes small power plants associated with
demonstration oil well rehabilitation and gas seep harvesting projects. Studies to provide the
foundations for medium- and long-term investments were also identified (listed in Annex 1)
including strategic studies to guide further legal/regulatory development and develop a rural
electrification framework for Timor-Leste. These two studies are respectively being financed by
trust-funded programs administered by the World Bank: the Public-Private Infrastructure
Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme
(ESMAP).

D.      Management Contractorfor EDTL: As part of the Electricity Sector Policy approved in
September 2002, the Government decided to outsource the management of all of EDTL's
operations to C E M of Macao, an internationally recognized utility management company, under
a management contract for a period o f three years. The CEM Team Leader i s designated the
Managing Director of EDTL and other members of the C E M team are designated to executive
positions including Director Technical. CEMcommenced the contract on March 1,2004, and has
begun to implement urgent measures to improve the overall technical and financial performance


                                                  3

of the utility (see Annex 6) and to provide systematic training to the local staff. There i s a strong
emphasis on training in the contract in which fixed fees are related only to training and variables
fees related to the management contractor's ability to improve EDTLperformance.

E.      Prepayment meters:        After a difficult start in 2003, EDTL has been able to make
considerable progress with pre-payment metering. By end-April, 2004, some 8,000 meters had
been installed (out of 10,000 meters available), and installation i s expected to continue since
Norway has agreed to finance 17,000 additional meters. It i s hoped that the overall meter
installation program will be completed early in 2005.         Residential power consumption in the
connected areas i s dropping noticeably, and overloading of electricity feeders i s abating as a
result of the installation program and more frugal use of electricity. It i s planned to provide
Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) under a lamp/light bulb replacement program primarily to
the prepayment meter recipients as a further incentive.

Donor Support

The Government has been seeking complementary contributions from international and bi-lateral
donors to fund the most urgent short-term priorities. The short-term priorities listedin the power
SIP are being addressed as follows (Annex 1provides further details):

    (a) improvement of fuel procurement: the government has launched a pre-qualification
        exercise in preparation for international competitive bidding. Support to this effort i s
        being financed through additional TFET funds under the existing Economic Institutions
        Capacity Buildingproject;
    (b) construction of an oil pipeline from the wharf to Comoro Power Station: decision has
        been deferreduntilthe fuel procurement exercise has proceeded further;
    (c) supplement to base load generation capacity at Comoro Power Station: being addressed
        through a proposed Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) project and engine
        replacement inUnit No. 5 at Comoro Power Station under the proposed project;
    (d) reinforcement and reliability improvement of Dili distribution system: partly being
        handled under JICA project and partly as a component of proposedproject;
    (e) efficient lamp/light bulb replacement program: being addressed through energy efficient
        lamp/light bulb distribution component inproposedproject; and
    (0 districthub-district rehabilitation program: program will commence through transfer of
        some of existing peak load generation plant in Comoro power station to regional centers
        after replacement of Unit No. 5 under the proposed project; the ADB (which assisted in
        initial rehabilitation efforts) plans to finance a study to define the scope of a rehabilitation
        project as part of its project preparation of a rural energy project for Timor-Leste.

Proposed Project: The proposed Power Sector Priority Investments Project responds to Timor-
Leste's urgent need to optimize its utilization of high-cost imported fuel in the power sector and
increase generation, distribution, andend-use efficiency through the following four components:

    (a) replacement of the diesel engine of the 2.8 Mw generation Unit No. 5 at Comoro Power
        Station;
    (b) distribution system rehabilitation inDili;



                                                     4

    (c) distribution of energy efficient compact fluorescent lampdlight bulbs; and
    (d) project audit.

2.      Rationale for Bank Involvement

There i s no Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Timor-Leste and the power SIP i s the guiding
document for World Bank involvement in line with the World Bank-led, donor-supported
Transition Support Program (TSP). IDA i s the trustee of the Trust Fundfor East Timor (TFET),
the multi-donor trust fund that has supported reconstruction and development activities since
early 2000 through projects implemented by Government ministries.

The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank provided extensive input to the SIP and the
Bank's knowledge of the sector i s a key reason for the Government's request for IDA assistance.
The rationale for IDA involvement includes the availability o f in-house energy sector
development expertise, ability to mobilize global experts with field experience, technical support
for project preparation and supervision capacity, and development of linkages with other sources
of expertise and funding. IDA involvement will also help to ensure quality of the proposed
project, while providing necessary project due diligence and other fiduciary responsibilities.

3.      Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes

The Government's vision till 2020, as stated in the May 2002 National Development Plan
(NDP), includes that "people will no longer be isolated because there will be good roads,
transport, electricity and communications in the towns and villages in all the regions o f the
country". Further, the NDP recognizes that "an effective system of infrastructure and services i s
crucial for agricultural productivity and poverty reduction, a determinant of business investment,
instrumental to human development, and the foundation for private sector development", and the
need "to plan for, provide and manage physical infrastructure that i s efficient, cost-effective, and
financially sustainable, and which supports the social and economic development priorities of the
people of Timor-Leste."

This Vision sets the following requirements for the power sector:

    (a) The power sector will create and maintain reliable and affordable power supplies which
        meet the needs o f immediate areas served, to support economic productivity and quality
        of life, throughout Timor-Leste.
    (b) Supplies will be developed to achieve lowest possible costs in the long run, tapping the
        economic potential of indigenous resources to displace costly imported fuels; indigenous
        resources to be developed may include natural gas, hydropower, solar, and others.

Each of the proposed components i s in line with the Government's vision of reliable and
affordable power supplies which displace costly imported fuels.

B.      PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.      LendingInstrument

This project will be on a grantbasis through the TrustFundfor East Timor administeredby IDA.

2.      ProgramObjectiveandPhases N/A       -
3.      ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveandKey Indicators

The project development objective i s the delivery of least-cost, high-quality electricity service
with minimumdependence on the government's budget. This objective will be achieved through
improvements in EDTL's generation capacity, generation and distribution efficiency, and
through savings achieved by reduction in demand with the use of energy efficient lampdlight
bulbs.

The key indicators of progress on this development objective are: system reliability, generation
and distribution efficiency, and reduction in Government subsidy to EDTL.

4.      ProjectComponents

    (i) Replacement of engine at Unit No. 5 at Comoro Power Station. The objective i s to
        enhance base load generation capacity and reduce fuel costs by replacing the unit engine
        by a new 2.8 MW unit at Comoro power station. The estimated cost i s $1.0 million.
    (ii)Distribution system rehabilitation in Dili. The objective i s to improve service quality and
        reduce losses through reinforcement andrehabilitation of the Dili system. The estimated
        cost i s $298,000.
    (iii) Distribution of energy efJicient lampsnight bulbs. The objective i s to achieve reductions
        infuel costs incurred by EDTLthrough greater efficiency inenergy end-use for lighting.
        The estimated cost i s $90,000.
    (iv) Project audit. Two project audits will be conducted to confirm that project resources
        have been used for eligible project activities. The estimated cost i s $2,000.

5.      LessonsLearnedand Reflectedinthe ProjectDesign

Experience in the preparation of the TFET Petroleum Technical Assistance project, SIPS and
other IDA projects and lessons learned from projects and studies financed by JICA and the
Norwegian Development Agency (NORAD) (see Annex 2) underscore the importance of the
following as the key factors to the success of the project:

    a. Full commitment from the Recipient counterpart: the Government has led the
        development of the power SIP (which includes each proposed component) and i s fully
        committed to implementing reductions in its fuel costs. The decision for the allocation of
         surplus TFET funds for the five SIP short-term priorities was fully supported by relevant
        ministries and ultimately made by the Prime Minister.




                                                  6

    b. Need for high-quality international consultant expertise: The management contractor,
       C E M of Macao, an internationally recognized utility management company, will take
       direct responsibility for this project. C E M has experienced international staff backed up
       by home office expertise inMacao.

6.     Alternatives Considered and Reasonsfor Rejection

The basis o f power sector planning in Timor-Leste i s the Power Sector Development Plan
(PSDP) for Timor-Leste covering a 20-year development period prepared at a cost of $400,000
under the direction of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in mid-2003. The PSDP includes
plans, cost estimates and economic analysis for various scenarios while considering alternative
options. The PSDP establishes the basis for future development of the power sector including
generation, transmission, distribution and electrification, and additionally discusses institutional
and policy issues.     The proposed project components are included in the Power Sector
Investment Plan (SIP) which i s based on the foundation laid by the PSDP.

C.      IMPLEMENTATION

1.      Partnership Arrangements N/A  -
2.      Institutionaland Implementation Arrangements

EDTL will be the implementing agency responsible for the preparation and implementation of
the project. The procurement work will be carried out under the direct supervision of CEM's
expatriate staff who have carried out similar assignments over the years. The Unit no. 5 engine
replacement and audit will be carried out under the supervision o f EDTL's Managing Director.
EDTL'sDirector Technical will supervise the contract for energy efficient lampdlight bulbs and
distribution rehabilitation. The Treasury will designate a staff member experienced in Bank-
financed procurement to buttress C E M staff`s capacity to execute these activities.

3.      Monitoring and Evaluationof OutcomesResults

ETDLwill be responsible and has the capacity for the collection of data associated with project
performance indicators, as part o f its responsibility for project implementation. EDTL will
report on the key performance indicators inits monthly report to IDA (see Section 6 below).

4.      Sustainability

As indicated earlier, Government commitment and ownership are clear as the Government's SIP
lists all three components as priority investments.      Annex 6 shows that the mandate of the
management contractor operating EDTL between March 2004 and 2007, includes a substantial
capacity building component. Therefore, the operation and maintenance of the Unit No. 5
engine andthe rehabilitated distribution system i s expected to be carried on sustainably b y EDTL
staff. EDTL's financial situation i s expected to improve significantly over the 2004-2007 period
with CEM's efforts and the completion of the prepayment meter program. The complementarity




                                                  7

between the proposed project components and CEM's mandate as the management contractor i s
expected to boost the sustainability of this project's benefits beyond the project's completion.

5.     Critical Risksand Possible Controversial Aspects

ETDLwill implement the environmental management plan developedduringproject preparation
and deemed satisfactory to IDA. No major risks for IDA are envisaged at this stage.

6.     Grant Conditions and Covenants

EDTL will implement the Environmental Management Plan developed during project
preparation in a manner satisfactory to IDA and will furnish to IDA for its prior approval any
proposed revision to the EMP. EDTL will maintain a stock control system and an inventory
system by which goods procured under the Project are at all times accounted for. EDTL will
furnish, free of charge, no more than three energy efficient light bulbsper customer participating
in EDTL's pre-payment meter program. EDTL will maintain policies and procedures adequate
to enable it to monitor and evaluate, in accordance with the indicators listed in Annex 3, the
implementation of the Project and the achievement of the project's objective. Finally, EDTL
will submit to IDA a quarterly progress report on this project based on the afore-mentioned
monitoring and evaluation policies and procedures as part of the management contractor's
monthly report.

D.     APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.     Economic and FinancialAnalyses

For this project, the economic cost of fuel may be treated as the actual cost since there are no
subsidy or taxes included in the price to EDTL. Similarly, power sales revenues have been
treated as a lower bound proxy for economic benefits. Therefore economic benefit-to-cost (BE)
ratios and IRR's may be treated as equal to the financial ratios.

    (i)   Repairs to Unit No. 5 at Comoro Power Station

          Three options were considered. The replacement of the engine with a new 2.8 MW
          engine will result in a levelized energy cost of 9.lc/kWh (at a 10% discount rate) which
          i s the lowest unit cost compared to the other two options: replacement with a new
          2.1MW engine (9.4c/kWh)          and refurbishment o f the existing 2.8MW engine
          (11.7dkWh).

          The replacement of the engine with a new 2.8MW engine will result in discounted fuel
          cost savings o f $1.136 million and $1.171 million respectively under the scenarios of an
          additional JICA-supported 4MW plant being installed in 2005 or 2006. The benefit-to-
          cost ratios will be 1.591 and 1.626 for these scenarios. The benefits include net power
          sales revenue inregional centers from the transfer of the high-speed engines currently in
          use at Comoro to plants in other towns. If the JICA generation project does not come
          online, the proposed project's benefits will be higher.



                                                   8

   (ii) Distribution System Rehabilitation

         This work i s a small part of an ongoing system rehabilitation exercise designed to bring
         the damaged and dilapidated networks to acceptable condition.            Thus it was not
          considered appropriate to carry out a stand-alone economic or financial evaluation for
          this component. It may however, be noted that the benefits of network rehabilitation are
          usually well justified on account of savings in losses and power availability.

    (iii) Energy EfSicientLight Bulb Distribution

          The benefits of energy efficient lampdlight bulbs will be two-fold: to the customer
          (from lower cost resultingfrom the reduced energy usage for the same lumen output of
          the lamp/light bulb) and to Timor-Leste (in fuel cost savings). For the customer, an 11
          Watt lamp/light bulb will provide the equivalent light of a 60 W normal incandescent
          lamp/light bulb. If three bulbs are provided to each household, the simple pay back
          period will be just two months and a benefit to cost ratio of 64.1 (for a 10 year life time
          and 10% interest rate assuming a conservative estimate of 3.5 hours usage for two bulbs
          indoors and 12 hours usage for one bulb outdoors).

For Timor-Leste, the benefits arise from fuel savings which average to about $640,000 per year
for an investment of only $90,000 giving a pay back period of less than 2 months. Limiting the
benefits for a period of only 4 years from end-2005 to end-2009 (at which time the hydro plant at
Ira Lalaro i s expected to be commissioned) will result in a net present value of fuel cost savings
of $1.93 million (at a discount rate of 10%). The benefit to cost ratio i s 22.

2.       Technical

The replacement of the old diesel engine also represents a technological upgrade, since the new
engine will have improved technical performance and better environmental performance in
several aspects.

In the distribution rehabilitation component, equipment to be procured will help to bring the
damaged and dilapidated networks to acceptable condition and, in future, will improve the
effectiveness of the new transformer stations that are to be supplied b y a JICA grant. Although
the JICA grant i s complementary to this component, the component i s not dependent on the work
proposedunder the JICA grant.

The 11W energy efficient fluorescent lampdlight bulbs will provide the equivalent light of a 60
W normal incandescent lamp/light bulb which means reduced energy usage for the same lumen
output.

3.       Fiduciary

Overall financial management o f funds under the proposed project will be the responsibility of
EDTLwith the Treasury of the Government of Timor-Leste providing the necessary support for
(i)processing of applications (ii)  maintaining adequate records and supporting documentation for
expenditures and (iii)  preparation o f periodic summaries of expenditures to be used by EDTLin


                                                   9

their reporting to IDA. EDTL will be responsible for maintaining a stock control system and an
inventory system b y which goods procured under the Project are accounted for at all times.

Implementation: The proposed project will be implemented by EDTL. The Managing Director
of EDTLwill be designated as Project Director.

Disbursement:      The proposed project i s expected to be completed by September 30, 2005.
Disbursement will use traditional disbursement methods: direct payments, reimbursements or
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The documentation supporting disbursements will be
retained by EDTL for at least one year after receipt by IDA o f the audit report for the year in
which the last disbursement was made.

Financial Management: Overall financial management of funds under the proposed project will
be responsibility o f EDTL. EDTL will be responsible for initiating payments to contractors and
ensuring that the goods procured under the project are properly reflected in the inventory and
other systems maintained by EDTL. The Treasury will assign appropriate staff to ensure that
these tasks are carried out ina systematic andtimely manner.

Audit: The Treasury will also be responsible for preparation of annual financial statements of all
project expenditures, and will make the necessary arrangements to have these audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA.

Procurement: The procurement volume under this project is expected to be very limited: three
ICB goods contracts (one of which will be in several lots) totaling $1.33 million, several small
goods contracts, each less than $15,000 and totaling not more than $60,000, and two very small
SSS consulting contracts to carry out audits of project activities. Procurement will be carried out
by EDTL. While CEM personnel have considerable procurement experience, they have little
experience in Bank financed procurement. Therefore, the Government's procurement procedures
will be followed and the Procurement Division (PD), which i s becoming experienced with Bank
Guidelines and SBD through its association with the TFET program, will review and clear all
procurement documents, bid evaluation reports and contract awards prior to submitting to IDA
for No Objection. Under Government rules, the PD reviews and processes all procurements
valued over US$lOO,OOO (including TFET funded) before submitting the documents to the
Contract Committee for review and approval.

4.      Social

No adverse social impact i s anticipated because the project focuses on rehabilitation and
replacement of existing facilities. At Comoro Power Station, the project will replace an existing
 engine. In the Dili distribution system, the project will rehabilitate existing lines improving
 safety.   The replacement of energy efficient light bulbs i s expected to reduce customers'
 electricity bills. Successful implementation of this project will benefit the population of Dili
 with lower cost lighting andmore sustainable power supply.

5.       Environment

The components related to distribution materials and CFL lampdlight bulbs have no adverse
environmental impacts. The component needing particular attention i s the replacement of the
engine of Unit no. 5 at Comoro power station. Precautions have been taken to ensure that this
replacement enhances the environmental performance of the station by using specifications that
conform to the standards adopted by the World Bank Group.                                     Accordingly, suitable
environmental performance standards to be used in the bidding documents have been agreed
with EDTL (see Annex 10). The use of these standards will ensure the procurement of a state-
of-the-art engine which will reduce emission levels of the Comoro power station while
simultaneously reducing fuel consumption. Thus the overall environmental impact of the project
i s expected to be positive.

An Environmental ManagementPlan has been prepared to address minimal impacts duringplant
installation as well as for operations of the entire power station. This plan will, in particular,
address the storage and disposal of waste oils.

                          Annex 1: Country and Sector or Program Background
                         Timor-Leste: Power Sector Priority Investments Project


The Government policies for the development of the power sector center on four broad
principles:

    0     The creation of a legal, regulatory and institutional framework that will support the sound
          development of the power industry over the medium and longer term.
    0     A sustained program of electrification aimed at providing the vast majority of households
          with access to power over the next 20 years.
    0     Development of lower cost, domestic sources of energy that can replace high cost,
          imported diesel.
    0     Enforcement of the principle that customers are expected to pay for the electricity
          services they receive, while recognizing that certain groups of consumers may require
          targeted subsidies.

In alignment with these principles, the Power Sector Investment Plan of the Ministry of
Transport, Communication andPublic Works (March 2004) identifies the following program for
developing Timor-Leste's power sector inthe mediumterm.

       Annex 2: Major Related Projects Financed by the Bank and/or other Agencies
                     Timor-Leste: Power Sector Priority InvestmentsProject


TFET financed:

Economic Institutions Capacity Building. The objective of this project i s to assist in strengthening the
capacity of Timor-Leste in evaluating economic options and designing and implementing economic
policies through the training of relevant East Timorese staff. The project pursues this by training East
Timorese public sector staff working on economic policies and decision-making on basic and advanced
tools of applied economic analysis. Through an amendment, the fuel procurement study (currently at pre-
qualification stage) has been included inthis project with additional TFET funding.

NORADfinanced:

    0    Preparation Studies: Ira Lalaro Hydropower Project.             The feasibility study update is
         currently underway, funded by NORAD. The PSDP report confirmed the necessity of the
         additional geo-technical studies, and recommended update and elaboration of the Environment
         Impact Assessment and also consideration of alternative design schemes for IraLalaro.

    0    Preparation Studies: Baucau Mini Hydropower Plant. An October 2002 W E (Norwegian
         Water Resources and Energy Directorate) mission identified several micro-hydro schemes that
         appear to have good potential. One of them i s at Baucau Town where a 350 kW, 3 GWWyear
         scheme could be developed to utilize water flowing from a spring (after local water supply needs
         have been met). Estimates comparing the cost of diesel generator and a hydropower plant of the
         same size showed that hydropower energy would be less expensive than diesel generation.
         Therefore, a feasibility study supported by NORAD i s underway. The consultant's contract also

    0    Dili Distribution Rehabilitation. Dili distribution system has been restored and in operation
         with adequate 20 kV line capacity for the existing load but further investment i s needed to: (a)
         refurbish substations to reduce technical losses from around 15% at present (due mainly to power
         transformer overload) to the 56% that might be expected for a distribution system of the size and
         topology of the Dili system; and (b) improve reliability and quality of service, through installation
         of some auto-reclosers and other switchgear inthe distribution network.

    0    Comoro Power Plant Generation. (4 MW additional capacity). The Comoro Power Plant has
         four medium-speed and eight high-speed diesel units. One of the medium-speed units i s out of
         service and based on the JICA mission's assessment, not repairable. As a result, the newer high-
         speed units (financed by Norway) are running at high capacity factors, which will accelerate
         degradation of their output, efficiency and lifetime (high-speed diesel engines are normally used
         for standby and short-term operation, not to serve base load). Inaddition, generation efficiencies
         are somewhat lower (fuel consumption for a high-speed unit i s 200-250 g/kWh in comparison to
         approximately 175 g/kWh for a medium speed unit). Therefore, installation of a 4 MW medium-
         speed unit is considered appropriate.

                   Timor-Leste: Power Sector Priority InvestmentsProject


The project consist of four components:

    1. Repairs to Unit no. 5 of Comoro power station consisting of replacement of the existing
       damaged engine with a new one with enhanced operational performance ($1.O million),
    2. Distribution rehabilitation work consisting of replacement of conductors, cross arms,
       insulators etc. ($298,000),
    3. Supply of energy efficient light bulbs to be distributed to customers choosing to join the
       pre-paid meter program ($90,000), and
    4. Conduct of audit of project activities including provision of technical assistance ($2,000).


1.     REPAIRS UNITNO. 5, COMOROPOWER
                  TO                                       STATION

Timor-Leste has a total generation capacity of 19MWbut no transmission grid. Individual cities
which have power supply are supplied by their own plants. Dili, the capital city, has a current
maximum demand of 12 MW which i s supplied by the Comoro power station. The current
available capacity at Comoro consist of 4 medium speed diesel units totaling 7.96 MW and 8
high speed diesel units totaling 7.8 MW. The medium speed units consist of two units of
available capacity 1.8 MW each installed in 1985 (MAK 1 and MAK 2), one unit of available
capacity 2.01 MW installed in 1989 (Nigata) and one unit of available capacity 2.35 MW
installed in 1995 (MAK 3). The fifth plant, the 2.8MW Unit no 5 (MAK 4), i s similar to the
previous units and was also installed in 1995 but has been out of operation following damages to
its crank case since 1999. The current mode of operation i s to run the medium speed units as
base load and to bring in the high speed units for peaking duty as well as for standby purposes
when one or more o f the medium speed units are out of service. A comprehensive study of the
power supply and demand issues over a 20 year horizon has been carried out under the Power
Sector Development Plan for Timor-Leste'.              This report provides the medium and long term
power balances and recommends the installation of two new medium speed diesel units in Dili
(in addition to the repairs to Unit No. 5 at Comoro Power Station), one immediately and the
other in accordance with the demand growth and reserve capacity requirements. Currently there
are discussions in progress between the Government and JICA for the supply o f one diesel unit
which may be able to be in operation in about 2 years.

The lack of adequate firm capacity from the medium speed units result in an operation o f the
highspeed units at a highplant factor with resulting highexpenditure on fuel costs2. Inaddition,
the Government of Timor-Leste intends to transfer a number of the high speed units to other


    A study conducted in2002 by Electrowatt-Ekono under ADB assistance
    The high speed engines consume fuel at the rate of 0.273 IiterskWh compared to 0.256 IkWh for existing
    medium speed units, 0.200 VkWh for the replacement of Unitno. 5 with a new engine, and 0.185 IkWhfor a
    completely new engine of 4 to 6 M W range.



                                                        16

cities to meet the demand in those areas. The most effective method of building sufficient
capacity of the medium speed units at Comoro while achieving optimum fuel savings i s to
undertake a repair of Unit no 5 (MAK 4) by replacing its defective engine while utilizing the
generator and all other plant accessories (all of which are relatively new and used only for a short
period). The increased plant reserve will also allow the transfer of some high speed units to
other locations.

Three alternatives have been considered for the replacementhepair of Unit no. 5: replacement of
the whole engine with a suitable alternative of 2.8MW or with a smaller 2.1MW engine or
replacement of only the damaged engine parts with new, original parts. Key characteristics of
the three alternatives as well as the cost per unit of capacity and energy (discounted up till year
2009) are listed in the table below. In view of the fact that the new hydro plant Ira Lararo could
come into operation in 2010, the benefits of the proposed new plant have been only taken up to
the year 2009. If, however, the Ira Lararo plant i s delayed there will be considerable additional
benefits from the proposedplant.

The winning option i s the replacement of the old engine with a new engine of 2.8 MW capacity.
This will allow the benefits of current technology for engines of this size with better fuel
consumption (approximating a 10-15% efficiency gain). In view of the highfuel costs inTimor-
Leste, substantial fuel cost savings can be achieved with this choice (see cost-benefit table in
annex 9).

The contract for the replacement of the engine at Unit No. 5 (MAK 4) unit by a new 2.8 MW
unitwould include the following:


     0  engineering and design o f the new system;
     0  procurement and installation of a new engine and disposal of the old one;
     0  modification of fuel, air, water andoil systems to accommodate the new engine;
     0  carrying out any maintenance and repairs needed to the generator and switchgear;
     0  operation and maintenance training of EDTL; and
     0  testing of engine (mainly for emissions standards).

2.     DISTRIBUTION      REHABILITATION

The Timor-Leste distribution systems were considerably damaged during the period of violence
leading to the formation of the country. While many of the repairs needed for the distribution
systems were carried out with the assistance of the United Nations Transitional Administration in
East Timor (UNTAET), there i s still some work to be done to bring the systems to acceptable
condition. The main activity in this regard i s the construction of about 50 new transformer
stations which will be carried out under a JICA assistance program (currently being processed).
The present project will supplement this activity by addressing rehabilitation requirements and
needed tools and instruments in selected areas of the Dili distribution network. The activities to
be included under this component are:


    0  necessary connections and low voltage restructuring associated with the installation of
       the new substations;
    0  other repairs and re-conductoring of dilapidated lines of medium (22 kV) and low
        voltage;
    0  repairs to existing transformer stations and supply cubicles; and
    0   tools and instruments for maintenance work.

Material to be secured under the project will include conductors, cross arms, insulators, line
hardware, fuses, LV circuit breakers, tools and instruments including protective gear. EDTL has
prepared a list of required materials which total to a cost of $298,000.


3.      DISTRIBUTION ENERGYEFFICIENTLAMPS/LIGHT BULBS
                         OF

Inview of the fact that fuel costs are extremely high in Timor-Leste, the proposed project will
implement a program to encourage the use of energy efficient light bulbs among consumers.
This project component will distribute 60,000 lampsilight bulbs (up to 3 each to 20,000
consumers) free of charge targeting those EDTL customers who have acquired prepayment
meters. The component i s expected to bringbenefits to the customers of EDTL,reduce the peak
load for EDTL and reduce fuel imports into Timor-Leste. Experience in several developing and
developed countries has shown this type of program to be cost-effective and efficient.

The prepayment meters program i s designed to counter the culture of non-payment of bills which
developed during and after the period of unrest. B y the end of April 2004, about 8,000 pre-paid
meters had been installed (out of 10,000 meters available) under this program, and installation i s
continuing at a rate of about 500 per week. Existing meter stocks will be exhausted b y early
June, and the Norwegian government has now agreed to finance 17,000 additional meters.
Residential power consumption in the connected areas is dropping noticeably, and overloading
 of electricity feeders i s abating as a result of the installation program and more frugal use of
electricity. While the new program to install prepayment meters i s gaining momentum, it i s felt
that distributingthree energy efficient lampdlight bulbs for each consumer who transfers to the
prepayment meter program will enhance the program and result inbetter bill collection.




                                                  18

As the installation of prepayment meters in Dili is ongoing by contracted personnel and EDTL
personnel until the first half of 2005, EDTL has contact with all electricity consumers in Dili.
All customers will regularly approach EDTLto pay their electricity bill, and EDTL will register
them at the same time and distribute the lampdlight bulbs to the customers. EDTL would be
responsible for the tender, purchase, storing and handing out of the lampdlight bulbs to the
customers in a practical, efficient and cost-effective manner. EDTL already has a register of all
customers, and the register i s being updated along with the installation of the prepayment meters.
EDTL has storage facilities in containers guarded night and day.              The customers with
prepayment meters are most likely to use the lampdlight bulbs.

This lamp/light bulb replacement component is intended as a demonstration activity for
increasing awareness about efficient uses of energy in an import-dependent country.

4.     PROJECT    AUDITS

Two project audits will be conducted under the project to confirm that project resources have
been used for eligible project activities. The first audit will be carried out in July-August 2005
while the second will be carried out within 4 months of the project closing date.

                     Timor-Leste: Power Sector Priority Investments Project


The proposed project will be implemented by EDTL which i s currently operating under a
management contract. As part of the Electricity Sector Policy approved in September 2002, the
Government decided to outsource the management of all of EDTL's operations to C E M of
Macao, an internationally recognized utility management company, under a Management
Contract for a period of three years starting March 1, 2004. C E M i s expected to implement
urgent measures to improve the overall technical and financial performance of the utility and to
provide systematic training to the local staff.

There i s a strong emphasis on training in the contract and fixed fees are related only to training.
There are no fixed fees involved for management, and compensation under the management
contract i s related to improved technical and financial performance only. Since the contractor's
performance will be measured against key performance indicators (as set out in the table below),
the terms of the management contract reinforce the contractor's commitment to the objectives of
the proposedproject.

Financial Management: Overall financial management of funds under the proposed project will
be the responsibility of EDTL with the Treasury of the Government of Timor-Leste providing
the necessary support for (i)   processing of applications (ii) maintaining adequate records and
supporting documentation for expenditures and (iii)preparation of periodic summaries of
expenditures to be used by EDTL in their reporting to IDA. EDTL will be responsible for
initiating payments to contractors and ensuring that the goods procured under the project are
properly reflected in the inventory and other systems maintained by EDTL. The financial
arrangements described in this annex were verified and discussed with the Director of the
Treasury and a World Bank Financial Management Specialist. Given the nature of the proposed
project and expenditures involved, these arrangements were assessed as satisfactory and
acceptable. The Treasury will assign appropriate staff to ensure that these tasks are carried out in
a systematic and timely manner.

Disbursement:      The proposed project is expected to be completed by September 30, 2005.
Disbursement will use traditional disbursement methods: direct payments, reimbursements or
Statement of Expenditures (SOE). All other contracts will be made against certified SOE's. The
documentation supporting SOE disbursements will be retained by the Treasury for at least one
year after receipt b y IDA of the audit report for the year in which the last disbursement was
made.

Special Account: To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government may establish a
Special Account denominated in U S dollars under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. If
the Special Account i s established, the authorized allocation for the Special Account will be
US$75,000. The replenishment application should be submitted by the Treasury on a monthly
basis or when the balance of the Special Account i s 20 percent of the initial amount, whichever
comes first. The Special Account will be auditedby independent auditors acceptable to IDA.

Stock and Znventory Control: To ensure that the goods procured for part b) Distribution
rehabilitation and Part c) Distribution of CFL lampdlight bulbs, can be properly accounted for,
EDTLwill maintain systems (inplace prior to the procurement of these goods) which can, to the
 satisfaction of IDA, address the following:

         keep track of the stock of CFL lampdlight bulbs and provide details of any that have
         been issued;
         provide an accurate stock count of un-issued CFL lampdlight bulbs at the end of each
         financial year which will be subject to audit;
         keep track of goods to be used in the rehabilitation o f the distribution system (e.g.,
         through a stock control system with details o f goods received and issued); and
         provide an accurate inventory of goods not yet used in the rehabilitation of the
         distribution system at the end of the fiscal year.




                                                   22

Audit: The Treasury will also be responsible for preparation of annual financial statements of all
project expenditures, and will make the necessary arrangements to have these audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. It will conduct a competitive bidding process to
contract an auditing firm to carry out the FY 05, 06 and 07 audits of CFET- and TFET-funded
projects. The EO1i s expected to be advertised in October 2004. The auditing firm which i s
selected in this process will be awarded an audit contract in May 2005 to conduct the audit for
this proposedproject on a SSS basis.

Funds Flow: The funding sources for the proposed project will come from TFET. The Treasury
will be responsible for requesting disbursement from TFET for agreed project activities. The
disbursement requests will be routed through the designated Government official authorized to
sign applications to withdraw funds from the Grant Account established for the project. Based
on authorized requests to disburse funds, IDA will withdraw andpay funds directly to a supplier
or transfer funds to a Special Account to be managed by the Government. It i s likely that the
majority of project funds will flow from IDA directly to the suppliers.

                            Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
                   Timor-Leste: Power Sector Priority Investments Project


A.     General

1.     Procurement of goods for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with
the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May
2004; and the provisions stipulated in the TFET Grant Agreement.          Provision of consulting
services will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants By World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004. The various items
under different expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be
financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods, the need for pre-qualification,
estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and
IDA in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.

2.     Procurement of Works: The installation and erection works for distribution rehabilitation
will be performed by EDTL's own construction force (or subcontracted by EDTL to qualified
local contractors). N o works will be financed b y the Grant.

3.     Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include: (a) a new
diesel engine for Generating Unit No. 5 of Comoro Power station (supply and installation); (b)
distribution rehabilitation materials including tools and equipment; and (c) energy efficient
lampdlight bulbs.

4.      All packages will be procured through ICB procedures except for some of distribution
materials that will be procured in several lots, each less than $15,000 usingShopping procedures.
The total value of all goods to be procured by Shopping will be limited to $60,000. All ICB
procurement will be done usingthe Bank's latest SBD for procurement of goods.

5.      Procurement of non-consulting services: There will be no non-consulting services to be
procured under the project.

6.      Selection of Consultants: Technical assistance to conduct annual audits of the project
will be procured under the project. The two auditing contracts will be awarded in accordance
with paragraphs 3.9 - 3.13 of the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants By
World Bank Borrowers".

7.Operating Costs: There will be no operating costs to be procured under the project.

 8. Others: N/A




                                                  24

B.      Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement

9.      Procurement activities will be carried out by EDTL which i s currently operating under a
management contract with C E M of Macao. The procurement work will be carried out under the
direct supervision of the management contractor's expatriate staff who have carried out similar
assignments in utility procurement. The ICB contract for the Unit no. 5 engine replacement and
two SSS contracts to conduct audits of project activities will be carried out under the supervision
of EDTL's Managing Director. One ICB contract for energy efficient light bulbs, and one ICB
contract in several lots for distribution materials, shopping for distribution materials, tools and
equipment, will be carried out under the direct supervision o f EDTL's Director Technical.

10.     While C E M personnel have considerable procurement experience, they have little
experience in World Bank-financed procurement. Therefore, the procurement will be followed
by the Government's Procurement Division, which i s becoming experienced with Bank
Guidelines and SBD through its association with the TFET program. Under Government rules,
the Procurement Division reviews and processes all procurements valued at US$lOO,OOO and
over (including TFET funded) before submitting the documents to the Contract Committee for
review and approval.

11.     An assessment of the capacity of the Implementing Agency to implement procurement
actions for the project was carried out by a World Bank procurement specialist on June 17,2004.

12.     The key issue and risk concerning procurement for implementation of the project i s the
lack of procurement capacity of EDTL staff. Since EDTL has employed C E M of Macao as
management contractor, this i s the main corrective measure that will mitigate this risk. EDTL
and C E M will have easy access to the expatriate procurement advisors on other World Bank
fundedmanaged projects. In addition all contracts awarded via ICB and SSS (95% of the value
of the goods and technical assistance to be procured) will be subject to prior review.

13.     The overall project riskfor procurementis average.

C.      Procurement Plan

14.     The Recipient, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation
that provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
Recipient and the Project Team on July 8, 2004, the main elements of which are reproduced
below. The Plan i s available at the office of EDTL, Caicoli Dili. It will also be available in the
project's file and on the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in
agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementationneeds andimprovements in institutional capacity.

D.      Frequency of Procurement Supervision

 15.    Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from WorldBank offices, the
capacity assessment of the Implementing Agency has recommended two supervision missions to
visit the field to carry out post review of procurement actions.

    Two project audits will be conducted (July-August 2005 and during the four (4) months prior to
    project closing on March 31,2006). The Treasury will conduct a competitive bidding processto
    contract an auditing firm to carry out the FY 05,06 and07 audits of CFET- andTFET-funded
    projects. The EO1i s expectedto be advertisedinOctober 2004. The auditing firm which i s

                   Timor-Leste: Power Sector Priority Investments Project



The project has four components:

     1. Repairs to Unitno. 5 (MAK4) of Comoro power station consisting of replacement of the
        existing damaged engine with a new one with enhanced operational performance ($1.0
        million);
    2. Distribution rehabilitation work consisting of replacement of conductors, cross arms,
        insulators etc. ($298,000);
    3. Distribution of energy efficient lampdlight bulbs to customers choosing to join the pre-
        paidmeter program ($90,000); and
    4. Project audit ($2,000).

1.      Repairs to Unit no. 5 at Comoro power station

As shown in the table below, two timelines have been considered for the analysis: first with the
new 4 MW plant to be supplied with JICA assistancecommissioned in July 2005 and the second
with this plant commissioned in July 2006. Under each timeline, the next 4MW diesel plant at
Comoro will be required two years after the JICA-supported 4MW plant. Furthermore, the
benefits are calculated only till the year 2009 since the proposed new hydro plant Ira Lararo
could be commissioned in 2010 at which stage the output requirements from the diesel plants in
Comoro would be substantially reduced. If the JICA generation project does not come online,
the proposedproject's benefits will be higher.

The main benefits o f this project component consist of:

    (a) Fuel savings due to the reduced operation of high-speed diesel engines (which consume
        higher amounts of fuel) with the availability of the Unit No. 5 plant;
    (b) Saving through postponement of the next 4 MW diesel by one year from the currently
        estimated 2007 to 2008; and
    (c) The ability to re-use the high-speed diesel engines in other locations where supply i s
        curtailed due to damages to the engine/generators.

To calculate the benefits of the re-use of the high speed diesel engines at other locations, the
assumptions used are:

    -   Cost of relocation: $50,000 (borne by EDTL in addition to the funding for this proposed
        project)
    -   High-speed plant used well below capacity at 0.5 MW peak, load factor of 22%
        corresponding to an energy generation per year of 963 MWh;
    -   cost of energy sold at 18 US c/kWh (the current sales price incities outside Dili);and
    -   system losses of 10%.

Cost-benefit analysis

A cost-benefit analysis of implementing this project component under each timeline was
conducted. At the current fuel prices ($0.382/liter) and an interest rate of lo%, the discounted
value of fuel savings till 2009 i s $1.136 million and $1.171 million, respectively, under the two
scenarios (incomparison to a cost of $1million).

A summary of the results (at 10% interest rate) i s as follows:

In the above analysis the benefits have been computed at actual costs and thus is worked out in
financial terms. The economic costs of fuel and power sales may be treated as the actual costs
(as there i s little element of subsidy in the prices) and the economic IRR and benefit-to-cost
ratios may be treated as equal to the financial ratios.

2.      Distribution Rehabilitation

This work is a small part of an ongoing system rehabilitation exercise designed to bring the
damaged and dilapidated networks to acceptable condition. Thus it will not be appropriate to
carry out a stand alone economic or financial evaluation for this component. It may however, be
noted that the benefits of network rehabilitation are usually substantially high on account of
savings inlosses andpower availability.

3.      Distributionof EnergyEfficientLampsLight Bulbs

The benefits of energy efficient lampdlight bulbs accrue both to the consumer (reducedpayment
of bills for the same benefits) and to the country (reducedfuel consumption). An 11Watt CFL
lamp/light bulb will provide the equivalent light of a 60 W normal incandescent lamp/light bulb.
If three lampdlight bulbs are provided for each household, the cost will be $4.50 (assuming
$1.50 for each) for an energy saving of 27.9 kWh per month (assuming a conservativeestimate
of 3.5 hours usage indoors for 2 lampdlight bulbs and 12 hours outdoors for the third), This
provides a saving of $4.80 per month to the customer (at an energy rate of $0.14 per kWh, the
current cost inDili). This provides a simple pay back period of about one month and a benefit to
cost ratio of 64:l (for a 10 year life time and 10% interest rate). The IRR will be high for such a
transaction.

The fuel cost saving i s the benefit accrued to the country from the use of CFLs. With a weighted
average fuel consumption of 0.25litres/kWh among EDTL's generation units and a fuel cost of
$0.382/litre, the energy saving of 27.9 kWh per month per householdtranslates into an annual
fuel cost saving of $32 for every set of three lampdlight bulbs given to every household. This
implies a saving of $640,000 per year for the targeted20,000 consumers. Inview of the possible
commissioning of the Ira Lalaro hydro plant in 2010 the benefits from fuel savings are only
computed up to 2009 (Le. a period of 4 years from end 2005). The net present value of these
savings (given the total cost of $90,000 for 60,000 lampdlight bulbs and a 10% discount rate for
4 years) is $1.939million with a simple payback of less than two months. The benefit to cost
ratio is 22.6:1.

                                Annex 10: Safeguard Policy Issues
                    Timor-Leste: Power Sector Priority Investments Project


The only safeguard issues that relate to the project are the environmental issues, particularly
concerning the replacement of the damaged engine at Comoro power station. There are no
adverse social or other impacts concerning other safeguard policies of the World Bank Group.
The environmental impacts and measures to redress these are discussed below with respect to the
following project components:

    1. Repairs to Unit no. 5 of Comoro power station consisting of replacement of the existing
         damaged engine with a new one with enhanced operational performance ($1.O million);
    2. Distribution rehabilitation work consisting of replacement of conductors, cross arms,
         insulators etc. ($298,000); and
    3. Supply of energy efficient lampdlight bulbs to be distributed to customers choosing to
        join the pre-paid meter program ($90,000).


The component with environmental concerns is the replacement of the damaged engine, Unitno.
5 at the Comoro power station with a new engine. This replacement will be undertaken with
stringent care to ensure compliance with the World Bank Group's pollution prevention
standards. The overall impact i s expected to be a substantial reduction o f emissions from the
Comoro power station due to the superior environmental and operational performance from the
state-of-the-art engine to be procured. The improvements will come from two main sources.
Firstly, the replacement engine will meet substantially higher emission standards than the
existing plant; emission standards to be complied with will include NO, less than 1000 mg/Nm3
(compared to World Bank Group standard3of 2000 mg/Nm3for plants less than 50 Mw);SO2
less than 1000 mg/Nm3 (compared to World Bank Group standard of 2000 mg/Nm3); and
particulates less than 100 mg/Nm3 (equal to World Bank Group standard).              Secondly, the
installation of the new engine will result in the reduction of generation from the other plants at
the station resulting in lower overall emissions. Additionally, the improved efficiency of the new
engine (approximately 175 g/kWh compared to 200 and 250 g/kWh for the existing medium
speed and high speed engines) will result in lower fuel consumption at the Comoro power
station.    A further benefit will be the lower lubricating oil consumption which would be
approximately 0.6 g/kWh compared to 1.15 g/kWh for the older plants. Thus the overall impact
of the replacement i s a substantially better environmental performance o f the Comoro power
 station.

         A number of measures will be taken during project implementation and operations to
ensure that the intendedenvironmental benefits are realized and any adverse effects minimized.
Duringinstallation, guidelines will be issuedfor retrieval of usable parts from the old engine and
 disposal of the remaining components. There will be no need for major excavations andconcrete
 work as the existing foundations are to be used for the new engine. The peripheral systems will
 also need only minimal cleaning and flushing as done regularly during engine overhauls. On
 completion of installation work, the plant operational characteristics will be confirmed with site

tests during commissioning to ensure compliance with the specified standards. In addition, an
Environment Management Planhas been developed for the entire Comoro power plant to ensure
that the plant operations and maintenance are carried out to the highest technical standards. In
particular, this plan includes the collection, storage and disposal of waste oil. While EDTL will
implement the Environment Management Plan for the power plant the Management Contractor
will train and guide the staff and ensure that the procedures developed are complied with.

        Components 2 and 3 have little or no environmental concerns. Rehabilitation and repairs
to the distribution system will include replacement and installation of line and transformer
station equipment such as conductors, cross arms, insulators, line hardware, fuses, LV circuit
breakers. There i s no procurement or replacement of transformers. Thus no special procedures
are needed andno environmental impact i s foreseen for this component.

        With respect to the energy efficient lampdlight bulbs, these are to be provided to
consumers for use in their homes as a measure of reducing the system load. There will be no
collection of any incandescent lampdlight bulbs which would be replaced by the CFLs. No
adverse environmental impact i s foreseen for this component. In view o f the fact that the new
CFL lampdlight bulbs will use less than a quarter of the power used by equivalent lumen
capacity incandescent bulbs the program will result in a reduction of generation for EDTL (and
reduction in bills for EDTLcustomers). This will have a beneficial environmental impact due to
reduced fuel consumption andreducedoverall emissions from the power plants.
