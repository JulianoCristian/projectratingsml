This objective\n            will be attained through improvements in the Timor Leste\n            Electricity (EDTL) generation capacity, generation and\n            distribution efficiency, and, through savings achieved\n            through demand reductions in the use of energy efficient\n            lamps and light bulbs. To this end, project components aim:\n            1) to enhance base load generation capacity, and reduce fuel\n            costs, the unit engine at the Comoro Power Station will be\n            replaced with a new 2.8 MW unit; 2). to improve service\n            quality, and reduce losses the distribution system at Dili\n            will be reinforced, and rehabilitated; 3) to achieve\n            reductions in fuel costs incurred by EDTL, the distribution,\n            and installation of efficient lamps and light bulbs should\n            ensure greater efficiency in energy end-use for lighting;\n            and, 4) project management activities will support auditing,\n            procurement, and financial management."}, "docdt": "2004-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
