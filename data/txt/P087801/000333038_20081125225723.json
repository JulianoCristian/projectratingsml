satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            capacity of a power utility management contractor for\n            project implementation may well be limited unless provisions\n            for the management of capital projects are included in its\n            contract. Thus, utility management contracts should include\n            management of foreseen capital projects and capacity\n            building of utility staff in their scope of\n            responsibilities. Timely and professional supervision of the\n            management contract is essential. A recent consultant review\n            of the performance under the first management contract\n            highlighted the failure to monitor the contract properly, as\n            well as the difficult operating environment, as critical\n            reasons for the poor performance overall under the contract.\n            Realistic risk assessment and appropriate implementation\n            arrangements for contingency plans to cover downside risks\n            as cost overruns are essential for ensuring project quality\n            at entry."}, "docdt": "2008-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
