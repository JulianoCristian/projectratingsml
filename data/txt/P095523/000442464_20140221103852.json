Territorial Development Project (TTDP) for Haiti were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            informing and sensitizing beneficiaries, and explaining the\n            project execution strategy, is required if populations are\n            to take full project ownership. Combining road\n            rehabilitation (or other infrastructure improvement) with\n            local investments can improve the impact of the former and\n            stimulate local development. Strong cooperation between\n            development organizations such as the Bank, Agence Francaise\n            de Developpement (AFD), and the European Union (EU) can be a\n            factor of success especially in the context where leadership\n            and donor coordination by the government is weak. As part of\n            project design, the provision of resources to address\n            emergency issues is required in post-conflict and\n            disaster-prone countries. Improved transport conditions in\n            rural areas translate into better access to markets by\n            producers, hence increasing income-generating opportunities;\n            they also translate into improved access to social services\n            (health, education). A work strategy focused on small and\n            medium enterprises (SMEs) for transport infrastructure can\n            act as a catalyst for developing private sector activities\n            and generating employment. Gravel roads can be a sustainable\n            and cost-effective technical solution to improve rural\n            transport infrastructure. Improving road maintenance\n            services in a volatile environment like Haiti which suffered\n            a total collapsing of its national systems in place in the\n            nineties is very challenging and a medium long term issue.\n            Participatory planning and inclusion can ensure better\n            targeting of resources while better responding to community\n            needs. Infrastructure subprojects of the type included in\n            TTDP component two should present an operation and\n            maintenance (O and M) strategy and attendant training program."}, "docdt": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
