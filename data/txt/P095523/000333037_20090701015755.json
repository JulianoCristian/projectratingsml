smallholders to markets,\n            anticipates environmental risks associated with the project\n            and recommends measures to mitigate them. Likely\n            environmental impacts include topsoil erosion, slope\n            instability, road embankment erosion, landslides,\n            degradation of road surfaces, sedimentation from drainage\n            systems, groundwater contamination from construction works,\n            increase in water turbidity, water flow changes, soil\n            compaction and pothole formation, loss of forest cover and\n            its regeneration, dust from traffic, disruption of animal\n            habitats due to traffic and water contamination, risk of\n            traffic accidents, resurgence of sexually transmitted\n            diseases and tuberculosis, limits to access and interference\n            with commercial activities, and modification of the\n            countryside, among others. To ensure the sustainability of\n            the project, the report recommends establishing an\n            information network to ascertain the effect of runoff on the\n            most important river basins and to monitor the hydraulics of\n            the rivers; limiting the use of heavy equipment during set\n            hours; setting speed limits for vehicles; locating works at\n            sufficient distance from residences, health centers, and\n            water sources; reducing dust, getting approval for site\n            locations; restoring the site after construction ends,\n            reforesting the site and replacing vegetation; collecting,\n            transporting and disposing of waste in an approved manner,\n            using stabilizing measures for slopes; reducing the risk of\n            accidents; educating the community about disease spread,\n            particularly sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS;\n            avoiding encroaching on protected areas and critical\n            habitats; taking all precautions to preserve water sources;\n            notifying the community about traffic interruption in\n            advance, sensitizing them about road safety, and using\n            signs; accelerating construction to minimize time needed to\n            disrupt the community; and in general abiding by\n            Haiti's rule on road rehabilitation."}, "docdt": "2009-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
