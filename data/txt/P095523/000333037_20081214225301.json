The changes follow the\n            occurrence of the series of hurricanes and tropical storms\n            that struck Haiti in 2007 and 2008, causing major damages,\n            particularly on transport infrastructure. The Haitian\n            Government and International Development Association (IDA)\n            have identified the Transport and Territorial Development\n            Project as a possible vehicle to channel funds for\n            reconstruction works. The amendments to the projects grant\n            agreement aim at reallocating project resources to these\n            reconstruction activities, by creating a new component\n            entitled 'post natural disasters' reconstruction\n            of selected infrastructure', with a total financing\n            amount of US$8 million. Initial project activities will be\n            kept unchanged. Provided country environment and project\n            performance allow for it, an additional financing will be\n            processed in late FY09 or early FY10 to compensate for this\n            reallocation and allow all initial activities to be\n            financed. This additional financing may also cover any\n            possible increase of the price of road works, following the\n            increased cost of gasoline. If an additional financing\n            cannot be processed, a second restructuring, involving\n            substantial modifications of the initial result framework,\n            will be processed."}, "docdt": "2008-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
