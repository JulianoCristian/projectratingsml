F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

The PDO was to lower the marketing costs for small producers in two selected ‘micro-regions’
comprising 4 to 5 communes in the Northern and South-Eastern departments of Haiti (N.B.:
marketing costs are those costs incurred in the aggregate of functions involved in moving goods
from producer to consumer). Specific Objectives: (i) reduce transport costs in bringing locally-
produced goods to markets and productive inputs from market, (ii) reduce other marketing costs
(e.g., transit losses), and (iii) ensure the sustainability of investments (transport and other basic
infrastructure).
 Key project indicators were: (i) outputs: km of roads improved up to acceptable standards,
 number of spot interventions and emergency maintenance activities, km of roads receiving
 adequate levels of routine maintenance, amount of basic infrastructure investments financed by
 the project, and amount of productive investments identified through the territorial development
 window; (ii) outcomes: decreased transport costs, decreased travel time, decreased transit losses
 and employment generated; and (iii) impact: increased traffic.

 Revised Project Development Objective (as approved by original approving authority)

 Project was restructured in 2008 and benefited from an additional financing (AF) grant in 2009.
 The PDO statement was not revised. Key Performance Indicators were unchanged except for one
 (km of roads improved up to acceptable standards from 80 km to 52 km), following coordination
 with EU that had accepted to finance the remainder of RN3 rehabilitation. One performance
 indicator was added for the new Component 4 (post natural disaster’s reconstruction of selected
 infrastructure).

                 Achieved. The percentage is the arithmetic average between the North and the
Comments
                 SE corridors for the decrease in the transports for goods.
PDO Indicator 2:  Decrease in travel time
Value                     0               -30%                -30%                 -58%

                 Achieved. The percentage is the arithmetic average between the North and the
Comments         SE corridors for the transport of goods and passengers. The target was
                 substantially exceeded.
PDO Indicator 3:  Days per year during which roads are impractical
Value                   >20                <5                   <5                    0
Date achieved       02/08/2008         03/06/2006          11/04/2009           07/30/2013
Comments         Achieved. The two stretches of roads are passable year round.
PDO Indicator 4:  Lower transit costs
Value                     0               -30%                -30%                >-30%
Date achieved       02/08/2008         03/06/2006          11/04/2009           07/30/2013
                 Substantially achieved. The transit costs are highly correlated to the decrease
                 in travel time and the improvement in the quality of transport. For perishable
Comments
                 goods these costs are estimated to have decreased by over 30% (beneficiary
                 survey).

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

    1.1. Context at Appraisal

     (a) Country and Sector Background
1.     General Country Background. For several decades, Haiti struggled to emerge from
cycles of political instability and natural disasters that devastated its economy, weakened state
institutions, exacerbated poor governance and deepened poverty. By 2003, the situation had
become so precarious that external aid dried up, the World Bank closed its office in Haiti and
many other donor agencies withdrew their support. Armed opposition forces entered from the
Dominican Republic to remove President Aristide from power and he left the country on
February 29, 2004. Subsequently, a transitional government was formed, a United Nations peace-
keeping force (MINUSTAH) was deployed to maintain stability, and the Bank reengaged in
Haiti. In addition to political shocks, Haiti is consistently struck by natural disasters, with
devastating effects. In Haiti, 96 percent of the population lives in areas at high risk to multiple
natural hazards (landslide, flood, earthquake). In 2007 and 2008, 5 hurricanes and tropical storms
struck Haiti (Noël, Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike). The magnitude 7.0 earthquake of 2010, caused
over 200,000 deaths and displaced 1.5 million people, caused US$7.9 billion (120% of GDP) in
damages and losses and US$11.3 billion in reconstruction needs.
2.    Agricultural Sector Background. In 2005, before project inception, agriculture played a
dominant role in the Haitian economy, contributing almost 30 percent of GDP (2002 figure) and
accounting for around 50 percent of overall employment, two thirds of employment in rural areas,
and three fourths of employment for the poor. Smallholder agriculture dominated the rural
economy. As the major engine of growth, it had the potential to generate, in the short-to-medium
term, multiplier effects for the rest of the rural economy. The major obstacle to mobilizing this
potential was low rural productivity combined with a high cost of doing business. The Bank’s
2005 Agriculture and Rural Development Review stated that the competitiveness of smallholder
agriculture had declined in previous decades resulting in a cycle of persistent poverty, out-
migration and environmental degradation. It identified the lack of access to markets due to poor
transport conditions, as well as the lack of post-harvest and market infrastructure, as major
reasons for the agricultural decline.
3.    Road Sector Background. At project appraisal, Haiti’s road network was in abysmal
condition, causing very high transport costs and unreliable transport services. This situation was
the result of years of neglect. The collapse of the road maintenance, the reduced level of
investment and the adverse climatic conditions had resulted in a dramatic deterioration of road
assets. According to the 2004 road inventory, only 20 percent of the 3400 km of Haitian roads
was in acceptable (good and average) condition, whilst 80 percent of the network was in bad or
very bad condition. The proportion of roads in acceptable condition had fallen dramatically in the
decade of the 90s since it was estimated at 34 percent in 1991. About 1,100 km of roads had been
taken out from the national road inventory due to their extreme levels of degradation, making
them impassable part of the year.
4.    Disaster Relief and Reconstruction. At the time of appraisal, the Bank had already
embarked on several operations meant to address damages and disruptions caused by hurricanes
and tropical storms, such asa project focused on disaster relief following the Fonds Verrette flash
flood that wiped out half of the city and the Mapou flooding that claimed several thousand lives
in the South East (FY2004). But the Bank had not yet systematically included this kind of
support as part of project design, and no major reallocation of funds from existing operations had


                                                12
been performed to that effect, as was done subsequently following the devastating 2010
earthquake and 2012 Sandy hurricane.
    (b) Rationale for Bank involvement (original project)
5.    Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF). In early 2004, the Transitional Government
(TGOH) led the donor community in preparing an Interim Cooperation Framework. The ICF
sought renewed political and social stability, and economic growth. Its broad strategic themes
were to: (i) strengthen political governance and promote national dialogue; (ii) strengthen
economic governance and contribute to institutional development; (iii) promote economic
recovery; and (iv) improve access to basic services. The Transport and Territorial Development
Project (TTDP) reviewed by this report, was intended to contribute directly pillars (iii) and (iv) of
the ICF. It was expected to create local economic opportunities by facilitating access to markets
and improved livelihoods through better access to basic services such as education and health.
The Project was also intended to contribute indirectly to ICF pillars (i) and (ii) regarding political
and economic governance through sound and transparent management of public resources for
transport infrastructure.
6.      Bank’s IDA Transitional Support Strategy (TSS). In January 2005, the Bank’s Board of
Directors endorsed a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for Haiti, which included up to US$150
million in grant commitments over a two-year period. A key aspect of the TSS was poverty
alleviation through improved access of communities to basic services and infrastructure. The two-
year strategy sought to restore hope by supporting: (i) basic services provision; (ii) job creation;
(iii) rehabilitation of areas devastated by floods in 2004; and (iv) community initiatives in local
development. The TSS was also intended to strengthen governance and institutions, improving
transparency, and promoting inclusion and consensus building on development priorities. TTDP
was closely linked to the TSS as regards: (i) improvement of transport corridors needed to link
rural producers to markets with a focus on two ‘micro-regions’ (Sub-Component 1.1); (ii) spot
interventions and maintenance to ensure all-weather accessibility on selected connecting roads
(Sub-Component 1.2); and (iii) promotion of territorial development and community initiatives
through a participatory planning process to determine development priorities and select local
investments (Component 2: Territorial development window).
7.    TTDP was approved by the Executive Directors on April 11, 2006, and became effective
on December 13, 2006. The project was initially financed through a US$16 million equivalent
IDA grant. It was restructured on December 8, 2008. The restructuring consisted in a reallocation
of grant resources in the amount of US$7.3 million to finance reconstruction works following
hurricanes and tropical storms that struck Haiti in 2007 (Noël) and 2008 (Fay, Gustav, Hannah
and Ike - FGHI). A new component was added, entitled ‘Post natural disasters’ reconstruction of
selected infrastructure’.
    (c) Rationale for Bank Involvement (additional financing)
8.     The additional financing (AF) grant was approved by the Executive Directors on December
8, 2009 and became effective on January 11, 2010. The additional grant was meant to help
finance the costs associated with a financing gap due to: (i) additional activities included as part
of a the project restructuring processed in 2008, in response to reconstruction needs generated by
the 2007 and 2008 hurricanes and tropical storms; and (ii) the cost escalation of the road
rehabilitation works included in the initial project. It is worth noting that the devastating
2007/2008 storms and hurricanes, which were followed by the terrible 2010 earthquake and the
2012 Sandy hurricane, were major external events which stopped regular administrative activities
and diverted the focus of most government services and agencies to short-term disaster relief and
reconstruction efforts. The reason for the cost escalation was due to the realization that the



                                                 13
anticipated traffic on the National Road No. 3 (RN3) in the North justified an upgrade of
standards, and, hence, more costly rehabilitation work to be undertaken by the Project.
9.    At the same time, the financing strategy for RN3 was modified based on the result of close
coordination between the three donors involved (IDA, AFD and EU). The AFD agreed to finance
the technical studies of the Hinche - Saint Raphaël section (45 km), whereas IDA agreed to
finance those of the Saint Raphaël - Carrefour la Mort section (38.7 km). Works and supervision
contracts were to be financed by AFD and EU on the Hinche - Barrière Battant section (75.2 km),
whereas IDA would finance the Barrière Battant - Carrefour la Mort Section (8.5 km).

    1.2. Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to lower the marketing costs for small
producers in the two selected areas (called ‘micro-regions’). The marketing costs were defined as
are those costs incurred in the aggregate of functions involved in moving goods from producer to
consumer. The Specific Objectives were to (i) lower transport costs in bringing locally-produced
goods to market and productive inputs from market; (ii) reduce other marketing costs (e.g., transit
losses); and (iii) ensure the sustainability of investments (transport and other basic infrastructure).
11. The key original project performance indicators retained, as per the PAD Results
Framework, were: (i) outcome indicators: decrease in transport costs and travel time, reduction in
transit losses and increase in employment; and (ii) output indicators: km of roads improved up to
acceptable standards, number of spot interventions and emergency maintenance activities, km of
roads receiving adequate levels of routine maintenance, amount of basic infrastructure
investments financed by the project, and amount of productive investments identified through the
territorial development window.
12. The original project was intended to pilot a territorial development approach in two ‘micro-
regions’. The micro-regions correspond to an economically integrated territory encompassing
four to five communes sharing (i) similar agro-ecological conditions and production potential; (ii)
common economic interests; and (iii) common roads, marketplaces and other basic infrastructure.
The two micro-regions selected according to their rural growth potential and their needs in basic
infrastructure were Dondon-St Raphaël (five communes in the North department) and Thiotte-
Anse à Pitre (four communes in the South-East department). In each micro-region, the project
was to finance (i) key transport improvement investments expected to have a major impact on
rural accessibility and become anchors to promote rural growth (Component 1); and (ii) basic
infrastructure and productive investments prioritized by local stakeholders to generate rural
growth, with a view to capitalize on improved transport conditions (Component 2). If successful
this model was to be replicated in other micro-regions in Haiti.

         and reasons/justification

13. The additional financing did not involve any modification to the Project Development
Objective. The result framework was updated to reflect the incorporation of Component 4 into
the project design. The corresponding result indicator for Component 4 (no. of spot interventions
on transport infrastructure affected by natural disasters) was added to the project results
framework. Two targets were revised: (i) the target for km of roads improved up to acceptable
standards, was revised downward from 82km to 52km to reflect the agreement that the UE would
take responsibility for the stretch of road from Barrière Battant to St. Raphaël (30km) previously
assigned to the Bank; and (ii) the target for spot interventions under Component 1 was revised
downward from 5 to 1, as all spot interventions were passed on to Component 4 as part of the

                                                  14
restructuring, except one (the ‘Pont Limite’ bridge over the Bouhaya river between Dondon and
St. Raphaël).

results, and the revised target that were to guide project implementation following Board approval

    1.4. Main Beneficiaries

15. The initial TTDP project was expected to bring important benefits to the Haitian
population, particularly small producers from the two selected micro-regions, which are highly
dependent of the quality and reliability of the transport system to access local and regional
markets: (i) the micro-region of Dondon-St. Raphaël, which covers five communes in the
Northern department, connected to Cap Haïtien the second biggest city in the country (production
of coffee, vegetables, beans, corn and citrus peels); and (ii) the micro-region of Thiotte-Anse à
Pitre covering four communes in the South-Eastern department, and located along the border with
the Dominican Republic (production of coffee, vegetable, beans, roots, cattle and charcoal); the
Bank-funded CDD project (PRODEP) had a presence in this second micro-region. The most
prominent criteria in reaching the decision concerning the selection of the two micro-regions
were their high agriculture potential and the lack of roads and market infrastructure. Thus,
improved roads and market infrastructure could make a large impact on the local economy of


                                                      15
these areas. Since these micro-regions are characterized by smallholder agriculture, it was
expected that any increased growth would directly benefit many poor households.
16. The additional financing approved by the Executive Directors in response to the 2007 and
2008 hurricane seasons was meant to channel project resources to repair and reinforce selected
infrastructure that were key to ensuring the continuity of the Haitian transport system. The
intended beneficiaries were the populations living close to the spot interventions being financed
under Component 4. These interventions were meant to enable them to preserve their livelihood
base, and access markets and basic social services.

      1.5. Original Components (as approved)

17.    Over a six-year period, the project was expected to finance the following activities:
18. Component 1: Improvement of key transport corridors (US$11.25 million). The
component’s objective was to improve the transport conditions in a sustainable manner in the two
micro-regions, through selected interventions on roads and critical points that are essential to the
rural economy. The project was to finance the cost of the works, related technical and economic
studies and implementation supervision.
19. Sub-Component 1.1: Road improvement and spot interventions (US$10.75 million).
The project was to finance the improvement of key transport infrastructure in each of the selected
micro-regions. Two transport corridors of about 50km each, constituting the ‘backbone’ of the
transport system in each micro region, were identified in consultation with local stakeholders
during project preparation. For each of these transport corridors, the project was to first finance
detailed feasibility and engineering studies to determine the most appropriate technology for the
road rehabilitation works. The scope of these studies was to also include selected spot
interventions to restore or preserve access (e.g., bridges, low water crossings, consolidation of
slopes). These studies were to be contracted by the Project Coordination and Implementation Unit
(UCE) at the Ministry of Public Works (MTPTEC). Once the studies had helped determine the
appropriate technical solutions for road improvement and spot interventions, the Project would
finance the cost of the related works and supervision. It was expected that large road
improvement works would be executed by mid-to-large size firms while spot interventions would
be contracted out to SMEs, or even to micro-enterprises such as those expected to be used for
routine maintenance (see Sub-Component 1.2). Component 1 was to be implemented in close
coordination with the other donors.
20.    The two transport corridors selected were:
      a) Corridor no. 1: Carrefour Lamort - St. Raphaël (38.8 km): This corridor comprised a
         segment of National Road no. 3 (RN3) connecting a number of important local markets
         (e.g., Grand-Rivière, Dondon, Saint Raphaël) to Cap-Haïtien; a number of spot
         interventions had been identified on this corridor; and

      b) Corridor No. 2: Forêt des Pins – Anse à Pitre (60 km): This corridor comprised a
         segment of the Departmental Road no. 102 (RD102) connecting the Thiotte-Anse à Pitre
         micro-region to Port-au-Prince and to an important market located on the Dominican
         border (Pedernales); on the RD102 segment from Thiotte to Forêt des Pins (20 km), the
         preliminary technical assessment performed during project preparation had recommended
         only periodic maintenance works.

21. Sub-Component 1.2: Emergency and routine road maintenance (US$0.5 million). The
total collapse of the road maintenance system in the early 1990s constituted one of the most

                                                 16
critical issues facing road investments in Haiti. Reforms engaged by the Government as well as
the support of donor community had allowed some limited progress in this area, the most notable
being making functional and operational the Road Maintenance Fund (FER) financed by
earmarked taxes (essentially a gasoline tax) in 2003, which was not active . The project intended
to support the reform of the Haitian road management system initiated with FER’s creation.
Specifically, it was intended to ensure that the list of priority roads whose maintenance was
FER’s responsibility was duly established and published on a monthly basis, and that FER would
have corresponding access to all proceeds earmarked for maintenance of these roads. Sub-
Component 1.2’s funding was earmarked only to support road maintenance activities of the road
investments to be financed by the Project. Rather FER was to be strengthened through the
provision of logistical support and training under Component 3 (see below).
22. Component 2: Territorial development window (US$3.0 million). The improvement of
the key transport corridors identified in the micro-regions was meant to become an anchor around
which rural growth initiatives would be developed. In order to facilitate the emergence of such
growth initiatives, a ‘territorial development approach’ was to be pioneered in each micro-region.
This approach aimed at putting in place a process to prioritize and assess growth initiatives (Sub-
component 2.1) that could be financed either by the project (Sub- component 2.2) or by other
donors, or by the Government.
23. Sub-component 2.1: Territorial planning process (US$0.5 million). This sub-
component aimed to support the territorial planning process leading to the identification of
priority investments at the micro-region’s level, including two stages: (i) a broad participatory
consultation in which all local and regional stakeholders were to present investment proposals
consistent with the project development objective; and (ii) a prioritization exercise managed at
the level of each micro-region and performed by an ad hoc territorial planning committee (the
‘Consultation Table-CT’) in which stakeholders would decide and endorse the territorial
development strategy proposed for the region and the list of related investments. The CT is a
forum regrouping all stakeholders involved in planning at regional level, i.e., representatives of
the central government, the local governments (Communes and Communal Sections - CASECs
and ASECs), the civil society and the private sector. The municipal services convene and chair
the CT, and act as its secretariat jointly. This CT process was to be managed by a facilitator hired
and financed under the sub-component. The role of the facilitator was to organize the broad
participatory consultation process, provide technical assistance to the communes and ensure the
implementation of the prioritized sub-projects. This last responsibility included assessing the
technical, economic and financial feasibility of subprojects, contracting the operators that would
implement the related works, and supervising and monitoring implementation and sustainability
of sub-projects financed under this component.
24. Sub-component 2.2: Complementary sub-projects ($2.5 million). The priority
investments (‘sub-projects’) that would emerge from the above territorial planning process were
to be financed up to a total of $2.5 million for the two micro-regions. The facilitator recruited
under the previous sub-component, was to provide the required assistance to complete the sub-
project feasibility studies. The cost of eligible investments were to be between $20,000 and
$100,000, that is, larger than the cost of investments eligible for funding under CDD projects
such as the Bank-funded PRODEP (typically under $20,000). It was envisaged that a few projects
costing over $100,000 would be made eligible for project funding on an exceptional basis, subject
to prior approval by the Bank. In implementing the priority investments, the Project was
expected to work closely with the other donors so as to secure additional funding, including
IADB, the European Union, UNDP (Capacity 21 and/or UNCDF) and the Canadian, German and
Spanish cooperations, as they had acquired experience in territorial planning in Haiti and/or were
active in the two micro-regions.

                                                17
25. Component 3: Project administration and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
(US$1.75 million). This component was to finance expenditures for project administration,
including environmental management and M&E activities. Eligible expenditures included: (i)
staff costs of implementing units; (ii) studies and consultancies; (iii) training activities; and (iv)
acquisition of goods and equipment needed for project implementation (e.g., vehicles, office
equipment, computers). Administrative costs incurred by the main PCU (UCE of MTPTC), and
by BMPAD and FER were to be eligible under this component.

    1.6. Revised Components

26. Component 4, introduced after the 2008 restructuring, was intended to finance a list of
priority reconstruction works, identified by the Haitian Ministry of Public Works, Transport,
Energy and Communication (MTPTEC), with the technical assistance of IDA (see List of
Component 4 reconstruction works in Annex 2).

    1.7. Other significant changes

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation
   2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28. Background analysis. The Bank prepared the project in a period of about eight months
from September 2005 to April 2006. The preparation team focused on the institutional
arrangements and the operational project implementation mechanisms included in the project
manual. The social analysis was based on similar project experience and beneficiary assessments.

                                                      18
The Government carried out an environmental assessment with public consultation. The
preparation team relied on the conclusions of the 2005 Bank-financed Agriculture Sector Review
(ESW) and on the experience gained outside Haiti with similar projects, notably the Peru 2nd
Rural Roads Project (FY2001) for overall project design. For Component 1 the team benefited
from the long-standing Bank experience regarding road rehabilitation and maintenance. For
Component 2 the team capitalized on territorial planning activities that had been undertaken by
other donors notably UNDP, and the French and Canadian cooperation agencies, as regards
planning at communal and regional level.
29. Building on prior experience with similar projects, the project design strategy included the
following features that were deemed crucial in the Haitian context: (i) multi-sector approach: to
be effective the project needed to have a broad multi-sector development perspective and a
corresponding proper mix of investments; (ii) territorial development strategies: given the diverse
agro-ecological conditions of the micro-regions, a spatially differentiated approach was required;
(iii) stakeholder’s involvement: in the absence of a decentralization framework and attendant
institutions designed to reach out to beneficiaries at the grassroots, participatory planning was
deemed required as a means to promote project ownership, particularly for the road works that
would require regular maintenance; and (iv) initial investment as anchor to jumpstart economic
growth: in the context of Haiti where transport conditions were abysmal, such an investment had
to focus road rehabilitation; the intent was not to spread resources too thinly but to squarely focus
on the key roads identified as the major impediment to rural growth.
30. Project objectives and indicators. The PDO to lower marketing costs for small producers
was relevant to further the ICF and TSS goals. It was responsive to the country’s circumstances
and development priorities at that time. PDO indicators concerning the decrease in transport cost
and travel time, as well as the ‘transitability’ (days per year during which the roads are
impractical), were realistic and reachable. They focused on the outcome for which the project
could reasonably be held accountable given its duration, resources, and approach. The indicator
related to lower transit costs (i.e., losses incurred during transport) was well-taken to estimate
project impact, but, as defined, it proved too broad to be accurately measured. It should have
been specified for the given types of goods and products being transported, the composition of
which changed dramatically during the project duration (with more perishables being transported
in particular). Since this indicator overall is highly correlated with travel time and conditions, it
was possible to get a sense of the improvements brought about by the project. But it was difficult
to accurately compare the pre-project and post-project situations. Similarly, the indicator
concerning the increase in overall traffic, as formulated, proved difficult to assess. It should have
been specified for different types of vehicles. Indeed, the indicator did not take into account the
likely change in the composition of the fleet of vehicles using the rehabilitated roads. It so
happened that the fleet using the rehabilitated roads, because of improved road conditions,
changed so dramatically (e.g., preeminence of motorcycles that were quasi-inexistent at project
inception, and replacement of trucks by smaller pick-up trucks and mini buses that were similarly
quasi-inexistent at project inception) that it proved difficult to compare the baseline (2007) and
end-project (2013) situations. Despite the challenges of comparing pre- and post-measurements,
the qualitative data gathered in the context of the beneficiary assessment and the existing high
levels of transit as well as considerably reduced travel times indicate the positive impact of the
project on both cost and overall traffic.
31. Institutional arrangements. The project relied on two implementation units: (i) the
Coordination and Execution Unit (UCE): this unit, located with the MTPTEC, was the primary
implementation unit in charge of overall project coordination as well as the execution of
Component 1; UCE had been created prior to TTDP implementation but had only operated on a
limited scale at project start-up; TTDP contributed to strengthen its capacity; and (ii) PL480

                                                 19
agency (later renamed the Office for the Monetization of Development Aid-BMPAD) in charge
of Component 2: this agency had been created to distribute and monetize in-kind foreign aid (US
aid mostly, and thereafter the Venezuelan Petro-Caribe aid); at the time of project start-up it had
taken responsibility for the Bank-financed CDD PRODEP project and had created a project
management section to that effect; this section relied on other sections for financial, safeguard
and M&E purposes; being newly created the project management section had limited capability at
project start-up.
32. One of the main problems beyond the limited initial capacity of the implementing units, is
that, as TTDP implementation unfolded, they became over-burdened by the management of
several other large projects: (i) UCE came to assume responsibility for several other Bank
projects, dealing with transport infrastructure reconstruction, notably following 2007/2008
hurricanes and the 2010 earthquake; and (ii) BMPAD also experienced a large increase in its
workload, with the development of the Petro-Caribe program and the addition of several projects
(including the Bank-financed PRODEPUR, the equivalent of PRODEP for urban areas). Like
TTDP, some of these large projects, if their focus was not on emergency and disaster-relief in the
first place, were given access to additional resources through the Additional Financing
mechanism to assume this type of activities during their implementation. As a result, UCE’s and
BMPAD’s implementation capacity became stretched as years went by, especially with regard to
financial management and M&E, and their focus became diverted to a significant degree to
disaster-relief and reconstruction activities with negative impact on TTDP implementation as
initially construed.
33. Project design. Lessons learned from generally accepted methodologies for road
rehabilitation and maintenance, as well as territorial planning, were incorporated into project
design. The lessons learned from the Peru experience were particularly useful. They were
customized to Haitian circumstances. The lessons learned through participatory processes under
the funding of other development partners were also heeded. However, although it was based on
robust concepts tested in other contexts, the project design displayed some flaws.
34. For Component 1, the decision to entrust the road engineering studies and work execution
to large firms proved sub-optimal. This decision was predicated on the fact that, at that time, no
SMEs with sufficient capacity and experience were yet in existence in Haiti and it was not
envisioned that they would develop sufficiently during project execution. This resulted in the use
of large firms with attendant cost escalation since their installation for relatively small contracts
in the context of road rehabilitation in the micro-regions proved costly. In reality, SMEs did
develop their capacities sufficiently to undertake road works at par with larger firms. To its credit,
TTDP displayed sufficient flexibility to adjust to the new situation and SMEs were allowed to
participate in project execution along larger firms especially under Component 4. In fact, the use
of SMEs turned out to be a major project benefit. Still with Component 1, another design
weakness proved to be in the underestimation of the time it would take to actually implement
road rehabilitation works. Coordination efforts with other development partners and decisions on
the technical options took much longer than anticipated. This lead to substantial delays of 2 to 3
years compared with the original timetable. Project struggled with the issue of deciding what
would be the better approach to do the road rehabilitation under Component 1 after the GoH
indicated that it has finally no fund to rehabilitate the first section of RN3. It was finally decided
that the northern corridor, being a national road with envisioned large traffic, would be paved to
regular standards for that kind of road. This led to substantial cost escalation. In contrast, it was
decided that south-eastern corridor would remain unpaved. Paving was not justifiable on that
road stretch at the expected low level of traffic even following rehabilitation.
35. For Component 2, the design proved to be robust and well adapted to local circumstances.
The decision to focus on ‘micro regions’ as opposed to communes, as the proper level to take

                                                 20
advantage of synergies and economies of scale, was novel but turned out to be the right level of
intervention. Also novel was the decision to use the ‘Consultation Tables’ (CTs) (ad hoc
committees to support the participatory process and approve subprojects) at both communal and
micro-regional level. Although they were not established under any legal and regulatory
framework, these CTs proved to be useful and efficient bodies, fully integrated into the local
government structure. Also, the delegation of Component 2 field implementation to two
prominent NGOs that would act as service providers with delegation of authority (MDODs) was a
deliberate choice dictated by the weakness of public institutions in Haiti. This proved to be the
right way to go given these circumstances. Finally the decision to limit the size of sub-projects to
US$100,000 due to the limited amount of funding available and the weak implementation
capacity of communes proved contentious because it also limited their scope and impact. This did
not prove a challenge since during implementation the size problem was spontaneously
circumvented by communes, as they joined forces at micro-regional level to implement larger
subprojects.
36. Adequacy of government commitment. GOH authorities fully participated in the project
preparation cycle. Both the MTPTEC, through UCE, and the Ministry of Planning and External
Cooperation (MPCE), through BMPAP, were involved in preparation activities. They had ample
opportunity to provide their views on project design options so that these options would be best
aligned with GOH’s development priorities. This joint preparation process with the Bank resulted
in the two executing agencies having strong ownership of and being fully committed to the
project design, in spite of the fact that the Bank had to assume the lead given the lack of
capacities of these agencies. As project preparation unfolded, the Government took full
ownership of the project as designed, recognizing that it met its development priorities.
37. Risk assessment. The preparation team aptly identified project risks. The project was
qualified as a high risk-high reward project with adequate risk mitigation measures. It turned out
that most of the identified political risks, including social unrest, never materialized. It was
instead natural disasters – duly mentioned in the risk analysis - which disrupted project
implementation. Cost over-runs and delays were also duly identified and did materialize.
38. One particular risk that was flagged forcefully, in relation to the sustainability of the road
investments, was the weak road maintenance system. At the time of project design some limited
progress had been achieved with the creation of the Road Maintenance Fund (FER) and with the
convergence of several initiatives from the donor community. The donors were unanimous in
saying that road maintenance was a huge problem. It represented a major challenge and had to be
tackled systematically. The corresponding risk was rightly flagged as Substantial in the PAD. To
mitigate this risk Sub-Component 1.2 was integrated into the project design to specifically
support the maintenance of the rehabilitated roads with an amount of US$500,000. Also, under
Component 3, funds were earmarked for the strengthening of FER’s operating capacity
Additionally, TTDP implementation was meant as the opportunity to further advance dialogue on
road maintenance. Several covenants were included in the Financing Agreement to that effect
including the obligation to publish the FER’s priority list of roads to be maintained and evidence
that all proceeds from the taxes earmarked for road maintenance would be transferred to FER on
a monthly basis. This was meant to ensure that FER would work according to the rules agreed for
its operation. The dialogue on road maintenance spearheaded by the Bank with both the
Government and the other donors led to substantial results on that front. The road maintenance
list was published regularly on the FER’s website and FER did receive the earmarked resources.
The dialogue also led to the preparation of the National Road Maintenance Strategy in 2009.
This strategy represented a major breakthrough and is a backdrop for the design of new road
operations, including the Bank’s upcoming Center and Artibonite Regional Development Project.
It is unfortunate that the TTDP funds allocated for FER for the maintenance of the roads under

                                                21
Sub-Component 1.2 were earmarked specifically for the roads rehabilitated under TTDP. They
could not be disbursed due to the late completion of the road rehabilitation works. In hindsight,
the design of the project should have permitted flexibility on that matter and the allocation of
funds to road maintenance should have been left open. If not, supervision missions should have
displayed sufficient agility to reallocate the funds to maintenance more broadly as it became
evident that, due to construction delays, the funds would not be utilized for the roads rehabilitated
under the project.
39.     Quality at Entry. No Quality at Entry evaluation was carried out.

      2.2. Implementation
40.     The following factors influenced project implementation.
   a) External factors
41. The following were important external factors that impacted project implementation both
negatively and positively:
      1) Public sector weakness: The weakness of public sector management in Haiti was a long-
         standing issue that was yet to be resolved at the time of project implementation. It has
         not been resolved to date. Public sector institutions largely depend on external assistance
         to carry out their functions. Most projects are managed by ad hoc PCUs similarly
         supported by external assistance. Institutional capacity is with the private and NGO
         service sector paying higher salaries and therefore attracting more qualified staff. In this
         context, the project did not attempt to strengthen core public ministries. It outsourced all
         road works under Component 1 and Component 4, and contracted two international
         NGOs for Component 2 to carry out outreach activities and support to subprojects.
         Outsourcing under Component 4 was made to SMEs and permitted to promote this type
         of firms;
      2) Lack of an adequate legal framework for decentralization: The project entered into
         partnership with municipal governments through its support of the core mechanism of the
         ‘Consultation Table’. Such partnership permitted to successfully carry out the
         participatory planning and implement communal sub-projects under Component 2.
         However, the Consultation Table has remained an ad hoc structure. The lack of the
         Consultation Table as an institutionalized mechanism, although it did not affect project
         implementation per se, constitutes a negative factor for the longer-term sustainability of
         TTDP institutional objectives.
      3) Disruptions and delays caused by the 2007/2008 hurricanes and the 2010 earthquake:
         The four 2007/2008 devastating hurricanes and the terrible 2010 earthquake were major
         external events which stopped regular administrative activities and diverted the focus of
         UCE and BMPAD to short-term disaster relief and reconstruction efforts. The
         earthquake caused government operations to almost completely collapse. Although UCE
         and BMPAD suffered only minor physical damage, they were called to massively
         contribute to disaster-relief and reconstruction activities, with the result that their
         operating capacity grew severely overstretched; and
      4) Donor coordination and strategic alliances: The Bank was able to coordinate very
         successfully and enter into a strategic alliance with EU and AFD regarding the
         rehabilitation of RN3; this constituted a major achievement and prerequisite to going
         ahead since, due to cost escalation, IDA resources were insufficient to cover the
         rehabilitation of the entire stretch of road in the North. Similarly, the Bank devoted
         major efforts to spearhead dialogue with the donor community on road maintenance.
         Finally, one of the MDOD (CECI) in the North was very successful in mobilizing

                                                  22
          additional funding from both the CIDA and USAID for the funding of the micro-regional
          plan by establishing strategic alliances with some of their projects.

      b) Internal factors
42.     The following were important internal factors that influenced project implementation:
      1) UCE and BMPAD implementation capability: Initially, UCE and BMPAD had limited
         exposure and experience with externally-funded projects, particularly Bank projects, and
         were little equipped to handle large complex projects. They had to build their capacity to
         do so. However, as their responsibilities increased during the project implementation
         period, due in part to the dramatic events that unfolded in the context of Haiti, UCE and
         BMPAD became overstretched, and experienced organizational and management issues.
         In addition they experience the following difficulties: (i) UCE had limited understanding
         of its overall project management and coordination functions; this lack of experience,
         coupled with insufficient communication with BMPAD, resulted in the quasi-absence of
         aggregate reporting for the project as a whole; also, whilst UCE had excellent technical
         expertise, it had limited knowledge of the strict fiduciary requirements required under
         Bank projects; and (ii) BMPAD was created to convert in-kind development aid into cash
         for the Treasury; it had little experience initially of the type of operational subprojects
         TTDP was promoting under Component 2, and little understanding of the Project’s
         supervision and monitoring needs; to its credit, it did strengthen rapidly its capability in
         that area through the recruitment of staff specifically dedicated to TTDP; consequently,
         Component 2 management did not suffer excessively;
      2) MDODs’ delivery capacity: Both MDODs were strong entities with long-standing
         experience in Haiti and in TTDP-type subproject design and implementation. The
         MDODs carried out their contracts in a professional and competent manner and achieved
         excellent results under Component 2; and
      3) SMEs’ capacities and cost-effectiveness: The spot improvements required under
         Component 4 were relatively small and scattered over large areas. The only solution to
         execute this type of work in a cost effective manner was to rely on SMEs. TTDP
         achieved that result successfully taking advantage of the fact that the SME sector was
         developing and ready to engage in small contracting jobs.

      2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

43. Design. The monitoring arrangements as described in the PAD were in accordance with
generally acceptable practices. They included the establishment and operation of a Management
Information System (MIS), technical audits, monitoring and evaluation reports. They also made
provision for the following impact evaluation activities under BMPAD’s responsibility: (i) a
baseline survey to set the reference values for the results framework indicators; (ii) a Mid-Tern
Review assessment, including the update of the indicators; and (iii) an end-of-project impact
assessment. The management information system proposed was too ambitious considering the
low capacity in place at design stage and has led to implementation issues.
44. Implementation. The proposed arrangements, however, promised more than UCE and
BMPAD could deliver. Monitoring and evaluation turned out to be a weak subcomponent. UCE
did invest in a MIS but never used it because of internal data transmission problems. A new MIS
system became operational in December 2012, too late to be useful for project monitoring. This
MIS is now used for the Bank’s PROREV, PRUII and PRGRD that continue to be managed by
UCE. BMPAD encountered similar problems. In fact, the monitoring of Component 2 came to

                                                  23
depend almost entirely on data collection and reporting by the MDODs. Moreover, BMPAD did
not have the capacity internally to undertake technical audits of subproject. It neither recruited
technically capable auditors, nor commissioned independent technical audits. Therefore the
technical review of the portfolio was not undertaken systematically. Issues with problem
subprojects were discovered and resolved in a somewhat ad hoc fashion.
45. Baseline survey (2007). A survey was conducted in late 2006 (with report completed in
early 2007) to inform the indicators of the results framework as far as their initial value stood at
project start-up. This survey was not sufficiently thorough in two ways: (i) it did not evaluate the
reference situation in areas outside the project area: therefore the ‘double difference’
methodology could not be used in later surveys since there was no hard data on the initial
reference situation; and (ii) it did not evaluate precisely some of the indicators, particularly the
PDO indicator relating to transit losses. The above deficiencies created shortcomings for the
impact evaluation conducted at project closure (see para 46 below).
46. Mid-Term Review (MTR). The MTR was originally scheduled for mid-2009. This
happened to be the time of the launch of Component 4 following the deadly 2008 hurricanes.
Project attention at the time was diverted from the initial project activities to the new disaster-
related activities. The MTR was therefore rescheduled for beginning 2010 which happened to be
the time of the earthquake. Given the disarray that prevailed at that time, the MTR mission was
simply cancelled. The baseline survey that had been prepared at project inception was not
updated as this had been originally planned, and no special MTR evaluation report was prepared.
In retrospect, the lack of an MTR was not a major problem, since, for the project restructuration
and subsequent preparation of the AF, the project team had to take fully stock and report on
implementation progress. The AF project paper de facto served as the MTR report.
47. Impact evaluation (2013). The project’s ex-post impact evaluation report was of
reasonable quality. The report was prepared within a limited timeframe by independent
consultants, only a few weeks before project closure. The report was based on the survey of a
purposely-selected sample of about 800 respondents and focus group interviews in the project
zone. The survey data was useful to inform the main indicators, but, since no reference group
outside the project zone was surveyed, it did not provide information based on the ‘double
difference’ approach (with vs. without project situation). The report collected most of the basic
data required (traffic volumes with composition of the fleet using the rehabilitated roads, cost of
transportation, travel time, etc.) However, it only collected qualitative data through the focus
groups on transit losses. Collecting hard data on that topic was complex and more time would
have been needed that was not given to the consultants. And no data had been collected as part of
the baseline survey so that comparison with the initial situation would have not been possible.
The additional value of the consultants’ intervention worth mentioning is that it reflected the
impartial opinion of independent experts who visited the field and spent time with the
communities impacted by the project. BMPAD did not organize workshops to discuss the results
of the impact evaluation and draw lessons from project implementation and monitoring.

    2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48. Safeguards. The safeguard policies that applied to the project were Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01), Forests (OP/BP 4.36), Cultural Property (OP 4.11) and
Involuntary Resettlement. The potential adverse impacts from TTDP investments turned out to
be minimal. For Component 1 and 4, the engineering studies regarding the detailed road and spot
interventions paid due attention to environmental and social aspects. For Component 2, BMPAD
with MDOD assistance focused on: (i) upstream screening of all subprojects to weed out those
with potentially more serious environmental impacts, and (ii) awareness-raising with beneficiary

                                                24
populations at communal level. Given the relatively small portfolio of subprojects, BMPAD’s
safeguards team proved capable of aptly following up on safeguard obligations related to
subprojects.
49. Procurement. UCE recruited a procurement specialist at the onset of project
implementation and subsequently complied with all the procurement requirements of the
Operational Manual. The various ex-post procurement reviews did not identify any significant
misprocurement issues. All road contracts were awarded based on competitive bidding, with the
exception of the road stretch from Carrefour La mort and Barrière Battant. For this stretch only
one company submitted a bid. Rather than cancelling the bidding process, it was decided that the
project would negotiate unit prices with the bidder. The contract was awarded after negotiations
over unit costs. The two MDOD contracts were awarded on a competitive basis through a quality
and cost-based selection procedure. The communes were not directly involved in procuring items
and services required for subproject implementation. MDODs were given that responsibility, per
their contractual obligations as operators with delegated responsibility over implementation.
Subproject procurement was achieved through competitive bidding and/or price comparison
procedures (shopping) depending on the thresholds agreed in the Operational Manual. The
MDOD were conversant with Bank procedures and no difficulties were encountered in the
procurement process.
50. Financial Management (FM) and audits. During most of the implementation period
financial management was problematic. UCE did not have strong financial planning and
budgeting skills. Submission of financial audits was often late and action plans addressing audit
conclusions were slow to be developed and implemented. Financial management was corrected as
part of an overall measure designed to strengthen UCE capability in that area. By project end, the
following results showing significant improvement in financial management had been obtained:
(i) financial monitoring and audit reports did not experience significant delays; and (ii)
comprehensive financial reports aggregating both UCE and BMPAD accounts were submitted.
51. Project costs. Total final project cost was about US$27.4 million, i.e., an increase of about
71 percent over the original estimate. This increase is partly explained by the new disaster-relief
activities under the Component 4 following project restructuring, but also by cost escalation for
road rehabilitation work under Component 1. Costs for that component were clearly
underestimated at project appraisal. Similarly, under Component 2, the cost of MDOD assistance
turned out to be 70 percent higher than anticipated because of the cost structure under which
international NGOs operate. The cost escalation was covered by a decrease in sub-project
investments so that the overall cost of Component 2 did not change. The administration,
supervision, and M&E activities, as well as capacity building and technical assistance under
Component 3 were lower than both the original and revised estimates, even though the volume of
activities following project restructuration had greatly increased. This testifies that the Project
was especially cost-effective regarding overall administrative and management activities.

    2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

52. In the absence of specific request by GOH, the Bank decided not to continue the TTDP in
the form of a follow-on project. But a new Bank project – the proposed Center and Artibonite
Regional Development Project (FY14) currently being processed -- is building directly on the
territorial development approach spearheaded by TTDP. Another project -- the Cultural Heritage
and Sustainable Tourism Development Project (FY14) also being processed -- borrows from
TTDP Component 2, as part of its approach to use the major investment in rehabilitation of
historic assets as anchor to promote broader socio-economic development at communal level.
These projects are creating a major vehicle for sustainability of the TTDP concept and long-term

                                                25
Bank engagement with transport and territorial development in Haiti, successfully applying many
of the lessons learned from TTDP.




3. Assessment of Outcomes
   3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

53.     Relevance of PDO. The PDO to lower marketing costs for small producers in the two
selected micro-regions was relevant at project inception and remained relevant at project closure.
Haiti is still a country relying on the rural sector and agricultural production for employment,
growth and poverty alleviation. Hence the need for all measures that can promote rural and
agriculture development. Additionally, better infrastructure at local level can go some way to
mitigating rural to urban migration and avoiding the congestion of large urban centers. In all the
above, the project supported directly or indirectly all four pillars of the TGOH’s ICF.
54. Relevance of Design. The design of the project, based on a customized version of the
Bank’s Peru Rural Roads, has proven to be relevant and robust in the context of Haiti. This
context is characterized by high risks stemming in part from recurrent disasters. TTDP’s approach
focused on the main infrastructure investments (with roads as a priority) and spot interventions
centered on micro-regions, coupled with territorial planning and participatory identification of
local investments. This approach has proven to be relevant for long-term sustainable regional
growth and development, and also to address climate-related risks which are a recurrent feature of
Haiti’s environment. It has provided very positive results reflected in the valuable infrastructure
and spot interventions implemented at micro-regional level, and subprojects implemented at local
level with enhanced community participation, transparency and accountability. The micro-
regional level of intervention proved the right one, allowing to tackle structural transport issues in
alignment with national and regional priorities, and concurrently to address local needs in
participation with the local population. With the post-earthquake reconstruction now almost
completed, the Government’s focus is on medium-to-long term sustainable development. TTDP
provides a valid approach aligned with the current GOH's strategy that consists of providing
planned infrastructure and related ‘structuring’ investments combined with locally identified and
managed socio-economic investments. Concerning local investments, as GOH has still not
published the decentralization decrees, there are de facto no alternative ways to channel resources
to the rural areas than relying on ad hoc Consultation Tables (CTs) or similar type institutions to
work with the communes. This mechanism is a means to elicit participation and ownership, in a
context where communes still do not have the required authority and resources to implement local
investments directly themselves.
55. Implementation strategy. The questionable parts of the implementation strategy has been
the reliance on independent entities -- a PCU (UCE) and an autonomous body (BMPAD) -- as
opposed to line ministries, and on ad hoc mechanisms, such as the Consultation Table (CT).
Additionally, TTDP relied as well on two international NGOs (MDODs) and on private service
providers and contractors for project execution. In the context of Haiti, this approach has proved a
wise course of action given the weakness of both the central administration, and the local
governments in the absence of a decentralization framework. Although there are improvements in
the capacity of central government institutions, the contracting of private and NGO service
providers for project implementation remains relevant. The central Government is insufficiently
organized to implement development programs in rural areas, and municipalities have neither the
authority nor the funding to do so. Project implementation required competitive outsourcing to


                                                 26
both large and medium-scale enterprises, as well as international NGOs. Concerning the
contracting of road works, the following aspects came to be recognized: (i) large enterprises were
interested only by the larger contracts; the project therefore had to resort to SMEs for spot
interventions; it did that with success; and (ii) the contracting of international NGOs proved quite
onerous, as they have to establish offices, employ staff and have significant overheads. Overall
the project’s implementation strategy remains relevant also as a response to the lack of capacity
of both central and local governments. The ‘parallel’ ad hoc project structures were meant to
fulfill immediate needs for the sake of efficiency. They did not prevent TTDP from working hand
in hand with core line ministries in particular MTPTEC, or local governments notably communes
and communal sections. As a result there was good coordination and alignment with public sector
initiatives.
56. On the above basis, the ICR concludes that the PDO, design and implementation were and
remain relevant.

    3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

57. Methodology. The PDO assessment is based on the results of a survey conducted just
before project closure in June 2013. The survey combined interviews of respondents from a
sample of purposely-selected respondents and resource persons (800) and random interviews of
truck drivers at market places (120) during market days, with focus group interviews (12 groups
of 18 respondents each). The survey aimed to collect data on PDO indicators, i.e., transport and
travel costs and travel time, as well as traffic level (this latter being a result indicator for
Component 2). It also aimed at collecting data on the impact of rehabilitated roads on livelihood
conditions, and the overall satisfaction and appreciation of respondents regarding both the road
improvements under Component 1 and the participatory planning and investment selection under
Component 2. The objective was to compare the current data with the data collected as part of the
baseline survey conducted at the beginning of 2007. The survey was administered in the two
micro-regions only. Therefore it did not provide any results on the impact of Component 4 aimed
at spot interventions outside the micro-regions (mostly in the department of the South-East, South
and Grande Anse).
58. PDO Indicators. The impact evaluation concluded that the project impact had been
extremely positive. Transportation costs (PDO Indicator 1) have experienced a dramatic decrease.
In constant 2007 terms, transportation costs have been cut in half on the road segment from
Thiotte and Anse à Pitre for coffee and cereals in the South-East and by 65% for passengers; in
the North the decrease in transportation cost for beans is only 12% between St. Raphaël and Cap
Haïtien and 43% for passengers. The travel time (PDO Indicator 2) on the stretches of road that
were rehabilitated has similarly improved dramatically. The improvement is most remarkable on
the stretch of road from Thiotte to Anse à Pitre (about 40km). Trucks used to take around 6 hours
due to the abysmal condition of the road; they now take 2 hours only or a decrease in travel time
of about two thirds compared with the pre-project situation. In the North the decrease in travel
time is not as dramatic given that only a small stretch of road was rehabilitated (8.5km).
Nevertheless travel time was cut in half between Cap Haïtien (the nearest large city) and Milot.
The two stretches of roads rehabilitated are now passable year round (PDO Indicator 3) when
they were impracticable several weeks yearly prior to rehabilitation. Finally, the qualitative data
that were collected on transit costs (losses) (PDO Indicator 4) as part of the focus meetings and
interviews with resource persons during the impact assessment survey indicate that for perishable
goods (fruits and vegetables produced by small famers) these costs are estimated to have
decreased by over 30% (beneficiary survey). This is not surprising given that the decrease in



                                                27
transit losses is positively correlated with the decrease in travel time and the improvement in the
quality of transport.
59.      Other indicators. A prominent result indicator (Component 1: Result Indicator 5) was
the increased traffic on the roads rehabilitated under the project. Traffic data were collected at
project closure as part of the impact study. However, they could hardly be compared to the pre-
project situation because the composition of the fleet using the stretches of roads rehabilitated had
changed dramatically. Motorbikes had become the prominent means of transport, followed by
light vehicles (pickup trucks and minibuses). Large trucks only accounted for a small fraction of
the traffic, whereas, given road conditions, they accounted for the quasi-totality of the traffic at
the time of the baseline survey (2007). Based on reliable informants interviewed during the
impact study, it is clear, considering overall numbers, that the traffic had increased substantially
in the North and dramatically (several fold) in the SE, especially for motorcycles, way above the
20 percent target set for that indicator.
60. Development Objectives rating was considered by the team as satisfactory for the most part
of project implementation, considering that a convention between the MTPTC and FER was
expected to be prepared and signed timely to perform road maintenance and light spot
interventions following Sandy’s impact on the southern stretch. The convention was prepared but
too late to allow proper execution of the works before the closure on the project. DO rating was
downgraded on the last ISR to reflect this situation.

    3.3. Efficiency

61. The analysis of the efficiency in the use of resources and cost effectiveness is based on the
following core aspects of project implementation: (i) the unit costs of road rehabilitation; (ii) the
administrative costs both for the Project as a whole and for Component 2; (iii) the use of
resources for subproject implementation; and (iv) the delays incurred in project implementation.
62. Unit costs of roads. At the onset of the project, the unit cost of road rehabilitation and spot
improvement were extremely high. This was due to the fact that large enterprises, in the difficult
business context of Haiti, had heavy costs of mobilization for relatively small contracts. As
project implementation unfolded, especially following the restructuration, it became clear that
public works SMEs had developed their capacities, and, for the same quality standards, had costs
ways lower that large contractors (see Table 3 below). With the support from the Bank, and
following commonly accepted practices internationally, UCE developed suitable procurement
rules to contract SMEs. This process was extremely successful to the extent that the bulk of
contracts for Component 4 were awarded to SMEs. In turn, this grew to be a major factor for the
promotion of national SMEs and attendant generation of employment.

63. Administrative costs. The administrative costs incurred by UCE for overall project
administration and management were reasonable compared to the amount of investments on the
ground. Disbursed amounts regarding Component 3 were actually lower than initially estimated
(88 percent) although additional activities were incorporated into the project; they represented a
low 5.5 percent of total project costs. This bears testimony that overall the project was managed
in a cost-effective way. For Component 2, the cost of support for subproject planning and
implementation as a percentage of the entire component cost was moderate compared to similar
projects. In rough terms, for every US dollar invested in subprojects, an additional 65 cents was
disbursed for participatory planning, training and capacity building, and for administration,
technical follow-up and assistance by MDODs and BMPAD. This compares well with PRODEP1,
since, in that project, for every US dollar invested in subprojects 86 cents were used by the
MDODs and BMPAD. Although TTDP is hard to compare to PRODEP, it can be concluded that
Component 2’s administrative and technical support has been cost-effective. Also, in the case of
TTDP, this is mitigated by the fact that the funds spent for Component 2 on planning helped
mobilized additional resources. Therefore, the ratio of administration costs vs. total subproject
investments should be more favorable.
64. Prima facie, the ratio of the costs of technical support and administration vs. total project
costs or costs of investments on the ground may appear high. However, experience has shown in
this project and other projects financed by the World Bank that strong external support has helped
build limited local institutional capacity. Projects and MDODs have to set up offices, recruit staff,
and purchase ample operational equipment. In this respect, the cost of doing business has
increased markedly in recent years, especially since the 2010 earthquake that mobilized a lot of
resources for reconstruction and pushed up the cost of goods and services. BMPAD reports that
its costs have increased by an annual 12 percent over the life of the project, mainly through the
increase in the number of consultants (staff) and remuneration (25 percent growth per year) as
well as a 17 percent annual growth in operating costs. The two MDODs contracted by the project
were international NGOs: the Canadian Center for International Studies and Cooperation (CECI)
and Agronomes et Vétérinaires sans Frontières (AVSF). These NGOs had significant overheads
(13-15 percent of the contract amount) which increased costs far above the costs of local NGOs.
Working through local NGOs would have been more economical but their implementation
capacity would have been insufficient.
65. Sub-project technical and economic results. As the subprojects were selected through a
transparent and competitive process amongst a list of proposals previously-established on the
basis of participatory planning there is no doubt that they addressed local needs. The question is
whether the selected subprojects were technically and economically sound, and reached their
objectives of improving the living conditions (water, roads, electricity) or generating employment
and income generation. Data on subprojects’ operational efficiency, sustainability and usefulness
for comparable municipality support programs in other fragile states are hard to come by. There
is no doubt that, in the context of TTDP, the money was used for the purpose for which it had
been intended. All bidding processes were organized by the MDODs and contract award had to
be vetted by BMPAD and further approved by the Bank. For each project, a management
committee comprising prominent members of the communal population had to established to
monitor work progress. Based on the individual technical audits conducted by the MDODs and
BMPAD, about 80% of subprojects were successful (e.g., paving of streets in Thiotte, installation
of solar street lighting, slope conservation agriculture in Brostage, cementing of road bands to
access Tet Plak from Forêt des Pins, electricity supply and distribution in Bahon, etc.) The

remaining projects, for different reasons, were less successful (e.g., fruit and vegetable market at
St. Raphaël: this market was not used as it should have been due to the construction of a nearby
larger general market; training of young people in tourism activities: few of the young trainers
found jobs in the tourism sector because of lack of tourism development; or cassava processing
that fail due to unfortunate failure of the equipment).
66. One factor that accounts for success or failure of the types of sub-projects implemented
under TTDP, is undoubtedly the degree of follow-up on the part of the implementing agencies.
The lack of attention in particular to cost-recovery to cover operating, maintenance and possibly
renewal costs is generally a major issue. At the outset, the first TTDP subprojects were
envisioned as tests (‘sous-projets d’accrochage’). At that stage, project management, both
BMPAD and the Bank, were more concerned with ensuring a transparent and systematic planning
and selection process for subprojects than with subproject technical and economic feasibility.
Later on more attention was placed on looking at issues such as the organizational structure
underlying the subproject as well as cost-efficiency parameters required to ensure long-term
sustainability.
67. Implementation delays. There were major implementation delays of 2 to 3 years for
implementation of Component 1. Road improvements were only completed in late 2010 in the
North and early 2012 in the South-East. These delays were due in part to delays experienced in
procurement and preparation of the detailed engineering studies and delays in contracting the firm
for road works in both micro-regions. In addition, delays were compounded due to the following
factors: (i) in the northern micro-region, the length of time it took for the Bank and the other
partner agencies (AFD and EU) to agree on a funding strategy for RN3; and (ii) in the south-
eastern micro-regions, the length of time it took for the Bank and the Government to agree on the
final options for road rehabilitation (road coverage, single vs. double lane, etc.) Clearly, the
2007/2008 storms and hurricanes and the 2010 earthquake were also huge additional factors in
the delays experienced in project execution, even though none of the micro-regions were
physically affected.
68. Economic evaluation. Table 4 below shows how the re-computed ex-post NPVs and IRRs
for the two stretches of roads rehabilitated under TTDP in the North and South-East micro-
regions compare with the results initially estimated at appraisal.
                                 Table 4 - Ex-ante vs. ex-post results
                                                        Ex-ante               Ex-post

        NPV North (US$ million)                             4.7                  1.7

        NPV South-East (US$ million)                       0.58                 0.35

        IRR North                                          39%                  14%

        IRR South                                          15%                  11%


69. The lower than expected results at project closure are explained by the large underestimation
    of the road rehabilitation costs at appraisal and the long delays experienced in the completing
    the road rehabilitation work. This is explained also by the overestimation of the benefits
    (other than the decrease in Vehicle Operating Costs) in the case of the Thiotte – Anse à Pitre
    micro-region (South-East). The induced impact on the coffee economy did not materialize
    because of the diseases crisis, clearly totally unrelated to road conditions, that this sector has
    experienced in recent years. In the North, the discrepancy of the results is largely explained

                                                 30
    also by the fact that only 8 km of roads were rehabilitated (as opposed to 38.8 km), the
    remainder awaiting the intervention of the EU.



    3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70. The assessment made in the preceding sections justify the overall outcome rating as
Moderately Satisfactory:
       Relevance: The PDO, design and implementation were and remain relevant however the
        fragility of the country could have been taken into account better to offer more flexibility
        during implementation;
       Efficacy: The PDO, as measured by the PDO indicators, shows a substantial level of
        achievement except for road maintenance envisioned pilot’s activities; and
       Efficiency. The project was generally implemented in a cost-effective way regarding
        unit costs and costs of administration, management and technical support. Overall, sub-
        projects resulted in good technical and economic results. Implementation delays for road
        rehabilitation were clearly a negative factor; but they permitted better coordination with
        other partners and adequate adjustment of TTDP’s scope of work.

    3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71. Poverty Impact. The project’s objective to increase access of small producers to market
services and productive assets was expected to have a positive effect on income for the poor. In
the context of Haiti, road rehabilitation and spot improvement undoubtedly served their assigned
purpose, i.e., to enable the populations not only to access markets but also to access basic social
services. While most subprojects generally had no direct impact on cash income, they had an
impact on the living conditions of the poor. In rural areas and small towns, connection to the
electric grid, street paving and lighting, rehabilitation of market places, upgrading of small tracks
making them passable year round, etc., are all factors that improve the livelihood conditions of
populations.
72. Gender Aspects. TTDP can be considered as a gender-oriented project. Roads
rehabilitation served the purpose of both men and women, but probably more the purpose of the
latter since it facilitated access to markets, bearing in mind that women in Haiti are the ones who
handle marketing activities. Under Component 2, the MDODs made a serious effort to promote
gender-friendly subprojects. They ensured that women were included in the subproject
committees and in Consultation Tables. Many subprojects provided training and employment to
women and men alike (e.g., training for tourism activities in the North), others were geared
specifically to serving the needs of women (e.g., the construction of market places).
73. Social Development. The impact survey conducted at project closure covered in some
detail TTDP’s main social development achievements. It bears testimony that the degree of
satisfaction of intended beneficiaries with these achievements was high. This included a positive
impact on access to social services, as well as awareness, empowerment and capacity building of
local communities as a result of the MDODs’ outreach activities. In this regard, the project
introduced a fundamentally new approach to working collaboratively through the CTs for the
benefit of the entire local population, as opposed to promoting individual and specialized interests.

                                                 31
In this sense, it expanded the number of stakeholders involved in decision-making and promoted
empowerment at the grassroots. Typically, the communes proceeded to select their own
subprojects in a participatory way and bargained amongst themselves to get their own priorities
accepted at micro-regional level. In doing so, the project aided in conflict resolution and certainly
gave a voice to the poor. MDODs managed the process closely in a transparent way so that elite
capture would be avoided.
    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

74.     TTDP earmarked substantial resources to strengthen institutions such as UCE and
BMPAD, as well as FER for road maintenance. At local level, capacity building of the CTs and
municipal authorities was an important objective assigned to MDODs, and, in that sense, the
project had a discernible impact on social capital and institution building. The project relied on
‘project-type’ structures outside the core administration and on private and NGO-type service
providers. It did not have the objective to mainstream these structures or to strengthen the core
administrative services. Hence, the latter did not receive any capacity building on the part of the
project with the exception of the Departmental Directorates of Planning in the two micro-regions
which received US$50,000 each. At the local level, the project did provide capacity building to
communes through the MDODs’ outreach activities. There was unfortunately neither an
evaluation of knowledge transfer nor follow-up as to whether or not the knowledge was applied.
No funding was earmarked directly for communes to increase their operating capacity (no
funding of equipment and no contribution to operating expenditures).

    (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

N/A

    3.6. Summary Findings of Beneficiary Surveys and/or Stakeholder Workshops

75. Stakeholder workshops were organized at project preparation and launch in 2005 and 2006
in each micro-region as one-shot type exercises. They served to inform the project design and
start-up process. Subsequently, implementation workshops were carried out regularly at
communal and micro-regional level as part of Component 2 implementation under the aegis of
the CTs with the assistance of the MDODs. They served to inform the preparation of the
communal and micro-regional plans as well as the selection the subprojects. As an additional
benefit, since Component 1 came to experience long delays, the workshops organized as part of
Component 2 also served to explain issues related to road improvement, and manage expectations
regarding the timeline for road construction. A beneficiary assessment was conducted at project
closure as part of the project impact study carried out in June 2013. The beneficiary assessment
employed a variety of methodologies including individual interviews, and meetings with focus
groups in the two micro-regions. For lack of time, it did not cover the project zones of
Component 4 interventions.

the project ex-post impact study:

77. The beneficiary survey took place through individual interview with 800 project
beneficiaries and meetings with 12 focus groups (18 members on average or about 216
respondents in total), both in the northern and south-Eastern micro-regions. The results were as
follows. The overall satisfaction rate with the project is 68% (50% for the North and 87% for the
South-East). The relatively low rate for the North is due to the fact that only a small part of the
RN3 (8.5 km) of the stretch from Carrefour Lamort and St. Raphaël (total 38.5km) was
rehabilitated as a result of the Bank agreement with EU. At the time of project closure, the
remaining part of the road was still in extremely bad conditions since the EU had not started the
road works yet. The TTDP also reconstructed the bridge on the RN3 over the Brouhaya river that
has permitted year round passage (previously vehicles had to go through the river bed to cross the
river). The satisfaction rate with the participatory planning process and corresponding subproject
financing (Component 2) was 73% on average with difference between the North (58%) and the
South East (89%) similar to that for roads improvements. The paving of Thiotte and the
environmental conservation project of Brostage (contour farming) received the highest marks.
Two subprojects that had less success (St. Raphaël vegetable market and the Milot artisanal
market) contributed to the lower rate of satisfaction in the North, all the more because they are
highly visible.
78. The beneficiary evaluation also illustrated the effects of improved roads in helping the
rural population to access basic services particularly education (78% of satisfied respondents) and
health (81% of satisfied respondents). Finally, the evaluation showed positive effect on
employment and income generating activities (69% of satisfied respondents) and leisure (57% of
satisfied respondents).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

79. The project has had major achievements and reached its objectives in terms of road
rehabilitation (Component 1) and spot improvement (Component 4). One of these achievements
is the promotion of local civil work SMEs. These enterprises were able to compete successfully
with large national and international contractors both in terms of costs and work quality. They

                                                                     33
are expected to continue expanding in the future. The availability of funding for road
improvement is probable given the willingness of the donor community to squarely tackle the
investment needs in infrastructure development and maintenance, including disaster-related work.
The project was also successful in tackling issues related to the maintenance activities. It
developed FER’s capacity and supported the application of the legislation designed to establish
the listing of priority roads to be maintained and give FER the corresponding resources required.
This has supported FER as the fundamental mechanism for funding road maintenance. The FER
is now an established institution that has the required operating capacity. Each year, the priority
list of roads to be maintained is updated. Maintenance contracts are outsourced and managed by
FER. FER’s financial resources are secured to the extent that they are earmarked on certain items
like gasoline sales. One issue that remains to be resolved is the still low level of funding granted
to FER which is inadequate to cover all its assigned road maintenance priorities.
80. Concerning Component 2, without a follow-up project and/ or technical assistance by
MDODs or other NGOs, a significant fraction of the subprojects are at risk of not being able to
operate and be maintained properly. Consequently, their benefits may wane. Similarly, if
additional funding is not forthcoming, the civil society institutions supported by the project (such
as the TCs) may not survive. In this regard, the Government has still not decided on options for
decentralization. There is undoubtedly a vacuum to be filled in that area, especially in view of
the fact that (long overdue) local elections are upcoming (end-2014). A positive note is that, as
part of the Bank PRODEPUR AF, support is envisioned on the topic of decentralization. In spite
of the current institutional and regulatory vacuum, however, TTDP has given the communes a
working experience that has increased their skills and improved their performance with attendant
sustainable progress in local governance, transparency and accountability. The Project has
undoubtedly represented a valuable local development experience that will most likely leave
some institutional capacity behind. In fact, two Bank projects currently being processed are
building on TTDP’s experience with transport and territorial development: the Center and
Artibonite Regional Development Project and the Cultural Heritage and Sustainable Tourism
Project (both FY2014).
81. In view of the remaining uncertainties concerning road maintenance, and the sustainability
of subproject investments in the absence of a decentralization framework, the risk to the project
development outcome is considered substantial.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
   5.1. Bank Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82. Project design was sound and based on the Bank’s longstanding experience with rural roads
inter alia in Peru. The design also benefited from the experience of other donors in Haiti (UNDP,
Canadian and French cooperation) regarding participatory planning. The project objectives aptly
addressed the country’s needs and were attainable. The territorial planning methodology proved
robust, and was implemented as designed. The project design permitted to accommodate the
disaster-related component incorporated at project restructuration with no need for modification
of the basic project concept. The use of local contractors for spot interventions proved very
successful in terms of work quality and cost, and for the promotion of civil work/engineering
SMEs. The use of international MDODs as main operators for Component 2 had a very positive
impact on field implementation, included strict adherence to fiduciary conditions. The use of an
ad hoc structure, the TCs, was well adapted at the time where local authorities were yet to have


                                                34
the required credibility and operational means. It permitted to work hand in hand with communal
authorities. In the interest of expediency, the Bank acted as the prime mover behind project
design and implementation. Such a stand was wise. It is the normal case with donors in Haiti
given the weakness of core government administration.
In spite of its prima facie good performance, the Bank’s performance regarding quality at entry
displayed some shortcomings: (i) whilst PDOs were relevant, a couple of indicators were not
sufficiently realistic in the sense that they proved difficult to measure accurately in the rapidly
changing context of Haiti transport sector (traffic volumes expressed as one single indicator in the
face of the dramatic change in fleet composition, and transit losses similarly expressed in general
terms in the context of a very diverse and non-homogeneous set of goods to be transported); (ii)
road rehabilitation costs were somewhat underestimated; (iii) the potential for using SMEs was
not given all the importance it could have; (v) the project design did not provide for sufficient
flexibility in terms of reallocation of the funds earmarked for road maintenance.
   (b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83. The Bank team conducted 17 formal supervision missions, on average two supervisions per
year. These missions always included the participation of the Bank’s fiduciary specialists, and, as
required, the Bank’s environmental and social safeguards specialists. It is worth noting that,
since 2011, the TTDP TTL (also appointed as SDN coordinator) has been based in Haiti. This has
permitted the Bank to provide the day to day implementation support and provided sustained
contacts with the government services and the executing agencies, UCE and BMPAD, especially
since these latter were handling several Bank SDN projects.
84. Bank supervision focused on regular project operating issues, including technical and
management issues. Several hotly debated technical issues concerned the options for road
rehabilitation and spot improvement work. This proved particularly challenging for the south-
eastern road stretch, as, beyond the basic unpaved option that had been decided at project design,
the exact work specifications remained to be decided. Also challenging, and widely debated, was
the option of using small local contractors. Supervision missions also served as basis to prepare
the restructuration plan and subsequent additional financing (AF) operation. The supervision and
AF preparation missions aptly overlapped during that period. The restructuration that took place
at about the mid-term of project implementation was the occasion to take stock of the status of
implementation at that time, obviating the need for a formal MTR. Also a lot of supervision time
was devoted to liaison and coordination with donors. This proved successful for the northern
road stretch, as agreement was reached between the Bank, AFD and EU regarding their respective
roles in rehabilitating RN3. As a result of these agreements, the Bank took charge of all the
preliminary engineering studies, as well as a 8.5 km stretch of road and a major spot improvement
(the bridge between Dondon and St. Raphaël).

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85. The Bank team supervised the project closely all along implementation. The decision to
base the TTL in Haiti permitted to reinforce the quality and intensity of the dialogue over project
implementation. The Bank team made every effort to coordinate with donor partners and
incorporate lessons learned into project implementation on a rolling basis. It took advantage of
the supervisions missions to aptly restructure the project at the time resources were needed for
disaster-related activities. In that sense it displayed agility and responsiveness in serving the
needs arising from emergencies leading to the restructuring of the project and subsequent

                                                35
granting of additional financing. The team also placed special emphasis on engaging the
Government and the implementing agencies in strategy and policy dialogue on road
improvement, road maintenance and local development in Haiti.
      However, the team performance could have been stronger on several counts: (i) the team
did not react sufficiently in terms of reallocating funds for road maintenance, (ii) it failed also to
readjust in an appropriate way one of the most critical PDO indicators that were too complex to
be monitored in the context of project implementation; and (iii) it failed to hold the MTR: Even
though this is excusable in the context of the dramatic events that took place, the Bank team
should have insisted to have a formal review including the preparation of mid-term impact
evaluation.
87. On account of all above considerations, in balance, the Bank overall performance for TTDP
supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.

    5.2. Borrower Performance

   (a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88. The Government proved capable to take full project ownership both at project design stage
and as execution unfolded. It was a strong partner. However, due to the relative weakness of
implementing agencies, significant implementation support was required from the Bank. UCE
and BMPAD were not as responsive as expected to the Bank’s efforts for project supervision, and
implementing the Bank's recommendations for improving performance was challenging at
times. As a result, these efforts had somewhat limited impact on improving project
implementation quality. The situation improved during the final months, as the project was
nearing closure. The implementing agencies heeded the Bank’s advice to properly handle the
technical and management issues that had been flagged and set the conditions for
closure, which included the wrapping up of the financial accounts, the preparation of the Project
Completion Report and the administration of the Project Impact Survey. The above-described
performance of UCE and BMPAD is not unusual considering Haiti’s low capacity and weak
institutional context. However, this was exacerbated by the devastating impact of the earthquake
of 2010, which killed one out of three civil servants, many in middle management and collapsed
many government buildings.


   (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89. UCE and BMPAD. UCE was the lead agency in charge of overall project coordination and
responsible for Component 1 and later Component 4. BMPAD was responsible for Component 2
as well as project evaluation. Their role was to handle the following main tasks as part of their
specific project implementation responsibilities: (i) procurement and financial management; (ii)
contract management, including road engineering and construction contracts and MDOD
contracts; (iii) day-to-day field supervision; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation through a
management information system (MIS), with the attendant preparation of quarterly reports, bi-
annual audits and ad hoc impact evaluations.
90. UCE/BMPAD’s management performance was weak at the onset, but improved as project
implementation unfolded as per supervision recommendations. Procurement reviews were
generally satisfactory but financial management often unsatisfactory mainly because of
insufficient budgetary planning. The financial audits were prepared by qualified external auditors;

                                                 36
they were generally of good and unqualified but late at times. Task (iii) was hampered by
BMPAD’s lack of staff following the earthquake; the high-level staff in charge of Component 2
was not replaced. For task (iv) UCE/BMPAD did not introduce an operating MIS until very late
in the project, and, hence, M&E was of generally of insufficient quality. For Component 2, the
monitoring was essentially based on information provided by the MDODs. The progress reports
were of reasonable quality but often late. A major problem was that UCE and BMPAD
performed all the above tasks separately at their own level with insufficient coordination between
themselves. As a result, there was no aggregate reporting for the project as a whole. This reflected
UCE’s weakness regarding project coordination. Another weakness is the fact that the project
evaluation capability was under BMPAD’s responsibility, whereas it should have been assigned
to UCE. BMPAD prepared the baseline survey, but did not update this survey at the Mid-Term
of project execution as planned. UCE show little interest in project impact evaluation until late in
the project implementation period. To its credit, the last impact evaluation study, carried out just
before project closure, received it full support.
91. MDODs. The MDODs carried out Component 2’s field activities. As subcontractors, they
performed with great competence considering the difficult field conditions and the many negative
events that could have hampered their activities, including the natural disasters that occurred
during the project period. Per their mandate, the MDODs facilitated the territorial planning
process. This resulted in the preparation of the comprehensive micro-regional development plans.
These plans proved to be of excellent quality and represented a major achievement. Subsequently,
the MDODs guided the systematic and transparent selection process of subprojects, ensured
follow-up of subproject implementation including provision of technical assistance and advice,
monitored field operations, and supervised the related financial aspects. These tasks were carried
out in a fully satisfactory manner. They were well appreciated by beneficiary populations.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

92. Taking into account Haiti’s general weak institutional capacity as reflected in the above,
and the implementation context of the multiple natural disasters that confronted the project during
implementation, the overall performance of UCE, BMPAD and MDODs combined is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

93. TTDP was meant to carry out road rehabilitation and spot improvement and implement a
pilot participatory process of identifying and selecting local investment to capitalize on the
benefits of the road and spot investments. The aim was to facilitate access to markets on the part
of small producers. The benefits brought about by the rehabilitation and improvement works were
predicated on reduced travel time and transit losses, increased traffic and general improvement in
the quality of transport. A disaster-related component was added at about the mid-term of project
implementation. It did not change either the project objective, or its implementation approach.
Based on this rich implementation course where both flexibility and discipline were required,
TTDP offers an array of lessons about general project implementation, works execution for rural
road rehabilitation and spot improvements, and participatory planning. These lessons are
summarized below.


    (a) General lessons

                                                37
94. Informing and sensitizing beneficiaries, and explaining the project execution strategy, is
required if populations are to take full project ownership. TTDP through a large array of
interventions (sensitization campaigns, use of mass media, workshops) was able to promote
ownership of project activities by beneficiary populations. In this regard, the execution of
Component 2 that started much earlier than the road works under Component 1 offered the
opportunity to better explain the road strategy, and hence secure its acceptance by the local
populations. This was particular useful to explain the reduced role of the project in the
rehabilitation of RN3 in the North and the fact that a gravel road option had been selected for the
road stretch in the South-East as opposed to a paved road. Under Component 2, the fact that it
was implementation under fully transparent conditions, including release of information and
rendition of accounts, avoided the capture of resources by local elites to pursue their own
individual goals; it prevented also that the TC be used as platform by local politicians to promote
their partisan views and further their political agenda.
95. Combining road rehabilitation (or other infrastructure improvement) with local
investments can improve the impact of the former and stimulate local development. In supporting
economic development and fight against poverty, road rehabilitation is generally not sufficient to
promote local development. TTDP impact evaluation has shown that significant improvements of
transport conditions (reduction of travel times and travel costs, greater availability and reliability
of transport services) follow the rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure. However, the
impact on local economic development and poverty reduction is generally not systematically
forthcoming. Consequently, the implementation of complementary investments at the micro-
regional level is a must to capitalize and derive the full benefits from the roads. In that regard,
TTDP showed that, in parallel with the improvement of transport conditions that make access to
local markets easier and more reliable, complementary investments are necessary to promote
opportunities for self-employment and income generation. TTDP however only had seed funding
to that end (US$2 million) which was way insufficient to cover the needs expressed in the Micro-
Region Development Plans. Although it met its target regarding this result, TTDP was able to
only raise a fraction of the additional funding required to finance the plans, in spite of its valuable
efforts. Projects similar to TTDP should make provision for a larger amount of funding
earmarked for local investments complementary to roads rehabilitation and spot improvements.
96. Strong cooperation between development organizations such as the Bank, AFD and the EU
can be a factor of success especially in the context where leadership and donor coordination by
the Government is weak. TTDP illustrated how three cooperation entities were brought to work
together regarding the rehabilitation of RN3 under a win-win framework that emphasized the
adding up of the comparative advantages of these entities, an open approach to the discussion of
the topics at hand and the resolution of conflicts. Such coordination was lengthy and time
consuming. But it was worthwhile and successful in a context where resources were limited. It
resulted in a suitable distribution of roles between the three donors with the Bank taking the lead
for the detailed engineering studies, the works regarding a major spot intervention and the
rehabilitation of only a limited stretch of road.
97. As part of project design, the provision of resources to address emergency issues is
required in post-conflict and disaster-prone countries. TTDP was restructured at mid-course to
accommodate the need to respond to the disasters caused by several tropical storms and
hurricanes in 2008. Under the new Component 4, the focus was shifted from regular road
rehabilitation and spot improvement to emergency works. This created some disruption in project
implementation, although the project proved able to fully accommodate the needs arising from
the restructuration. The attendant lesson is that it would have been easier to be fully prepared
right from project design to the event of an emergency. In that sense, creating a specific
component to be triggered depending on needs would have been advisable. This lesson has
already been heeded in the Bank’s recently approved and upcoming projects for Haiti that all

                                                  38
include such an emergency component that can be triggered depending on prevailing emergency
circumstances.
    (b) Lessons concerning transport projects
98. Improved transport conditions in rural areas translate into better access to markets by
producers, hence increasing income-generating opportunities; they also translate into improved
access to social services (health, education). The impact evaluation of TTDP has illustrated the
benefits of rural road interventions in Haiti, confirming conventional wisdom based on
international evidence. Rural roads not only facilitated access to markets, hence promoting
agricultural production, but also school attendance, visits to health centers and opportunities for
leisure. These results are a strong advocate for investing in rural roads as part of a growth and
poverty reduction strategy in rural areas.
99. A work strategy focused on SMEs for transport infrastructure can act as a catalyst for
developing private sector activities and generating employment. Under TTDP Component 4, the
inclusion of SMEs served the need to perform spot improvement for a widely-scattered rural
infrastructure. In addition to being cost-effective, the SME program had spillover effects on local
development initiatives, creating employment opportunities for the rural populations involved.
100. Gravel roads can be a sustainable and cost-effective technical solution to improve rural
transport infrastructure. TTDP’s experience confirmed international evidence that paving roads
is not always the most cost-effective solution to address transport needs on low- traffic roads.
Instead, for rural roads where traffic levels do typically exceed a minimum threshold (say 50
vehicles per day), gravel roads constitute the most adequate technical solution provided due
attention is given to maintenance. Under proper maintenance conditions, gravel roads are both a
cost-effective and sustainable option. Unfortunately, these conditions are not always met in post-
conflict or fragile countries where funding is limited and road maintenance is not considered a
priority. This is the case in Haiti. The project failed to seize the opportunity to make a dent in
improving the situation.
101. Improving road maintenance services in a volatile environment like Haiti which suffered a
total collapsing of its national systems in place in the nineties is very challenging and a medium
long term issue, the use of legal covenants in the project to support a broader dialogue with other
donors and the government on that thematic has shown some positive but limited results. A
dedicated operation to address such a critical issue to protect the huge effort of rebuilding of the
road network would merely have been more adequate. However, high level of volatility calls for
an approach that is both opportunistic and focused on long-term sustainability. This presents
issues of measurement and limits the predictability of outcomes.
(c) Lessons concerning participatory planning and subproject execution
102. Participatory planning and inclusion can ensure better targeting of resources while better
responding to community needs. TTDP through Component 2 aimed to empower the rural
population in the process of identifying local priorities and selecting local investments. In this
regard, participatory plans identifying key local investment ensured that local stakeholders’ needs
were fully reflected in the prioritization of investment alternatives. Preparation of these plans
helped understand the related economic development opportunities and poverty links as perceived
by communities. Various consultations and participatory workshops in the targeted communes
ensured the engagement and inclusion of all beneficiaries and community members from the
design through the implementation phase. As part of the workings of the mechanism of the
Consultation Table (TC), a methodology was developed so that local stakeholders could solve
key tradeoffs between investment alternatives while limiting the risks of capture of the decision-
making process by individual interests. The obligation of transparency and due rendition of
accounts proved to be the key to the project success. The CT was the appropriate mechanism to
ensure proper accountability to rural stakeholders.

                                                39
103. Infrastructure subprojects of the type included in TTDP Component 2 should present an
O&M strategy and attendant training program. Ensuring that resources are lined up for the
operation, maintenance and renewal of investments is a must for subprojects to be sustainable..
Subprojects that require operational and management skills need to be accompanied by
corresponding training and follow-up support. Such support should be duly included in the terms
of reference of MDOD contracts.

7. Comments by Borrower on Issues Raised
Summary of comments by Ing. Garry JEAN, UCE Coordinator, MTPTEC. (Project
Implementation Unit in charge of overall coordination of the project) (January 29, 2014)

The UCE is in agreement with the different ratings proposed in the ICR document but highlight
elements through the following comments.
     “The vast majority of project objectives was reached or exceeded in some cases
       particularly in terms of reduced travel time and transportation costs for easier access to
       markets.
     The emergency works have restored access for areas that were left isolated after the
       destructive series of natural disasters that have rocked the country during the project
       implementation period. They also have allowed supporting the small regional
       construction companies which had a positive impact on both reducing the cost of works
       and increasing local employment.
     The ICR document does not fully reflect the efforts deployed to address the issue of road
       maintenance. In fact, since the beginning of the project, successive governments have
       reiterated their commitment and given priority to this issue in conjunction with the
       reconstruction of the road network. This has included operational support to FER, the
       implementation of a national strategy for maintenance road, and the recently-created
       department within MTPTEC dealing exclusively with road maintenance.
     Given the very good results of the project, the positive impact in terms of improving
       access to health services and education, as noted in the satisfaction survey and the
       ongoing efforts to ensure better sustainability of our road investments, this overall
       project rating, is relatively conservative. “

About his performance, the PIU emphasizes the extremely difficult circumstances related to the
devastating earthquake of January 12, 2010 which has severely impacted the staff. Moreover, the
continuity of existing operations was a particularly delicate task given new government priorities
related to the challenges of reconstruction. UCE also recognizes that the rapid increase in the
volume of activity has hampered its performance including the implementation of PTDT.
Finally, The Ministry of TPTPC brings to the Bank’s attention its excellent relations with the
various teams of the World Bank throughout the project implementation and how it has
contributed to TTDP’s good performance.

                                Annex 2 - Outputs by Component
Component 1

This component (US$11.25 million) dealt with the road infrastructure component. It comprised
two sub-components: (i) Sub-component 1.1 (US$11.25 million) concerned the rehabilitation of
the two stretches of roads of Carrefour Lamort to St. Raphaël (38.8 km) to be asphalted in the
North, and Forêt des Pins to Anse à Pitres (63 km) to be improved as a gravel road in the South-
East, and (ii) Sub-component 1.2 (US$500,00) for road maintenance.

Subcomponent 1.1: Road rehabilitation. To implement Sub-component 1.1, UCE launched three
competitive bidding processes respectively for: (i) technical studies, (ii) work execution; and (iii)
work supervision. As a results of the bidding for the technical studies, the firms AIC Progetti was
selected to prepare the studies for the road stretch Forêt des Pins - Thiotte - Anse à Pitre as part of
a contract with the MTPTC of March 24, 2008 for an amount of US$ 625,000, and Gelsen
Consult for the engineering study of Carrefour La Mort - St Raphaël for a total of € 386,000 or
about US$500,000.

In the South-East, the studies showed that the amount of money available for the work was
clearly insufficient for the rehabilitation of the entire two stretches of roads. Indeed, following
discussion of the options for road rehabilitation based on the Progetti study, the UCE had
indicated that, given the its importance of as departmental road linking to the Dominican
Republic, the stretch Forêt des Pins-Thiotte-Anse Pitre should be treated according to the
characteristics of a two-lane road and not as a local road with one bandwidth and crossings, as
this had been one option in the preliminary design. That option also considered only spot
interventions, whereas UCE preferred a full road rehabilitation. In addition, at the opening of
bids, the lowest bid for the rehabilitation of the road was 25 % higher what the study had
estimated estimated. In total, the cost overrun was about US$5.10 million, compared to the initial
estimate. Accordingly, it was decided to rehabilitate only the section Thiotte - Anse à Pitre (40
km) as the most critical part. The Government and the Bank agreed to seek other options for the
remaining 20 km between Thiotte and Forêt des Pins. The firm Vorbe & Sons won the contract
for work execution for a total of US$6.9 million. It completed the works in two years. The group
EXPERCO / ESC was given responsibility for supervision under a contract for an amount of
US$750,000.

Similarly, in the North, the amount of funding provided at project appraisal proved to be way
under real costs, for the following reasons. The type of interventions was intended to be a light
rehabilitation. It was decided that the rehabilitation standard was insufficient and had to be raised
to a higher standards. The reason for the higher standard was that the traffic on that road section,
following rehabilitation of the entire RN3 all the way to Port au Prince decided by the Haitian
government with the support of other donors, was estimated at a much higher level that
previously estimated. Various options were considered by the Bank during supervision missions
in close coordination with the two other donors concerned (EU, AFD and AFDB) to draw upon
the various financing potentially available from the view of the rehabilitation of the larger stretch
of road all the way to Hinche and create synergy and complementarity between the donors. These
efforts resulted in a funding strategy involving a very close coordination between the three donors
(WB, AFD and EU): (i ) AFD financed the technical studies of Saint Raphaël section - Hinche
(45 km), while the Bank would finance those of the Carrefour Lamort - Saint Raphaël (38.7 km);
and (ii) work execution contracts for works and supervision were to be financed by AFD and the
EU for the section Hinche - Barrière Battant ( 75.2 km ), and by the Bank for the section
Carrefour Lamort – Barrière Battant (8.5 km). For work execution on this latter stretch only one

                                                  42
bid was received from the firm Ghella SPA. The lack of interest on the part of other international
and national firms was explained by the relatively small size of the contract. The amount of this
proposal was over US$10 million which exceeded the amount available for this stretch by about
US$2 million. After negotiations over unit costs and quantities, the contract was signed with the
company in January 2010 for approximately US$8.7 million. Word supervision was entrusted to
SNC Lavalin /LGL consortium for an initial contract of US$547,000, followed by an extension of
US$120,000.

All above processes resulted in large delays with road rehabilitation work being completed way
off schedule in 2011 for the North and 2012 for the South East,

The following photos depict the situation of the road stretches in the Northern and South-Eastern
micro-regions in the situations before and after the project.

Subcomponent 1.2. The Road Maintenance Fund (FER) received some support for capacity
building, in the form of office equipment and furniture as well as construction of the new offices
following the 2010 earthquake. However, MTPTC was late in preparing a road maintenance
convention with FER for the maintenance of the road stretch from Thiotte to Anse à Pitre. As a
result it could not receive in time the funding earmarked for that purpose under TTDP
(approximately 400,000 USD). A part of these maintenance activities thus remain to be made
mostly for RD41 as since its rehabilitation,RN3 has been maintained by MTPTCE from Carrefour
La Mort to Saint Raphael on a force account bases without using FER funds. It has to be noted
that this activity of the project even if quite unsuccessful has allowed to support during the
lifetime of the project a broader dialogue with the MTPTCE on road maintenance and to support
the extensive work of other donors like EU and IDB which have financed capacity strengthening
of MTPTC services, with late but valuable results such as an operational road maintenance fund
receiving expected taxes from MEF, support the creation of a dedicated unit at MTPTCE to
prepare road maintenance programs and preparation of a road maintenance strategy.

                                               43
Component 2

Component 2 ‘Territorial Development Window’ (US$3 million) consisted of two sub-
components respectively to (i) support the participatory planning process (US$500,000) including
the corresponding outreach activities and the operation of the Consultation Tables; and (ii) the
funding of socio-economic subprojects at communal level (US$2.5 million). The bidding process
launched for the recruitment of the facilitators resulted in an escalation of the cost of
subcomponent to close to about US$850,000 million. The reason in part is that they were
requested to act under delegated management contracts (MDODs) with responsibility not only for
outreach activities but also for contracting and payments for the subprojects. The other reason
what that the international NGOs that were selected had to high costs of operation given the
difficult working environment of Haiti.

Component 2 had a strong positive impact in the two micro-regions both in terms of the
participatory territorial planning approach supported by the project and the portfolio of
subprojects which was financed. Also to be noted is that it started implementation as early as
2007, way before Component 7 and for close to 3 years was the sole TTDP presence in the field.
Component 2 impact can be summarized as follows :

Participatory Territorial Planning (PTP). The various methodological tools and steps for PTP,
were first developed and tested under Component 2 by the two NGO facilitators (CECI and
AVSF) in close liaison with the Departmental Directorates of Planning (MPCE). As part of this
process the rules governing the operation of the Consultation Table (TCs) were established. The
TCs subsequently operated with the support and coaching of the two facilitators. The MPCE
directorates received financial support ($50,000 each) from TTDP to strengthen their capacity.
The two Micro-Regional Development Plans (MRDP, one per micro-region) were prepared and
validated through the TC with the participation of all key stakeholders (decentralized services of
the government, local authorities and civil society organizations). These plans built on priorities
established at communal level that were vetted and cross-examined at micro-regional level
through for incorporation or not into the MRDP. They contained all the micro-regional
investments that had been selected and prioritized.

Porfolio of sub-projects (see Appendix1): The subprojects financed under TTDP were selected
from MRDPs’ investment priorities. Worth noting is that the funds earmarked by TTDP for
subprojects (about one million for each micro-region), represented only a fraction of the financial
envelope that would have been required to fund the MRDPs. TTDP financed 8 sub-projects in the
Northern micro-region and 13 in the South-Eastern micro-region for a total of approximately
US$1.95 million. The NGO facilitators selected to support the implementation process worked
under contractual arrangements with full delegation of authority. They managed the bidding
process, handled the funds for payment of subproject expenditures, contracted with firms, and
oversaw the implementation and monitoring of all sub-projects by providing close support to the
sub-project management committees. They held regular workshops, generally in conjunction with
the meetings of the Consultation Tables (TCs). These workshops were a major factor in
informing and eliciting the participation of the stakeholders, and getting them to fully adhere to
the strict rules governing the participatory process. Hence this process was fully transparent. It
has permitted a full rendition of accounts and has avoided elite capture.

Institutional strengthening. The communes of the two micro-regions received capacity building
through the MDODs’s outreach activities and support to the Consultation Tables (TCs). The
Departmental Directorates of Planning (DDP) received funding of approximately US$50,000 for

                                                44
renovation of building, acquisition of equipment and services (office furniture, computer
equipment, internet, etc.) and support to TC meetings. In addition (i) in the North, a consultant
was hired for 9 months to train the staff of three communes for municipal planning and
preparation of the development plans, and (ii) in the South-East, Component 2 supported the
installation of the Deputy Director of Planning in the commune of Belle Anse, by taking over the
funding of his salary for one year.




The impact study showed that Component 2’s sub-projects impact was very positive, with
emphasis on the following areas:

a) Socio-economic Development: The socio-economic infrastructure funded by the subprojects
   have created an enabling environment for productive activities and/or services (e.g., markets,
   supply and distribution of electricity , tourism development, promotion of crafts and
   sustainable agriculture) activities;

b) Environmental conservation and management of risks and disasters: The subprojects
   concerning hedges or stone contour farming and protection of gullies, in combination with
   other projects, have let to the effective protection of watersheds; and

c) Strengthening of social capital: the process of prioritization and implementation of sub-
   projects according to TTDP’s participatory territorial planning approach has resulted in solid
   ownership of the investment process by local populations represented in the Consultation
   Tables. These populations have been empowered. They have gained more confidence in
   themselves, the habit of thinking and working together, and awareness of key development
   issues (status of women, youth and other disadvantaged groups, weakening of protection of
   the environmental heritage, etc.).

Component 4

Appendix 3 lists the spot improvements carried out under Component 4. The first intervention
was the Point Limite on Brouyaha River between the communes of St. Raphaël and Dondon.
Bayley bridge offered by the French Cooperation was installed. The spot improvements under
Component 4 involved inter alia: (i) strengthening river embankments; (ii) rebuilding bridges and
improving drain; and (iii) stabilizing sea shores. The benefits from these investments were felt
immediately by the nearby populations. They included protection from the risks generally
associated with disasters, notably protection from flooding of dwellings and land plots.

Description de l’Intervention                                      Situation Avant   Situation Après
Pont Limite. Le pont Limite est situé sur la RN3, près de
Saint Raphael. L’ancien pont, un pont mixte à fermes
métalliques, était en mauvais état et constituait un réel
danger pour les usagers. Il a donc été fermé à la
circulation. Le passage à gué de la rivière Bouyaha était
fréquemment infranchissable en période de pluie. Le
Gouvernement Français a offert en don au Gouvernement
Haïtien un pont métallique de type Bailey pour remplacer
le pont disloqué.
Route Jacmel Marigot (RD41). Après le passage du
cyclone Noël, la route départementale RD41 reliant la ville
de Jacmel aux communes de Cayes-Jacmel et de Marigot a
été sérieusement endommagée et le drainage transversal
saccagé par les eaux en furie des ravines qui la traversent.
Divers petits projets ont été exécutés pour la réparation de la
chaussée, la protection du littoral en plusieurs endroits par
des murs de soutènement en gabions galvanisés et plastifiés,
les interventions ponctuelles au niveau des ravines
transversales (protection de berges, construction de dalots,
curage des ouvrages obstrués, curage de lits), la confection
de fossés longitudinaux maçonnés.
Route de Maniche. - La route de Maniche (zone Saint
Hélène), après le passage du cyclone Noël, était
impraticable sur environ 3km. En effet, la chaussée se
trouvait presque complètement détruite par les eaux de
ruissellement des montagnes environnantes. Les travaux
identifiés ont été répartis en cinq (6) petites activités
(Maniche Lots 1,2, 3,4 et Dolin-route de Maniche),
exécutées par des petites et moyennes Entreprises du
département du sud.
Ravine Anse Colin sur Corail Soult. Les travaux ont
consisté en : protection de berges en gabions, curage du lit.

                        Annex 3 – Economic and Financial Evaluation

    a) General presentation of the ex-ante and ex-post economic evaluation

The ex-ante economic evaluation was performed in two ways: (i) a quantitative evaluation of the
main road rehabilitation investment; and (ii) a general qualitative evaluation of the expected
project socio-economic benefits in the two micro-regions.

The quantitative evaluation under (i) concerned the main road investments under Component 1.1
for an estimated amount of US$10.75 million or 67% of estimated total project costs. The other
physical investments at the time of appraisal were either (i) not yet identified precisely (road
maintenance activities under Subcomponent 1.2 for an estimated amount of US$450,000), or (ii)
yet to be identified (socio-economic subprojects under Subcomponent 2.2 for an estimated
amount of US$2.5 million). They were not amenable to economic and financial analysis at that
stage. They represented only 18% of total project costs. International evidence indicated that the
benefits from road maintenance were high and those accruing from socio-economic investment
with the commune, to the extent they were well managed and maintained were likely to be high
as well. It was decided that for the latter that a detailed implementation and operating plan and a
cost-benefit analysis will be required before reaching a final decision.

The benefits arising from non-physical investments under Component 2.1 (support to capacity
building and outreach activities under the local participatory process for an amount of
US$500,000) and Component 3 (project administration and management for an estimated amount
of US$1.75 million were rightly so recognized as intangible and hence not readily amenable to
quantification. Conventional wisdom and evidence in Haiti and other countries where institutional
capacity is weak indicated that these benefits were likely to be extremely high.

The ex-post NPVs or IRRs were computed for the project. They complete the quantitative
economic assessment of the outcome indicators of the results framework based on the Impact
Study done at project closure, in particular the traffic level that was a critical parameter for the
estimation of ex-ante NPVs and IRRs.

    b) Ex-ante quantitative analysis using the Road Economic Decision (RED) model

General description of the RED model. The RED performs the financial economic evaluation of
improvements and maintenance projects adopting the consumer surplus approach, which
measures the benefits to road users and consumers of reduced transport costs. This approach was
preferred to producer surplus approach, which measures the value added or generated benefits to
productive users in the project zone of influence, e.g., mainly agricultural producers, since the
consumer surplus approach allows for a better judgment of the assumptions made and an
improved assessment of the investment alternatives simulated. As shown under (c) the producer
surplus was estimated qualitatively. The Roads Economic Decision (RED) model was found to be
more appropriate than other models, due to the low traffic characteristics of the selected roads.

Vehicle operating costs (VOCs). The RED VOC module computes vehicle operating costs and
speeds as a function of road roughness for terrain and road types (flat, rolling, mountainous,
paved, graveled, earth) and motorized or non-motorized vehicle types, which are selected among
several possible vehicle types. The module also requires country specific input parameters
regarding road characteristics, such as altitude, percent of time driven in rainy conditions and
percent of time driven in extreme conditions (hurricane). The model supplies values that are
automatically generated when the technical data is not available, such as for paved roads texture

                                                57
depth, number of rises and descents, speed limit enforcement, etc.

Technical road improvement alternatives. The technical assessment performed on the two
selected roads identified various improvement alternatives on the different sections of the two
roads, with their associated estimated costs. Based on technical considerations as well as
available budget, two options were taken into selected: (i) asphalt treatment for the Northern road
stretch; and (ii) gravel road with low-cost spot interventions for the South-Eastern road stretch.

Traffic growth assumptions. On the two road stretches, traffic generated during the first years
following improvement works was expected to be very high. Indeed, the situation in the two
micro-regions was characterized by a heavily constrained demand for transport due the extremely
deteriorated conditions of road infrastructure. Most of the traffic was generated by trucks, pick-
ups and buses that people use to access markets in order to sell or buy goods. It typically takes
several hours for these vehicles to go one way, allowing only one rotation per day. If, for example,
travel time were to be halved, which was realistic if roads were to be improved, traffic could
easily double in the very short term at the current level of transport services. Given the likely
entrance of new transport service providers traffic increase forecast were bound to be
conservative.

Results of the RED analysis. The traffic growth assumption retained were (i) high growth during
the first five years following road rehabilitation, with subsequent tapering off to the national
average (about 8%) after that period. On that basis, the RED analysis gave a large positive NPV
of over US$4.7 million (IRR 39%) under conservative assumptions for the Northern stretch and a
NPV of US$0.58 (IRR 15%) for the South-Eastern stretch.

    c) Ex-ante exogenous benefits

Exogenous benefits. The improvement of the two stretches of roads was expected to generate
benefits going beyond the reduction of vehicle operating costs. The isolation of the rural
population populations in the two micro-regions due to the poor transport conditions translated
into reduced access to limited provision of key inputs to develop productive activities, and high
transit and transportation losses. The improvement of transport conditions was expected to
generate two main positive effects regarding agricultural farming systems: (i) an increase of the
volume of sales as a result of increased productivity due to improved access to key inputs such as
fertilizers; and (ii) an increase of net profits earned by local producers and traders as a result of
decreased transit losses for traded crops. These benefits were expected to be significant.
However they were not assessed quantitatively because of the difficulty of collecting reliable data
on the farming economy.

Main project expected benefits. Despite the physical isolation and poor road and market
infrastructure, at project appraisal there was significant agricultural production taking place in the
two micro-regions and significant untapped potential for growth. Year-round access to roads and
markets was the key to boost tradable agricultural production that needed to be nationally and
internationally competitive. The lack of year-round access and high transport and transaction
costs related to poor roads and access to markets led to level of production and high post-harvest
losses. In fact, a major short-term benefit of the project was expected to be to ‘harvest the low-
lying fruits’ first by decreasing post-harvest and transit losses related to poor and/or impassable
roads. This was expected to raise incomes of smallholders by increasing farmgate prices and
lowering input costs. In turn with the increase in agriculture productivity expected in the medium-
term, improved roads would allow producers to access new markets leading to higher returns and
providing initiatives for higher-value production. It was recognized also that increases in value-

                                                 58
added all along the value chains was not to be limited to rural households, since actors all along
that chain were to benefit, including input suppliers, transporters, merchants, processors and
exporters. Finally, improved roads were expected to lead to improvements in household well-
being associated with improved access to social services (e.g., education and health) located in
urban centers.

Specific benefits in the two micro-regions. The following features characteristics of the local
economy were expected to enable the two micro-regions selected to respond positively to road
improvements:

1) Rural economy characterized by smallholders. Rural areas in both micro-regions were and
   still are characterized by smallholder agricultural production. All smallholders are likely to
   benefit from improvement in transport conditions although to different degrees depending on
   their landholdings. Smallholders with less than 1.0 hectare produce both for the market and
   for home consumption. They also sell their labor and engage in small-scale-trading activities.
   Many households in this group tend to be poor and vulnerable to falling deeper into poverty.
   Smallholders with 1.0 to 3.0 hectares tend to hire seasonal labor to help with agricultural
   activities and off-farm activities. These households represent an important group in the rural
   economy because they tend to have sufficient assets to benefit from improvements in
   agricultural production and marketing. These households have the potential to intensify and
   diversify production, in both crops and livestock enterprises. Smallholders with more than 3.0
   hectares represent a more dynamic segment of the population because they also engage in
   non-agricultural activities (notably commerce by women household members and transport).
   All smallholders were expected to benefit from road improvement, with the larger ones
   expected to derive relatively more benefits;

2) Subsistence-oriented, but integrated into markets. Although the rural economy is
   characterized by smallholders with a strong subsistence orientation, a large amount of
   agricultural products are traded on local markets. Producers are buying and selling different
   consumer goods and services, including their own labor. Fresh and processed food products
   are the major consumption items of the majority of households. It is to be noted that small-
   and large-scale traders are mostly women operating in both formal and informal
   marketplaces;

3) Coffee, fresh fruit/vegetable and rice production in the micro-regions. Coffee is an important
   cash crop for smallholders in Haiti, with about 200,000 households producing coffee on about
   100,000 hectares. Approximately 1 out of every 3 rural Haitian households is estimated to be
   involved, to some extent, with the coffee sector. Coffee is an important commercial crop in
   both micro-region, with the South-Eastern micro-region (Thiotte area) being a region with
   high growth potential. Fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as staple like bananas and beans are
   important productions in both micro-regions area. St Raphaël that has the benefit of an
   irrigated perimeter (about 400 ha) has a substantial production of fresh products as well as
   rice; and

4) The non-agricultural rural economy. In terms of non-agricultural economic activity, there are
   no enterprises outside agriculture that employ more than a few persons in the micro-regions.
   But, a significant proportion of the rural population engages in some type of petty trading
   activities - of their own agricultural products (raw or processed) and/or various types of basic
   consumption goods. Some men and women engage in artisanal activities, such as sewing.
   There are also various retail and service activities in the town center and home based services.
   Most activities linked to post-harvest activities such as coffee depulping, drying and sorting.

    d) Ex-post project benefit evaluation

Summary findings and conclusions from the ex-post impact study

General. The impact evaluation concluded that the project impact had been extremely positive
based on the following criteria:

1) Transportation costs: They have experienced a dramatic decrease. In constant 2007 terms,
   transportation costs have been cut in half on the road segment from Thiotte and Anse à Pitre
   for coffee and cereals in the South-East and by 65% for passengers; in the North the decrease
   in transportation cost for beans is only 12% between St. Raphaël and Cap Haïtien and 43%
   for passengers;
2) Travel time: On the stretches of road that were rehabilitated travel has similarly improved
   dramatically. The improvement is most remarkable on the stretch of road from Thiotte to
   Anse à Pitre (about 40km). Trucks used to take around 6 hours due to the abysmal condition
   of the road; they now take 2 hours only or a decrease in travel time of about two thirds
   compared with the pre-project situation. In the North the decrease in travel time is not as
   dramatic given that only a small stretch of road was rehabilitated (8.5km). Nevertheless
   travel time was cut in half between Cap Haïtien (the nearest large city) and Milot;
3) ‘Passability’ of roads: The two stretches of roads rehabilitated are now passable year round
   when they were impracticable several weeks yearly prior to rehabilitation; and
4) Transit losses: Based on the meetings with focus groups and interviews of reliable informants,
   it was determined that these costs have also been reduced considerably, way beyond the
   target of 30% earmarked for the PDO. It is not surprising since the transit costs variable is
   highly correlated with travel times that have been cut dramatically and the transportation
   quality that has markedly increased.

Traffic volumes and traffic growth. An important element as proxy to assess the economic
impact of road rehabilitation was the increase in the volume of traffic. Based on the answers to
the qualitative questions asked during the various interviews with resource persons (truck drivers)
and focus groups a very rough estimate, used for the ex-post economic analysis, is 95% per year
or a tripling over the past two years in the South-East (road stretch from Thiotte to Anse à Pitre),
and 10% per year in the North (road stretch from Carrefour Lamort to St. Raphaël). The
interesting aspect is the changing composition of the fleet on project roads. Whereas at project
inception, most of the vehicles were trucks and pick-ups (the ubiquitous ‘tap-taps’) for both
passengers and goods, the fleet had changed dramatically at project closure. The two wheelers
(motorbikes used as motor-taxis carrying 3 to 4 passengers) are now the most numerous vehicles
constituting 70% to 90% of the fleet (more on difficult stretches of roads) with light vehicles
coming second and trucks third. Also there is the appearance of mini-buses in the light vehicle
category, whereas they were not operating on the project roads at project inception.

Ex-post evaluation of economic impact

The TTDP’s ex-post economic evaluation was performed using the RED model as was done for
the ex-ante evaluation. However assumptions differed as they reflected projections based on the
ex-post situation that were significantly different than the situation envisaged at appraisal.
Current traffic data used were those collected during the project ex-post impact study (June 2013).
The evolution of traffic volumes were updated based on current trends as shown in the impact
study. The Vehicle Operating Costs (VOCs) were updated using the procedures of the Highway
Decision Model 4 (HDMA 4). The NPV and IRR were recomputed on the above basis based on

                                                60
a 15-year horizon and a discount rate of 10% corresponding to the Haiti’s current cost of
borrowing. The specific assumptions and results for each micro-region are as follows:

South-East corridor. This concerns the Thiotte - Anse à Pitre road stretch of 40 km which was
upgraded to unpaved all weather access at a cost of US$8.17 million. The recomputed NPV for
that stretch is US$ 0.353 million and the IRR 11%. This result is difficult to compare with the
ex-ante result. Indeed it is based only on the VOCs unlike the initial study that also took into
account the road-induced effects on the local coffee economy. These ‘exogenous’ effects were
key because, at the extremely low level of traffic, the decrease in the VOCs alone did not permit
to yield positive results even though the traffic was forecast to increase substantially. The
situation has greatly changed in the past two years since road completion in 2011. The numbers
show that the road is economically profitable based on the VOC alone. This is because of the
considerable increase in traffic in the past two years estimated for the sake of this analysis at 95%
per year. The hypothesis made for the sake of computation is that the huge increase would taper
off in the coming five years (5%) and then plateau at 3% a year for the medium to long-run. The
exogenous impact on the coffee sector was not taken into account for the ex-post analysis because
since 2010 the coffee sector has experienced a crisis due to: (i) phytosanitary diseases that caused
the production to drop significantly, and (ii) exogenous factors contributing to Haitian exportes to
beneficiates from better coffee prices on the international market. In the future, this situation is
expected to rebound especially given the Ministry of Agriculture’s (MARNDR) attention to
coffee production and processing. Hence the road’s IRR as re-computed is conservative.

North corridor. The selected option was for TTDP to pave the 8 km stretch of road from
Carrefour Lamort to Barrière Battant for an investment of US$8.08 million, the remainder being
made passable with the construction of the bridge over the Brouhaya river but left unpaved in
anticipation of the works to be implemented by EU. The unit costs for road construction
estimated at appraisal were grossly underestimated. Based on the initial assumption that the
entire stretch of road from Carrefour Lamort to St. Raphaël (40km) would be paved, the trend in
traffic increase were correctly estimated (20% per year) but since only a small fraction was paved
the increase turned out to be much less (10%). Once the EU part of the road is completed the
traffic should pick up much quickly in the two years following completion (estimated at 20% per
year for 2016-17) to taper off at 5% in next three years and 3% in the medium term. These
estimates are conservative since a lot of traffic from RN1 is likely to be diverted to RN3 when
this latter is completed since the distance from Cap Haitian to Port au Prince is shorter and the
relief is less steep as one arrives on the Central Plateau. Based on the above assumptions the re-
computed NPV is US$1.7 million and the IRR is 14%.

    e) Comparison of ex-ante and ex-post results

                               Table 1 - Ex-ante vs. ex-post results

                                                         Ex-ante             Ex-post

        NPV North (US$ million)                            4.7                  1.7

        NPV South-East (US$ million)                       0.58                0.35

        IRR North                                          39%                 14%

        IRR South                                          15%                 11%


                                                 61
As shown above, the lower than expected results at project closure are explained by the large
underestimation of the road rehabilitation costs at appraisal and the long delays experienced in the
completing the road rehabilitation work. This is explained also by the overestimation of the
benefits (other than the decrease in Vehicle Operating Costs) in the case of the Thiotte – Anse à
Pitre micro-region (South-East). The induced impact on the coffee economy did not materialize
because of the crisis, clearly totally unrelated to road conditions, that this sector has experienced
in recent years. In the North, the discrepancy of the results is largely explained also by the fact
that only 8 km of roads were rehabilitated (as opposed to 38.8 km), the remainder awaiting the
intervention of the EU.

                              Annex 5 – Beneficiary Survey Results

The beneficiary satisfaction survey was administered as part of the impact study conducted in
June 2013 just before project closure. It was conducted through interviews of a sample of about
800 purposely selected beneficiaries and meetings with 12 focus groups (with about 18
participants each) in the two micro-regions. The survey was not conducted the areas covered by
Component 4 which are located outside the micro-regions. The beneficiary satisfaction with
Component 4, therefore, was not assessed.

    a) Satisfaction with road rehabilitation (Component 1)

Six subject matter questions were asked to respondents to identify the impacts of rehabilitated
roads on their livelihood condition, related production, trade, income generation, access to health,
access to education, and recreation activities.

Overall satisfaction rate. The average satisfaction score for all subject matter across the two
microregions is 68 %. As would be expected, due to the drastic decline in travel time and cost of
transportation on that road stretch, the degree of satisfaction with the project is higher for the
beneficiaries of the Thiotte - Anse à Pitre road segment (87%), than the satisfaction rate for the
beneficiaries of road stretch Barrière Battant - Carrefour Lamort (50%).

The following graph summarizes the overall beneficiary satisfaction rate. The following

study.

Perceived impacts on production, trade and income-generating activities. The project
development objective was, through the rehabilitation of roads, to lower the marketing costs for
small producers. It was therefore imperative to question the impact of component 1 at the
production, trade and income levels of beneficiaries. The following results were obtained. 92%
of respondents in the South East and 46% in the North are satisfied with the positive impact of
roads on their production activities. This is based on the increase of these activities (34%),
increase in their profit margins (11%), improving their sales (18 %) and facilities offered faster

                                                                      64
transport ( 6%).

Satisfaction with regard to health impacts. The impact on access to health care is a vital aspect
of road rehabilitation. The respondents on average were 81% satisfied with the impact of road
rehabilitation on access to health facilities. This was broken down as follows between the two
micro-regions: 72% of respondents in the North vs. 90% in the South-East indicated that roads
had a positive impact on access to health services, mostly predicated on faster and more reliable
transport facilities.

Satisfaction with regard to impact on education. The impact on access to education facilities
was found to be the second fundamental aspect of the rehabilitation of local roads. 78% of
respondents on average perceived that the impact of road rehabilitation on access to schools was
positive. This was broken down as follows between the two microregions: 60% for the North vs.
96% for the South-East.

Satisfaction with regard to impact on leisure. Access to leisure beneficiaries is the latter on
which we asked respondents. 57 % of respondents on average respondents recognized that road
road rehabilitation had a positive impact on leisure and recreation opportunities. This was broken
down as follows: 38% in the Norh, and 76% in the South-East.

    b) Satisfaction with territorial participatory process and socio-economic subprojects
       (Component 4)

The satisfaction rate with the participatory planning process and corresponding subproject
financing (Component 2) was 73% on average with a difference between the North (58%) and the
South East (89%) similar to the satisfaction rate with road rehabilitation The paving of Thiotte
and the environmental conserve.ation project of Brostage (contour farming) received the highest
marks. Two subprojects that failed (St. Raphaël vegetable market and the Milot artisanal market)
probably contributed to the lower rate of satisfaction in the North, all the more because they were
very visible.
