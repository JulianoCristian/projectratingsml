                         The objective of the Project is to improve the health and nutritional status of the people of Afghanistan, with a greater focus on women and children by increasing
                         accessibility and quality of the BPHS in the provinces of Balkh and Samangan and urban Kabul.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project performance and progress toward the project development objectives (PDO) is rated as satisfactory, with most PDO level indicators estimated to be well on target
                         except for immunization. Contraceptive use also indicates as either decreasing or stagnating after increasing for three years. However, implementation performance is rated as
                         moderately satisfactory. Service delivery performance in both provinces of Balkh and Samangan in terms of key performance indicators (mean Balance Score Card score) shows
                         negative trends. The performance of implementing partners and SM-MOPH provinces point toward improvements in most of the indicators. However, immunization and contraceptive

                         use indicate stagnation and downward trends. Three critical issues are effecting implementation including: a) delayed payments to implementing partners; b) decreased availability of
                         drugs at the service level in a number of provinces; and c) reduced intensity of monitoring by MOPH. MOPH has made progress in processing contract amendments for Samangan
                         province with implementing partner to ensure that there is no break in service delivery during the transition from SHARP to SEHAT. However, extension of Balkh contract is still
                         pending. Urban BPHS, despite some improvement, is also making slow progress with small improvements in quantity of services provided. The implementation of Essential
