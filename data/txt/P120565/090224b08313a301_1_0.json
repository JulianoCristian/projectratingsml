Some lessons learned included: the\n            approach used in Afghanistan to deliver primary health care\n            services is becoming a model for other fragile and\n            post-conflict countries. The successful approach revolves\n            around: (i) a low cost unified package of health services\n            that is agreed upon by all stakeholders; (ii) contracting\n            out services to NGOs who have greater agility and\n            flexibility in delivering those services; (iii) close\n            collaboration between the government and development\n            partners with clear cut spheres of responsibilities and\n            roles; and (iv) a gradual strengthening of government\n            capacity for stewardship and healthcare provision with\n            increasing roles and responsibilities over time. Reporting\n            and collection of data on performance indicators, and HMIS\n            strengthening should be considered carefully when designing\n            future operations. Local provincial health departments\n            should be encouraged to play an increasing role of\n            facilitation and stewardship. Strict supervision of and\n            reaping maximum benefits from NGOs should not be the primary\n            focus of the provincial health departments. Early engagement\n            of the provincial health departments should be sought in\n            future operations to coach them towards facilitating and\n            assuming monitoring functions during project implementation."}, "docdt": "2015-09-25T23:16:02Z"}
