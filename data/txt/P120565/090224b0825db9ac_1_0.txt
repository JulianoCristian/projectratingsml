                         level indicators estimated to be well on target except for immunization. The Afghanistan Household Survey (AHS 2012) shows an overall increase in maternal health related

                         The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has successfully completed the selection of NGOs for the implementation of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) in the two provinces
                         financed by this JSDF but which now will be undertaken with the support of the ongoing System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition (SEHAT) project. The new contracts

                         were effective on January 1, 2014. The transition between the previous NGOs to new NGOs went very smoothly and there was no disruption in service delivery. The urban BPHS
                         pilot shows some improvement in the utilization key health services in the last six months. The number of deliveries assisted by professional health workers doubled as compared to
                         the same period last year and contraceptive use indicates a 13% increase. Despite improvement in results and some progress in implementation with improvement in the supplies of
                         health facilities, processing of pending procurement and ensuring proper staffing of health facilities, the overall implementation progress of the pilot remains slow and behind
                         schedule. The evaluation of the urban BPHS pilot also continues to make slow progress and was expected to be completed by March 2014. The hiring of the consultant to
                         undertake the evaluation is in process, and the evaluation is expected be completed by end August 2014. The work on developing the next phase of the urban BPHS program is just
                         beginning, awaiting for the results of the evaluation.
