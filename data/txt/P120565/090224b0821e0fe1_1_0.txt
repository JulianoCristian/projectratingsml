                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project performance and progress toward the project development objectives (PDO) is rated as satisfactory, with the PDO level indicators estimated to be well on target
                         except for immunization. Contraceptive use also indicates as either decreasing or stagnating after increasing for three years. Service delivery performance in both provinces of Balkh
                         and Samangan in terms of key performance indicators (Balance Score Card score) shows some improvement in 2013. In addition, urban Kabul also shows improvement in
                         performance with increase in utilization of key preventive services including OPD visits, antenatal care and skilled deliveries.

                         MOPH has made progress in processing all contract amendments, extending contracts to December 31, 2013. MOPH has successfully processed procurement for next phase of
                         contracts under the follow-on SEHAT project and new contracts will be effective by January 1, 2014. This will ensure that there is no break in service delivery during the transition
                         from the existing project to SEHAT (approved for next five years). The performance of implementing partners in both provinces point toward improvements in most of the indicators,
