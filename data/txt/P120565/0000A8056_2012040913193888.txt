                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project performance at MTR was rated satisfactory as progress toward the PDO is satisfactory. Most of the PDO level indicators show results well on target. At MTR project's
                         expected outputs based on available data indicate that overall access and coverage to basic services has increased as almost 85 percent of the population now lives in districts which
                         now have service providers being financed to deliver a basic package of health services. Health Management Information System data shows increasing coverage of deliveries
                         attended by skilled attendance and DPT3 coverage, TB treatment success rate has been maintained and number of current users of family planning has also increased but coverage

                         Implementation performance since MTR is now rated as satisfactory. Service delivery performance of implementing partner in both provinces of Balk and Samangan had declined
                         during the transition from the previous project in terms of quality of care and coverage of services. However, as a result of actions taken data suggests that there is now a reversal of

                         trends with improvement in key performance indicators in both of the provinces. The improvement has been as a result of detailed review of performance by GCMU with
                         implementing partners (NGOs, MOPH-SM and PHDs). The resulting province specific actions plans are being implemented with enhanced monitoring and continuing dialogue. In
                         addition, after initial delays, implementation of EPHS in PPA and SM provinces and Urban BPHS have started to make good progress. A detailed assessment of urban BPHS will be
                         undertaken in April 2012.

                         The 2012 Health Sector Strategic Planning Retreat was organized by the MOPH in January 2012 which has defined and laid out priorities for implementation of the Ministry's
                         Strategic Plan (2011-2015). The team has initiated dialogue with the Ministry and European Union for the next phase of support for the health sector to be approved in 2013.
