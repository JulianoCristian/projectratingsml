Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This is the final implementation status report. Overall project performance and achievement of project development objectives (PDO) is rated
 moderately satisfactory. The progress on PDO level indicators is on target except for immunization. Two of three PDO indicators not only achieved the
 targets set but also exceeded. The project made a commendable progress with regard to enhancing access to antenatal care. Pregnant women
 receiving antenatal care during a visit to a health provider, target was 119,127 during the project lifetime. The project fully achieved its target and
 exceeded it by 7%. Similarly the project fully achieved the target in terms of service use with increase in number of consultations per person per year.
 The utilization rate of 1.8 was attained, thereby significantly exceeding the target. Although the project did not achieve its childhood immunization
 target, some progress still was made, under very challenging and difficult circumstances.
 The financing of the BPHS in the two provinces, Balkh and Samangan were supported by this project. Provision of BPHS services in two provinces
 made satisfactory progress. The full package of services was delivered. The HMIS data indicate significant improvements in utilization of most key
 health services, including antenatal visit, institutional delivery and OPD visit, in the two provinces. The improvements were as a result of the regular
 monitoring and follow-up by MOPH.., The provision of BPHS is now being undertaken with the support of the System Enhancement for Health Action in
 Transition (SEHAT) project. The implementing NGOs, hired through a competitive process, have been providing the services in these two provinces
 since January 2014 and transition has been smooth.
 The urban component of the project has also made progress ensuring most activities are completed before project closure. All pending procurement of
 goods including equipment, medicine and other consumables were completed and health facilities supplied with essential drug and necessary
 equipment. In addition, number of monitoring visits by SM team and Kabul Provincial Health Department has increased. With completion of these
 pending procurements the project has disbursed about 99% of its budget.
 The external assessment of the urban BPHS pilot has been completed and the final report will be delivered to the client by December 15, 2014. The
 assessment was delayed due to the security situation in the country. The findings of the independent assessment indicate that the MOPH managed to
 create an Urban Health Model for Kabul, by modifying the existing BPHS developed for rural areas and improving the ability of urban health facilities
 (HFs) to provide urban BPHS. In addition, the assessment shows improved provider knowledge (through training and capacity building of HF staff) and
 increase in number of monitoring visits by supervisors. The performance indicators indicate an increase in outpatient visits, deliveries assisted by skilled
 health worker, TB positive cases successfully completing treatment and children under 5 years who received nutrition screening. The performance did
 not show any improvement in children immunization which remained stagnant
 The urban BPHS pilot faced significant challenges in implementation. The greatest challenge was the complex management structure and lack of clear
 roles and responsibilities between the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism (SM) and Kabul Provincial Health Department (KPHD). In addition, significant
 delays occurred in procurement of medicines and supplies; and the Community-Based Healthcare (CBHC) component of the urban pilot was not
 implemented successfully as only 120 Community Health Workers (CHWs) were trained by 2014 though the target was 660.
 MOPH is in the process of developing its proposal for urban BPHS for next phase of support under SEHAT project. The proposal is in draft stage and
 it’s expected to be share with the Bank by Dec 20, 2014.
 The ICR mission is planned for early January 2015 and as per schedule the ICR report will be finalized by end June 2015.
