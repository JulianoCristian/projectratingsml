                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall project performance is downgraded to moderately satisfactory as service delivery performance of implementing partners in both provinces of Balk and Samangan declined in
                         terms of quality of care and coverage of services in 2010 as compared to the previous years. In addition, development of urban BPHS proposal is making slow progress and taking
                         much longer than envisaged. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and Implementing partners have analyzed these negative trends of service delivery performance and are taking
