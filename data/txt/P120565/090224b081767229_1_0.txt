                         Overall project performance and progress toward the project development objectives (PDO) is rated as satisfactory, with the PDO level indicators estimated to be well on target.
                         Service delivery performance in both provinces of Balk and Samangan in terms of quality of care and coverage of services shows a reversal of trends with improvement in key
                         performance indicators in both of the provinces. The program implementation continues to be closely monitored with continuing dialog between MOPH and implementing partners.
