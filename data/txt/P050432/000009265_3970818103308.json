social\n            protection program. This program has been developed to\n            assist the most vulnerable groups of society who will suffer\n            from the negative income effects of macro-economic\n            stabilization and structure reform measures to be carried\n            out throughout 1997/1998. The project, consisting of a\n            single tranche, will provide financial support for the\n            Government's social protection program. This program\n            includes: child allowances, agricultural pensions, a minimum\n            income guarantee scheme, social feeding programs,\n            educational social protection, temporary income support, and\n            lifeline rates for electricity."}, "docdt": "1997-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
