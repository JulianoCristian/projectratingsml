IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3694-KO)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Environmental
Technology Development Project in Korea, for which Loan 3694-KO in the amount of
US$90 million equivalent was approved on January 6, 1994, signed on February 16, 1994
and made effective on May 11, 1994.
The loan was closed on schedule on September 30, 1998. Final disbursement
took place on March 11, 1999. There were two cancellations during the project period:
(i) the final balance of US$499,746.95 which was canceled on March 11, 1999, and (ii)
on September 15, 1998, the Government of Korea (GOK) requested a cancellation of
US$931,629.81.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Carol Hau-Lai Ball, assisted by Mr. William Rees
and Ms. Ruth Montague. The ICR was reviewed by Mr. Alan Ruby, Manager, EASHD,
and Mr. Sri-Ram Aiyer, Country Director, EACKF. A summary of the submissions to
the ICR by the nine project participating institutions is included as Annex B.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission in May 3-19, 1998, which visited the Ministry of Finance and Economy
(MOFE), and the Supply Administration, Republic of Korea (SAROK). The mission also
held a meeting at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in
Daejon City with representatives of all nine project institutions. The information in this
report is based on materials in the Project Implementation Index File, Divisional Black
Books, and submissions from the nine project institutions as well as information received
during the completion mission.  The nine project institutions contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by: (a) providing specific data upon request; and (b) contributing
their own evaluation of the project's preparation and execution. The Bank summarized
the individual evaluation summaries submitted by the nine project institutions and their
submissions are included as Annex B. No comment was provided by the Government on
the draft ICR prepared by the Bank.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3694-KO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
i.    The objective of the project was to strengthen: (a) selected national research
institutes in Korea to assist them to identify and adequately address environmental issues
and to undertake environmental research and development (R&D) activities, and (b) the
Ministry of Environment's (MOEN's) policy and planning role.
Implementation Experience
ii.    Overall implementation was satisfactory. The project was closed on schedule and
had no cost overruns. Equipment procurement for all project institutions was completed as
planned and in accordance with the Loan Agreement while the library materials procured
actually exceeded the original allocation by about 70%. The overseas training and visiting
experts components were on target or exceeded for nearly all project institutions (Table 7).
The final disbursements for these two components were, however, only 67% and 38%,
respectively, compared to the original Loan allocations. Reallocation of Loan proceeds
from the two components in favor of equipment and library materials was agreed to by the
Bank, after a review indicated that there would be no significant deviation from the original
project objectives.
iii    The actual disbursements were US$88,568,623.24 or about 98.4% of the loan
amount. Disbursements conforned to all Bank procedures and included the use of Special
Accounts (SAs).  Counterpart funds for equipment transportation and installation,
operations and maintenance, consumable materials and civil works for housing the
equipment were adequately provided throughout the life of the project.
iv.   There were nine institutions under this project under five different ministries (Table
14). Only four out of the nine institutions had had experience in implementing Bank-
financed projects, but overall there were no serious implementation problems. The most
significant problem came through the establishment of a single SA at the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) for all nine project institutions which delayed SA processing at the initial
implementation stage. When this was rectified by a Loan Amendment and nine SAs were
established, the Minimum Application Size (MAS) for Applications for Withdrawal
became too large, which required a second disbursement letter. These early disbursement
difficulties plus the inexperienced new project institutions resulted in the sending out of
several inactive SA messages from the Bank. Several also went out toward the end of the



vi
project when some of the institutions had completed their procurement ahead of schedule or
were nearing completion which meant that SA activities were less frequent than the normal
three-month minimum allowance for SA replenishment requests.
v.     In addition, audit reports from  a few  of the nine institutions were submitted
somewhat later than scheduled but none was ever seriously overdue. These delays,
however, did not adversely affect the completion schedule or the output of the project.
There were no overdue audit reports at Loan Closing, and all other covenants were in full
compliance.
vi.    The effectiveness during the later implementation years of the nine project
institutions plus the help of the experienced procurement agency of the Government of
Korea's (GOK) SAROK made project implementation satisfactory.
Results
vii.   All of the project objectives were successfully met. The project has enhanced R&D
capacities at all nine project institutions, especially in the areas of environment-related
research activities and technology development, by providing up-to-date and highly
specialized equipment, library materials, staff training and international expert services.
The project also has strengthened the role of MOEN by helping them to develop sound and
up-to-date environment-related policies.
viii.   Research activities and publications of research findings as well as receipts of patent
awards have increased steadily over the project years for all nine project institutions. Of the
total research activities conducted by the nine project institutions, 12% were environment-
related, the results of 22% were published either domestically or internationally, more than
12% were used by related industries, and 10% were awarded patents.
ix.    New environmental research centers and divisions have been established in some
project institutions and they are serving important roles in the areas of environmental
technology development. Small and medium size enterprises have also benefited from the
project-financed equipment, library materials and research results. These companies
usually lack the necessary financial resources, knowledge and equipment to develop related
industrial technologies and to focus on environmental issues, and the project institutions
have helped them to do both.
Sustainability
x.     The GOK's commitment in the two Bank-financed environment-related projects
(this project and the Environmental Research and Education Project') indicates its
awareness of the serious environment-related problems that have been caused by the rapid
This project complements the Environmental Research and Education Project (Loan 3612-KO), which assists in
strengthening the capacity of selected agricultural and veterinary colleges to address rural environmental problems.



vii
industrialization of Korea. Adequate counterpart funds have been provided for both
projects throughout the project years.
xi.  In order to develop more efficient methods of production to conserve natural
resources and reduce pressures on the environment, the GOK has responded to the
emerging environmental problems by strengthening its institutional and legal framneworks.
The Environmental Agency (EA) was upgraded to the Ministry of Environment (MOEN) in
1990, and new basic legislation was introduced. With the help of the Korea Environment
Institution (KEI) and its newly established Regional Research Site (RRS) {Table 6, Section
2 (a)}, the MOEN now leads in formulating environmental policies and coordinates and
monitors environmental planning activities.
xii.   Another indication of sustainability is GOK's support for the Cleaner Production
Technology Program organized by the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH).
This program aims at minimizing the generation of waste and pollution, and the GOK has
doubled the program budget for 1999 compared with 1998.
xiii.  Given GOK's continuous support for several environmental research programs after
the completion of this project (paras. 8 and 18) as well as the long-term commitment in
MOEN, there is reason to assume that these environment-related policies and R&D
activities will continue and that the possibility of sustaining the enhanced role of the project
institutions is very strong.
Bank Group Performance
xiv.  Overall Bank performance was highly satisfactory. Efficiency and economies of
scale were gained through combining the preparation of two environment-related projects
(para. x) with an education project, and by fielding a single mission to supervise all the
on-going education projects in Korea at the same time. Staff continuity throughout the
implementation period also improved supervision efficiency and problem-solving.
xv.   Bank supervision for this project totals about 33 staff weeks (Table 2). This
commitment of time is average by Bank standards, but extremely efficient for a project
with nine implementation agencies. The project's supervision was rated "excellent" by
the Bank's Quality Assurance Group (QAG) during FY 1997.
Borrower Performance
xvi.  Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory.  Among the nine project
institutions, some performed better than others, but good working relationships among the
nine project institutions and the Bank helped to overcome small implementation problems.
Covenants were in full compliance.
xvii.  Counterpart funds were adequate. Satisfactory facilities for housing the equipment
in each of the nine project institutions were provided. The highly specialized equipment



viii
provided by the project was well-maintained, managed, and utilized. There was no shortage
of spare parts and consumable materials.
xviii. Staff were appropriately identified and trained and visiting scholars assisted with the
research activities. Some funds for overseas training and visiting experts, due to savings
and under-programming were reallocated in favor of needed equipment and library
materials (para. ii) consistent with project objectives.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
xix.  Project performance indicators were added three years after project startup.
Impact and output indicators were set and fully met (Table 6). Research projects have
been increased and results published. Equipment is well-managed and maintained, and
its utilization rate is high. KEI has established information systems to help them do
systematic analysis and management of environmental information, leading to the
formulation of better environmental policies and governance.
xx.   Korea graduated from borrower status in June 1995; however, due to the recent
financial crisis in the region, the GOK has asked for some structural adjustment and
technical assistance loans.
xxi.  The design of this project was straight-forward and supervision work was well-
coordinated, detailed and cost-effective. Therefore, there are no major lessons to be
leamed from the project.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3694-KO)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    The objective of this project was to strengthen: (a) selected national research institutes in
Korea to assist them to identify and adequately address environmental issues and to undertake
environmental R&D activities, and (b) the Ministry of Environment's (MOEN) policy and
planning role. This would result in a better understanding of the technological aspects of
environmental problems, improved methods of measuring and monitoring key environmental
indicators and more environmentally-sound production processes, and would lead to improved
environmental policy formulation and implementation.  The Loan financed specialized
equipment, overseas training, visiting experts and library materials.
Sectoral Development Objectives
2.    There was an urgent need in Korea to develop more efficient methods of production to
conserve natural resources and to reduce pressures on the environment. Among the consequences
of Korea's rapid industralization has been the increasing degradation of the environment. Air,
water and noise pollution have become major problems. Waste disposal, in densely populated
Korea, has been another critical concern. This project was developed in response to these urgent
needs.
Policy Issues
3.    The increasing complexity of environmental issues and the growing sensitivity to them led
the GOK to broaden its existing legislation and to strengthen its implementation. The GOK also
wanted to strengthen the policy and planning functions of the responsible agency/ministry. In
1990, the Environmental Agency (EA) was upgraded to the MOEN and the Basic Environmental
Policy Law was introduced. This was supported by separate laws dealing with specific problems
such as air preservation, water preservation, noise control, hazardous substance control, solid
waste management, and marine pollution. Environmental offenders were prosecuted and
penalized for their damage to the environment. The principle of "polluter pays" was enforced and
strengthened through advanced deposits and raising the pollution excise tax on users of
environmentally harnful substances.
4.    Strengthening the legal framework was an important part of the strategy to address
environmental problems, but improving the understanding of the scientific and technical nature of
these problems was equally important, such as the basic scientific relationships bearing on



2
environmental problems, improved methods of measuring environmental degradation and more
effective monitoring arrangements. In these areas, the universities were playing an important role.
Complementing the work of the universities were the national research institutes, most of which
were under the authority of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) (Table 14). Initially
they were established in the 1960s and 1970s to provide private sector leadership in key areas of
industrial R&D. After large-scale private firms had taken over about 70% of the industrial R&D
projects, these national research institutes focused mostly on non-commercially oriented applied
research and in research support and technical assistance to small and medium size enterprises,
which lacked the resources to undertake R&D activities. Their environment-related research
projects included the development of technology to improve measurement and monitoring,
compatible products, and sound production processes as well as training of industry personnel in
these areas.
Evaluation of Objectives
5.    The GOK's objectives for this project were highly relevant to the environmental problems
caused by Korea's rapid industrialization. The results of the project research activities and
technology development are being used by related industries as well as receiving patent awards
(para.7). MOEN has assumed a more important role in the areas of policy making and planning
for environment-related matters in Korea, and they are now much more advanced and up-to-date
on global environmental issues and concerns (para. 6).
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.    All of the project objectives were fully met or exceeded. The project has facilitated and
enhanced the research capabilities of all nine project institutions, especially in the areas of
environment-related research activities and technology development. The project has also
upgraded MOEN's environment-related information systems by providing mainframe computers
and related staff training. This has greatly increased MOEN's access to the latest global
environmental information and sound solutions, and enhanced its participation in the planning and
formulation of policies for environmental concerns and in conducting its own research activities.
Sixty-eight research activities were carried out by MOEN under the project, the results of all of
them were published and most of the results were utilized as environmental policy guideline
materials.
7.    Research activities, publication of their findings, and patent awards have steadily
increased over the project years for all nine project institutions. Project institutions conducted a
total of 7,152 research projects during this time. Of these, 871 (12%) were environment-related,
the results of 1,602 (22%) were published either internationally or domestically, 860 (12%) were
used by related industries, and 692 (10%) were awarded patents.
8.    In some of the project institutions, new centers, divisions and plans were established for
the sole purpose of promoting a cleaner environment -- for example, KITECH's Textile and
Cleaner Production Technology R&D Center and its Cleaner Production Technology R&D



3
Division, and the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology's (KRIBB's)
Biotechnology Development Plan.
9.    Small and medium size enterprises also benefited from this project. Some of the project
institutions have provided advice, services and the use of equipment to these companies, which
often lack the financial resources, knowledge and equipment needed to conduct their own
environmental research projects.
C.  IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE
PROJECT
Implementation Record
10.   Overall implementation was satisfactory. There were nine institutions in this project
under five different ministries (Table 14), which in reality was like implementing nine sub-
projects. Five of them were new project institutions with no prior experience in implementing
Bank-financed projects -- therefore minor implementation hiccups were to be expected. There
were no serious implementation problems. There were two initial disbursement difficulties
(para. 11), several inactive SAs and some overdue audit reports requiring reminders from the
Bank (para. 12). None of the problems adversely affected the outcome of the project. The
project was closed on schedule with no cost or time overruns. Final disbursement reached
about 98.4% of the total loan amount.
11.   The first disbursement difficulty resulted from the agreement made by the Economic
Cooperation Bureau without the clearance of the Treasury Bureau of the MOFE that one SA
was to be opened and put under the control of the MOF (later renamed MOFE). In effect, this
made the Treasury Bureau the bookkeeper for all nine institutions. This was not convenient for
any of the parties concerned. MOFE did not have the office space or the manpower to handle
the extra work needed to track the nine project institutions' disbursement activities and to keep
the project accounts. It was not convenient for the project institutions to process their
disbursements in a timely manner while situated at different locations. This problem was
solved by the First Loan Amendment which allowed the nine institutions to have their own
SAs. The second disbursement difficulty was that the size of the MAS for Applications for
Withdrawal should have been adjusted at the same time as the Loan Amendment in proportion
to the smaller SA amounts needed by the nine individual institutions. The initial MAS of
US$300,000 was appropriate for the original single SA, but was too high for the smaller
individual SAs in processing disbursements. This difficulty was quickly resolved by a second
disbursement letter.
12.   There were several inactive SA messages from the Bank during the beginning and at the
end of the project years. The initial disbursement difficulties as mentioned in para. 11, plus the
inexperienced new project institutions resulted in the sending out of several inactive SA
messages. Other inactive SA messages near project completion were due to the fact that
several project institutions had completed their procurement ahead of schedule or were nearing
completion. Therefore SA activities were less frequent than the three-month minimum



4
allowance for SA replenishment requests. There were also some minor delays in submitting the
annual audit reports at the beginning of the implementation period, probably due to
unfamiliarity with the conditions of the covenant. Other covenants were in full compliance
(Table 10).
13.   Equipment procurement was handled by the GOK's experienced central procurement
agency, SAROK. As international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures were used for all
equipment procurement even when not required by the Loan Agreement, substantial savings
resulted, and project institutions were able to purchase more items than originally planned. All
procurement procedures were in compliance with Bank procurement guidelines.  No
irregularities have been found.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
14.   There were no major problems affecting the project, other than constant changes of
institution names (Table 14) and persons in-charge which made project monitoring difficult and
time-consuming.
Consulting Services
15.   The actual number of visiting experts was higher than originally planned (Table 7),
frequently because international experts were unable to commit to long periods in Korea.
Instead, project institutions hired more short-term experts for shorter durations. Their inputs
were valuable and highly relevant and improved the quality of the research activities (para.7).
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
16.   The GOK has a very clear understanding of the enviromnent-related problems that have
resulted from Korea's rapid industralization and densely populated cities. Its continuous support
for this project and for the Environmental Research and Education Project (Loan 3612-KO) are
obvious indications of GOK's awareness in these areas. There has been no shortage of
counterpart funds for both projects even during the country's financial crisis period, which started
in September 1997.
17.   The GOK's strengthening of the planning and policy-making functions of MOEN by
upgrading the EA to a line ministry, is another indication of its long-term commitment to solving
its environmental problems. MOEN now leads in formulating environmental policies and
coordinates and monitors environmental planning activities.
18.   The GOK will continue its support to several research institutions' environment-related
programs and centers (para. 8), and KEI's RRS, even after the completion of this project, and in
some areas program budgets will be doubled in line with the national plan, such as for KITECH's
Cleaner Production Technology Program.



5
19.   All the research institutions' equipment is well-maintained and managed, and highly
utilized. O&M funds for the future operation of the equipment are expected to be adequate. The
national research institutions' R&D activities are also on an upward trend (para. 7).
20.   All of the above indications strongly suggest that the development objectives of the
project will continue to be met for years to come.
E. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
21.   Overall Bank performance was highly satisfactory. Efficiency was gained during the
preparation stage by combining the preparation of this project with preparation of both the
Environmental Research and Education Project (Ln. 3612-KO), and the Science and Technical
Education Project (Ln. 3693-KO).  Economies of scale were also achieved during
implementation by fielding a single mission to supervise all the on-going education projects in
Korea at the same time. In addition, the continued involvement throughout the implementation
period of original team members, most notably the task manager and his technical consultant
for advice and supervision activities as well as for training new task managers prevented the
lost of project information and resulted in timely and effective problem-solving.
22.   Supervision work was well-coordinated, detailed and cost-effective. An early project
launch workshop for all project institutions aimed at preventing implementation mishaps and
delays was considered money well-spent. Small implementation hiccups during the beginning
years (paras. 11 and 12) were quickly dealt with and corrected in a timely manner. As a result,
the project supervision team received an "excellent" award from the Bank's QAG during
FY1997.
23.   Although it was time-consuming and difficult to monitor nine sub-project institutions
with constant changes of names and persons in-charge (para. 14), Bank staff continuity and
efficiency in supervision have helped keep the time spent on this project to a minimum 33 staff
weeks (para. 21).
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
24.   Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory. Each of the nine project institutions
carried out its own project activities on individual time schedules. Among them, some
performed better than others. Minor implementation hiccups, such as inactive SAs and slight
delays in submitting audit reports and/or ICR data and evaluation summaries were all overcome
by good working relationships with the Bank teams, effective communications, and the taking
of timely corrective actions (paras. 11 and 12).
25.   Equipment procurement was handled by SAROK which is well-experienced and
efficient (para. 13). Technical specifications were revised according to the latest technology
and were tailored to meet the individual project institution's particular needs.  Other
procurement procedures were also in compliance with the Bank's guidelines including the



6
direct contracting procedures for procurement of the library materials and the hiring of
international experts.
26.   There were no shortages in counterpart funds for the installation and transportation of
project-financed equipment, consumable materials and O&M costs. Satisfactory facilities for
housing the equipment in each of the nine project institutions were provided. Equipment was
well managed and maintained and the utilization rate was high.
27.   There were minor Loan reallocations for some project institutions due to savings in
procurement and under-programming of staff training and visiting experts in favor of additional
equipment and library materials. Nevertheless, overall staff training needs and technical
assistance from international experts were met and not sacrificed.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
28.   Overall project objectives were successfully achieved. Research capabilities of the nine
project institutions have been enhanced, and the role of MOEN in policy-making and planning
has been strengthened (para. 6). Project institutions have steadily over the years increased their
R&D activities and the results have been published either internationally or domestically. Most of
their findings have been used by related industries and some have been awarded patents (para. 7).
All project performance indicators were fully met and/or exceeded (Table 6), and the GOK
remains committed to supporting the national research institutions (para. 18). Equipment is well-
managed and maintained, and highly utilized by the research staff and the related communities.
These are strong indications that research activities tackling Korea's environment-related
problems will be continued.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
29.   Korea graduated from borrower status in June 1995; however, due to the recent financial
crisis in the East Asia region, GOK has asked for some structural adjustment and technical
assistance loans.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
30.   The design of this project was straight-forward and supervision work was well-
coordinated, detailed and cost effective. Therefore, there are no major lessons to be learned from
the project.

Table 6: Key Indicators for Project Operation
1.    The project would strengthen selected national research institutes to identify and
adequately address environmental issues and to undertake environmental R&D activities.
Impact Indicators:
(a)   Participating institutions will implement at least 10 R&D activities with
environmental concerns by the end of the project. The results exceeded
expectations -- a total of 871 environment-related R&D projects were
conducted.
(b)   Participating institutions will increase the publication ofjournal articles and
scientific papers relating to environmental concerns by 40% by the end of
the project. The results of about 1600 R&D activities were published,
although final evaluation submissions from the participating institutions did
not indicate how many were environment-related. However, it can be
assumed that the target was achieved.
Output Indicators:
(a)   Where planned in the respective participating institutions, staff training will
be implemented according to the implementation plan. This was largely
achieved, although not to 100% in every participating institution; however,
staff training needs have been generally met.
(b)   In each of the nine participating institutions, equipment procurement will be
implemented according to the implementation plan. Implementation was
completed on schedule for all institutions.
(c)   Computer systems will be enhanced according to an established plan in all
participating institutions. All needed computer systems have been procured,
and their utilization rate is high.
2.    The Project would assist MOEN to lead in formulating environmental policies and
enhance its role in coordinating and monitoring environmental planning activities.
Impact Indicator:
(a)   MOEN (or KEI) will demonstrate its increased participation in the planning
and formulation of policies for environmental concerns by increasing its
interaction with participating institutions and by increasing its publication
rate by at least 20% by the end of the project. The achievement exceeded the
plan -- all environmental information systems (KEINS, KLIS, GIS, INS



15
linked with IGBP/DIS2) have been completed and are in use. The RRS has
also been established in KEI. The results of the 68 environment-related
R&D activities were published and are being used mostly by industries and
as materials for environmental policy guidelines.
Output Indicators:
(a)    50% of the staff training will be provided to MOEN personnel by 1996; by
the ICR year training will be complete. Although the number of people
trained fell short of the Appraisal estimate, staff training for the needs of
MOEN has been generally met for this project.
(b)    Equipment and facilities will be upgraded to support the planning and policy
formulation role by MOEN. Equipment procurement has been completed at
a cost of about 70% of original estimates, largely due to lower mainframe
prices obtained through the international competitive bidding process.

Geographical Information System; INS - the International Environmental System; IGBP - the International
Geographic-Biosphere Program; and DIS - Data Information System.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
IBRD Progress Review Mission - May, 1998
Environmental Technology Development Project
Loan 3694-KO
Aide Memoire 1/
1.    The IBRD Mission 2/ visited Korea between May 3 and 19, 1998, to review the
implementation progress of three World Bank financed projects and perform the tasks of
a project completion mission for one of the three projects. This Aide Memoire will
address only one, Loan 3694-KO. During the course of its review, the mission received
nine status reports and had a meeting at KAIST, Daejon, with representatives of all nine
participating institutions 3/ of the project. The mission would like to take this opportunity
to express its appreciation for the kind assistance offered to the mission members and
special thanks to KAIST for allowing IBRD to hold the meeting at KAIST and providing
assistance and hospitality. The mission also visited the Treasury Division of the Ministry
of Finance and Economy (MOFE) and the Supply Administration, Republic of Korea
(SAROK).
2.    The overall progress of the project is generally satisfactory. The status of
procurement and disbursements planned and achieved for the nine participating
institutions in this project are summarized in Annex 1, and is considered as satisfactory.
Six out of nine institutions have completed or nearly completed implementation. Annex
2 provides a summary of the implementation of Overseas Training and Visiting Experts
in the seven institutions concerned. Implementation of these two components can only be
considered as fair.
Unused Loan Proceeds by Closing Date
3.    Seven of the nine institutions stated that there would not be any significant
amount of unused loan proceeds by the time of the Closing Date, September 30, 1998.
However, SERI and KEI stated respectively that about US$0.6 million and US$0.8
million might not be used by the Closing Date. The mission pointed out that: (a) for this
1 / This Aide Memoire is subject to review and modification by Bank management.
2/ The mission comprised Ms. Carol H.L. Ball (Task Team Leader, EASED), and Sing Zak Sung
(Consultant).
3/ See Annex 3 for their full names and their responsible ministries.



26                           ANNEX A

loan, there will not be any extension of the Closing Date; and (b) the unused fund would
be cancelled from the total loan amount.
4.    KAIST would like to use an additional US$0.5 million of the unused fund as
mentioned in para. 3 above for buying more library materials. MOFE indicated to the
mission that the request, if forthcoming, would be duly reviewed and a quick decision on
its approval would be made taking into consideration of the proximity of the Closing
Date and the lead time for procurement and disbursement.
5.    The Bank would normally have no objection to any transfer of small percentage
of loan funds between categories of expenditures at a time near a loan's closing date, as
long as the project's development objectives are not adversely affected. There is also no
need for an amendment of the Loan Agreement of minor transfer of funds between
institutions within the same project. The Bank would respect the Government's decision
while still achieving the original development objectives.
6.   In this particular case, the request for transfer is probably under 1% of this loan's
total amount (US$90.0 million), the mission's view is that the Bank would not have any
objection, if so requested to MOFE, and MOFE approves it. This would not adversely
affect the project's development objectives.
Matters Related to Implementation Activities At The Time Near the Closing Date
7.    At a late stage of project implementation, ICB and NCB procurement procedures
are not suitable, because the lead time is too long. More suitable procurement procedures
are prudent shopping procedures for equipment, and direct negotiations with suppliers for
library materials. The lead time for each is short. There should be enough time for
completing the transactions, particularly for delivering the goods to the Purchaser before
the Closing Date. This is crucial because expenditures for goods and services delivered
after the closing date are not eligible for disbursement.
8.    A suitable disbursement procedure to be used at a late stage of project
implementation is "Direct Payment to Suppliers" for which Form 1903 should be used.
This would obviate two difficulties: (i) the use of Special Commitment would involve the
issuance of a Letter of Credit (L/C), for which the expiry date may be after the Closing
Date, and the Bank would not honor such L/Cs; and (ii) the Special Account (SA) used
may not have a large enough balance to cover the transaction during the SA recovery
period near the Closing Date.
9.    Sometimes payments on eligible expenditures could not be all made before the
Closing Date. The Bank, however, could grant a grace period of four months after the
Closing Date to facilitate such payments. The Bank would usually agree to this request,
if asked for, and the mission recommends to Bank management granting such grace
period for the nine institutions.

Review of Bid Evaluation Reports and Contract Awards
10.   During the visit to SAROK, the mission reviewed recent bid evaluation reports
and contract awards made for the nine institutions during this review period. From a
sample coverage of about 25%, no irregularities were found. All awards were made to
the lowest evaluated bidders. Single bids, if responsive and of reasonable price, were
awarded contracts without retendering. There was no negotiations of prices after bid
opening. SAROK's performance is satisfactory.
Review of Statement of Expenditures and the Supporting Vouchers
11.   The mission's review covered all institutions except KEI, which had no
expenditure during this review period. Sample coverage ranged between 22% and 100%
of their entries in the applications of withdrawal. All the supporting vouchers (contracts
and receipts) matched with the entries on the SOEs. The review, therefore, indicated the
eight institutions' satisfactory operation of both the Special Account and the SOEs.
Covenant Compliance and Audit Reports
12.   All covenants in the Loan Agreement were in full compliance. The audit reports
for expenditures made in the Korea's Fiscal Year of 1997 (January 1 to December 31)
should reach the Bank on or before June 30, 1998. One such report was received during
this mission. It contained the Independent Auditor's opinion in general but did not
include a separate opinion on the Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). As this is a
requirement in the Loan Agreement, the mission reminded this institution to make good
on this shortcoming before June 30, 1998. This message was conveyed to the other eight
institutions during the meeting at KAIST.
Inactive Special Accounts
13.   Five of the nine institutions have inactive Special Accounts according to the
record of our Disbursement Division. These five institutions were asked to communicate
with our Disbursement Division and provide either application for withdrawal or to
refund the balance of the Special Account to the following World Bank account:
Federal Reserve Bank of New York
33 Liberty Street, NY, NY 10045, USA
Account IBRD A-General ABA no. 210-8138-3
Attention: Foreign Department
Reference: IBRD Loan 3694-KO, SA Refund for (Name of Institution, e.g. KRISS)
Research Activities
14.  In all the institutions in this project, research activities continued to increase
annually together with the number of environment-related research topics. The mission is



28                              ANNEX A
Page 4 of 11
satisfied with their reports. More detailed information will be provided to the Bank as
required in the Questionnaire (see Annex 4) for the preparation of the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR).
Preparation of ICR
15.  It is the Bank's policy to prepare an ICR for each project after its Closing Date.
The purpose is to evaluate the success or failure of the project. Whether the development
objectives had been achieved as anticipated. Is there a cost- or time- overrun? Whether
the performance of the Borrower and of the Bank during the implementation of the
project had been satisfactory? Is the project sustainable after its completion? What are
the measures taken by the Borrower to make it sustainable? What are the lessons learned
for the Borrower and the Bank? For example, is it worth being replicated in other
developing countries?
16.   For achieving the above tasks, both the Bank's and the Borrower's effort is
needed. Accordingly the mission prepared a Questionnaire (Annex 4) and presented it to
the representatives of the nine institutions at the meeting at KAIST for comments and
improvements. The draft was approved during the meeting.
17.   There is a due date for the ICR in its final form to reach the Bank's Executive
Directors for their review and comments. This due date is March 31, 1999, six months
after this Loan's Closing Date. Therefore a time schedule is needed for the preparation of
the ICR. The mission's draft time schedule was also presented at the KAIST meeting,
discussed and approved by the nine institutions' representatives. It is included in this
Aide Memoire as Annex 5. Any comments, if provided, will be included in the ICR. The
mission also stressed the importance of adherence to the time schedule, so that the ICR in
its final form could be delivered by the due date.
Next Mission
18.   There will be no more progress review missions from the Bank for this project, as
the Closing Date is September 30, 1998.

SUMMARY OF SUBMISSIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF KOREA'S
NINE PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
The loan amount of US$90 million, allocated to nine project institutions, was
98.4% disbursed. The components of the loan were: equipment (US$80.8 million);
overseas training (US$5.1 million); library materials (US$2.4 million); and visiting
experts (US$1.7 million).  Implementation of these components was generally
satisfactory but in a small number of cases, procurement fell short of targets.
Implementation experience is summarized as follows:
Equipment
The procurement of equipment was successfully completed in eight institutions.
KEI fell short with only about 70% of the loan amount allocated to equipment being
disbursed. Equipment procurement was managed successfully by SAROK in association
with the institutions. There was a tendency for procurement to lag behind planned levels
in the early years of the project but shortfalls were overcome in the later years.
Overseas Training
Seven institutions financed overseas training. This was successfully completed in
five institutions but ETRI and KRIBB fell well short of training targets. Disbursements
were only 33.4% for ETRI and 23.7% for KRIBB, respectively. The shortfall in KRIBB
was the result, in part, of a reallocation of loan funds in favor of equipment and library
materials at the expense of overseas training and visiting experts (see below).
Library Materials
Five institutions procured library materials.  KAIST secured an additional
allocation of US$300,000 to procur^ research and teaching materials. KRIBB also
exceeded its allocation for library materials by about 20%.
Visiting Experts
Six institutions financed visiting experts. This was successfully completed in four
institutions. ETRI and KRIBB again fell short of targets with disbursements of 56.6%
and 33.0% respectively. KRIBB's reallocation of loan funds, noted above, resulted in the
reduction of visiting experts.
Other Project Outcomes
Although data coverage was limited, institutions indicated substantial increases in
key indicators during the first three years of the project (1995-97).

ANNEX B
Page 2 of 32
* Nine institutions showed increases in research projects averaging 7% per year.
* Five institutions showed increases in research publications averaging 45% per year.
* Four institutions showed increases in patent awards averaging 67% per year.
* Regarding the utilization rate of equipment, five institutions provided estimates in the
range of 75%-100%. Three institutions, which did not provide a numerical estimate,
indicated that utilization rates were high to very high.
* All institutions indicated that the overall objective of the project i.e. to strengthen the
R&D capabilities and, where relevant, teaching capacities, had been successfully
achieved.
Individual evaluation summaries from the nine project participating institutions are
included here as attachments.

1. Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) was established with
the aim of nurturing highly qualified scientists and engineers proficient in the in-depth
learning of fundamental knowledge and practical application, and the aim of promoting
basic and applied research to raise Korea's strength in science and technology. Today,
KAIST has successfully consolidated itself as the nation's best research-oriented science
and engineering educational institution, playing the leading role in the development and
advancement of science and technology.
2. In the pursuit of systematic and effective education for the scientifically gifted,
KAIST was founded by and remains under the auspices of the Ministry of Science and
Technology rather than the Ministry of Education, as is the case with all the other
universities. This ensures KAIST a full financial support from the government and a
greater operational flexibility. Furthermore, KAIST enjoys a special geographical
advantage of being situated within the Taeduk Science Town along with other
universities, public and private research institutes as well as venture businesses. This
creates an ideal environment for our faculty and students, to obtain maximum results
from their endeavors in academic and research fields through mutual cooperation and
exchange.
3. Over the past 28 years, KAIST has produced about 18,700 graduates, including 3,400
Ph.D. degree holders, all of whom are now carrying out a central role in the
development of science and technology in many spheres but not limited to universities
and research institutes at home and abroad, government and industries. Annual research
projects of over 1,000, totaling approximately US$58 million, and a continuous stream
of major, quality research papers show that KAIST is truly a research-oriented
university.
4. Our potential to grow as a world class science and engineering university has already
been proven, amply, by receiving some of the highest recognition from both local and
international communities. As a testament to our superior qualities, KAIST was ranked
the overall first in 1995, 1998 Joong Ang Daily Newspaper Nationwide University
Evaluations, and the first in 1996 Nationwide Evaluation of Information-oriented
Universities by Dong-A Daily Newspaper. Furthermore, KAIST graduate programs
were rated as being in the top 10% in relation to US colleges and universities in the 1992
ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering & Technology) Evaluation.

5. KAIST believes that these achievements have been realized with the support from the
Korean government and from the World Bank, provided over a number of occasions. In
particular, it is regarded that the recent Environmental Technology Development Project
(Loan No.3694-KO) has contributed enormously to facilitate and promote
environmentally related academic and research activities at our university.
6. The following categorically summarizes the results and evaluations of the activities
undertaken in relation to the Environmental Technology Development Project by our
university.
1) Equipment Purchase
o A total of 415 items purchased; in some cases more upgraded and improved
equipment than the ones originally planned for purchase were procured.
o Environmentally related equipment with educational purposes were purchased
for sharing among departments such as civil engineering, chemical engineering,
biology and chemistry, whose works are closely related to the environment. In
particular, a substantial amount of equipment provided to the Energy and
Environment Research Center meant that truly in-depth researches could be
performed.
o Also, with a proportion of the total purchase devoted to the equipment required
for the computerization of campus, they will significantly assist in establishing
an intelligent campus.
o In conclusion, all these equipment purchases have greatly contributed to
enhancing the level of quality of teaching and research at KAIST.
2) Library Materials Purchase
o As originally planned, 12,520 academic serials in 1,1880 titles, 4,957 book
volumes and 8 titles of CD-ROM databases have been purchased.
o In addition, the supplementary loan of US$300,000.00 provided at the
conclusion of the Project permitted an additional procurement of publications
needed for teaching and research.
o The expansion of data in the form of books, serials, etc. has not only supported
academic and research activities of our faculty and students, but provided
essential science and technology information to research institutes in Taeduk
Science Town and to other institutes at home and abroad. Furthermore, it has
given our library an opportunity to develop into a specialist library in national
science and technology.
3) Fellowships
o The duration of fellowships varied, ranging from 2 months to 6 months and 12
months; it, however, was adjusted with respect to the nature of training.

Page 8 of 32
Attachment 2
o In order to widen the scale of fellowship training, the amount of financial
support per head was reduced and, hence, an increased number of faculty from
the number originally planned was provided with the opportunity to participate
in attaining advanced technologies from overseas.
- Original plan: 60 persons, 360 man-months
- Actual implementation: 130 persons, 779.3 man-months
4) Visiting Experts
o The actual implementation of securing visiting environmental experts consisted
mainly of short-term visits rather than the long-term visits as stated in the
original plan.
- Original plan: 17 persons, 360 man-days
- Actual implementation: 29 persons, 279 man-days
o The reason for the actual implementation result was because, in many cases, it
was difficult for the visiting experts to stay a longer term to meet other
commitments.
o Also, the need for visiting experts was partly decreased with the
implementation of overseas training by our own faculty.
7. In conclusion, the IBRD Environmental Technology Development Project (Loan
No.3694-KO) has been a successful one, which has contributed immensely to KAIST
with the identification of environmental issues, the strengthening of capacity to address
those issues adequately and to undertake environmental research and development
activities.
8. We thank the World Bank, again, for supporting the Environmental Technology
Development Project (Loan No.3694-KO). Especially, we would like to express our
most sincere thanks to Sing-Zak Sung, Carol Ball, Gaye Lindsey, Robert McGough and
Alan Ruby for their assistance to allow the Project to be carried out without a hiccup
right from the start to the end.

2. 3 Problems with Implementation
KITECH encountered no major difficulties in regard to the implementation of
the Loan 3694-KO Project and there were no noteworthy delays. KITECH
wishes to express its thanks to the E3RD and other related agencies for their
support and cooperation.
3. Impact on the Loan Project
The Loan Project enhanced KITECH' s ability to conduct research into
developing environment-related technology. The Loan has helped the institute
acquire necessary equipment to carry out its works in this field.
In addition, the overseas training and technical assistance obtained from the
Loan Project has helped facilitate KITECH's research into the development of
environment-related technologies.
Over the course of the implementation, KITECH carried out, 55 research
projects related to environment technology.  Many of the results obtained
have been transferred to the industrial sector. In addition, 27 patents were
received between 1995 and 1998.
KITECH has start to put a greater emphasis on the development of
environmentally sound technologies. To facilitate the implementation of the
Loan Project(3694-KO), KITECH organized the Textile & Cleaner Prouction
Technology R&D Center in 1995. The proceeds of the Loan helped secure the
necessary equipment to carry out environmental research.
In September of 1998, the completion month of the Loan Project, KITECH
set up the Cleaner Production Technology R&D Division, which is solely
devoted to research in environmental technology. The Division assist the local
manufacturing industry cope with increasingly stringent environmental
regulation both in and out of Korea. The Division works to develop
technologies that minimize the generation of waste and pollution, rather than
focusing on ways to deal with pollution after it has been created.

Page 13 of 32
Attachment 3
KITECH's efforts are in line with the position of the Korean govenrnent.
The institute is the supervising body for the Cleaner Production Technology
Program, which brings together interested parties from the industry, academia
and the research sector. As an indication of the growing importance of the
environmental issue, the goveronment has nearly doubled the program budget
for 1999 compared to this year.
KITECH's tasks include the planning and coordination of the program  as
well as follow-up supervision after the completion of research.
In addition to a wide range of environment-related research projects, seminar
and conferences are organized to keep up to date on the latest advances in
the field of cleaner production technology.
Along the line of KITECH' s objectives, the institute works to support and
medium sized manufacturers. Theses companies often lack the necessary
financial resources and equipment to concenturate on environmental issues.
The institute provides assistance to smaller firms that are involved with
development of clear production techniques.
4. Conclusion
The Loan Project enabled KITECH to accumulate experience and know-how
in the field of environment-related technology. KITECH is taking a proactive
stance in regard to the development of this field.  The procurement of
equipment has facilitated research at the institute while information gained
from overseas training and visiting experts helped broaden our researcher's
perspectives and knowledge base.
The IBRD Loan project also laid the foundation for close Multinational and
bilateral cooperation, expecially in the area of environment-related technology.
KITECH hopes to build on this foundation to pursue cooperative projects with
other countries.   An example of such  a project is the "South-South
Cooperation" which we have discussed with the Bank on previous occasions.
With international boundaries becoming less defined, KITECH hopes to make
use of the know-how and experience accumulated through the Loan Project
by taking part in similar projects in the future.

Environmental Technology Development Project
Evaluation Summary (Loan 3694-Ko)
1.  Objective
Mankind has achieved modem civilization through the advancement of
science and technology since the Industrial Revolution. However, the crisis of
fossil energy, the major driving force of the mechanical civilization, and the
increased pollution caused by industrial development has begun to threaten the
eco-systems in which we live. It has begun to show the limits of growth of the
modem industrial society. It has been recognized that continued socio-economic
development requires a tangible solution for the current environmental problems
to ensure a better life and to improve the quality of life.
There is no choice, but that mankind must seek alternative ways of life and
the advancement of science and technology to solve such urgent problems as
energy resources, and conservation of environment for the future sustainable
living and continued prosperity of mankind.
The objective of this loan project is to find clues to solution for the
global problems of environment and resources by using biotechnology, including
genetic engineering, which has become an important tool for the solution of the
current environmental problems.
