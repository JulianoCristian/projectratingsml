Korea graduated from borrower status\n            in June 1995; however, due to the recent financial crisis in\n            East Asia, the government has asked for some structural\n            adjustment and technical assistance loans. The design of\n            this project was straight-forward and supervision work was\n            well-coordinated, detailed, and cost-effective. Therefore,\n            there are no major lessons to be learned from the project."}, "docdt": "1999-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
