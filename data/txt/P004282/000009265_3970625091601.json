In light of these, the National Electricity\n            Board of the States of Malaya's (NEB) immediate concern\n            is to maximize the operational efficiency of its existing\n            facilities and optimize the use of the country's energy\n            resources.  The Energy Efficiency and Plant Rehabilitation\n            Project seeks to achieve these objectives, through emphasis\n            on improving the efficiency of thermal power stations,\n            replacing oil with natural gas as the primary fuel for power\n            generation, introducing a more effective maintenance\n            management system for thermal and hydro power plants,\n            rationalizing the transmission system, modernizing system\n            operation and control, and furthering specific institutional\n            capabilities.  The project specifically includes:  (a)\n            rehabilitation of 1,290 MW of plant at Tuanku Jaafar, Prai\n            and Sultan Iskandar from oil to oil/gas firing; and (c)\n            introduction of computerized maintenance management systems\n            at all major thermal and hydro stations.  It also provides\n            for the (d) modernization of the national load dispatch\n            center; (e) installation of regional distribution control\n            centers; (f) installation of transmission lines; (g)\n            installation of nine substations; and (h) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
