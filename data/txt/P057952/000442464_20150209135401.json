The institution seeks to involve ordinary people at\n            every step: citizens select their most pressing needs,\n            submit a proposal to the fund, and cover 10 percent of a\n            micro-project's cost through contributions in cash,\n            building materials or labor. 20 new students signed up at\n            the beginning of the school year.
