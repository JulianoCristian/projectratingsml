Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) The improved poverty targeting strategy\n            developed under the ASIF II Progress contributed\n            significantly to the project's ability to benefit the\n            poorest communities and to poverty reduction in Armenia. The\n            lesson that can drawn here is the importance of having a\n            clearly formulated poverty targeting and an allocation\n            mechanism based on objective criteria and poverty data\n            ensuring the flow of project benefits to the neediest\n            segments of the population; 2) Experience under the ASIF\n            program, as in other SIF programs, has underlined the\n            importance of delivering good quality community works\n            projects identified as priority projects by poor\n            communities; 3) The approach of the ASIF II project to\n            integrate multi-sector community-based projects with local\n            institution building and self-management has been effective\n            in ensuring the sustainability of its operations. The\n            success of this approach derives from the convergence of\n            several mutually reinforcing factors: (i) deliberate\n            responsiveness to local needs and priorities; (ii) local\n            institutional capacity building complementing the\n            Government's decentralization policy; (iii) innovations\n            in poverty targeting, promotion and outreach; and (iv)\n            systematic and continuous monitoring and evaluation; and 4)\n            During project design and in the course of project\n            implementation, discussions with the ASIF and with the\n            Government focused on the strengths of the ASIF, the\n            opportunities ahead, the challenges the ASIF is likely to\n            face in the medium and longer term, and the vision of its\n            future role. These discussions were important as they\n            contributed to the process of gradually mapping the future\n            direction of the ASIF."}, "docdt": "2007-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
