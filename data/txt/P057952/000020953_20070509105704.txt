F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The aim of the ASIF II Project was to support the Government's continuing efforts to
improve the living standards of its lower income groups among the Armenian population



                                                ii

and to strengthen institutions at the local level. The specific objectives of the project were
to:
  (i) Improve basic social and economic infrastructure that can result in immediate
improvements of the living conditions of the poorest among the population and short-
term employment opportunities.
  (ii) Develop partnerships at the local level between the local government authorities
and communities through effective outreach programs to improve planning, coordination,
management, and information dissemination activities.
  (iii) Enhance greater stakeholder participation and empowerment at the local level, by
supporting the decentralization of activities which will provide clearer roles, and greater
accountability for the local governments and communities in the design, implementation,
sustainability of microprojects, and the eventual transition to direct contracting of works.
  (iv) Promote institution building and social capital formation at the local level focusing
on strengthening local government and communities in decentralized management of
basic public services.
  (v)   Promote private sector development by creating opportunities for the local
construction industry, fostering competitive bidding processes, and by training small-
scale contractors.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)


1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance)


Armenia is a small, landlocked, mountainous country in the Caucasus Region, with limited natural
resources and a population estimated at 3.2 million. The country experienced a virtual collapse of
its economy after independence in 1991. By the end of 1993, real GDP shrank by more than 50
percent relative to the pre-transition level, real wages had fallen to about 6 percent of their 1991
level, and hyperinflation of over 1000 percent had thrown a vast majority of the population into
poverty.   To address these problems, the Government launched a macroeconomic stabilization
program in 1994, and as a result, the economy began to recover with real GDP growth rates of 5.4
and 6.9 percent in 1994 and 1995. Some improvement in living conditions was achieved; the
average wage doubled in real terms between 1994 and 1996 and substantial increases were
achieved in the proportion of households with electricity and piped water. Nevertheless, the
1996/97 Household Budget Survey showed that about 55 percent of the population was living
below the poverty line and 28 percent of the population was under the food line. The average wage
was still only one-third of its 1992 level. Although the trend of rapidly increasing inequality
appeared to have stabilized since 1994, it remained very high. The Gini coefficient for per capita
income distribution had reached 0.58 compared to the pre-transition level of 0.26 in 1989. For
household expenditures, which are more consistent, the Gini coefficient was estimated at 0.44 in
1996. Nevertheless, in 1996/97, per capita consumption was still 18 times higher in the top decile
than for the poorest 10 percent.

These problems were aggravated by natural disasters (notably the devastating 1988 earthquake
which left thousands without shelter, property or basic means of existence), and the immigration of
some 360,000 refugees after the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, plus an unprecedented energy crisis.
A large number of ethnic Armenian refugees who had become internally displaced persons were
living in very poor dwellings. Furthermore, Armenia still needed to change from its central
planning during the Soviet rule of more than 70 years, and to redress a) subsequent lack of
infrastructure maintenance, and b) inadequate social assistance due to underdeveloped government
capacity and insufficient funds.     Although Armenia remains a centralized state, incremental
development of a decentralization policy and a comprehensive legislative framework for local self-
government since the mid-1990s created new possibilities. In line with the Armenian constitution
of 1995, the Government took steps to create an effective decentralized administrative structure by
delegating service delivery functions to the local self-government units supported by the Armenian
Law on Local Self-Government introduced in 2002. The Law introduced incremental changes and
represented a further development in strengthening the framework for decentralization. A number
of amendments to the law were introduced in 2004. In 2005, a new Law on Municipal Service was
adopted, with provisions concerning the hiring, qualifications, and terms of reference and security
of tenure of municipal employees.

In 1995, the ASIF I Project was designed to support the key objectives of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy to raise the living standards of the people by reducing the pockets of poverty
that had emerged over the years.        Specifically the ASIF I Project      sought to reverse the
deterioration of basic social services infrastructure and stimulate some short-term employment,
thereby generating a positive, visible impact on the people and reducing hardship during the
economic transition.     The ASIF I Project successfully achieved this objective with the



                                                    5

implementation of nearly 200 microprojects and approximately 470,000 community members in
Armenia benefiting form microprojects. At a broader level, the Project has given primacy to the
active involvement of community members in decisions which affect the quality of their lives by
putting in place a framework for greater stakeholder participation.             It promoted self-help
mechanisms, increased the sense of community ownership, promoted greater cohesion among
members, and set the foundation for future social fund operations.


Against this backdrop, the 1997 CAS judged that the country's difficulties and meager economic
prospects meant that Armenia's future economic growth was unlikely to lift many out of poverty
quickly. It concluded that directly targeted remedial interventions were necessary to improve the
living conditions of those who had not benefited from economic growth. On this basis, the Bank
decided to mount a follow-up operation to its first assistance to the Armenian Social Investment
Fund. This led to the ASIF II Project, on which the Government and IDA signed a Credit
Agreement in May 2000. The Project was designed to build a link between, on the on hand,
initiatives to support local communities and the engagement of members of the community in
decision-making, and, on the other, efforts to strengthen local government and implement the
Government of Armenia's decentralization program.

6.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The aim of the ASIF II Project was to support the Government's continuing efforts to improve the
living standards of its lower income groups among the Armenian population and to strengthen
institutions at the local level. The specific objectives of the project were to:
     (i)     Improve basic social and economic infrastructure that can result in immediate
             improvements of the living conditions of the poorest among the population and short-
             term employment opportunities.
     (ii)    Develop partnerships at the local level between the local government authorities and
             communities through effective outreach programs to improve planning, coordination,
             management, and information dissemination activities.
     (iii)   Enhance greater stakeholder participation and empowerment at the local level, by
             supporting the decentralization of activities which will provide clearer roles, and
             greater accountability for the local governments and communities in the design,
             implementation, sustainability of microprojects, and the eventual transition to direct
             contracting of works.
     (iv)    Promote institution building and social capital formation at the local level focusing on
             strengthening local government and communities in decentralized management of
             basic public services.
     (v)     Promote private sector development by creating opportunities for the local
             construction industry, fostering competitive bidding processes, and by training small-
             scale contractors.


The key performance indicators approved include: (i) completed infrastructure projects; (ii) short-
term employment generation; (iii) satisfactory ratings by beneficiaries regarding quality of works
and services received; (iv) trained local municipal officers in financial management, budgeting,
accounting, and asset management and development of three-year plans with budget lines for the
maintenance of public facilities developed by municipal officers, as a result of financial
management training; (v) trained members of Implementing Agencies (IAs); (vi) trained school
accountants, school principals, and school council members in support of the decentralized school
governance program; (vii) trained local contractors; (viii) satisfactory ratings by trainees regarding



                                                     6

the quality and relevance of the training programs carried out under the project covering financial
management training, school training, contractor training; and Implementing Agency (IA)
training; (ix) participation of local contractors in ASIF infrastructure projects as an indicator for
creating opportunities for the local construction industry; (x) Implementing Agencies (IAs) formed
for microproject supervision and types of participants; (xi) community meetings organized during
microproject promotion and types of participants; (xii) satisfactory ratings by beneficiaries
regarding levels of participation relating to microprojects; (xiii) satisfactory ratings by
beneficiaries regarding partnerships formed with local governments as a result of microprojects;
and (xix) short-term employment generation.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification


The Project objectives and key indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised
(briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO, as
well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)

The ASIF II Project targeted the following main beneficiaries: (a) the poorest communities of
Armenia in both rural and urban areas; (b) poor primary and secondary school children in urban
and rural areas; (c) poor farmers in urban and rural areas; (d) poor urban and rural households; (e)
vulnerable groups such as ethnic Armenian refugees; (f) private contractors participating in
competitive tendering of small works; (g) local governments at the city (city councils, mayors) and
community level (village councils, mayors); (h) established community-based associations (e.g.
Schools Councils, Water Users Associations, Condominium Associations); and (i) local-based
training entities (e.g. Finance Officers Association, Mayors Association).

Original Components (as approved)

With the support of the IDA Credit of SDR 14.9 million, co-financing from UK-funded DFID in
the amount of GBP 1.2 million, and community contribution of US$ 2.0 million, the ASIF II
Project was designed to support the following three project components, as approved.

Component 1. Rehabilitation of Small-Scale Infrastructure (original base cost US$24.11
million): Building upon the work carried out under the ASIF I project, the ASIF II project sought
to rehabilitate basic social and economic infrastructure at the local level through the financing of
microprojects. To ensure the sustainability of project outcomes, the ASIF II project was to
intensify institution building at the local level. Accordingly, the ASIF II project was to finance a
comprehensive capacity building and technical assistance program benefiting implementing
agencies, local governments, contractors and ASIF staff.

Financing of Microprojects to Support the Rehabilitation of Small-Scale Infrastructure Sub-
Component: The microproject types to be proposed and carried out by Implementing Agencies
included: kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, special schools for disabled children, art,
music and sports schools, children's playground in urban areas, local health posts, water supply
systems, sewage and sanitation systems and irrigation works. The project would also finance: (i)
microprojects involving the rehabilitation or upgrading of school heating systems to better assure
school attendance during the cold winter months; and (ii) school furniture (desks, chairs,
blackboards, etc.).      In addition, this sub-component was to finance consultant services for
microproject design and supervision to assure the good quality of works.

Capacity Building and Technical Assistance to Implementing Agencies and Local Contractors
Sub-Component: The ASIF II project sought to intensify the capacity building efforts started
under the ASIF I benefiting the IAs and the local contractors. On-the-job training was to be
provided to Implementing Agencies in the areas covering: the preparation, design, procurement,
implementation and maintenance of Microprojects. Specific topics covered under the training
program, included: (a) project identification and formulation; (b) project costing and accounting,
(c) competitive bidding procedures; (d) mobilization of community involvement in construction
and maintenance activities, (e) management of partnerships with LGs, NGOs and other entities, (f)
quality control, and (g) monitoring and evaluation. On-the-job training was also to be provided to
contractors in competitive bidding procedures and technical standards. Special workshops and
seminars were to be organized at the local level to discuss issues of interest to communities
regarding the microproject cycle.

Component 2: Local-Level Institution Building (original base cost US$1.06 million): This
component was to complement the microproject component enabling local level institutions to
address the needs and priorities for local development through a comprehensive capacity building
program. Local governments and community-based associations were to be targeted in this
component with the objectives of strengthening partnerships between them and enhancing their
capacities for greater effectiveness in service delivery.

Local Government Training Sub-Component: Local governments at the city level (city councils,
mayors) and at the community level (village councils, mayors) were to receive training from both
indigenous and international experts in such functions as: financial management, budgeting,
taxation and asset management. The training sought to support local governments to: (i) develop,
plan and manage their own budgets; (ii) gain a better understanding of the basic concepts and
applications of property tax, land tax, duties and fees, and equalization; and (iii) acquire a basic
knowledge of asset management covering inventory monitoring, operation and maintenance of
assets, and planning of future investments.

Community-Based Training Sub-Component:                  Community-based organizations (school
councils, WUAs,) and community members involved in the microprojects were to receive
technical assistance and training in areas relevant to their activities and involvement in sector
specific microprojects. The initial phase of this program was to focus on school microprojects.
Technical assistance and training was to be provided by qualified experts to support the
Government's decentralized school governance agenda directed at: (i) school principals in the
areas of leadership and management, school legislation and regulation; (ii) school accountants in
the areas of financial management and accounting; and (iii) school council members in the
formation and operation of school councils.

Component 3: Institutional Support to the ASIF (original base cost US$4.15 million): This
component sought to support the Project Management Unit through the provision of limited office
equipment, vehicles, salaries, operating costs such as communications, local travel, utilities,
printing and publication, office supplies, fuel, vehicle insurance and inspection, vehicle
maintenance and repair, project audits, training and technical assistance, and monitoring and
evaluation.

Capacity Building and Technical Assistance to ASIF staff Sub-Component:                  This sub-
component was to finance technical assistance and training to ASIF staff. Specifically, technical
services of foreign and local advisors/supervisors were to be financed in the areas of quality of
works, procurement, MIS and cost accounting systems, and compliance with the Operational



                                                    8

Manual. Training was to be provided to the ASIF staff on a range of topics identified on the basis
of perceived needs during ASIF I implementation and ASIF II preparation. Such training covered
participatory community development, institutional assessment, capacity needs assessment,
quality of works, operations and maintenance, project supervision, and environmental standards.
Study tours and workshops were also to be organized under this component.


Co-financing from UK-funded DFID provided support to Component 1 described above in the
form of technical assistance for microproject design and supervision, and to Component 2
covering training for local level institutional strengthening benefiting local governments,
community members, and ASIF staff.

1.6 Revised Components
None.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)
During the implementation of the Armenia SIF II Project there were changes in funding
allocations and closing dates extensions of both the ASIF II Credit and of the DFID Grant.      As a
result of substantial savings under Category (3) Consultants' Services, due largely from the hiring
of local consultants and firms to carry out key assessments, reviews, capacity building programs
and microproject design and supervision, a total of US$1.4 million was reallocated from the
Consultants' Services Category (3) to the Works Category (1) (a). This reallocation was requested
by the Government of the Republic of Armenia to support: (i) the Earthquake Recovery Program;
(ii) critical needs for school heating in the neediest communities; and (iii) critical needs for
community infrastructure projects in the neediest communities. The implication of the
reallocations was an increase in the volume of works under the Community Infrastructure
component. This led to the Government's request for extensions of the closing dates of both the
Credit (8 months) and the DFID Grant (6 months). The extensions allowed additional time to
adequately complete the ongoing work under the Project and to start key project preparation
activities under the ASIF III Project.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)


The project's design and preparation were done well. The background analysis and rationale for
Bank support were thorough and provided solid grounds for the proposal. The design was clearly
ambitious but not complex or unrealistic. There was evidence of Government commitment and
stakeholder interest. The project preparation team prudently assessed the operation's risks and set
suitable provisions for mitigating them. The importance given by the project team to project
preparation, design and quality at entry was critical to the successful implementation and
outcomes of the ASIF II Project. Project preparation activities were carried out on a timely basis
and provided valuable inputs for the design of the follow-up operation. These activities, which
were largely financed under the ASIF II PHRD Grant (US$494,000), consisted of: (i) the carrying
out of key technical assessments, studies and reviews; (ii) capacity building activities in the ASIF



                                                  9

Office to strengthen the capacity of technical staff in improved procedures; and (iii) the
development of strengthened procedures particularly relating to community outreach and
participation, quality of works, and an improved Management Information System. Although the
National Assembly took a long time to ratify the PHRD Grant, the Fund was nonetheless able to
proceed with these preparations with the use of the PHRD program's provision of an "advance"
drawdown to circumvent the delay related to the Grant's ratification. This "advance" was helpful
in facilitating key project preparation activities supported by total disbursements amounting to
US$177,000. The project design benefited from all of these activities in addition to the lessons
learned under the ASIF I project and from other innovative social funds. The following are key
factors of project preparation, design and quality at entry affecting project implementation and
outcomes.


Strengthened Project Approach. The ASIF I Project was primarily oriented to the delivery of
infrastructure and service improvements with the aim of raising living standards for the poor and
other vulnerable groups. Its main institutional development aim was to help equip the Fund for
managing the investments for these improvements. This also entailed assisting local governments
and communities, mostly for their parts in preparing and carrying out the investments. The project
experience, however, demonstrated that relatively little had been accomplished in strengthening
local governments. Meanwhile, developments in Armenia had shown that there was a need for an
overall upgrading of the public sector. The Government viewed decentralization as a key building
block in the process of evolving good governance -- contributing to the effectiveness of planning
and implementation of local development programs. Accordingly, the Government began moving
towards decentralization, and adopted new strategies for improving social protection, health and
education.


In this context, it was decided that ASIF II should differ from its predecessor. The Fund's function
was broadened from community investments and related capacity building, and moved towards
wider social development. Its functions were expanded to helping strengthen local institutions and
communities for their roles in a planned decentralization of the management of public services.
Through capacity building activities, the ASIF successfully created a link between initiatives to
support local communities and the engagement of members of the community in decision-making,
and efforts to strengthen local government and implement the Government of Armenia's
decentralization program.


Improved Poverty Targeting Strategy. With the implementation of the ASIF I Project in 1996,
the Government became increasingly aware of its importance as a tool for poverty reduction. It
formed an integral component of the Government's program to improve accessibility,
sustainability quality of social services provided to the poor. The ASIF had been effective in
carrying out this mandate by financing the construction and rehabilitation of social and economic
infrastructure to complement the work of other line ministries. The ASIF has also been crucial in
strengthening social capital and providing short-term employment opportunities to the low income
groups. However, a change in methodology for the allocation of funds had become necessary as
described below.



                                                  10

The poverty targeting strategy adopted for the ASIF II Project represented a major advance
relative to that adopted for ASIF I. The main deficiency highlighted by the Operations Evaluation
Department (at that time) in regard to the latter was that the distribution of assistance was actually
regressive on a household basis. A likely contributory factor was that the data required for
systematic poverty targeting was unavailable from poverty assessments until well into ASIF I's
implementation. Taking into account the data constraints at the time of Appraisal, the allocations
under ASIF I were computed on the basis of limited data from a poverty ranking exercise and a
needs and capacity study. Allocations were also were influenced by non-poverty factors and
intentions to help regions damaged by the 1988 earthquake and those which suffered most from
the border dispute. Since then, progress has been made to address these data deficiencies in the
State Statistics Department and the Bank's Poverty Assessment analyses. With the availability of
new data from the 1996/1997 Household Budget Survey, it was decided that the ASIF II's
preparation should benefit from an improved methodology for poverty targeting. Taking into
account a Bank review of social fund experiences worldwide, the Fund elected to apply lessons
learned of having clearly formulated targeting and allocations using objective criteria and poverty
data.

In broad terms, the design of the poverty targeting strategy under ASIF II was based on
allocations by marz (region) determined by the marz's population, its poverty indicators, and
regional preference factors related to location in the earthquake zone or in a border area affected
by conflicts. The data for this exercise was based on the findings of the Household Budget Survey
of 1996/97 and the Bank's report entitled "Improving Social Assistance in Armenia" of June 1999.

To ensure regional equity in the use of ASIF II funds, mitigate political pressures, and to target
such funds to poor communities, the allocation to marzes outside the capital city of Yerevan were,
in the first instance, based on two general factors: (a) population; and (b) the poverty score
computed from three poverty indicators and two regional preference factors representing
earthquake and border zones. The three poverty indicators were: (i) the poverty incidence (head
count index) or the proportion of the population below the national poverty line -- representing the
extent or "quantity" of poverty; (ii) the severity index representing the intensity of poverty; and
(iii) unemployment -- representing the lack of opportunity to secure a means of sustainable
livelihood. For the Yerevan region, the allocation was based on a share of 22.5 percent of the total
allocation, as compared to approximately 26 percent of the amount disbursed under the ASIF I
Project. The table in Annex 13 shows the final allocations by region. As the table shows, the
Shirak Marz received the highest allocation reflecting its highest poverty score in an earthquake
prone area, and the second highest regional population. In contrast, the Vajoc Dzor Marz received
the lowest allocation largely reflecting the lowest regional population, and to a lesser extent, its
poverty level and location in a border zone. The Project's figures show that the actual allocations
made under ASIF II were much in line with different regions' poverty and population levels. A
statistical analysis of the relationship between the IDA Credit's disbursements and the regional
population-poverty index demonstrated a very high correlation coefficient (0.95).


Overall, ASIF's project targeting is considered to have been progressively improved in design and
application. It has kept poverty alleviation at the forefront of its decisions. It has also kept



                                                  11

"counting" other socially important factors affecting living conditions as reasons for priority
allocations, e.g., the special problems of mountainous and border regions (for which additional
indicators have been incorporated in the formula for Fund allocations under ASIF III).


Support to the Government's Social Sector Reform. The Bank's country strategy then provided
for advancing education and health reforms. Accordingly, although ASIF II was not intended to
contribute directly to these reforms, its definition called for helping to broaden support of the two
sectors, along with coordinating Fund activities with their policies. The project, therefore, aimed at
remedying the deteriorated school and health clinic infrastructure, these sectors' overly centralized
management, and local governments' and civic associations' weaknesses in these fields. With
regard to the social protection sector, the design of the ASIF II Project focused on addressing the
following key issues: (i) widespread and severe poverty in Armenia with 55 percent of the
population estimated to be living in poverty; (ii) growing number of ethnic Armenian refugees,
which at the time of project preparation was estimated at 333,000 living in temporary dwellings - -
with some 132,000 living in very poor conditions; (iv) poor targeting of social assistance; and (v)
the growing threat of the emergence of social exclusion as a result of long-term structural poverty.


Upgraded Instruments.           The Fund's tools were upgraded to address issues raised in the
assessments and reviews carried out under the ASIF I Project. One action provided for the
implementation of its Quality of Works enhancement program for improving infrastructure
designs and supervision. It was aimed at raising their technical standards, accompanied by
provisions for more comprehensive training of implementing agencies, local governments and
communities. More appropriate technical norms and standards were developed for different kinds
of microprojects, particularly on seismic construction. These were better enforced through
specialists' oversight of procurement procedures and the Fund's own supervision, supplemented
by technical experts' advice on design and supervision. It also tightened ASIF requirements
regarding building materials, raising some to "Euro-standards."


The Management Information System was upgraded for a more effective monitoring and
evaluation of project activities. Community participation and outreach was also strengthened with
the development of a community participation framework consisting of training, technical
assistance, assessments and information dissemination.          In addition, a new matching fund
arrangement in partnership with local donors was devised, to which thirty percent of the IDA
Credit proceeds designated for works funding was assigned.


Effective Use of Assessments and Action Plans.             The project preparation team effectively
addressed issues from ASIF I's experience, notably regarding: (i) quality of works relating to
technical design and supervision, construction carried out in accordance to construction norms and
standards, and sustainability of public facilities rehabilitated; (ii) community outreach and
participation to enhance community engagement and empowerment; and (iii) capacity building to
address capacity gaps at the local level regarding service delivery. The team was able to address
these issues drawing from the findings and recommendations made in the beneficiary assessments,
quality of works reviews and in the Mid-term Review carried out under the ASIF I Project. They



                                                   12

also drew from the Action Plans developed to address issues raised in these reviews and to help
them identify remaining issues that needed to be addressed under the follow-up operation. In
addition, the project design drew from two key technical reviews: the Institutional Assessment of
Local Government and the Cost-Effectiveness Review carried out during the project preparation.
The preparations provided adequate coverage of technical and economic aspects, poverty and
social development issues, fiduciary and institutional elements, and implementation requirements.


The project's activities also called for addressing the national decentralization program under the
very difficult conditions.    Some of the key problems were the lack of a comprehensive
decentralized policy, limited capacity and resources for carrying out local government activities,
and partial measures in undertaking decentralization initiatives.

Addressing these problems no doubt would have required the development of a comprehensive
decentralization program by the Government of Armenia, currently being supported under the
IDA financed Public Sector Modernization Project (PSMP). While this process was gradually
evolving in Armenia, the Government's decentralization initiatives provided a good opportunity
for the ASIF II Project to develop greater stakeholder participation and capacity building at the
local level in the preparation, design, implementation, and sustainability of microprojects. The
ASIF II Project was thus designed to contribute to this endeavor by providing support in the areas
of partnership development, project participation and ownership, institution building and
community outreach. During project preparation, a Decentralization and Institution Building
Action Plan was developed to present specific areas of support under the proposed ASIF II Project
for greater stakeholder participation and ownership at the local level within the Government's
decentralization program.


The Action Plan drew from studies carried out as part of project preparation, which included the
Institutional Assessment of Local Government and the Cost-Effectiveness Review mentioned
above.    Specifically, these studies provided valuable insights and analysis and specific
recommendations on how the ASIF II Project could assist local government and communities to
prepare, implement and manage microprojects on a sustainable basis. The Action Plan focused
primarily on helping communities and local governments respond to particular needs and
functions associated with microprojects, as well as addressing the priority needs for local
development with the objective of strengthening partnerships and increasing effectiveness. Thus
the plan, which was kept within the framework of microprojects, was effective in four key areas:
(i) the design of the component on local level institutional strengthening; (ii) the development of
the section on capacity building of the ASIF II Operational Manual; (iii) the implementation of
training activities; and (iv) the delivery of key outcomes in support of the Government's
decentralization program.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
The key project changes and actions taken during project implementation are described below.


The Need to revise the Regional Allocation of Funds. In December 2002, at the request of the
Government of Armenia, the regional allocation of project funds was revised on the basis of: (i)


                                                  13

population size of each marz; (ii) the poverty score, equivalent to the average of six indicators; and
(iii) a reallocation of the amount initially set aside to compensate for shortfalls in regional
disbursements under the ASIF I Project. As a result of this revision, the largest expenditures at the
regional level were made in the Lori and Shirak marzes, and a proportionally large expenditure in
the Aragacotn marz. This reflected the Government's priority in first addressing the urgent
reconstruction needs in these three marzes in the earthquake zone, which had suffered the most
damage from the last earthquake.


Implications of Large Increases in Prices of Construction Materials.                   During project
preparation, the ASIF encountered some problems in carrying out its civil works because of large
increases in the prices of construction materials boosted by the local construction boom. This
problem was aggravated by the fact that US $-denominated transactions slowed after a decline in
the relative value of the dollar vis-a-vis the Armenian dram. These hiked contract prices reduced
significantly the number of contractors participating in work bids, causing delays and some
contracts to be terminated. Faced with these serious constraints, the ASIF took action by raising
the microprojects' financing thresholds, revising some 25 contracts to increase their values, and
adjusting payment arrangements and pricing provisions. These measures were timely and
appropriate responses to the problems.           However, the problem that remained was the
implementation of fewer microprojects in the targeted communities resulting from an increase in
microproject costs.     To address this serious issue, the Government requested a significant
reallocation of Credit funds in the amount of US$1.4 million from the Consultant Services
Category, where there were considerable savings, to the Microproject Category.


Implementation Improvements as a result of the Mid-term and other Reviews. A Mid-term
Review of the ASIF II Project carried out in November 2003 provided helpful recommendations
for implementation improvements drawing on the findings from the Beneficiary Assessments (2),
Quality of Works Reviews (2), Institutional Assessments (2), and a Cost-Effectiveness Review.
These included: (a) on community participation, clarification of the roles and responsibilities of
implementing agency members, expanding information dissemination on microprojects,
strengthening assessments on microproject beneficiaries; and extending special training to weaker
communities particularly to develop proposals, mobilize community members, and manage
microprojects; (b) on operation and maintenance (O&M), providing special training to ASIF
promotional staff, so that they could in turn better training communities in this critical area; (c) on
quality of works, additional follow-up measures on construction design and supervision, special
training to contractors in the areas relating to quality of works, and the introduction of a budget
line, as part of total microproject cost, to ensure for initial period the operations and maintenance
of public facilities renovated under the ASIF; (d) on cost-effectiveness, improving ASIF's cost
accounting system. Action Plans for each review and assessment carried out were developed and
agreed to with the ASIF setting out the recommended actions and a timeframe for carrying them
out. Following the Mid-term Review, a number of workshops were organized by the ASIF to
discuss the finding and recommendations of the reviews and assessment carried out and the Action
Plans agreed to. Actions were taken in a timely manner, as well as on the recommendations of
the social capital and institutional assessments, contributing to the ASIF II's successful execution.



                                                   14

Corrective Actions taken relating to Institutional Strengthening Activities. During the course
of project implementation two institutional assessments were carried out to evaluate and assess the
impact of the local level institutional assessment component. As a result, some corrective actions
were taken during the mid-term review which included: (i) wider dissemination of the results of
the local level institutional strengthening activities; (ii) the inclusion of village level council
members as participants of local government training; (iii) the development of special training for
local governments to deal with refugees; (iv) provision of follow-up training on the changing
legislations related to Local Self Government; and (v) the inclusion of joint two-day workshops
for school principals, school accountants, and school council members, as part of the school
training program. These recommendations were discussed and agreed to in a timely manner with
UK-funded co-financier DFID, which supported the component on Local Level Institutional
Strengthening. A number of workshops were organized to disseminate the results of the capacity
building activities and to elicit feedback from key stakeholders. Several joint supervision missions
were carried out by DFID and the Bank to assess the progress, impact and issues relating to
capacity building activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization


Monitoring and Evaluation Design. ASIF II's provisions included performance indicators
concerning: (a) the number of microprojects completed by typology; (b) the number of capacity
building programs completed for local governments, implementing agencies, contractors and the
total number of participants; (c) cost-effectiveness of microprojects; (d) the quality of civil works
projects; (e) operations and maintenance of public facilities; (f) ASIF's service delivery regarding
promotional, appraisal and follow-up activities; and (g) short-term employment generation. These
were appropriate for monitoring the Fund's progress towards achievement of the Project
Development Objectives. The resulting data was also usefully employed, e.g., to gauge
microprojects' costs per beneficiary, and for comparisons with unit costs and comparator agencies'
works. ASIF III plans similarly call for drawing on M&E assessments of municipal government
capacities for defining its activities in local institutional strengthening.


In line with these provisions, project monitoring activities were assigned to ASIF's project
implementation unit at the outset of the project, which tasked these to a special M&E entity under
the newly-created Institutional Development Department of the Fund. Their objectives were: (a)
ensuring that microproject processing followed Operational Manual rules and requirements; (b)
providing progress information to the Fund's board of directors, the Government and donors; (c)
alerting managers on problems in project implementation; (d) determining how the project was
affecting the intended beneficiaries; and (e) assessing and reporting on project outputs and
outcomes. The M&E framework included microproject monitoring data from ASIF staff and
implementing agencies, management information system (MIS) findings, annual technical reviews
and audits, and periodic impact assessments.


Monitoring and Evaluation Utilization. The Fund's strengthened MIS was relied upon as the
major tool for performance monitoring of both the project as a whole and individual


                                                      15

microprojects, in line with the agreed impact indicators. The ASIF progress reports and Bank
mission reports regularly documented the effectiveness of the M&E Framework in assessing the
linkage between inputs, outcomes and results and the achievement of project development
objectives to deliver benefits to the target groups. The impact of project activities were derived
from beneficiary and institutional assessments, a social capital assessment, other assessments
carried out in the field by the ASIF promotional team, and from workshops organized under the
project to share the results of microproject and capacity building activities carried out under the
project.


Physical monitoring of the implementation of microprojects was done through routine visits to all
infrastructure microproject sites in order to check the progress and quality of the works. The
implementation process was followed up by: ASIF engineers, supervisors, and IA representatives.
Detailed checking on microproject documentation was done routinely. Inspection was done on the
submitted official requests, project applications, minutes of community meetings organized,
capacity assessments of IA members and communities, desk and field appraisals, environmental
checklists and final Appraisal reports.     Checking was also done on designs, specifications,
required permits and approvals, quality certificates, and on other documents.


The Project's M&E system is gaining importance as it is becoming an integral part of the
Government's framework for poverty monitoring capacity to monitor sector outcomes and
progress towards attaining MDGs. In November 2004, the PRSP working group adopted the PRSP
monitoring indicators' system with the approval of a Government decree. The system
encompasses 177 indicators, which are clustered in groups concerning poverty reduction and
improved living conditions, education, health, basic public services and housing, civil isolation
and inequity, and sustainable environmental development. The indicators are broadly consistent
with the key IDA 14 sector outcomes. Data on the indicators and targets have to be submitted to
the Finance Ministry, and are currently being used for monitoring progress on poverty reduction
and towards attaining the MDGs. They derive from the work of ASIF's new Management
Information, Monitoring and Evaluation Department which is charged with data collection and
analysis, along with the preparation of periodic reports. Data on indicators and targets draw on the
Fund's upgraded MIS which was refined by new database server software. These new
arrangements and facilities helped sustain the Fund's M&E activities, beyond ASIF II's
implementation period.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
The Fund satisfactorily manages safeguard and fiduciary issues.

A Bank financial management assessment in mid-2006 concluded that ASIF had acceptable
arrangements for meeting Bank standards in these fields. ASIF's accounting and reporting policies
and practices, based on internally developed methods and software, were judged to be reliable. Its
internal controls and filing system were also found satisfactory. The Bank team's assessment and
an independent consultant concluded that ASIF's accounting staff was extensively experienced in
Bank norms. They also complimented the Fund on the quality of training it had provided to local
implementing agencies on their procurement practices. Moreover, during the project's execution,



                                                  16

there were no substantial auditing problems identified. Neither were there significant procurement
issues.

A complementary factor was the Fund's upgrading of its MIS. It was linked with its internal
accounting operation, thereby permitting both systems to use only one database. This
improvement enabled the Fund, to carry out its monitoring and supervision more effectively. In
this connection, the Fund's upgraded supervision was exemplified by its action in one particular
instance. When it noted that potential contractors for its microprojects were withdrawing lowest
priced bids, ASIF promptly tightened its bid security requirements. It did this in order to reduce
significant collusion among the contractors. In fact, this tightening of these requirements served to
effectively curb this problematic practice.

A second fiduciary-related circumstance which ASIF handled well related to the emergence of
fund shortages. When these occurred, ASIF promptly resolved these conditions through resort to
short-term borrowings. It was notable that these circumstances were quickly identified with the
help of Government and Bank monitoring actions.             Apart from these measures, the Fund
developed new procedures which were aimed at minimizing financial management risks.
An additional element of ASIF's safeguard improvements concerned possible environmental
issues. A Bank review of its operations concluded that no microprojects presented environmental
problems. Moreover, to further upgrade the Fund's activities in this sector, it introduced additional
special environmental protection standards. These were designed to help obtain even fuller
consistency with national policies and Bank norms.

As indicated above, thus, the Fund operates in a quite satisfactory environment related to
safeguard and financial compliance. But there is some need for caution. According to a recent
BEEPS (business and enterprise survey) report, the Fund has to function under conditions of high
perceived corruption in national commercial activities. Also, a CFAA report said that there was a
significant overall fiduciary risk in Armenia because of weaknesses in core control and regulatory
agencies and in the quality of auditing, monitoring and supervision. However, it concluded that the
fiduciary risk of stand-alone financial management arrangements for Bank-financed investment
projects was low.

The only negative fiduciary issue experienced under the project relates to the frozen account in the
bankrupted Credit-Yerevan where project funds in the amount of USD350,000 were deposited.
The funds were frozen in the early part of project implementation and affected all Bank financed
projects in Armenia at that time that had accounts in Credit-Yerevan. This reduction in funds only
marginally affected the actual recipients of the sub-projects under the ASIF II Project - - with the
reduction of the equivalent of about 2 infrastructure microprojects. The Armenian Government
handled the issue of the frozen accounts in a systemic manner.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity,
and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Notwithstanding infrastructure investments in recent years, complemented by the ASIF program,
major infrastructure gaps remain in Armenia, with adverse consequences on the living conditions
of the population. These deficiencies largely reflect years of neglect in maintenance after the
break-up of the Soviet Union, unclear responsibilities for maintenance, and ineffective
institutional arrangements at the local level. Infrastructure gaps are most acute in the rural areas,
especially in the remote and isolated communities, as well as in mountainous and border zone



                                                  17

communities ­ indicating the need for a large number of small scale investment of the type carried
out by the ASIF. The main strength of ASIF is its capacity to penetrate into remote, isolated, and
poor communities, induce effective discussion on their perceived priorities, and to bring into
fruition project proposals to serve their needs. The technical and the professional capacity to carry
out these activities has built upon a solid foundation of experience and expertise gathered over the
past ten years, during which 619 microprojects were completed under the ASIF I and II Projects.
The ASIF has the capacity to execute community investment projects to a level of about US$8.0
million per year. The success of the ASIF II Project, in particular, led to the Government's
interest in a follow-up operation and a specific request for Bank assistance.


A follow-up operation was prepared and was approved by the Board in October 2006. It became
effective in December 2006. It is directed at deepening and expanding the efforts which were
implemented under ASIF II. Under the proposed follow-up operation, the ASIF would help
implement a development program supporting community investments, strengthened social
service delivery and good governance, including greater accountability in line with evolving
government policies and programs. Its approval reflected the Bank's satisfaction that the follow-
up project had appropriate technical, financial and institutional provisions to ensure effective
project activity, adequate inputs, and proper policy underpinnings.


Furthermore, the Fund's own plans indicate favorable prospects of ensuring suitable post-
completion operations with the help of the following policies and provisions, supplementing its
continuing efforts to provide high level project quality.

    · Requiring local governments and communities to finance up to 7 percent on average of
         microproject costs to ensure adequate stakeholder participation and project sustainability.
         This is considered to represent a realistic degree of resource mobilization, given the
         communities' limited financial resources.
    · Development of a further improved two-stage poverty targeting strategy based on a
         community mapping and profiling exercise.
    · Pursuing increased central government financial support for ASIF's program.
    · Charging user fees to cover operations and maintenance costs in the case of revenue-
         generating investments.
    · Expanding the training of local government officials in financial management and
         budgeting to include procedures for asset maintenance and financial provisions regarding
         the maintenance of public facilities.
    · Ensuring that municipal authorities and communities have well defined roles in
         microproject implementation arrangements.


In addition, Armenia's local governments are being supported to acquire greater capacities for
autonomous management, revenue mobilization and funding improvement activities and for public
accountability. These capacities are planed to be strengthened under ASIF III.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)




                                                   18

The project objectives, design and implementation were intrinsically linked and relevant to the
project's key aim of providing significant poverty alleviation of Armenia's lower income groups
and contributing to strengthening local institutions for community development and
empowerment. The objectives continue to be just as important now as when ASIF II was
established. They remain consistent with the Government's October 2003 PRSP and its current
development priorities. Also, the May 2004 CAS underscored the importance of raising the living
standards of the poor and vulnerable groups through better health, education and other basic
services in order to reduce the non-income poverty that the country strategy stressed for the Bank's
concentration.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 4)
The Project achieved its intended development objectives to deliver benefits to the target groups
efficiently and satisfactorily through the successful delivery of a number of key outputs and
outcomes which are highlighted below.


The Outputs achieved under the Project are reflected in quantitative data (measurable
improvements) relating to project benefits. They represent project deliverables (on the supply
side) that are designed to stimulate development outcomes (on the demand side) based on the
causal chain. The Project outputs relating to its specific objectives are as follows:


Improvement of basic social and economic infrastructure


·     332 high-quality and cost-effective community infrastructure improvements covering
      schools, potable water facilities, irrigation systems and community centers in remote,
      isolated and poorer communities (which had not benefited much from economic growth).
·     57 schools rehabilitated or newly built in the earthquake zone (which constituted the largest
      contribution from a single agency in support of the Government's national program for the
      recovery of this area).
·     20 specialized schools for the youth in poor remote rural areas covering sport facilities,
      music and art schools, and a socio-psychological rehabilitation center.
·     Furniture provided for 620 schools.
·     Heating systems installed or repaired in approximately 50 schools.
·     Water supply services rehabilitated or constructed in 50 villages.


Institution building at the local level, enhancement of stakeholder participation, social capital
formation, and development of partnerships


·     Training of some 1,050 mayors (of whom 485 were women) in financial management,
      budgeting, accounting and asset management.
·     Submission of 885 three-year plans and development of 873 annual budgets by municipal

      management, information dissemination, and operations and maintenance.
·     Formation of 905 Implementation Agencies with a total membership of 6,510 community
      members (of whom 1,840 were women, 615 were government officials, and 3,315 were
      community members) reflecting partnerships of community members and municipal
      officials.
·     Organization of 1,000 community meetings with the participation of 155,000 community

      on quality of works for the benefit of ASIF staff.
·     Training of 20 technical staff in ASIF through international conferences, special workshops,
      and study tours     to enhance their capacity in the areas covering decentralization and
      institution building, service delivery at he local level, quality of works, promotion and
      outreach, and monitoring and evaluation.


Institution building, private sector development, and partnership formation


·     Participation of some 148 local contractors in ASIF infrastructure projects, of whom 76
      participated in more than one project, creating opportunities for local construction industry.
·     Training of some 1,400 contractors on tender procedures, bid preparation, and quality of

      institute under the Ministry of Education and Science, to carry out training for school
      principals and school councils.


Developmental effectiveness. There were also important outcomes/results from these ASIF
activities highlighting the impact of the Project's development intervention. These outcomes
reflect the demand-side of behavioral responses by the beneficiaries as a result of the project,
validating the causal linkage between outputs and outcomes. Thus, the outcomes reflect feedback
received from beneficiaries that was documented in the Beneficiary Assessments (see Annex 5)
carried out under the Project. Given that the developmental impact of the project often reflects a
combination of more than one objective, this section presents the key results that were brought
about by the Project, as follows:
·     The provision of cleaner drinking water contributed to the improvement of household



                                                   20

      hygiene, better health for children and the community in general, as well as income savings.
·     Improved school conditions for better education in terms of the quality of classes, better
      class attendance (especially during the winter months), greater enrollments, upgraded class
      performance, in conjunction with improved student health and hygiene.
·     Upgraded health services resulting from the rehabilitation of health clinics, along with better
      working conditions for medical personnel.
·     Boosted yields and income levels from community agricultural lands resulting from
      improved water irrigation, which led to increased cultivation and subsequent expanded
      production.
·     Contribution of financial management training to strengthening the quality of works of the
      community administration and providing a stronger foundation of knowledge for the
      leadership role of mayors. The training also contributed to building the confidence of
      municipal officers in budget-making and budget management.
·     Improvement of school management arrangements through specialized training benefiting
      school principals, school accountants, and school council members during the transition to a
      self-governing structure of schools.
·     Contribution to short-term employment in poor participating communities.
·     Increased civic participation and empowerment of Armenian youth in community
      development through their engagement in activities of the newly built and renovated
      community centers.
·     Expanded engagement of municipal and civic society leaders in intra-community bonds and
      cooperation.
·     Helped lessen the level of tension in a number of poor rural communities, as a result of
      providing equal access to irrigation water.
·     Enhanced capacity of ASIF technical staff in the areas of decentralization and institution
      building, service delivery at the local level, quality of works, and monitoring and evaluation.
·     Strengthening of partnerships and information dissemination among key stakeholders
      through a series of regional, national, and local level workshops and conferences.


To sum up, the development impact of the Project has contributed to significant improvements in
the quality of life of the poor and vulnerable groups in Armenia. Some residents of Armenia's
poorer communities are now enjoying rehabilitated and warmer schools, more potable water in
their homes, better specialized schools for particularly needy students, the increased involvement
and engagement of local governments with strengthened capacity, and comparable poverty
reduction benefits.      Furthermore, the ASIF project program complemented and thereby
contributed to the development programs in Armenia which helped reduce the poverty rate in
Armenia from 56.1 percent in 1998/99 to 34.6 percent in 2004. This was achieved through the
combined efforts of the ASIF I and II projects with the implementation of over 600 priority
infrastructure projects in poor communities throughout Armenia. The ASIF was singled out in the
Poverty Assessment for its contribution to the national goal of supporting access to safe drinking
water.


ASIF II provided improved incentives and mechanisms for Armenia's local governments and



                                                    21

communities to carry out poverty-alleviating and development-enhancing programs.              These
include:


    · broadening the Fund's activities beyond its earlier role;
    · developing more comprehensive assistance, proceeding to village level activities, getting
        into the network of community connections and communications (i.e., not just physical
        improvements);
    · targeting its assistance to support the Government's development priorities such as school
        heating, school furniture, and infrastructure needs in the earthquake zone;
    · training mayors and municipal accountants and thereby contributing to the improved
        quality of local administration, the preparation of better documentation to the regional
        offices of central ministries, and to mayors' strengthened leadership;
    · the increased success in encouraging local ownership and broad participation;
    · the greater attention to sustaining completed works projects;
    · the Fund's progress to greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness;
    · the Fund's improved approach to poverty targeting;
    · the Fund's more effective structure, systems and procedures;
    · the Fund's assistance to improve services in schools, health clinics and water systems.


Beneficiary assessments concluded that the Fund's microprojects had provided a useful framework
for strengthening local governments and mobilizing community members (ref. Annex 8). The
intended beneficiaries voiced strong support for the microprojects; the vast majority (90%)
expressed satisfaction - two thirds of these were highly satisfied regarding (a) quality of life
(health, education, access to potable water) improvements in the communities; (b) enhanced
empowerment of governments and communities; and (c) improved interactions between local
governments and communities. The Beneficiary Assessment of 2002 highlights the contribution of
the project in generating short-term employment in poor communities. It noted that in almost all
beneficiary communities assessed, an average of 20 people in each community took part in civil
works on a paid basis for a period of 3-4 months. Community members expressed satisfaction in
seeing projects being implemented in their communities that yield tangible, visible results which
are designed for the common good of the community. Significantly, as well, the assessment
respondents considered that the activities carried out demonstrated that decentralized approaches
in Armenia could help raise the poor's living standards. They also recommended that ASIF's
mandate be extended to a longer term status, increasing its potential for tackling even more
challenging development problems and for having a still greater impact on local institutional
development. In this connection, Annex 13 describes the methodology used for both the
beneficiary and other assessments conducted under the Project.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The Project's economic rate of return was not calculated, as operations of this type in the public
sector yield a wide range of external benefits to society which are not readily quantifiable and are



                                                  22

therefore not expected to achieve verifiable monetary results. Moreover, the demand-driven
character of the microprojects (and the fact that neither their sizes nor their types were known ex-
ante) precluded the use of traditional methods of cost-benefit analysis. At the microproject level,
although the costs of projects are known with some precision at the appraisal stage by ASIF, data
deficiencies at the community level precluded the quantification and valuation of the wide range
of benefits and externalities generated by microprojects. In these circumstances, the measurement
of efficiency was directed towards studying the cost-effectiveness of ASIF microprojects vis-à-vis
those of comparator organizations, and accordingly a Cost-Effectiveness Study was conducted in
2004 by specialized local consultants under the guidance and advice of an international consultant.
The approach adopted was to examine the economic use of project funds at the macro and micro
levels as follows: (i) the project rationale within the broader context of national development
objectives, government strategy, and the Bank's country assistance strategy and programs; and (ii)
the cost-effectiveness of microprojects completed under ASIF II compared with those completed
under traditional government programs and NGO programs.

The macro level analysis demonstrated that the project rationale was consistent with the
Government's development strategy and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of May
2004, specifically the CAS goal (iii) of reducing non-income poverty through better health,
education, and basic services. At the micro level, the cost-effectiveness study, which covered a
sample of 93 microprojects, revealed favorable results. In school projects which constitute more
than half of ASIF's microprojects, the average cost of a new school constructed was favorable
(US$116,000) compared those constructed by a relevant NGO selected for the study
(US$147,410) and the Government (US$158,620). The cost per beneficiary in new schools
constructed by ASIF (US$123.82) also was marginally lower than that of the NGO (US$124.14)
and significantly lower than that of the Government (US$146.55). Water supply projects -- which
constitute around 20 percent of ASIF microprojects -- had the lowest cost per beneficiary (US$23)
compared to those constructed by the NGOs (ranging from US$24 to US$35). However, due to
the size and complexity of ASIF projects, they were on average more costly than those of the
NGOs. In the irrigation sector, the ASIF's cost-effectiveness profile has been only slightly better
than those of its comparators -- an NGO and the Government's Irrigation Project, which are well
managed.     Although ASIF's cost per beneficiary was lower than that of the Government's
program, it was higher than that of the NGO. On the other hand, the Government's cost per meter
has been more favorable than those of ASIF and an NGO, reflecting economies of scale. In the
health sector, the ASIF has also made a modest contribution towards achieving the Government's
objective of enhancing primary health care services. (See Annex 5 for details).

The analysis thus demonstrated that the ASIF II Project utilized a cost-effective means of meeting
the targeted infrastructure needs of poor and vulnerable communities, consistent with the
country's development strategy.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory


The Project achieved its development objectives by effectively delivering benefits to target groups
that have not received many benefits from economic growth. Its work on infrastructure
improvements and related activities benefited the poorest communities in remote and isolated
areas, the socially vulnerable including orphans, refugees, and disabled persons, as well as high
mountainous communities, earthquake zone communities, and border-zone communities. The
Project was not marred by significant shortcomings, inefficiencies or other material inadequacies.


                                                  23

Although Project's activities were launched several years ago, its accomplishments are still
consistent with Armenia's present development priorities and current Bank strategies and goals.
They therefore remain highly relevant.


With regard to the project's local level institutional strengthening activities, it is difficult to
evaluate the full impact of these activities regarding assistance to the national decentralization
program. Its essentially pilot activities have not been in place very long and their across-the-board
results are not yet entirely manifested. It is clear, though, that there were some innovative
advances made towards broader community and local government involvement, significantly in
relatively remote and less developed parts of the country. A good example of this innovation in
these areas is the aforementioned three-year municipal development plans with corresponding
budgets. These initiatives were substantial in pointing the way towards modernizing relatively
outdated and unproductive local governments (ref. para. 8.5b). Some of these exhibited interest in
and demonstrated intentions of undertaking greater self-management as a consequence of the
assistance they received. Another important outcome was the indication that the changed situation
has enabled some local administrations to receive greater attention from regional governors and to
exercise larger influence on local budgets.


Furthermore, each ASIF project has to some degree served as a tool of decentralization. To
illustrate this point, the construction of a potable water or irrigation system creates an expansion of
the national system of service capacity in the form of a locally owned asset. In the process, ASIF
works hard to develop the management capability within the client community to enhance long-
term project sustainability. The ASIF also seeks active community participation so that the
community feels joint ownership of the asset and supports it. Thus, one can conclude that the
Government's decentralization program reflects the same goals of the ASIF II Project of localizing
a portion of the national system and developing local management capability and community
involvement and support.


The operation's outcome is rated Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)


(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


Social Development.
The Social Capital assessment (ref. Annex 13) showed that ASIF II successfully built on and
strengthened existing levels of social capital, which had figured important in many communities'
capacities to initiate and effectively manage microprojects. The same factor was also influential in
ASIF's choices of beneficiaries of its microproject financing. The existence of social capital stocks
similarly created opportunities for effective decentralized systems built on partnerships between
the public and governments. This involved redefining the roles and responsibilities of municipal
authorities and citizens regarding the delivery of municipal services, as well as the dissemination
of public information. In the process, the Fund helped both the Government and the public better


                                                     24

understand the fundamentals of participation, project management and accountability. These
created incentives for community members to become more actively engaged in microprojects, as
well as in the maintenance of the facilities they produced.


Beneficiary Assessments reported that the microprojects had boosted participatory spirit and civic
identity. They also judged that these activities had provided a helpful framework for promoting the
strengthening of local governments, mobilized community members, and created links between
them which enhanced interpersonal bonds and trust. In addition, they reported finding evidence of
the following phenomena:


(a) -"Bridging" --interactions between strengthened local governments and mobilized community
members participating in ASIF's microprojects, which created linkages between them. The
institutional network between local mayors and regional governors was strengthened, which built
ties between the two levels.


(b) -"Bonding"--the active engagement of community leaders with their constituents in the
microprojects strengthened intra-community bonds and cooperation. Ties between school
principals in (and outside of) project areas were created by ASIF program training (which also
produced a stock of better trained principals beyond those in immediate project areas). The
practices of community-priority setting in community meetings showed considerable potential for
engaging community residents in the making of major decisions, as well as building better
understanding of local governance.


The Social Capital assessment commended the Project's promotion of participatory methods,
concerns with capacity building and attention to long-term service needs. It concluded that these
elements were useful catalysts for institutional development and social capital formation, which
they      considered      especially    important      in    areas     of    needy     populations.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)


A number of institutional strengthening efforts under the ASIF II project contributed to longer-
term capacity and institutional development.        These range from institutional changes in the
structure, systems and procedures under the Project, to broader based institutional changes in
support of the Government's decentralization program, and to the emergence of a common vision
for the future of the ASIF program in Armenia.


The ASIF improved its operational effectiveness and efficiency in a number of ways. It revised its
organizational structure to make it more responsive to changes in country needs and new
Government policies. It undertook an important role in Armenia's PRSP framework and processes,
as an agent of development. The Fund's organizational changes also encompassed more significant
monitoring and evaluation functions, as well as expanded community outreach and promotional
activities, and training and technical assistance functions. These changes augur well for increasing



                                                   25

ASIF's potential to assist the Government to progress further towards its long-term economic
growth and social development goals.


In addition, the Project contributed to strengthening community and local government capabilities
in significant ways. ASIF's microprojects directly engaged these entities in mobilizing and
carrying out municipal improvement activities in a more systematic and professional manner.
Other aspects of the Project's operations enhanced social capital formation at community levels
and created opportunities for effective decentralized local governance through stimulation of
public-government partnership ties.


These latter measures reflected worthy efforts to change Armenia's meager institutional
endowment from the Soviet regime, which was marked by a scarcity of adequate capacities at
local levels, especially in the more rural and isolated communities. Given this near void, the
Fund's program in this operation constituted a formative approach to putting in place several
essential institutional elements. These centered on broad scaled training activities for improving
local competencies. A large share of these was channeled in orienting community groups and
local governments in the fundamentals of mobilizing citizen participation, project design and
management, and civic accountability. Capacity building in the mayors' ranks concentrated on
building up their appreciation of the concepts and tools that are fundamental institutional
mechanisms (e.g., budgeting, taxation, investment planning, and asset management). There was
also considerable effort devoted to upgrading the knowledge and skills of school principals,
accountants and school council members for better performance in their communities' main
function. All these might constitute preliminary steps towards helping localities to engage more
fully in becoming able to carry out their own planning, implementation, resource mobilization, etc.


Further, the Project also contributed usefully to strengthening the Government's capacity for
poverty monitoring (which figures important for its PRSP activity). It helped to improve its ability
to analyze poverty, from which a national database on household welfare was created. All these
factors suggest good possibilities of ASIF's sustaining a strategy that affords sufficient flexibility
to meet specific infrastructure and service requirements while making its allocations on a strongly
poverty-oriented needs basis.


As such, the Project's actions comprised useful building blocks for future institutional
developments and for strengthening the enabling environment for local self-government. These
may be less visible in the creation of official organizations than in these pioneering arrangements
for participatory decision-making, collective accountability and other aspects of self-governing.
That should be satisfactory, however, given their limited starting points and the continuing
formidable constraints on what can be done in these localities. These include: (a) the still
predominant central government powers and the lack of suitable division of labor from local
administrations; (b) inadequate autonomy and resources of local governments; (c) numerous gaps
and uncertainties in governance arrangements; and (d) substantially unskilled personnel and
instabilities in municipal administrations. Barring substantial changes in these areas, it might be
advisable to confine future efforts in this area to solely seeking further progress in upgrading local



                                                    26

public administrations' collaboration with the Fund, perhaps mainly in Armenia's smaller
communities.


In this connection, the Government and ASIF have agreed on a common vision for the future in
which the Fund will function as an active partner with other executive branch agencies. The
Fund's role will be to concentrate on small and medium-sized infrastructure works within the
Government's overall development effort (in which it is important for the Government's quasi-
"outsourcing" of infrastructure and other improvements), while also handling additional
responsibilities in the decentralization program.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)


ASIF's beneficiary assessments, as well as the social capital and institutional reviews (ref.
Annexes 8 and 13), found that the beneficiaries considered that the Project had improved their
lives through the opportunities afforded for participation in the microprojects. They also
concluded that ASIF II's institutional framework had served as an effective catalyst for
institutional development and social capital formation, manifested in improved service delivery by
local communities and government agencies. Benefiting communities also commended the Fund
staff's performance and dedication.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low or Negligible


There is only a Negligible to Low risk that the Project's development outcomes will not be
maintained.    That is, in part, because Armenia's economic and social perspectives indicate that
there will be both an ongoing need for, and likely continuing public policy to provide the types of
assistance which ASIF's activities have supported. Further repetition of the past development
outcomes thus, in all likelihood, will remain priority Government objectives. The current
arrangements for these activities appear to be sufficiently flexible and strong to deal with various
possible risks.


A second but more important reason for assessing the overall Risk to Development Outcome to be
relatively low is that Armenia now has a respectable standing in social and economic
development.      Its positive features that could be drawn on to sustain the gains achieved under
ASIF II include:


    · The Government's successful stabilization and structural reform record indicates a
         progressively improving policy and financial viability environment, which could be
         replicable.
    · The ASIF program has become an increasingly more important Government tool for


                                                   27

         carrying out those reforms, and figures centrally in its PRSP which aims at reducing
         poverty, lowering inequality and improving human resources.
     · Armenia's recent strong economic growth and prospects of continuing large external fund
         receipts should enable it to maintain (and expand) ASIF II-type activities.
     · The changes which strengthened the Fund could help mitigate possible risk problems.
     · Experience with social fund-type projects has shown that the sustainability of these funds
         can best be achieved through the integration of community-based projects with progress in
         local institution building and self-management. ASIF has successfully advanced in this
         direction.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The Bank's work during the preparation of the Project was of high quality. Its strategy and
instruments were very appropriate. The assessment of different alternatives was balanced and its
conclusions well justified. The Project's design took into account lessons from previous projects in
Armenia and other countries. Appraisal of the commitments and the capacities of the Government,
the implementing agency and potential beneficiaries for the tasks appears to have been generally
sound. Technical aspects were thoroughly examined, as were the fiduciary elements. Links with
other donors were well considered and incorporated. The implementation plan was thorough and
well balanced.


The Bank's assistance helped the Government initiate the Project on a timely and appropriate basis
in response to its priority needs. This was especially useful in view of Armenia's external problems
at the time and the continued difficulties the country faced in dealing with a variety of issues
related to poverty. It was particularly helpful that, although the Project was modeled on its
predecessor and prepared expeditiously, it also skillfully accommodated changes to adapt to
evolving public policies.


The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry of the Project is rated Highly Satisfactory.
This takes into account the efficacy of the work carried out in the activities described above, which
covered the most important aspects of the Project's strategic relevance and its preparation and
design. The preparation team's work also warrants particular credit for its service in helping ASIF
broaden its vision from the past relatively routine social fund origin to a more comprehensive
social development cast.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                   28

Task management conducted field supervisions, together with special studies and assessments of
the project. These covered broad issues about the Fund's operations and their benefits, as well as
technical, administrative and procurement matters, and qualitative assessments of the activity's
progress, functioning and impacts. Their reports were quite comprehensive and well documented
and effectively informed the Government and Bank Management of the operating conditions in an
objective and timely manner. They dealt professionally with the problems and possible solutions.
The Mid-term Review assessed overall performance comprehensively and quite substantively. The
social capital and institutional assessments were especially helpful.


The Bank's flexibility was put to useful purposes and produced timely benefits when ASIF had to
solve some implementation difficulties. One case necessitated speedy relief of the special
rehabilitation needs of earthquake zone and border communities.        Others involved permitting
increased values of some subprojects to compensate for price rises, and adjusting funding ceilings
and payment amounts correspondingly, along with raising the procurement threshold review level.
These actions helped the Fund maintain good progress overall on the Project. In addition, it was
agreed that any subsequent comparable Bank-supported activity should seek to compensate
communities for the "shortfalls" in their Fund allocations which resulted from a previous reduction
in the number of microprojects funded (ref. para. 7.2).


The Bank's performance record during project supervision does not show any shortcomings in the
identification of opportunities and resolution of issues. Therefore, it is recommended that the
Bank's rating here be judged Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during the lending and supervision phases as discussed in section
10.1, Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government team which helped to prepare the project participated actively in the definition of
its strategy and funding and implementation plans. It was particularly helpful in establishing the
agreements for ensuring firmer and more adequate counterpart funding than ASIF I provided, an
important requirement for ensuring the achievement of the desired objectives. The Government
also collaborated well in the efforts made to link the project with the results of assessments of
Armenia's problems and requirements in the social sectors, as well as with the planning of its
decentralization program. Its Local Self-Government Law and several similar measures provided
useful policy backing for improving community-level management and empowerment, although
the Government accomplished less in their implementation and in decentralization program
measures than would have been desirable.



                                                  29

The Government also deserves credit for its positive measures to help ensure ASIF's continued
support in help advancing Armenia's growth at least over the medium term by confirming its
place in the public sector structure for purposes of the implementation of this project. By the same
token, the Government took other significant policy actions, especially in the later part of project
implementation, through its issuance of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, supplemented by its
successful stabilization and structural reform program.


The Finance Ministry was constructive in its assistance with the project's arrangements but not
fully successful in mobilizing the envisaged level of external co-financing. It was helpful with its
own funds (total Government contribution of US$2.0 million), however, in seeing that ASIF
consistently had adequate resources for project implementation. During that process, moreover, the
Government`s participation was timely and very cooperative.


The Government's performance in the Project is rated Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory


Implementing Agency Performance
The Project clearly demonstrated ASIF's main strength of being able to penetrate remote, isolated
and poorer communities, obtain their residents' consensus on development priorities, help
mobilize collaborative efforts to address them, and to bring them into fruition. The Fund has built
up a solid technical and professional capacity based on a now well established fount of experience
and expertise of some 10-years depth with substantial quality. An additional comparative
advantage has been ASIF's ability to effectively impact Armenia's smaller and medium-sized
communities, in which it has earned widespread popular trust, perhaps more than that of other
national institutions. Its demand-driven character and partnership arrangements have earned it
substantial backing.


In the ASIF II operation, the Fund provided a valuable base for the Project's timely initiation and
takeoff, and demonstrated a strong commitment to achieving its development objectives
throughout its life. Its readiness for the tasks remained energetic, well directed and altogether
commendable.


Independent experts judged that the ASIF team engaged in promotion, appraisal and follow-up
activities which were effective in providing technical, managerial and organizational support to
community members. They also judged its staff to be professionally competent, hard working,
committed and responsible. In addition, the benefiting communities explicitly commended the
staff's dedication, particularly praising the Training and TA unit's work, and ASIF's services in
diffusing development knowledge.


ASIF's performance was particularly valuable in the solutions for the problems which emerged
from the increases in the prices of construction materials, the foreign currency realignments, and


                                                   30

the resulting program delays. As noted previously, when the Fund found that contractors were
withdrawing their lowest priced bids (even with the loss of the related security guarantees), it
prudently increased bid security levels in order to discourage possible collusion. Better previous
pricing practices might have helped. Further, its success in adapting ASIF's role to help support
the Government's decentralization program demonstrated a constructive initiative in trying to
move from a technical engineering-type entity to a more development-oriented one. The Fund also
effectively acted to try to ensure strict conformity in the allocation of its and the IDA Credit's
resources with the poverty targeting formula. On the other hand, its decisions to make investments
in some large water networks were debatable choices. In addition, ASIF had to upgrade its cost
accounting system in order to overcome past deficiencies.


With ASIF's project implementation experience, it effectively monitored microproject
implementation consistent with both Armenia's and the Bank's environmental requirements.


ASIF's performance is rated Highly Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the Government's overall performance described in section 10.2, the overall Borrower
Performance is rated Satisfactorily.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)


Poverty Targeting. The improved poverty targeting strategy developed under the ASIF II
Progress contributed significantly to the project's ability to benefit the poorest communities and to
poverty reduction in Armenia. The lesson that can drawn here is the importance of having a
clearly formulated poverty targeting and an allocation mechanism based on objective criteria and
poverty data ensuring the flow of project benefits to the neediest segments of the population. The
poverty targeting for ASIF II was well developed having sufficient flexibility within the overall
allocations to target specific needs on a demand-driven basis. The poverty targeting strategy was
further refined under the ASIF III Project using a two-stage process consisting of geographical
targeting of project funds by region followed by the identification of needy communities within
each region through a community mapping and profiling exercise, based on a set of detailed
criteria.


Quality of Works. Experience under the ASIF program, as in other SIF programs, has underlined
the importance of delivering good quality community works projects identified as priority projects
by poor communities. A number of measures were taken under ASIF program to improve the
quality of works, obtain client satisfaction with services received, increase contractor
accountability, and to address the issues of corruption. While there were a number of very useful
measures described in this ICR, one measure that was particularly effective was the sub-
contracting of local firms to carry out the design and supervision of microprojects. Other useful



                                                   31

measures adopted were the training of local contractors on technical standards and the setting up
of a showcase room in the ASIF Office to display the technical standards and quality of output in
typical components expected under the ASIF program. These procedures, together with regular
post procurement reviews, quality of works reviews contracted out, and regular financial
management reviews and financial audits, comprise a comprehensive and effective approach to
dealing with quality of works.


Sustainability and Link to Government Decentralization. The approach of the ASIF II project
to integrate multi-sector community-based projects with local institution building and self-
management has been effective in ensuring the sustainability of its operations. The success of this
approach derives from the convergence of several mutually reinforcing factors: (i) deliberate
responsiveness to local needs and priorities; (ii) local institutional capacity building
complementing the Government's decentralization policy; (iii) innovations in poverty targeting,
promotion and outreach; and (iv) systematic and continuous monitoring and evaluation. The
ASIF's experience in supporting the national decentralization program demonstrated the Fund's
ability to be helpful in such activity. In a context where management skills were scarce at the
local level, that "added value" became an attractive asset. However, care should be taken to avoid
possible overexpansion of the Fund's responsibilities and excessive drain on its faculties.


The Government's Shared Vision of the ASIF. During project design and in the course of
project implementation, discussions with the ASIF and with the Government focused on the
strengths of the ASIF, the opportunities ahead, the challenges the ASIF is likely to face in the
medium and longer term, and the vision of its future role. These discussions were important as
they contributed to the process of gradually mapping the future direction of the ASIF. The good
reputation of the ASIF, its proven strengths in its capacity to penetrate into remote, isolated, and
deliver priority infrastructure needs combined with capacity building, and the opportunities ahead,
particularly in ASIF's "market share" in the construction and rehabilitation of small and medium-
scale infrastructure, have brought forth a common vision for the future of ASIF. This vision is one
of having the ASIF become a relatively independent entity functioning as an active partner to the
Government of Armenia. The ASIF would continue to target communities in poor isolated
communities through the provision of small-and-medium scale infrastructure work where the
Government would not be involved. This partnership of the ASIF and the Government is an
important lesson that reflects that an effective development agency can work alongside
Government to complement and enhance effective and sustainable development for and by the
people.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A. Component 1: Rehabilitation of Small-Scale Infrastructure

The project successfully met its infrastructure improvement goals, expanded on the Fund's past
accomplishments on the ground, substantially raising the standards of its operational performance
and helping to improve living standards of the poor and strengthen institutions at the local level.
This was accomplished through a large number of high quality cost-effective microprojects
supported by complementary training to implementing agencies, local contractors and
communities, and enhanced participation to ensure the sustainability of projects.

Completed Microprojects.         ASIF II was credited with the successful completion of 332
microprojects with the help of the IDA Credit and local contributions. The actual disbursements
for these projects amounting to US$25.13 million far exceeded the $18.68 million estimated for
these activities during appraisal. It also was also substantially greater than the level of these
works under ASIF I. On the other hand, the works completed were less in volume than what they
were meant to accomplish. This was due to price hikes which followed significant increases in
the costs of construction materials due to a construction boom and the decline in the relative
values of US$ vis-à-vis the Armenian dram. These caused the prices of works contracts to rise by
up to 45 percent, as well as a reduction in the number of contractors who bid for the
microprojects. The infrastructure projects generated short-term employment in some of the
poorest communities of Armenia with the creation of 322,000 job-days. The Beneficiary
Assessment of 2002 highlights that in almost all beneficiary communities assessed an average of
20 people in each community took part in civil works on a paid basis for a period of 3-4 months.
To ensure good quality of works, a total of 15 local firms were contracted to carry out
microproject design and supervision.

School Microprojects. An estimated 65 percent of the completed involved 57 small-scale
school renovation and new construction works, along with school heating system renovations
covering 50 schools, and complementary school furniture for 620 schools. The ASIF also
rehabilitated 20 specialized schools for the youth in poor remote rural areas covering sport
facilities, music and art schools, and a socio-psychological rehabilitation center. This emphasis
followed the priorities set out in ASIF II's objectives and design. In the process, as originally
envisaged, the microprojects helped support the Government's education reform agenda through
expanding the facilities and services of key schools in the targeted regions. The microprojects in
the education sector were supported by the Project's training activities for school personnel. An
estimated total of 510 participants comprising 180 school accountants, 80 school principals, and
250 school council members benefited from specialized training financed under the project in
support of thee Government's decentralized school governance program.             Furthermore, as
documented in the Beneficiary Assessments carried out, the school microprojects were assessed
to have generated valuable social and economic benefits. These included improvements in school
enrollments, class performance and class attendance, as well as student health and hygiene.

Potable Water and Irrigation Microprojects. An estimated 20 percent of the completed
microprojects encompassed water supply, waste disposal and irrigation activities. In particular,
water supply services were rehabilitated or constructed in 50 villages. Their nature and scope
closely followed ASIF II's objectives and design. The Fund's successful fulfillment of these
targets resulted in improved living conditions in the more remote and poorer areas of Armenia.
The provision of cleaner drinking water contributed to the improvement of household hygiene,
better health for children and the community in general, as well as increased income savings.




                                              35

Capacity Building and Community Participation. To ensure the sustainability of microprojects
the ASIF took the following measures: (i) intensified its capacity building efforts started under
the ASIF I Project benefiting Implementing Agencies (IAs), community members and local
contractors; and (ii) enhanced community participation in project activities. One significant
output was the training of some 6,510 community members of IAs in planning, management,
information dissemination, and operations and maintenance. A total of 905 IAs were formed
with a total membership of 6,510 community members (of whom 1,840 were women, and 615
were government officials) reflecting the partnership of community members and municipal
officials. The ASIF effectively organized 1,000 community meetings with the participation of
155,000 community members (of whom close to 70,000 were women and 2,000 were
government officials). In addition, 1,400 local contractors were trained on tender procedures, bid
preparation, and quality of works. Of these, 148 local contractors participated in ASIF
infrastructure microprojects creating opportunities for the local construction industry. As a result
of the training and promotional activities under the Project, a significant amount of US$2.6
million was received as community contribution, equivalent to 8 percent of total project costs.

B. Component 2: Local Level Institution Building

The local level institutional building activities carried out under the Project complement nicely
the microproject component enabling local level institutions to address the needs and priorities
for local development through a comprehensive capacity building program. The ASIF's
engagement in capacity building activities reflects the broadening of the Fund's focus and
functions in support of the Government's decentralization program.             Specialized training
programs were developed and carried out in the areas covering: a) financial management,
budgeting accounting and asset management to benefit municipal mayors and financial officers;
and b) decentralized school management arrangements in support of the transition to a self-
governing structure of schools benefiting school principals, school accountants and school
council members. Through these training activities, the ASIF successfully built a link between,
on the one hand, initiatives to support local communities and the engagement of members of the
community in decision-making, and on the other, efforts to strengthen local government and
implement the Government of Armenia's decentralization program.

The training of mayors and municipal accountants contributed to strengthening the quality of
work of the community administration, and by providing a stronger foundation of knowledge for
the leadership role played by the mayor. The training program helped build their confidence in
budget formulation and budget management. The training also contributed to the mayors' and
accountants' improved ability to prepare the documents required by the marzpeteran to the
expected standards. Local officials were also pleased with the detailed review and attention and
analysis of the new local government legislation and its implications.

The school training carried out helped improve school management arrangements in line with the
Government's decentralized school governance program during the transition to a self-governing
structure of schools. Specialized training benefited school principals, school accountants, and
school council members. School staff who participated in the organized training commented on
their ability to put to immediate use the skills acquired in rational budgeting and staff plans.
They felt more self assured and were better able to manage their increased responsibilities under
the new school management arrangements.

The specific outputs of the local level institutional building component are as follows:
·     Training of some 1,050 mayors (of whom 485 were women) in financial management,
      budgeting, accounting and asset management.



                                                36

·      Development of some 885 three-year plans and submission of 873 annual budgets by
       municipal officers as a result of the municipal training.

·      Training of about 180 school accountants (of whom 130 were women); 80 school
       principals (30 women), and 250 school council members (half women) in support of the
       Government's decentralized school governance program.

·      Participation of 6 local firms to carry out capacity building activities.

·      Participation of the Center for Education Reform (CER), a government owned training
       institute under the Ministry of Education and Science, to carry out training for school
       principals and school councils.

·      Carrying out of a national workshop to (i) disseminate the findings from the local level
       institutional strengthening component of the Project in support of the Government's
       decentralization program; (ii) exchange lessons learned with key donors and agencies
       involved in similar activities; and (iii) discuss with central and local government officials
       upcoming development programs focusing on decentralization.

B. Component 3: Institutional Support to the ASIF

The project helped to develop the Fund into a much stronger, broader based institution. It also
expanded its capacity to penetrate into more remote, isolated, and poorer communities, stimulate
effective discussions on their perceived priorities, and to bring to fruition proposals to meet their
needs. ASIF's improvements are credited to large measure to the Credits' inputs along with
DFID's support. These provisions included technical assistance to the Fund's management and
staff, purchases of vehicles and equipment for various departments, administrative support of the
organization, and various assessments covering Beneficiary Assessments (2), Quality of Works
Assessment (2), Institutional Assessment (2), the first Social Capital Assessment, and a Cost-
Effectiveness Review.       The financing also covered the Fund's operating costs and the
expenditures related to the monitoring and evaluation work, financial audits and MIS
improvements. Government counterpart funding helped cover the costs of this component. The
further strengthen the capacity of ASIF staff, enhance partnerships with key stakeholders, and
disseminate results under the Project, the outputs delivered under this component were as
follows:

  · Carrying out 7 workshops comprising: (i) one regional conference on Social Funds and
       Decentralization; (ii) four national         level  workshops     covering project launch,
       decentralization and capacity building, ASIF implementation results, quality of works; (iii)
       two workshops on quality of works for the benefit of ASIF staff, local contractors and local
       firms specialized in infrastructure design and supervision.

  · Training of 20 technical staff in ASIF through international conferences, special
       workshops, and study tours to enhance their capacity in the areas covering decentralization
       and institution building, service delivery at he local level, quality of works, promotion and
       outreach, and monitoring and evaluation.




                                                37

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)


As in other community development projects, the demand driven nature of the project ­ which
responds to microproject proposals from poor communities during the life of the ASIF II Project ­
clearly precluded the ex-ante use of traditional methods of cost-benefit analysis and the calculation
of economic rates of return. Neither the size nor the types of proposals were known ex-ante. And
consequently, projects of this type were not expected to achieve quantifiable and verifiable
monetary results. Even at the microproject appraisal stage, the non-availability of reliable data at
the micro or the community level precluded the ASIF from calculating expected ERRs. Although
the costs of projects were known, reliable data did not exist to quantify the expected benefits and
project externalities in a meaningful manner. In these circumstances, the ASIF adopted the least
cost approach to microprojects, based on project alternatives and project designs, while meeting the
requisite standards.


In the absence of ex ante ERR estimates as noted above the ICR analyzed the Project's efficiency
using cost-effectiveness criteria to determine whether it represented the effective use of project
funds. The results are spelled out in this ICR's discussion of the cost effectiveness of the uses of
public funds for a sample of 93 microprojects completed under ASIF II compared with those
carried out under more traditional government programs and those assisted by NGOs.

At the micro level, the Cost-Effectiveness Study conducted in 2004 has revealed some very useful
results. In school projects which constitute more than half of ASIF's microprojects, the average
cost of a new school constructed was favorable (US$116,000) compared those constructed by a
relevant NGO selected for the study (US$147,410) and the Government (US$158,620). The cost
per beneficiary in new schools constructed by ASIF also was lower than that of the NGO and the
Government. As regards water supply projects, although ASIF projects are, on average more
costly than those of the NGO, due to the size and complexity of ASIF projects, they had the lowest
cost per beneficiary compared to those constructed by the NGOs.

In the irrigation sector, the ASIF has played an important role in complementing the large-scale
irrigation projects of the Government. However, its cost-effectiveness profile has been only
slightly better than those of its comparators ­ an NGO and the Government's Irrigation Project,
which are well managed. Although ASIF's cost per beneficiary (US$37.65) is lower than that of
the Government's program (US$77.68), it is higher than that of the NGO (US$30.95). On the other
hand, the Government's cost per meter (US$16.07) has been favorable than those of ASIF and the
NGO, which were around US$20.00, reflecting economies of scale. In the health sector, the ASIF
has also made a modest contribution towards achieving the Government's objective of enhancing
primary health care services. The study also showed that ASIF's cost per beneficiary (US$2.32) to
be significantly lower than those of one NGO (US$4.35) and another NGO (US$3.43).


Thus, the Cost-Effectiveness Study has shown that the costs of ASIF's microprojects, both in terms
of average costs and costs per beneficiary, largely compared favorably with those of others. They
were, on the whole, lower than the costs of comparable activities. Moreover, at the macro level, the
analysis showed that the project rationale is consistent with the Government's development
strategy, and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of May 2004, specifically the CAS
goal (iii) of reducing non-income poverty through better health, education, and basic services. The



                                                38

analysis thus concluded that the ASIF II Project demonstrated that the ASIF employed a cost-
effective means of meeting the targeted infrastructure needs of poor and vulnerable communities,
consistent with the country's development strategy.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)

This section summarizes the beneficiary survey results documented based on feedback received
from representatives of local government administrations, community and school council
members, members of the Implementing Agencies, community members, and other stakeholders.
It encompasses the findings of: (a) a beneficiary assessment carried out in September 2002 which
provided some preliminary information; (b) a 2003 field research study; and (c) subsequent
interviews conducted for the institutional and social capital assessments.


1.     ASIF microprojects provided a useful framework for involving and strengthening local
governments, mobilizing community members, thus demonstrating that a decentralized approach
in Armenia could help raise the poor's living standards.


2.    ASIF microprojects had had strong participatory bases and reflected the immediate needs
and priorities of the benefiting communities. Most of their residents took part in community
meetings, provided labor or other support during implementation, and periodically monitored
progress. However, direct involvement of the greater community was the highest at the stage of
microproject identification and selection of members of the Implementing Agencies.


3.     Not all Implementing Agency (IA) members were equally active in the microproject
management. A number of IA members admitted that their role in the microproject was rather
formal and that they could have benefited from more specialized and ongoing training in order to
empower them to take a more proactive role in microproject management.


4.    The intended beneficiaries voiced strong support for the microprojects; the vast majority
(90%) expressed satisfaction - two thirds of these were highly satisfied regarding: a) quality of
life improvements in the communities; b) enhanced empowerment of governments and
communities; and c) improved interactions between local governments and communities.


5.    The microprojects significantly improved the quality of essential social infrastructure and
services in those communities, and produced some better basic welfare outcomes. Benefits
included improved class attendance, access to potable and irrigated water and higher quality
medical services. These showed that decentralized approaches could help raise living standards
of the poor.


6.    A number of community members mentioned that they received some information on the
status of microproject implementation from IA members, particularly at the start of the project,
but that they could have benefited from more regular information dissemination on the part of the
IAs at all stages of construction.


7.   ASIF microprojects helped lessen the level of tension in some communities, as a result of
providing all residents with access to irrigation water.




                                                  43

8. ASIf microprojects played the role of a catalyst by enabling local leaders to demonstrate hard
work, and reinforce their position and reputation within their communities. This provided an
opportunity for the local leaders to be more effective in mobilizing community members around
the most immediate local problems.         Through shared experience, the framework of the
microprojects contributed to strengthening the links between community leaders and residents,
and has enhanced the credibility and the reputation of mayors and school principals as those
"who can get things done."


9.     The microprojects are well regarded on the grounds that their selection, planning and
delivery processes were viewed as fair, efficient and effective. At the same time, they were
sometimes criticized in communities by those residents who did not personally benefit from these
activities.


10.     The microprojects filled gaps in a situation in which funds for capital improvements were
scarce, thereby strengthening the base for community economic and social development. They
also helped strengthen existing stocks of social capital and community self-confidence, and the
skills of community leaders.


11.    Community leadership at all stages of the process was good and effective. The most active
roles were played by formal leaders, mayors and (in the case of schools) principals.


12.   Mayors and community accountants greatly valued the financial management training
organized under the project, which has made a direct and practical contribution to strengthening
the quality of work of the community administration and provided a stronger foundation of
knowledge for the leadership role played by the mayor. All mayors who had participated
emphasized the helpfulness of the combination of "theoretical" and practical work, the relevance
of the topics selected, and the quality of the lecturers. Particular attention was made of the
contribution of the training program to building their confidence in budget-making and budget
management.      The detailed attention to review and analysis of the new local government
legislation and its implications was also very much appreciated.


13. The School principals interviewed expressed high levels of satisfaction with the quality of
training they received including the coverage of the program and the results of the training. They
learned the basics of school management and administration, how to formulate budgets and
manage and monitor resources. They also learned about the rights and responsibilities as school
principals and how to work with new school councils.


14.    School accountants also gave a strongly positive response in their evaluation of the training
received. All who had received training commented that they now felt more self-assured as
professional accountants, well able to manage their increased responsibilities under the new
school management arrangements. They also noted benefits of the training program including
sharing experiences, establishing friendships, and expanding their professional network with
school accountants from other regions. An interesting finding of the Beneficiary Assessment was



                                                 44

that the relations between the trained school accountants and the regional Education Department
of a particular region (Vanadsor) improved as a result of the training.


15. School council members who participated in school training were particularly pleased with
the knowledge they acquired about the roles and responsibilities of school council members. As
a result of the training, school council members came to the realization that their active
participation in school matters provided them with a voice to raise important issues concerning
school matters and the overall well being of the students. It also brought them closer to school
principals and made them more willing to actively participate in monitoring activities of
microprojects, as well as in the maintenance of completed school microprojects.


16.     The joint two-day training workshop organized on demand for school principals,
accountants, and school board members allowed participants to gain a better understanding of the
basic roles and responsibilities of each school staff member, how they can improve their services
to the community, and ultimately strengthen their partnership.


17.    ASIF II training contributed to the strengthening of old, and the establishment of new,
social networks in the communities. It also provided local leaders vital knowledge about their
rights and responsibilities.


18.    The ASIF is well regarded by Government, other donors, by local self-government and by
other observers. It is viewed as effective and professional in its ability to match priority
community needs with external investments. It is also valued for the quality and the scope of the
training it provides.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The following comments were submitted by Mr. Ashot Kirakosyan. Executive Director of ASIF
on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, on February 13, 2007.

The objectives were fully achieved.

The project's main success was that the goals were achieved in full. Its setbacks were: (i) the
decline in USD/AMD exchange rate and the sharp rise in building materials prices which led to
the breaching of a number of construction contracts. New biddings were announced to complete
the micro-projects; (ii) the significant amount of funds (more than USD350,000) was frozen in
bankrupted Credit-Yerevan bank despite the ASIF's unsuccessful efforts to retrieve the funds. It
should be noted that the funds were fozen in the early part of project implementation and affected
all Bank financed projects in Armenia at that time that had accounts in Credit-Yerevan. This
reduction in funds only marginally affected the actual recipients of the sub-projects under the
ASIF II Project - - with the reduction of the equivalent of about 2 infrastructure microprojects.
The Armenian Government handled the issue of the frozen accounts in a systemic manner.

ASIF II surpassed ASIF I in many aspects. The second project included large and well designed
component of Local Level Institutional Strengthening. A big number of community leaders,
school principals and accountants received training under this component, which was highly
appreciated by the Government of Armenia. Provision of school furniture also was one of the
features of the second project, which favorably distinguished it from the first one.

The main problems were caused by the drop-down of USD/AMD exchange rate and the growth of
building materials prices, which brought to the breaching of a number of construction contracts
and new biddings were announced to complete the micro-projects.

Some training on rehabilitated infrastructure maintenance could have been provided to
communities.

Changes in the regional allocation of ASIF's funds were directed to help the Government's
Poverty Reduction Program.

At the very beginning of the project, a significant time was consumed to agree on procurement
procedures. This should be done during the preparation phase.

If more attention had been paid to ASIF staff remuneration, a smaller number of highly qualified
staff would have been lost.

The consultants hired showed themselves in a very favorable way.

The midterm review provided the Government and other interested parties with very detailed and
useful information on project implementation.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders



The following comments were received from Mr. Matt Lesslar on behalf of DFID, United
Kingdom on April 11, 2007.

DFID supported the Armenia Social Investment Fund II with a commitment of £1.2m. DFID's
project nested within the structure of the much larger World Bank loan. The purpose of DFID's
support was to strengthen the capacity of the ASIF Project Implementation Unit to effectively
administer and manage the Social Investment Fund. Project outputs focused upon developing
partnerships at the local level between authorities and communities, empowering stakeholders at
the local level, capacity building and improving service delivery to communities.

DFID TA has strengthened the capacity of the ASIF team and the contractors who undertake the
design, appraisal and monitoring of the micro-projects so that the overall effectiveness of ASIF 2
has improved. DFID TA has also strengthened the capacity of local government, local
councillors, school leaders and accountants and has therefore contributed to the developmental
benefits of the SIF instrument. These investments in local actors last well beyond individual micro
projects and have been considered particularly important by the SIF management.

DFID found evidence that partnerships at local level were being enhanced and developed. The
Social Capital Impact Assessment conducted in 2003 provides independent evidence of how
partnerships at local level have been developed and enhanced through ASIF, emphasising the
crucial role played by local mayors and school directors in mobilising the community.

Specifically, short term local level employment has been generated. In 2004 alone 73,820 worker
day workplaces were created. The beneficiary impact assessment 2002 highlights that in almost
all beneficiary communities assessed on average 20 people in each community took part in civil
works on a paid basis for a period of 3-4 months. The community members employed in the civil
works were some of the poorest in their communities. The 2004 cost effectiveness study concluded
that compared with similar investment mechanisms (UNDP, SCF, Oxfam and the government),
the 68 ASIF micro projects in education, potable and irrigation water showed impressive cost
effectiveness.

The Micro-Projects structure allowed for real benefits to be made at a local level and provided a
focus for activities. They had succeeded in generating much interest and enthusiasm from the
local community and feedback received was of a generally positive nature.

ASIF has contributed to the development of partnerships between local government authorities
and communities. DFID's Project Completion Report concluded that ASIF II was contributing to
poverty reduction in Armenia. The achievement of the project purpose has made a valued and
significant contribution to the capacity of the World Bank loan to achieve its purpose.

Annex 10. Additional Annexes

10.1 Armenia: Poverty Targeting Strategy: Regional Allocation of Funds in the
ASIF II Project.

An Explanatory Note on the Methodology


1. The objective of this annex is to outline the poverty targeting strategy and the allocation of
funds across marzes (regions) under the ASIF II project. In broad terms, the allocations by marz
were determined by its share of the population, its poverty indicators, and regional preference
factors which depend on whether or not it is in the earthquake zone or in a border area affected
by military conflicts. The poverty data for this annex is based on the findings of the Household
Budget Survey of 1996/97 and the Bank's report entitled "Improving Social Assistance in
Armenia" of June 1999, as presented in the ASIF II Project Appraisal Document. The main
features of the allocation process under the ASIF II Project were as follows:

    · ASIF II funds were primarily allocated by marz. The objective of this allocation was to
        ensure regional equity in the use of ASIF II funds and to provide the basis for planning of
        ASIF expenditures by marz. In addition, fixing such an allocation was intended to
        mitigate political pressures to reallocate funds during the project life. A further sub-
        division of these allocations to urban and rural areas within each marz was not
        considered due to the lack of data at the marz level.

    · The total funds available for regional allocation in ASIF II were divided into two
        categories: (i) ASIF II marz allocations, excluding the Matching Fund; and (ii)
        "Adjustment Funds". The Matching Fund was based on an IDA contribution of US$2.71
        million, and was supplemented by an equivalent amount from the sponsors, local
        communities and the Government.

    · The "Adjustment Funds" referred to funds that were underspent in various marzes during
        ASIF I implementation, estimated at approximately US$1.45 million.           Accordingly,
        marzes which were disadvantaged during the ASIF I, benefited from funds equivalent to
        the shortfalls automatically added to their marz allocations.

    · For marzes outside Yerevan, the poverty targeting formula developed was used to
        calculate the allocation of funds, and thereby ensure a greater shift of funds to these
        marzes. For the Yerevan region, the allocation was based on a share of 22.5 percent of
        the total allocation, as compared to approximately 26 percent of the amount disbursed
        under the ASIF I Project.

    · The allocation to marzes outside Yerevan were, in the first instance, based on two
        general factors: (a) population; and (b) the poverty score computed from three poverty
        indicators and two regional preference factors representing earthquake and border zones.
        The three poverty indicators were: (i) the poverty incidence (head count index) or the
        proportion of the population below the national poverty line -- representing the extent or
        "quantity" of poverty; (ii) the severity index which is the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT)
        measure P2 -- representing the intensity of poverty; and (iii) unemployment --
        representing the poverty of opportunity to secure a means of sustainable livelihood.



                                                 50

     · The actual allocations were then calculated using a special formula developed for the
         purpose. However, no specific allocations were made to communities within marzes as
         the ASIF II Project was demand-driven, and microprojects were appraised by ASIF
         according to agreed appraisal criteria.


2.      As agreed during the Supervision Mission of June 2001, the targeting formula for the
revised allocation included the following new variables:

     · the number of populated areas in each region, except Yerevan, which has a special
         allocation, based on the proportion used for ASIF I;
     · the number of populated areas in the earthquake zones i.e., Aragacotn, Lori, Shirak, and
         Tavush; and
     · the number of populated areas in the conflict zones, Ararat, Gegarqunick, Sunik, Tavush,
         and Vajoc Dzor.


3.       The allocation of funds for the ASIF II Project was developed through a three-step
process. The total amount allocated was equivalent to the total civil works component of ASIF
II.


Step 1: The data inputted to the first Excel table included: (a) population by region; (b) the
poverty index by region; (c) the severity of poverty index by region; (d) unemployment by
region; (e) number of populated areas in all regions except Yerevan; (f) number of populated
areas in earthquake zones; and (g) number of populated areas in conflict zones. The source for (a)
was the Armenian State Department of Statistics, while the source for (b), (c), and (d) was the
World Bank report "Improving Social Assistance in Armenia" June 1999 (Report No. 19385-
AM). The source for (e), (f) and (g) were data presented during the June 2001 Supervision
Mission (SPN).


Step 2: The next step was to normalize the input data into indicators. Thus, the numbers for (b),
(c), (d), and (e) above were expressed as proportions of the respective averages in a second Excel
table. In the case of the regional preference factors in (f) and (g), a scoring system was used to
give a higher weight to the earthquake and conflict zones. Thus, each region received a 'basic'
score of 0.5, while the earthquake and conflict zones were given an additional score as a function
of the number of communities in the particular region.


Step 3: The final step in the exercise was to present the regional allocations in a third Excel table
on the basis of a number of computations:

     · A poverty score for each region was calculated as an average of the six indicators.
     · The poverty score was then multiplied by the population to yield a Population-Poverty
         (P-P) index.
     · Funds from ASIF II of $8,231,162 (agreed during the June 2001 SPN Mission) were then
         allocated proportionately to each region (except Yerevan) based on the P-P index.



                                                51

    · ASIF I shortfalls were then added to produce the regional allocations (except Yerevan).
        An allocation of $2,809,800 for Yerevan (based on the ASIF I proportion) is added to
        produce the final allocations for all ten regions.


4.    Results Achieved: An analysis of IDA disbursements in relation to the regional allocations
as of September 5, 2006 showed a high degree of correlation. The correlation coefficient
between disbursements and allocations was calculated to be 0.95 from the Table below.

10. 2 Methodologies of the Assessments and Reviews

The following note describes the methodologies used for the several assessments made
for and during the implementation of the Project.

Social Capital Impact Assessment


The Armenian Center for Social Dialogue and the Yerevan State University collaborated in the
preparation of the Social Capital Impact Assessment which was conducted during September-
October 2003. Its main objective was to examine the ways in which ASIF influenced local social
and institutional organizations in the Armenian communities, whose advancement was one of the
Project's aims.


The assessment was designed to be a qualitative measurement drawn on the views and
perspective of ASIF II's beneficiaries. Its designers, at the same time, crafted the assessment so
as to obtain a picture which would also reflect the views of all social groups in the targeted
communities. Also, the study was intended to follow up on the beneficiary assessment carried
out in September 2002 which provided more preliminary information on the effects of ASIF's
microprojects on local social organizations.


In addition, the Social Capital Assessment set out to determine whether the Project's observed



                                                  52

outcomes were attributable to the microprojects themselves, as well as to take account of
variances in the communities and the outcomes. In order to explain the outcomes, the Assessment
adopted a control-treatment group comparison, along with in-depth qualitative research
techniques. In-depth interviews were conducted in five control group communities in which
ASIF did not finance microprojects. These were chosen for their similarities to the microproject
communities in their main social and economic characteristics.


The causality factor was verified through an in-depth qualitative assessment of the ASIF-assisted
communities. In order to isolate the Project's effects, information was gathered about these
communities' histories of social organizations and the levels of community participation before
and after the microprojects. This also examined what roles some particularly active individuals
and community leaders played in these communities before the microprojects.


The Assessment's fieldwork was carried out in fourteen urban and rural communities. The
sample included four communities (treatment group) where there were microprojects. These were
statistically matched (using propensity score matching) with another five communities which had
no ASIF interventions. The nine were selected based on the results of the 2001 Living Standards
household survey. The sample also included another five communities which had ASIF
microprojects, chosen for purposive or illustrative sampling, in which the Fund was considered
likely to have impacted their social capitals.


The Assessment's respondents included (a) local leaders and elites, and (b) community members
(who consisted of both those were--and were not--involved in the microproject processes.
Those in the second category were selected through random purposive sampling, stratified so as
to reflect the social composition of the beneficiary communities and the views of all existing
beneficiary groups. The main social groups represented included men and women, the elderly
and schoolchildren, newcomers and refugees, the disabled, marginally poor and socially excluded
households. The beneficiary sample was not selected to be statistically representative of ASIF
communities' total beneficiary communities. However, because of the in-depth qualitative
methodology, the findings are considered to represent an accurate account of the situation in the
beneficiary communities.


The Assessment's methods included in-depth interviews (conversational and semi-structured),
and focus group interviews (all conducted in Armenian). The fieldwork was conducted by six
Armenian field researchers, all scholars of Yerevan State University's Sociology Department.,
experienced in sociological studies. They all participated in pilot evaluations at two sites for
testing the interview guides and the research methodology.


Microproject Beneficiary Assessment


The Beneficiary Assessment (BA) was conducted during December 2005-Febrtuary 2006 by the
Armenian Center for Social Dialogue. Its aim was to examine the effectiveness and impact of the
microprojects for different groups of beneficiaries, as well as to gather data on how ASIF might




                                               53

improve its mechanisms.


The Assessment effectively studied the level of beneficiary awareness of ASIF and satisfaction
with its microprojects; level of participation in these activities; level of transparency and
accountability of the organizations involved; and the impacts of the microprojects on the social
capital of the communities, on partnership development and on overall institutional development
The Assessment was carried out in 20 urban and rural communities where microprojects were
financed (including 12 school, 4 water, 2 community center, 1 health and 1 irrigation activities).
Those selected for assessment were determined by the microproject's ratio in the overall ASIF
program.


The Assessment respondents consisted of (a) leaders and elites, some of whom were involved in
project initiation and execution; (b) community members, some of whom also participated in the
microprojects; and (c) the latter's contractors responsible for their construction. The second
group were selected through random purposive sampling, stratified to reflect overall social
composition of beneficiary communities and groups.


The BA used qualitative and quantitative methods for gathering and measuring data. There were
in-depth interviews (both one-on-one and groups in type) with the local leaders, community
members and contractors. There were focus groups conducted for gathering beneficiaries'
feedbacks, which averaged 8-12 participants, and generally lasted up to two hours. These were
used to--and served to--cross-check the information gathered during the in-depth interviews,
gauge their validity and reliability. In addition, there were standardized interviews carried out
with 320 direct and indirect microproject beneficiaries.


In the case of school microprojects, the sample universe included all pupils, teachers and parents.
Only 5th-10th grade pupils were surveyed. Sample distribution was made by an "even
distribution" strategy. Eleven pupil units were selected by systematic random selection; five from
5th-10th grade lists and six from all pupils' lists.


The BA's fieldwork was conducted by eight researchers, balanced in gender. All had relevant
backgrounds in social sciences and experience in sociological studies (both qualitative and
quantitative). All first completed pilot assessments with random selected beneficiaries to test
study instruments and methods. Pre-test results were discussed with ASIF and some necessary
adjustments were made.


Institutional Assessment


An institutional report was issued in April 2006. It built on earlier studies from field visits carried
out in July 2003, as well as a field research study conducted in the same year by a team from
Armenia's Center for Social Dialogue and Yerevan University. Similarly, the fieldwork drew on
the aforementioned Social Capital Assessment.


The Institutional Assessment (IA) related to the Government's emerging policy and program for


                                                    54

decentralization and enhancement of local self-government (which became a significant feature
of the design of the ASIF II Project). With this background, the IA was chartered to examine the
status of the Government's reform measures within the context of the environment of the local
communities. It studied the character and quality of governance arrangements as they influenced
efforts to facilitate local economic and social development.


The IA sought to examine progress made and steps taken to establish functional decentralized
administrative structures at municipal levels, stressing the delegation of responsibilities and
financial authority for service delivery functions there. It also addressed the range of government
activities intended to support decentralization reform at local and regional levels. Meanwhile, the
IA reviewed the communities which had benefited from ASIF investments to assess the quality
and impact of local level institutional strengthening activities.


Moreover, the IA was tasked to examine a wide range of possible new activities, such as the
preparation of regional development plans, establishment of inter-community unions, options for
capacity building in selected municipalities, social services delivery functions, for consideration
in the preparation of possible new ASIF programs (including the aforementioned ASIF III
Project, now already underway).


The main IA field mission took place in January 2006. It consisted largely of interviews in
Yerevan, regional centers and local communities, mainly with the Deputy Minister of Territorial
Administration, community officials, and representatives of DFID, USAID, PADCO and the
UNDP. These were supplemented by a review of the growing number of Government documents
and legislation on governance and local self-government, plus donor reports on these subjects.

Quality of Works Review

The Quality of Works Reviews were carried out by local specialists (engineers) who had the task
of reviewing a sample of 15 to 20 works projects of different typology that were under
construction and completed in different regions. The review covered:

(i) quality of technical designs according to required norms and standards;
(ii) construction carried out in accordance with technical designs, drawings, and standards;
(iii) quality of workmanship and materials used;
(iv) review of environmental effects of the projects by assessing implementation arrangements
for ensuring that sub-projects meet environmental requirements and that full consideration is
given to environmental safeguards;
(v) quality of procedures, supervision and reporting;
(vi) the beneficiaries' perceptions of quality of works; and
(vii) Development of an Action Plan to address issues identified in the review.

The review also covered an assessment of the actions taken under the agreed Action Plan
developed under the previous Quality of Works Review. In some cases, depending on the
specialization of the consultant carrying out the review, special training sessions were organized
at the ASIF Office to address technical issues raised in the review.
