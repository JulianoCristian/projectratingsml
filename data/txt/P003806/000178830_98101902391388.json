140,000 ha of irrigation systems\n            already rehabilitated; and (iv) strengthening of the East\n            Java Provincial Irrigation Service. The project is a time\n            slice of ongoing Government of Indonesia programs in East\n            Java to improve small and badly deteriorating irrigation\n            systems, and to provide groundwater for dry season cropping.\n            Its main objectives are to establish a sound provincial\n            irrigation service capable of designing and implementing\n            irrigation improvements and properly operating and\n            maintaining them, and to expand the use of groundwater,\n            which will result in steadily increasing output and incomes\n            of smallholders."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
