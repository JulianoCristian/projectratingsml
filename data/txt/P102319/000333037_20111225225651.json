The\n            activities in question include: (i) completing the\n            establishment of an monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system for private sector development in South Sudan, and\n            training of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and\n            Investment (MCII) personnel in using the system to generate\n            baseline data and indicators; (ii) following up the\n            performance of BPC winners; (iii) completing the contract\n            for the management of the South Sudan Microfinance\n            Development Facility (SSMDF) and monitoring the performance\n            of microfinance institutions; (iv) supporting the\n            public-private dialogue; and (v) supporting project\n            management. There are no changes to the results framework.\n            The risk of the project remains as substantial given the\n            post-conflict conditions of South Sudan. For the additional\n            financing, existing financial management (FM) and\n            disbursement arrangements will remain unchanged. The same\n            designated account will be used for the additional financing."}, "docdt": "2011-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
