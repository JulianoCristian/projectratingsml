1.     The Closing Date for the South Sudan Private Sector Development Project, MDTF-SS,
and Project ID: P102319 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until January 31, 2012.

2.      Activities in project components are progressing well and project objectives continue to
be achievable. The project development objective and overall implementation progress are rated
as Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory, respectively. The framework for creating a
conductive environment for private sector growth has been initiated. A trade and investment
policy and a national microfinance policy were prepared and are in the process of being
finalized, a draft Mining Bill and accompanying regulations have been completed, and five
trade-related Bills have been drafted. An industrial competitiveness strategy has also been
completed. In the area of access to finance and building entrepreneurship among Southern
Sudanese, loanable funds and technical assistance for capacity building have been availed to
Microfinance Institutions and block collateral has been provided for loans from Kenya
Commercial Bank-Sudan to 44 entrepreneurs who emerged winners in the Business Plan
Competition. The collateral will eventually be turned into equity for the entrepreneurs who
successfully pay off the initial loans. The design of the Juba food wholesale market has been
completed but construction of the market has been postponed due to shortage of funds in the
MDTF following a request for additional financing. In terms of disbursements, the project has
disbursed US$7.58 million out of a total of US$8.46 million, representing a disbursement rate
of 90 percent (while the loan overview shows a disbursement rate of 99.4 percent, aside from the
US$52,000 undisbursed, there is an additional US$822,569 available in the special/deposit
account in the form of advance as shown in Annex 1).

3.      There is a discrepancy between the development objective of the project in its Final
Project Proposal and the Grant Agreement (GA). In the Final Project Proposal, the objective is to
establish the enabling environment for private sector development, and support formal private
sector growth. In comparison, in the Grant Agreement, the objective is to develop an enabling
environment, and to sustainably increase formal employment in Southern Sudan. The objective
of the Grant Agreement remains.

4.      The development objective of the project continues to be achievable despite the initial
delays in start-up operations of the project. The proposed extension is necessary to help the
project complete outstanding activities. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has prepared an
action plan including an implementation plan to meet the revised project closing date.
