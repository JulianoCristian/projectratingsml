There are some of the key\n            lessons learned from this project (i) projects designed in\n            post-conflicts regions need a heavy dose of realism; (ii)\n            constant supervision is indispensable and resources ought to\n            be organized accordingly; (iii) the costs and difficulties\n            of attracting and retaining qualified personnel are\n            considerable;(iv) M&E systems should be established and\n            funded before others; (v) high-level steering committees are\n            key;(vi)world bank procedures must be capable of responding\n            to post-conflict environments. The development objectives of\n            the project were to: (A) develop an enabling environment for\n            private sector growth; and (B) to sustainably increase\n            formal employment in Southern Sudan"}, "docdt": "2013-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
