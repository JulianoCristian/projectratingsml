                         were prepared and are in the process of being finalized, a draft Mining Bill and accompanying regulations have been prepared, and five trade-related Bills have been drafted. An

                         industrial competitiveness strategy has also been prepared. In the area of access to finance and building entrepreneurship among Southern Sudanese, loanable funds and technical
                         assistance for capacity building have been availed to Microfinance Institutions and collateral has been provided for loans from Kenya Commercial Bank-Sudan to 42 entrepreneurs
                         who emerged winners in the Business Plan Competition. The collateral will eventually be turned into equity for the entrepreneurs who successfully pay off the initial loans. The design
                         of the Juba food wholesale market has been completed but construction of the market has been postponed due to shortage of funds in the MDTF. Funding for Phase-II that focuses
                         on employment creation and improving access to finance has not been secured from the MDTF. Efforts are underway to secure the required $10 million for PSD Phase-II from
                         alternative bilateral and/or multilateral sources in addition to resources from the Government of Southern Sudan.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The GOSS will prepare final versions of the various policy documents (Trade and Investment, Microfinance, and Industrial Competitiveness Strategy) and finalize the draft Bills by the
                         end of June 2011. The GOSS will also look for funding from development partners to initiate Phase II of the PSDP to scale up on the successful access to finance and
                         entrepreneurship components, and establishing the framework for attracting a private sector investor to construct and manage the wholesale market (Public Private partnership).
