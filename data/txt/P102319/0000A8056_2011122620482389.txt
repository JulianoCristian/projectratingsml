                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The GOSS will prepare final versions of the various policy documents (Trade and Investment, Microfinance, and Industrial Competitiveness Strategy) and finalize the draft Bills by the
                         end of June 2011. The GOSS will also look for funding from development partners to initiate Phase II of the PSDP to scale up on the successful access to finance and
                         entrepreneurship components, and establishing the framework for attracting a private sector investor to construct and manage the wholesale market (Public Private partnership).
