1.      Additional financing amounting to $0.675 million drawn from the Multi-Donor Trust
Fund for South Sudan (MDTF-SS) will be made available to the South Sudan Private Sector
Development (PSD) Project(TF090186 and Project ID: P102319) and the closing date of the
project will be extended from January 31, 2012 to June 30, 2012.

2.      Activities in project components are progressing well and project objectives continue to
be achievable. The project development objective and overall implementation progress are rated
as Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory, respectively. The framework for creating a
conductive environment for private sector growth has been initiated. A trade and investment
policy and a national microfinance policy were prepared and are in the process of being finalized,
a draft Mining Bill and accompanying regulations have been completed, and five trade-related
Bills have been drafted. An industrial competitiveness strategy has also been completed. In the
area of access to finance and building entrepreneurship among South Sudanese, loanable funds
and technical assistance for capacity building have been availed to Microfinance Institutions and
block collateral has been provided for loans from Kenya Commercial Bank-Sudan to 44
entrepreneurs who emerged winners in the Business Plan Competition. The collateral will
eventually be turned into equity for the entrepreneurs who successfully pay off the initial loans.

3.       The additional financing is required to finance the completion of original project
activities given an unanticipated cost overrun and financing gap in the MDTF-SS funded PSD
project. The activities in question include: (i) completing the establishment of an M&E system for
private sector development in South Sudan, and training of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry,
and Investment (MCII) personnel in using the system to generate baseline data and indicators; (ii)
following up the performance of BPC winners; (iii) completing the contract for the management
of the South Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SSMDF) and monitoring the
performance of microfinance institutions; (iv) supporting the public-private dialogue; and (v)
supporting project management. The $0.675 million will be allocated to expenditure category (5)
as presented in Table 2.

4.      The additional financing would: (i) allow MCII staff to continue data gathering and use
of M&E databases developed by the project; (ii) build the capacity of SSMDF staff through
technical assistance and continue to support the development of the microfinance sector in South
Sudan; and (iii) enable the project to document the dynamics of job creation of BPC winners
through monitoring and follow up. The additional financing will enable the project to meet its
disbursement projections, and fiduciary obligations after the project closing date of June 30,
2012.


5.      This project has met all requirements under OP 13.30 (on closing date) where a) project
objectives continue to be achievable, b) the performance of the recipient and implementation
agencies is satisfactory, and c) an action plan has been prepared by to complete the project within

                                                5
the extended closing date. Moreover, the OP 13.20 (on additional financing) requirements have
been met. The overall performance of the project in the most recent 12 months has been
Moderately Satisfactory or better. The legal covenants set forth in the grant agreement have been
substantially complied with and there are no any unresolved fiduciary (including no audit issues),
environmental, social or other safeguard issues. Lastly, the additional financing will be used
within three years of the original closing date of the grant.

6.      There are no proposed changes to the results framework. The risk of the project remains
as substantial given the post-conflict conditions of South Sudan. For the additional financing,
existing FM and Disbursement arrangements will remain unchanged. The same designated
account will be used for the additional financing.

7.      The development objective of the project continues to be achievable despite the initial
delays in start-up operations of the project. The proposed extension is necessary to help the
project complete outstanding activities. MCII has prepared an action plan including an
implementation plan to meet the revised project closing date. The action plan includes additional
support to microfinance institutions, collection of data for the M&E system, and follow-up of
BPC winners. The implementation of this plan would enable the project to improve its overall
performance.

8.      This will be the second extension of the project.
