new exchanges, together with\n            associated expansion of cable network, distribution\n            facilities and buildings to permit connection of an\n            additional 36,300 DELs; (b) expansion of long-distance\n            network capacity by some 2,500 trunk circuits, consisting of\n            about 2,300 working circuits on existing and new microwave,\n            coaxial and carrier cable systems and some 200 circuits on\n            existing and new VHF and UHF spur routes; extension of\n            existing trunk exchanges by 1,100 lines; and installation of\n            three new trunk exchanges providing an additional capacity\n            of 2,100 lines; (c) expansion of the rural telephone system\n            to cover an additional 90 localities by use of open-wire\n            lines, carrier and radio systems of the long-distance\n            network; (d) expansion of the telex/gentex exchange in San\n            Jose by 250 lines and the national telex/gentex network by\n            80 new VFT channels; and (e) expansion of training\n            facilities, employment of instructors and technical\n            consultants, and purchase of
