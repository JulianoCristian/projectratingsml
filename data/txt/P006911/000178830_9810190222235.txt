INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CN A
PROPOSED LOAN TO INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD
FOR A FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), with the guarantee
of the Republic of Costa Rica, for the eouivalent of US$23.5 million to help
finance a project for telecommunications. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7V percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Report of Costa Rica" (No. 360-CR)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 15, 1974(R74-lOO). Annex I
summarizes the main economic and social indicators.
3.        Costa Rica is a rare example among developing countries.  High
per capita income growth has been achieved, while development benefits have
not concentrated in the upper strata of the population. A high level of
investment and booming banana and manufacturing exports allowed real output
to grow at over 6 percent yearly during the 1960's, while family planning
efforts and rising educational and income levels contributed to a sharp de-
cline in the population growth rate. Consequently, real per capita GNP grew
by 35 percent during the decade to $590 in 1971.
4.        Public sector policies have in the long run had a counter-cyclical
effect on economic activity. Exports, which account for over one-fourth of
GDP and are still concentrated in a few agricultural products depending on
fluctuating weather and world market conditions, are the main motor of private
sector activity. In periods of export shortfalls (such as 1971), expansionary
fiscal policies prevented a more drastic fall in output and employment. How-
ever, in a very open economy, which does not restrict trade or capital move-
ments, expansionary policies result in excessive demand pressures and lead to
heavy import increases.
5.        In 1972 a major tax reform, combined with a lower growth of
government current expenditures,resulted in improved public sector
savings. The public investment effort, which grew by over 50 percent in
1971, expanded by another 35 percent in 1972, but higher savings permitted
a modest reduction in the need for deficit financing. At the same time
growth of credit to the private sector was reduced markedly from 1971
levels. Buoyant exports in combination with a reduction in import growth



-2 -
(resulting from the less expansionary financial policies and gradual de-
valuation of the exchange rate) resulted in a reduction in the resource
gap. During 1973 the export boom continued and private capital inflows
rose rapidly. Thus,the foreign resource gap continued to decrease and
impor't payment arrears, which had accumulated during 1971-72, were rapidly
eliminated. However, inflation increased steeply from an annual average
of only 5 percent in the 1966-71 period to over 16 percent in 1973. Part
of the explanation for the change in internal price trends has been the
recent rise in import prices, due to inflation abroad and the currency
realignments. Nonetheless, monetary expansion must bear part of the re-
sponsibility.
6.        A 1974-78 National Development Plan, now being prepared, will have
the following major objectives: (a) an explicit employment policy; (b) an
even better income distribution; (c) further diversification of production
and exports; (d) improvement in the efficiency of the public sector; and (e)
higher savings and investment levels. The Plan's emphasis on policies af-
fecting employment is justified since the successful absorption of a rapidly
growing labor force during the 1960's may decrease in the future unless ap-
propriate measures are taken. Although Costa Rica's income distribution pro-
file compares favorably with other Latin American countries, the Government
is aware that the relative position of the poorest 20 percent of the population
has improved little in recent decades and that urban-rural disparities remain
large. During the 1960Qs considerable income redistribution appears to have
taken place from the top 5 percent group to the middle classes. In recent
years, much is being done to improve education and other social services in
the rural areas, and agricultural policy is being redesigned to emphasize
assistance to the small farmer. However, more could be done to improve land-
holding patterns and reduce rural income disparities through a more vigorous
land and income taxation policy.
7.        Agriculture will remain the main sector in the economy.   During the
sixties Government policies emphasized the diversification of exports; coffee de-
clined in relative importance while bananas and beef production alone accounted
for well over half of the increase in agricultural output. Future Government
policies in the sector will be directed at achieving a better balance between the
development of new export lines and improving the productivity of small farmers.
8.        Industry expanded rapidly during the sixties mainly owing to the
creation of the CACM, generous fiscal incentives and the favorable economic
conditions created by the boom of agricultural exports. In the short run
prospects of industry will mainly depend on the growth of exports to CACM
partners exploiting the regional import substitution possibilities that still
remain. Over the longer run, industrial policy will have to promote indus-
tries oriented to markets outside the CACM. During 1972-73 various measures
have been taken to achieve these objectives. The Government recently approved
an export promotion scheme granting fiscal incentives to non-traditional exports
marketed outside the CACM and created an Industrial Development Corporation to
promote and arrange financing for new industrial projects. At a regional level
and in an effort to revitalize the CACM, the Common Market Secretariat (SIECA)
recently proposed major changes in the Common Market structure, which are now



- 3 -
being reviewed by the five Governments. This revitalization of CACM,
however, will depend partly upon the renewed full participation of Honduras,
a step which in turn depends upon a political settlement between Honduras and
El Salvador. The most promising industrial export prospect in the long run
is aluminum metal. A project now in preparation involves an aluminum producing
complex with a yearly output of 250-300,000 tons, an 800 MW hydropower plant,
and related infrastructure at a total cost of over US$700 million. Preliminary
schedules call for construction to start in 1975 and production in 1980.
9.        The achievement of Costa Rica's development goals will be dependent
upon  the Costa Rican Government's ability to tackle the internal inflation
problem and increase the country's capacity to import. In the near future
inflationary pressures will continue to be strong. Import prices are expected
to grow rapidly mainly due to the recent sharp increase in petroleum prices
and higher rates of inflation in industrial countries. At the same time
domestic cost push inflation will rise due to the inevitable wage increases
which will probably, to a large extent, be passed on to prices. Prices of
basic foodstuffs, which rose rapidly in 1971-73 because of a serious drought,
might have stabilized in 1974 as supply recovered, but sharply increased ferti-.
lizer costs may neutralize this effect. In the above scenario, Government
financial policies will need to concentrate on limiting aggregate demand to
reduce demand pull inflationary pressures and maintain a viable balance-of-
payments position, while at the same time stimulating productive investment
to accelerate output growth. The growth of import volume will have to be lower
than in the past, when imports grew substantially faster than output; thi3 will
require a major effort to limit import demand. To allow for a sustained in-
vestment performance, policies will need to concentrate on reducing the import;
intensity of consumption and industrial production. Besides redesigning fiscal
incentives to industry, a major ingredient to achieve this target will be the
maintenance of a realistic exchange rate.   In the last week of March, Costa
Rica devalued the colon by eliminating the dual exchange rate that had pre-
vailed since 1971, and fixing the new dollar parity at ¢8.60. At the same time,
effective April 15, 1974, the main Central American banana producers (Costa
Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama) imposed a $0.025 per pound export tax.
Although it has not yet been clearly determined what impact this will have
on banana export volume, the resulting increased foreign exchange earnings
in the short run will at least offset the additional cost of Costa Rica's pet-
roleum imports (estimated at US$25 million in 1974).
10.       Public direct investment, which increased from 3.9 percent of GUP in
1960-62 to 7.6 percent in 1972, is projected to remain at over 7 percent of GIP
throughout the decade. The overall structure of public direct investment is
not expected to change markedly from that of previous years: 50-60 percent
to physical infrastructure and 25-30 percent to the social sectors. The
Plan, however, expects to give more support to agriculture through direct
infrastructure investment and increased credit lines.
11.       To finance a high level of investment Costa Rica will have to
achieve a marginal savings rate of 21-24 percent in 1973-60. While this is
not much above the already high average savings rate (lb percent of GDP in
1971-72), it will present a major challenge in view of the slower growth of
exports projected for the decade. The key problem is public savings.    The



economic report projected that unless appropriate measures were implemented,
public savings could be expected to fall to about one percent of GDP iLn 1978.
The recent large banana export tax mentioned above, and a 40 percent increase
in power tariffs implemented in April 1974 should improve markedly public
sector finances during the next twc years. Later in the decade, however,
additional tax and tariff measures will have to be implemented. At the same
time a concerted effort to control expenditure growth through improved budg-
etary practices and better public sector planning will be required.
12.       The economic report projects that to finance the current account
balance-of-payments deficit would require that gross disbursements on medium-
and lonig-term loans to the public sector increase from $220 million in 1967-72
to around $460 million in 1973-78. The projected increase in the level of
long-term borrowing reflects the real growth of the economy, a rise in the
share of public investment in GDP, an increased reliance on long-term instead
of short-term borrowing to finance the current account deficit, as well as
some inflation. Expressed as a share of exports, however, the current account
deficit is projected to gradually decline and gross disbursements to remain
unchanged during the 1970's. If around three-quarters of new foreign loan
commitments are obtained at terms similar to those of the international
agencies, the debt service ratio will not rise above the present 10-11 percent.
During the 1980's the projections show a further decrease ii the current
account deficit expressed as a share of both exports and GDP, and a similar
level of the debt service ratio as in the 1970's.
13.       Apart from the Bank, external financing is provided principally by
USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American Bank
for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAID has been active mainly in agri-
culture, road maintenance and construction and health. IDB has been financing
mainly agricultural and industrial credit, water supply, housing, feeder
roads, rural electrification and vocational and agricultural education.
CABEI is active in financing projects which have a regional impact, princi-
pally in transport, industry and telecommunications. The past lending of
these agencies is summarized below (net of cancellations):

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Costa Rica has to date received sixteen Bank loans and one IDA
credit, totalling US$130.0 million, net of cancellations. The last opera-
tion, a loan for an education project, amounting to US$6.2 million, was
signed on June 25, 1973. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments, as of April 30, 1974, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       Bank lending accounts at present for about 28.0 percent of the
total public and publicly guaranteed debt and about 20.5 percent of the
total debt service. By 1980, based on projections in the economic report,
the Bank group share of the total public debt and public debt service
will increase to 32.0 percent and 24.7 percent respectively.
16.       In the past, Bank operations in Costa Rica have given emphasis
primarily to the development of infrastructure -- power, telecommunications
and highways, which so far have received about 75 percent of total Bank lending.
Daring the last few years the Bank has begun increasing its assistance to
agriculture and has made a first loan for education. The Bank's current five-
year plan is designed to respond to the Costa Rican development strategy in
several different ways.  Through proposed loans in agriculture and rural de-
velopment and components of projects in education, power and telecommunications,
we would help strengthen the Government's efforts to raise the productivity
and empoyent capacity of the farming sector and to help reduce the income
and welfare disparities between urban and rural areas. In our activities in
the rural sector, we will seek to coordinate closely with IDB and USAID not
only with a view of improving the effectiveness of lending by major external
agencies at the national level, but also to help assure that Government pro-
grams are developed in a manner consistent with Central American priorities.
In pursuit of these objectives in all five Central American countries, a joint
IBRD, IDB and USAID agricultural and rural sector review has been organized
in cooperation with each of the Governments, and the first field survey (to
Honduras) has recently been completed.
17.       Given the vulnerability of Costa Rica's balance-of-payments, a
second major objective of our lending would be to assist in the Government's
program for increasing and diversifying exports of both farming and industrial
origin. Besides continued Bank assistance for development of the country's
power, telecommunications and transport systems, this approach will involve
further emphasis in the selection of projects for financing on export-
ori4nted agriculture and agroindustries. In addition, in order to help
expand its exports, particularly those in which the products will have



- 6 -
a substantial component of local value added, the bank is considering the
possibility of assisting in the financing of, and in mobilizing additional ex-
ternal resources for, a large hydro-electric project which is designed to
supply the power requirements of a proposed major aluminum complex. A third
major thrust of the Bank lending plan, exemplified by proposed lending in
power, telecommunications and education is to assist in Government efforts
to improve the efficiency and savings capacity of public sector infrastructure.
Aside from the telecommunications project now before you, the project whose
preparation is most advanced is an agricultural credit project which will provide
financing for livestock, crops and agroindustries as in two previous projects
of a similar nature, but which will also contain a substantial component for small
farmers. This project is planned to be presented to the Executive Directors in the
second half of 1974.
18.       IFC has made an investment in Costa Rica ($0.6 million in 1966 to
Productos de Concreto, S.A.) which has been fully repaid. At present, IFC is
exploring the possibility of participating in the financing of the proposed
large-scale aluminum project.
PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN COSTA RICA
Development of the System
19.       The major part of the telecommunications system in Costa Rica --
the local and long-distance telephone service -- is the responsibility of the
Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE). With the assistance of the
first of a series of Bank loans for telecommunications, ICE in 1966 installed
Costa Rica's first automatic exchange. Since that time ICE has expanded
its network to include 65,000 installed lines in all principal cities of the
country.   At the end of 1973, Costa Rica had 2.16 telephones per 100 popu-
lation, the highest density in Central America, but demand continues to grow
rapidly. The most recent Bank loan (bOl-CR) signed in February 1972 provides
financing for a further expansi-on of the network (principally additional exchange
lines, expansion of trunk network capacity, extension of the system to rural areas
and training). The development of the National Telecommunications System (NTS)
and the Bank role in its financing, are illustrated in the following table:
Expansion      Total Cost        Bank Lending
Program         ($ mil.)           ($ milu)          No. of lines

(1,066-70)       16.5               9.5                34,200
Stage II
(1970-73)        12.5               6.5                30,100
Stage III

7-
20.       One of the notable characteristics of the telecommunications sector
in Costa Rica has been a concentration of the facilities around the metro-
politan area of the capital.   The Stage III expansion seeks to offset this
by the extension of telephone services to about 600 smaller towns and villages
and the next stage expansion, to be supported by the proposed loan, will be
marked by further efforts in this direction. It has been recognized that one
of the most difficult problems related to the economic development of rural
areas is their isolation; it is expected that the expansion of the tele-
communications system country-wide will help the rural econonm in realizing
substantial benefits, by making possible better marketing of rural produce
and more efficient distribution of rural inputs, as well as increasing the
accessibility and quality of social services.
21.       Another recent development in the telecommunications sector is the
trend towards consolidation. In addition to the local and long-distance
service, ICE now operates the Costa Rican section of the Central American
Regional Micro-wave Network (COMTELCA) and is also scheduled to start operating
the National Telex/Gentex service this year. The Ministry of Interior presently
operates the Public Telegraph Service, but ICE will assume responsibility
for this service Dy 1975. ICE has a 50 percent interest in the International
Service and will take over the remaining 50 percent by 1977. With these
acquisitions ICE will control and manage virtually the entire telecommunica-
tions sector in Costa Rica. In addition, by the end of the decade ICE is
planning to offer such services as data transmission, broadcast transmission
and ship-to-shore communication.
Regulatory Authority
22.       The jurisdiction over ICE's telecommunications tariffs, technical
standards and finances belongs to the Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE),
which is the principal regulatory authority for Costa Rican public utilities.
SNE's decisions regarding tariff matters, however, are subject to review
by the Government. The tariffs for telecommunications services provided by
ICE have not changed since 1966 and are at present comparable to those in
other countries in the region. While the existing tariff level has been
adequate to support ICE's telecommunications expansion program up to now, a
tariff increase would be necessary to permit implementation of the expansion
program through 1977.
Progress of Stage III Project
23.       Implementation of the ongoing Stage III project (Loan 801-CR) is
progressing satisfactorily. Commitment of funds is running close to the
original timetable and some works are proceeding ahead of schedule. Dis-
bursement of funds is somewhat behind schedule as a result mainly of (i)
the need to revise a portion of the program to provide for additional
capacity in the main trunk systems, a modification made necessary by an un-
anticipated acceleration in the rate of traffic growth, and (ii) extended de-
livery time for some equipment. The period of execution of the Stage III
works will partially overlap with the next stage (Stage IVA - 1974-77) of
expansion of ICE's telecommunications section. Starting with Stage III, the
development of NTS in fact has been based on a series of shorter-term rolling
plans, which are best suited to the conditions of rapid growth of demand for
services and frequent new developments in the field of telecommunications.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Fourth Telecommunications Project
of Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) - Costa Rican (No. 417-CR ,
dated May 21, 1974 ) is being distributed separately. The main features of
the loan are summarized in Annex III. Following the review of the Stage IV
feasibility study with ICE in the fall of 1973, the project was appraised in
November/December 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington from May
6  to lO, 1974.     The ICE delegation was led by Ing. A. Murray, Vice-
President of the Board of Directors; the Government was represented by the
Ambassador to Washington, Lic. M.A. Lopez; SNE was represented by Dr. R.
Vargas, Vice-Director.
Project Entity
25.       ICE was established in 1949 as an autonomous agency of the Govern-
ment to plan and carry out a coordinated program of electrification of the
country. In 1963 it began exercising the additional responsibility of pro-
viding telecommunications services in Costa Rica. Except for being obliged
to pay for the operating costs of the regulatory agency (SNE), ICE is exempt
from all taxes and is authorized to carry out its activities completely inde-
pendently of the Government, except for the approval of tariffs and bond
issues. ICE has a seven-member Board of Directors, one of whom is a member
of the Government. The other six non-Government members are also appointed
by the Government for eight-year staggered terms. The general manager,
appointed by the Board, is responsible for all managerial and admini-
strative functions. The general manager is assisted by three deputy
managers (for power, telecommunications, and finance and administration).
The existing managerial structure reflects the organizational changes which
ICE has introduced in connection with the implementation of ongoing Third
Telecommunications (Loan 801-CR) and Fourth Power (Loan 800-CR) projects
and which are designed to provide a decentralized organizational framework
compatible with substantial expansion of both the power and the telecommuni-
cations sections of ICE. Unless the Bank otherwise agrees, ICE will
maintain the existing organizational separation of its telecommunications
and power sections, including the separation of accounts as stipulated
in the Loan Agreement for Loan 801-CR. (Section 5.01 of the Loan Agreement.)
26.       ICE's telecommunications section presently has 1,222 full-time
employees, which corresponds to 18.7 employees per 1,000 telephones. This
is considered a favorable ratio for a developing country, especially in view
of the fact that this section does much of its own installation work. The
staff is judged to be well-trained and capable of good maintenance work.



27.       ICE's other section -- Power -- has so far received four Bank loans
(totalling about $38 million), and another loan for power has been requested
by ICE for FY75. In general, the development of ICE's power sectiou has been
satisfactory. Recently ICE experienced substantial delays and cost overruns
because of severe geological problems encountered in constructing a tunnel for
a hydro-electric project, financing of which was assisted by the Bank (631-CR).
The tunnel is now completed and the hydro plant will enter into operation by
mid-1974.
Description of the Project
28.       The proposed project ("Stage IVA") represents the first half
(1974-1977) of ICE's 1974-80 Stage IV expansion plan and consists primarily
of:  (i) expansion of the   telephone    network capacity by 56,300 exchange
lines; (ii) expansion of the long-distance network capacity by 2,500 'trunk
circuits and expansion of the switching capacity by 3,200 circuits; (iii)
expansion of the rural telephone system to serve 90 additional rural commu-
nities; (iv) extension of the telex/gentex service outside the capital city;
and (v) expansion of ICE's training program to provide about 12,500 man-weeks
of training per year by 1977.
29.       The primary purpose of the proposed expansion of ICE is:   (i) to
prevent congestion of the NTS by expanding the capacity of the local and long-
distance network to handle existing demand; (ii) to help meet the demand for
new telecommunications services by providing additional facilities; (iii)
to further extend telecommunications services to smaller communities and
rural areas, a process begun under the Stage III project; and(iv)to maintain an
imequate level of investment in the training of technical and administrative
perscnnel which has so far proven to be one of the most important contributing
factors to the successful development of ICE's communications services.
Cost Estimates and Financing
30.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$50.8 million
equivalent, with a US$30.8 million (61 percent) foreign exchange component.
The proposed Bank loan of US$23.5 million would cover 76 percent of foreign
exchange costs or 46 percent of total costs. For the financing of the US$7.3
million balance of the projectts foreign costs, ICE has obtained a commit-
ment from CABEI for US$2.3 million (repayable in 15 years, including one year
of grace, at 8 percent interest), and is also negotiating loans from suppliers
for US$5.0 million (with average terms of about 6 years at 10 percent interest).
All of the project's US$20.0 million equivalent local costs (39 percent of
total costs) would be financed by ICE from internally generated cash.
Financial Position and Future Earnings of National Telecommunications System
31.       The present financial situation of ICE's NTS is satisfactory.   From
1968 to 1973 it maintained a rate of return between 14 and 18 percent.
During the same period NTS' revenues and operating income both increased by
more than 200 percent, while its net assets doubled. As a result of capi-
talization of its earnings, its debt equity ratio improved from about



- 10 -
72/78 in 1971 to 70/30 in 1973 and is expected to be about 63/37 by 1977.
During 1974-77 the current ratio will be at least 1.4:1.  The Bank has so
far been NTS' principal creditor, holding by the end of 1972 about 70 percent
of NTS' long-term debt (61 percent of ICE's total long-term debt).  EBy the
late '70's the Bank share of NT-S' long-term debt is expected to decline,
since it will be increasingly able to use other sources of long-term financing.
32.       Since NTS rate base is presently considered inadequately valued,
particularly since the recent exchange rate unification, agreement has
been reached that by October 1, 1974 NTS assets will be revalued on the
basis of a method acceptable to the Bank. (Section 5.07 of the Loan Agree-
ment.)
33.       In order to assure the viability of the above financial plan (para. 30).
ICE and the Government intend to raise NTS tariffs by at least 50 percent by
January 1, 1975. With this increase, ICE should be able to finance about 40 per-
cent of its 1974-77 telecommunications expansion program, secure necessary addi-
tions to working capital and maintain at least a 12 percent return on revaluted NTS
".ets.   (SectioD '.05 of the Loan Agreement.)  The above-mentioned rate ot return
has been agreed as the minimum rate of return for ICE's telecommunications section
and will be the same as agreed under the Loan Agreement for Loan 501-CR.
34.       During project implementation the annual debt service coverage of
ICE's telecommunications section is expected to vary from 1.7 to 2.9. Loan
801-CR required that ICE obtain Bank approval for any long-term borrowing pro-
posed at a time when net revenues of the telecommunications section are less
than 1.5 times maximum long-term debt service requirements of that section
for any succeeding fiscal year. The same condition will be maintained in the
proposed loan agreement. (Section 5.04(a) of the Loan Agreement.) The loan
agreement for Loan 801-CR also required that the amount of ICE bonds redeemable
after 30 days' notice would not exceed 30 percent of the total amount of out-
standing ICE bonds. This covenant is repeated in the proposed loan agreement.
(Section 5.04(b) of the Loan Agreement.)
Financial Position and Future Earnings of National Electric System (NES)
35.       Despite high rates of return (11-12 percent vs. the 9 percent re-
quired as a minimum by the loan agreements with the Bank) NES has had severe
cash difficulties in the past four years mainly because of cost overruns on
the Bank-financed Third Power Project. Medium-term financing has been used
to cover cost overruns, which had a heavy impact on the section's debt service
requirements. In March 1974 a 40 percent increase in power tariffs was
approved by the Government. This increase, plus a further expected increase of
at least 20 percent to compensate for exchange rate unification, should allow
NES to maintain a rate of return in excess of 9 percent (on properly valued
assets) and finance about 25 percent of its 1974-1978 expansion with inter-
nally generated cash. The annual debt service coverage would improve from
0.9 in 1974 to 2.1 in 1978. The debt/equity ratio would vary between 55/45
and 63/37 and its current ratio would remain above 1.8:1. At the end of 1972,
the Bank held about 57 percent of NES' long-term debt.



Special Assurahces
36.       As in the case of previous loans, ICE has agreed to have its accounts
verified by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. (Section 5.02 of
the Loan Agreement.)
37.       In the past it has been noted that the amount of capitalized overhead
of ICE's administrative section has represented an arbitrary fixed percentage of
construction expenditures rather than the actual amount of administrative expen-
ditures devoted to construction. This may have led to misstatements of earnings.
To prevent this possibility in the future, ICE has agreed to retain an indDprn-
dent public accounting or management consulting firm acceptable to the Bank to
review its pro cedures for distributing institutional costs and to implement the
recommended procedires after discussions with the Bank.   (Section 4.02 of the
Loan Agreement.)
38.       Previous Bank loans, in common with loans obtained from other
sources, have been secured by mortgages on power and telecommunications
properties of ICE. The proposed loan would also be secured by new mortgages
or extension of the existing ones. ICE, however, is in the process of attemDt-
ing to obtain a release of all liens on its assets held by third parties. If
ICE is successful in securing such release, the Bank would release ICE of the
Ifieiseexecutedor to be executed in favor of the Bank. (Article VI of the Loan
Agreement.)
39.       In the past it has been noted that the Government and Government-
owned public institutions have owed NTS up to one year's billings. It has
been agreed, therefore, that the Government will bring its accounts with ICE
up to date and keep them current.   (  Section 3.u4 of the Guarantee Agreement.)
Project Execution
40.       The project would be carried out by ICE over a four-year period
and is expected to be completed by December 1977. ICE's telecommunications
staff, assisted by manufacturers' engineers in the case of larger installations,
will plan, engineer and install the equipment included in the project as it
has done satisfactorily in the past telecommunications projects. The
Stage IVA expansion will call for doubling of ICE telecommunications staff
by 1977. However, the number of staff per number of installed lines will
remain approximately at the present level. In order to facilitate absorption
of this increase, ICE will, as a part of the Stage IVA project, substnntinlly
expand its administrative and technical training program, which will receive
technical assistance from ITU and other sources.

Procurement
41.       Procurement of all equipment and materials to be financed by the
proposed loan would be subject to international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement, except for some
switching and transmission equipment (amounting to about Us$4.o million) for
extending existing installations where direct compatibility is essential;
this equipment would be purchased directly from three suppliers with whom
the original contracts were placed as a result of international competitive
bidding under previous Bank loans. (Part A.2 of Schedule 4 to the Loan Agree-
ment.)
42.       Because of long procurement lead time, it has been agreed that
ICE might enter into commitments before approval of the proposed loan for
goods with a value of some US$6.0 million, which includes a commitment of
US$1.8 million for direct purchases mentioned above. No retroactive financing
would be required.
43.       Similar to previous loans to Costa Rica, in accordance with the
Central American Agreement, suppliers from Central American Common Market
(CACM) countries would receive a margin of preference of 15 percent of the
c.i.f. price or the CACM preferential tariff (which is 50 percent of the
applicable external tariff),whichever is lower. (Part B.2 of Schedule 4 to
the Loan Agreement.)
Disbursement
44.       Disbursement under the loan would be for 100-percent of foreign expen-
ditures for imported equipment, 95 percent of the ex-factory costs of contracts
awarded to Costa Rican manufacturers, and the foreign exchange costs of consul-
tants' and training experts' services. Because of the ongoing nature of Costa
Rica's telecommunication expansion, any unused loan balance could be applied,
after consultation with the Bank, to the purchase of additional goods required
for Stage IVA expansion.
Economic Justification
45.       The choice of the optimum design of the project was based on
present value studies of the capital and operating costs of engineering
alternatives of the larger works in the project (assuming a 20-year period
at a 14 percent discount rate). The proposed project represents the least-
cost solution to meet NTS' needs.
46.       The projected financial rate of return on the project is 21 percent.
under the assumption that the revenues attributable to the project will be
increased so as to offset the increase in project operating costs caused by
inflation.  No attempt was made to estimate the economic rate of return though
there is no doubt that it would exceed the financial rate of return because
(i) the prices charged for services do not adequately measure the full benefits
to subscribers, particularly those using telecommunications for business pur-
poses; (ii) the costs include the full costs of extending services to new
areas even though the full benefits do not include those to be obtained when



- 13 -
all potential subscribers in those areas are connected. The latter is
particularly true of the 90 smaller and rural communities outside the metro-
politan area of the capital, which will be included in the country's commu-
nications network during the implementation of the proposed project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft of the Loan Agreement between Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad and the Bank; the draft of the Guarantee Agreement between the
Republic of Costa Rica and the Bank; the Report of the Committee provided
for-in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank,
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan Agreement and Guarantee
Agreement conform to the normal pattern of loans for telecommunications projects.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. P!YOJECTS IN EXECUTION -
664            Siguirres-Limon Highway Project; US$15.7 Million Loan of
April 2, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily, and the highway
is expected to be completed, about on schedule, by the end
of 1974. The contract, as awarded, was about 30 percent
higher than the engineering estimate. The Government has
financed the additional costs out of its own resources. So
far there have been no significant cost overruns during
construction, hence the cost to completion should approximate
the contract cost at the time of award.
800            Fourth Power Project; US$6.5 Million Loan of February 24, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After the initial delays in the installation of the two
15 MW gas turbines, which are the principal components of
the project, implementation has been proceeding on schedule
without substantial cost overruns.
801            Third Telecommunications Project: US$17.5 Million Loan of
Fkebruary 24, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The status of this project has been described in para. 23
of this report.
827            Second Agricultural Credit Project: US$9.0 Million Loan
of June 5, 1972: Closing Date: December 31 , 1976.
The project is progressing satisfactorily. The proceeds of
the loan were committed by the end of the year 1973, one year
earlier than anticipated at the time of appraisal. The
Central Bank,with Bank assistance, is preparing a third project
with a substantial component for a small farmer credit program.
l/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
This should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

872            Highway Studies Project; Us$1.4 Million Loan. of December 28,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The first phase of the project -- the feasibility study of
improvement of the highway connections between San Jose-
Siquirres and San Jose-Puerto Viejo -- has been completed.
The second phase -- final engineering for the most attractive
alignments -- was started in August 1973 and should be com-
pleted by the end of 1974.
915            Education Project; US$6.2 Million Loan of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1978.
The project became effective December 27, 1973. There has been
about a four months' delay in project implementation, caused
principally by a delay in Congressional ratification of the
loan agreement.
