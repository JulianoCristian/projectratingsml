SUMMARY
i.        The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established by the Gov-
ernment to help overcome the two main problems of Mauritius: unemployment and
excessive dependence on one crop, sugar cane. Its purpose is to finance in-
dustrial and tourism development as well as the diversification of agricul-
ture. Industry is the sector which offers the largest potential for creation
of productive employment and this sector accounts for the bulk of DBM's busi-
ness.
ii.       Foreign investors show an increasing interest in establishing export
oriented industries in Mauritius. They are attracted by government incentives,
the high quality of manpower and the cost of labor, which remains low in spite
of recent increases and inflationary pressures. Prospects for industrial ex-
pansion over the next two years are good, provided that economic and social
stability continues to be maintained. Prospects for tourism expansion are
uncertain because of possible fare increases and flight restrictions as a
consequence of fuel shortages. If planned projects are completed, the num-
ber of hotel rooms is expected to double from 900 in 1972 to 1700 by 1975.
iii.      A US$3.5 million IDA credit was made to DBM in June 1972.  It in-
cluded $400,000 for the continuation of the current industrial estates pro-
gram, located at Plaine Lauzun, and $100,000 for the feasibility study of a
new industrial estates program. DBM received a second IDA credit of TJS$4
million in June, 1973 for an industrial estate at Coromandel. DBM's foreign
resources for industrial and tourism projects are expected to be fully com-
mitted by the second quarter of 1974.
iv.       DBM is the only significant institutional source of financing for
non-stugar industry, tourism and agricultural processing projects on a term
longer than seven years in Mauritius. Through direct financing or through
its industrial estates program, it has assisted a majority of the manufac-
turing enterprises which have been established under the Government's in-
centive programs.
v.        DBM's present Managing Director is an expatriate whose contract
expires in May 1974. It is expected, however, that he will continue with
DBM until a replacement can be found. DBM is actively searching for a
replacement. DBM has extended until November 1974 the term of a project
appraisal advisor seconded to it from ICICI in India. The company is presently
recruiting a controller/treasurer. Recently, DBM has taken steps to improve
its follow-up and loan collection procedures. During negotiations, DBM
agreed to increase its lending rate on industrial and tourism loans from
8.5% to 9.5%, and to pass the foreign exchange risk of the Bank loan on to
its clients.
vi.       DBM is a creditworthy institution and continued assistance to it
would be useful, not only to meet its financing requirements, but also to
assist in strengthening its appraisals and follow up work so that DBM can
better fulfill its role as a development institution.



- ii -
vii.      Bank loan of US$5 million to cover DBM's foreign exchange resource
gap for about two years is recommended. It is recommended that DBM's free
limit be increased from US$50,000 to US$150,000 for individual projects and
that the aggregate free limit for such projects be increased from
US$750,000 to US$1 million.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established in 1964,
as a successor to the Mauritius Agricultural Bank whose assets and liabili-
ties it took over. In 1970/71, at the request of the Government, the Bank
Group assisted in reorganizing DBM, so that it could play a more active role
in the development of Mauritius. A US$3.5 million IDA Credit to DBM was ap-
proved in June 1972.  A second IDA credit to DBM, of US$4 million, for DBM's
investments in the industrial estate project of Coromandel, was approved in
June 1973. The first credit is expected to be fully committed by the second
quarter of calendar year 1974, and DBM has applied for further assistance
from the Bank Group. This report appraises DBM for a proposed Bank loan of
US$5 million.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
General
2.01      The present economic situation in Mauritius is analyzed in "Memo-
randum on Recent Economic Development and Prospects of Mauritius," report
number 268-MAS, dated October 26, 1973.
2.02      A small, densely-populated island (720 square miles; population
850,000), Mauritius reached a level of GNP per capita (at market prices) of
about US$300 in 1972. The growing of sugar cane and the manufacture and ex-
port of sugar dominate the economy. Sugar-related activities were responsi-
ble for 35% of GDP and 90% of exports in 1972. Due to two successive record
sugar crops in 1972 and 1973, rising international prices for sugar, and rapid
growth of non-sugar manufacturing activities and tourism, Mauritius has been
experiencing an economic boom in the last two years. National income (in
terms of constant purchasing power) increased by 6.4% in 1971 and by 12.5%
in 1972.
Government Industrial Policies
2.03      Objectives.  The Government's development strategy places emphasis
on the two main problems of eliminating the high level of unemployment and
diversifying the economy away from sugar, while achieving a 7% target growth
rate in GDP. About 16% of the labor force was unemployed in 1972, and another
9% was working in Government relief and development programs. Prospects for
diversification of agriculture are limited because of lack of land and sugar's
comparative advantages. Due to limited growth prospects, few new jobs are
expected in the sugar industry. For these reasons, expansion of manufactur-
ing for exports and of tourism is a key instrument of the Government's devel-
opment strategy.



-2-
2.04      The Government has specified a number of development targets to be
reached by 1980. For the non-sugar manufacturing sector the goals are to em-
ploy 60,400 (19% of total employment), compared to 18,400 (9% of total employ-
ment) in 1969, and to contribute Rs 316 million in value-added (17% of total
GDP), compared to Rs 54 million (6% of total GDP) in 1969. This represents
target annual growth rates of 11% in employment and 17% in output for the
non-sugar manufacturing sector. The tourism sector is expected to contribute
Rs 60 million (3%) to GDP in 1980, compared to Rs 8 million (1%) in 1969.
The relatively high capital intensity of hotel projects as compared to manu-
facturing investments in Mauritius 1/ makes the tourism sector of less direct
importance for the Government's employment objectives. Given the level of in-
vestment which has been taking place in Mauritius, the targets do not seem
unreasonable; however, they are probably slightly over-optimistic.
2.05      Incentives.  Up to 1970, the Government's main means of stimulating
industrial development consisted of granting Development Certificates to those
entrepreneurs who seemed best able to carry out projects in a selected group
of primarily import-substitution industries considered to be of importance
to the island's economy. Development Certificates entitle companies to a
five-to-eight-year tax holiday (depending on depreciation allowances chosen),
import duty exemption on capital goods and protection against competing im-
ports through customs duties or quantitative restrictions. Companies in
certain activities favored by Development Certificates undertake, in exchange,
to maintain prices at certain levels, and cannot increase them without Gov-
ernment approval. Largely for fear that high-cost import substituting in-
dustries would increase the domestic price level, and thus make Mauritian
sugar non-competitive in export markets, the Government has granted Development
Certificates and administered the scheme with caution. Development Certifi-
cates in some industrial activities were either delayed or not granted because
costs would have been too high.
2.06      A scheme specifically aimed at stimulating investment in export
industries was put into effect in December 1970 when the Export Processing
Zone Act was approved. Under it, companies producing for export markets
are granted a ten to twenty-year tax holiday on retained earnings, 2/ a
five-year tax holiday on dividends, exemption from import duties on obliga-
tions, and guaranteed foreign exchange for raw material imports and for re-
patriating profits and capital, among other benefits. Companies which op-
erate under this scheme are not restricted to any specific location but may
set up their factories in any industrial site on the island.
1/   Investment cost per job amounts to about $15,000 for a first class
hotel as compared to an average of $2,000 per job for the manufacturing
projects approved under Credit 313-MAS. However, this analysis excludes
employment in secondary industries which could be stimulated by increased
tourism.

-3-
2.07      Industrial Sites and Estates.  The Government wishes to provide
adequate infrastructure for industry. Two hundred acres of land near the
harbor at Port-Louis are being reclaimed and have been earmarked for a large
industrial zone. The Government also plans to build and lease industrial
estates, which are useful to foreign investors, because they reduce the
amount of initial capital required and spare the time and effort needed to
secure authorization from a variety of authorities for land and utilities.
Recently, industrial investment has increased dramatically in Mauritius
(see para. 2.10) and as a result the demand for industrial sites exceeds
the planned supply. DBM has its own program of building industrial estates
which it is now accelerating in response to the demand (see para. 4.10).
Mauritius is now developing a comprehensive land use plan, so that industrial
development can take place in a coordinated fashion. During negotiations,
the Government agreed to review its draft plan and measures for its enforce-
ment with the Bank.
The Industrial Sector
2.08      Mauritian industrv is still dominated by sugar processing which
contributed about 10% of GDP in 1972. Value-added by non-sugar manufactur-
ing in 1972 amounted to Rs 84 million (in current Rupees), or 7% of GDP, and
employment was an estimated 20,600, or 10% of total employment in all sectors.
Up to now most of the non-sugar manufacturing output has come from import-
substitution or service industries, which had been established before 1970
(and granted Development Certificates). They are primarily in the food and
beverage sector, construction materials and printing. Possibilities for ad-
*ditional import-substitution industries are severely limited bv the size of
the domestic market.
2.09      With the exception of sugar and tea, Mauritius has practically no
basic commodity to transform industrially. Industrial development therefore
depends on the transformation of imported raw materials and intermediate prod-
ucts for export markets. In addition to its own small but active group of
local entrepreneurs, Mauritius has recently been able to attract a number
of foreign investors who have seen the advantages the country offers, in-
cluding: (1) the adaptability and competence of Mauritian workers, (2) the
low level of wages, 1/ (3) duty-free export privileges to the EEC (Mauritius
became an associate member in June 1973) and (4) Government incentives
(discussed below). Disadvantages are high freight rates and delays due to
infrequent ship calls, which tend to limit export opportunities to high
value, low bulk goods which can be shipped by air. Transportation dis-
advantages should decrease as the volume of cargo from Mauritius increases.
However, higher fuel prices may aggravate transport difficulties.
1/   Wages in Mauritius are less than half the wage levels of Hong Kong and
Singapore, at the current rate of exchange.



- 4 -
2.10      From 1970 to August 1973 the Government approved a total of 65 Ex-
port Processing Zone applications. At the end of August it also had 38 new
applications under consideration. Since only about a third of the companies
with approved applications have begun operations as yet, the activity in this
sector has not yet been fully reflected in output and employment statistics.
Industrial investment, however, has shown a marked jump to Rs 23 million and
Rs 36 million respectively in 1971 and 1972, compared to an annual average
of Rs 15 million from 1967 to 1970. By March 1973, 3,300 new jobs had been
created in industry and pending projects were estimated to require over 20,000
in additional employment. However, a major portion of the new employment op-
portunities are being taken by women who were not previously counted among the
ranks of the unemployed.
2.11      The 65 approved Export Processing Zone applications include 34 tex-
tile projects, seven projects in food and beverages, six in jewelry (includ-
ing watches and spectacle frames), five in electrical and electronic goods,
four in toys, and the rest are miscellaneous manufacturers.
Tourism
2.12      Visitor arrivals in Mauritius have increased beyond all expectations
by an average of 33% a year since 1969, reaching 49,000 in 1972. The 900
hotel rooms and bungalows in M1auritius were estimated to have 90% occupancy
rate in 1972, enabling the hotel industry to earn average returns on fixed
assets of about 24%. Two-thirds of the available rooms are in first class
hotels located on the beaches of Mauritius.  The largest increase in ar-
rivals have been visitors from South Africa, Europe and Australia, due at
least in part to an increase in the number of airlines serving the country,
and to the introduction of special promotional air fares.  Nine new hotels
are expected to be built in Mauritius by the end of 1975 (compared to the 22
now operating), which would increase available rooms to 1,700, nearly double
the 1972 level. About half the rooms available in 1975 are expected to be
in the first class beach hotels. The prospects for these proposed tourism
projects will need careful reevaluation now in view of potential effects
on the airlines of world-wide oil shortages.
Financial Institutions
2.13      There are seven commercial banks in Mauritius:  the Mauritius Com-
mercial Bank accounts for half of all banking business and Barclays Bank for
about another quarter.  In June 1973, a new State Commercial Bank was estab-
lished with Rs 2.5 million in share capital, of which 80% was contributed b,
the Government and 20% by DBM. The State Commercial Bank is expected to make
working capital loans to "neglected" sectors of the economy, mainly small-
scale industry and agriculture. It started operations in September 1973,
and began by making about Rs 300,000 in educational loans for individual
students both in Mauritius and abroad. The Mtauritius Commercial Bank is
the only other bank incorporated and owned locally; the other five are
branches of overseas banks.



-5-
2.14      All commercial banks extend term loans to industry, usually up to
seven years. The Mauritius Commercial Bank does so through the Mauritius
Commercial Bank Finance Corporation in which it has a 60% interest (the other
40% is owned by Lloyds Bank of U.K.), and Barclays Bank through the London-
based Barclays Overseas Development Corporation. By mid-September 1973,
these two institutions each held slightly over Rs 20 million of medium-term
commitments, primarily for industrial and tourism projects, but also a small
proportion for agriculture. Each of them stated that they were now approach-
ing their self-imposed limits on medium-term lending.
2.15      Other financial institutions include:  the Mauritius Cooperative
Central Bank Ltd. which lends mainly for seasonal financing of sugar cultiva-
tion, and also, on medium-term, for land purchase or improvement and for hous-
ing; the Sugar Industry Pension Fund which occasionally makes term loans to
sugar processing companies; the Mauritius Housing Corporation; the Post Of-
fice Savings Bank, and a number of insurance companies which make occasional
investments in industrial enterprises.
2.16      Interest Rates.  As regulated by an Interest Act, the maximum in-
terest rate permitted on secured loans over Rs 6,000 is 9%. On unsecured
loans, however, the interest rate is allowed to rise to a 36% maximum. With-
in these limits, interest rates are determined by an interbank agreement.
At present, the prime rate is 7%, and the interest rate charge on medium-
term loans is 8.5%.  The rates on time or savings deposits are between 4%
and 6%, depending on the term. Although total commercial bank deposits in-
creased by 38% in the year ending June 30, 1973, and time and savings de-
posits increased by 36%, future growth in deposits could be effected by
the low level of interest rates on them, compared with the rate of infla-
tion now being experienced in Mauritius. The consumer price index increased
by over 5% in 1972, and rose by 18% in the year ending October, 1973. Infla-
tion is new phenomenon in the country and it is largely related to the signi-
ficant salary increases made in 1973. The Government recently imposed a tax
increase and credit restrictions on commercial banks in an effort to contain
inflation. It is unclear at this point ho ""inflation will be held in check,
but at present it is clear that, even assuming the rate of price increases is
cut sharply, the interest rate structure is low. During negotiations, DBM
agreed to increase its interest rate on industrial and tourism lending from
8.5% to 9.5%. In addition, sub-borrowers will assume the foreign exchange
risk on foreign loans and thus, overall, the terms are considered appropriate.
2.17      DBM's Role.  DBM is the only significant institutional source of
financing for industrial and tourist projects on a term longer than seven
years in Mauritius. As investment grows and the demand for long-term fi-
nance expands, DBM has the potential to become an increasingly important
institution in the economy. Through either direct financing or its indus-
trial estates program, DBM has assisted 75% of companies with Export Proc-
essing Zone Certificates, and 55% of companies with Development Certificates.
DBM's disbursements to industry and tourism represented about 12% of gross
fixed capital formation in industry and services in 1972. DBM's appraisals
are more comprehensive than those of commercial banks in technical aspects



-6-
and will increasingly be so in terms of economic analyses. This is benefi-
cial to improve economic allocation, but it tends to give commercial banks
a competitive advantage over DBM in the view of potential clients. Partly
because of self-imposed lending limits on individual investments (of about
Rs 4 million for commercial banks and Rs 6 million for DBM at present), DBM
and commercial banks have undertaken joint financing of projects. DBM has
also collaborated with IFC on a tourism project (see report IFC/P-102 of
April 29, 1972).
III. DBM: THE INSTITUTION
Relations with Government
3.01      DBM is closely related to the Government.  The Government owns 80%
of DBM's shares and the Bank of Mauritius (the Central Bank) 20%. The Gov-
ernment provides DBM local currency resources in the form of long-term sub-
ordinated loans at a 2.5% interest rate (see para. 4.03). The Financial
Secretary of Mauritius is DBM's Chairman. The ordinance which created DBM
empowers the Minister of Finance to give the company general policy direc-
tives, but DBM's Board may insist that the Government take any risk of loss
resulting from activities so directed. DBM has undertaken a small-scale in-
dustry lending program, refinancing of agricultural loans, and loans to tea
project planters all with Government guarantees. DBM's small-scale indus-
tries program is in effect a fund managed on behalf of the Government, since
DBM has no spread on the 2.5% interest it charges and the Government has
agreed to reimburse DBM for its administrative expenses on this program.
Also the Government will reimburse DBM for any net operating losses on its
industrial estate operations due to its substantial exposure in this program.
In 1973, the Government invited DBM to participate in the share capital of
the new State Commercial Bank (see para. 2.13). During the year, DBM played
a useful role in increasing communication between itself, the Government, and
industrialists in Mauritius by organizing a seminar on development banking,
which was inaugurated by the Minister of Finance.
3.02      In connection with the first IDA credit, DBM and the Government
agreed that DBM would no longer be audited by the Auditor General, but by
an independent firm (see para. 3.11). During 1973 the Government issued a
directive that the legal work of parastatal organizations including DBM,
should be performed by the Ministry of Justice, but DBM secured an exemp-
tion from this rule for the legal advice it requires on its ordinary busi-
ness.
Operating Policies
3.03      During 1973, DBM modified its Policy Statement by raising the maxi-
mum loan it grants to small-scale industrial enterprises from Rs 10,000 to
Rs 15,000, and to agricultural enterprises from Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per



- 7 -
arpent. Loans over these ceilings pay higher interest charges. (The re-
vised Policy Statement appears as Annex 4.) These changes were called for
because of rising construction costs in the country. Also, DBM's interest
rate on small-scale industrial loans was decreased from 4.5% to 2.5X, because
of the Government's desire to provide a greater subsidy to small-scale enter-
prises. This degree of subsidy should not be needed for worthwhile projects.
However, since the Government is covering all risks and costs of this program,
there is little leverage that DBM has to modify the lending rate. DBM plans
to undertake a review of the program with the Bank's assistance to determine
the costs and benefits of the program.
Board of Directors
3.04      DBM's Board consists of twelve directors:  three representatives
of the Government, one of the Bank of Mauritius, and seven of the private
sector (all chosen by the Government) and the Managing Director. (See list
of Directors in Annex 3.) The Chairman, Mr. R. Pyndiah is also Financial
Secretary of Mauritius and holds a casting vote in DBM. The Directors are
all prominent members of Mauritius' business and official communities. The
Board, which must approve all investments, meets twice a month, and applies
itself conscientiously to DBM's affairs.
Management
3.05      DBM's Managing  Director, Mr. D.V. Narasimhan, was recommended to
DBM by the Bank Group. He joined the company in May 1971 after spending
six years as Chief Executive of the Madras Industrial Investment Corporation
(India). Mr. Narasimhan's contract expires in May 1974, but it is expected
that he will continue with DBM until a replacement for him can be found.
DBM, in consultation with the Bank, is at present actively reviewing a number
of possible expatriate candidates to fill the post.
Staff and Recruitment Practices
3.06      DBM's organization chart is shown as Annex 5.  DBM's staff consists
of 18 professionals and 29 non-professionals. The Industrial Department is
ably managed by Mr. Edward Siou. Since November 1971, DBM has had the advan-
tage of the services of an investment officer seconded from ICICI, 1/
Mr. P.H. Joshi. Mr. Joshi's contract expired in November 1973, and his term
was extended for another year. During 1973, DBM recruited five new invest-
ment officers for its Industrial Investment Section, and a project accountant
for its Industrial Estate Section. Also, at the time of the mission's visit,
the company had opened ten regional offices to assist applicants for DBM
financing particularly of small-scale industry and agricultural projects.
It plans to open another ten such offices by the end of FY1974. DBM had the
misfortune of having its accountant and his assistant die during 1973. At
present, one of the five new investment officers is acting as a temporary
1/   Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India.



accountant. DBM's accounting and budgeting work is in need of much improvement
(see para. 3.11), and the company is searching for a comptroller/treasurer at
the level of a chartered accountant (or equivalent) to strengthen this aspect
of its work. None of the five new investment officers DBM recruited this year
have had experience in project analysis, but they appear to have potential,
given adequate on-the-job training. Mr. Joshi will be devoting much of his
time to the training of DBM's appraisal staff.
3.07      Part of the staffing problems seems to be that DBM has set its
sights too low in its recruitment efforts, but not because of constraints
in the level of salaries it can offer. In connection with the first IDA
Credit, DBM substantially raised salaries, which were at the level of gov-
ernment salaries, to bring them to a level intermediate between the public
and the private sectors.  During 1973, following the Sedgwick recommenda-
tions, 1/ public salaries were increased by about 40% to be brought in line
with the current level of salaries in the private sector.  DBM's salaries will
be increased as well, and are expected to continue to be maintained between
public and private sector levels.
Procedures
3.08      Coordination and internal communications within DBM need to be im-
proved. At present, investment officers report directly to the Managing
Director, who performs such tasks as assigning projects to particular officers
and reviewing draft appraisal reports. However, the Managing Director does
not have time to give each officer the type of individualized attention re-
quired and as a result, DBM's new recruits do not get adequate attention.
Management also becomes deeply involved in the details of the accounting
function, including forecasting and preparation of internal reports. Respon-
sibility for these activities needs to be delegated, and lines of authority
need to be more clearly defined within DBM. Only then will DBM's management
be able to focus its efforts on more important matters which require its
attention, including the organization of follow-up work, staff recruitment
policies, coordination on projects with commercial banks, and improving the
capability of DBM's own staff and appraisals. During negotiations, DBM
stated that it would take steps along these lines.
Appraisals
3.09      Most of DBM's appraisals have been at an acceptable quality level
but some needed to be more thorough, particularly with respect to proposed
management and marketing arrangements for projects.  Economic analysis of
import substitution projects needs to be improved. The Bank made available
to DBM a set of guidelines for economic analyses of projects and helped work
out economic return calculations on a number of projects submitted for Bank
financing. During negotiations, DBM stated that it would send to the Bank
projects over the free limit at an early stage and await the Bank's views
before committing itself on such projects.
1/   Mr. P.C.M. Sedgwick was retained by Government as a consultant to review
civil service classifications and salaries.



-9-
Follow-Up
3.10      DBM has been slow in establishing an effective procedure for following
up on projects after disbursements have been made. As a result, many loans
have been in arrears for long periods of time without effective action being
taken by DBM (see para. 4.14). DBM did make follow-up visits to about thir-
teen industrial projects during the first nine months of 1973. However,
these visits did not result in recommendations for concrete steps to be taken
either by DBM or by the company to help resolve problems. Also, many other
problem projects existed which had not been visited by DBM. One positive step
taken by DBM during 1973 was the appointment of a special subcommittee of the
company's Board to review each of the large agricultural and industrial loans
in arrears. At the Bank's insistence, DBM is now instituting more systematic
follow up procedures, and its implementation of these will be followed closely.
Accounting and Auditors
3.11      The death of DBM's accountant and his assistant has strained the
company's internal accounting and reporting capacity. The company has under-
gone its first audit by an independent firm (Kemp Chatteris, which is
associated with Touche Ross & Co.), and as a result, a number of improvements
are being introduced in its accounting procedures. DBM is now searching for
a new comptroller/treasurer.
Legal Matters and Disbursements
3.12      DBM has four separate legal advisors which it consults on a re-
tainer basis. The company has been experiencing lags in signing loan con-
tracts in some cases of over a year after Board approval of projects. DBM's
clients usually obtain bridging financing from commercial banks. During 1973,
DBM's Ordinance was amended to allow DBM to take a fixed charge on fixed as-
sets of projects sited on leased land. In the past, DBM was only permitted
to take mortgages, which caused delays, since completion of construction of
buildings is required in Mauritius before a mortgage can be obtained on build-
ings located on leased land. Also, DBM has instituted a commitment charge
which begins accruing six months after Board approval of projects. These
measures should help eliminate delays in the signing of loan contracts. DBM
is continuing to look for other possible steps to eliminate delays. It will
also study whether notary fees on small-scale loans can be reduced. The
results of its investigations of these matters will be reported to the Bank.
3.13      Procurement procedures are satisfactory, considering that most of
the industrial projects financed by DBM are comparatively small. In the case
of machinery and equipment, customers are required to show evidence that they
have asked for more than one offer.

IV. DBM: RESOURCES, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Domestic Resources
4.01      Equity.  The share capital of DBM, entirely paid in, amounts to
Rs 10 million and is held 80% by the Government and 20% by the Central Bank.
As of June 30, 1973 retained earnings amounted to Rs 12.5 million, bringing
DBM's total equity to Rs 22.5 million. Investments in local currency for
the Industrial Estates project of Coromandel, amounting to about Rs 21 mil-
lion, will be financed from FY1974 to FY1977 by increases in subscription of
DBM's share capital by the Government.
4.02      Local currency borrowing.  As of June 30, 1973, DBM's long-term
liabilities amounted to Rs 44.6 million, of which Rs 18.0 million were in
the form of bonds issued by the Mauritius Agricultural Bank and assumed by
DBM, and Rs 26.6 million in the form of Government loans. The bonds, gua-
ranteed by the Government, were sold to the public between 1950 and 1963 with
initial maturities of between 23 and 25 years and an average interest rate of
4.04%. The first maturities fall due in 1976. DBM progressively builds up
a sinking fund, invested in various Government securities, to meet the repay-
ment of the bonds.
4.03      DBM has obtained all its new resources from the Government, which
has allocated once a year to DBM sufficient long-term funds to meet its ex-
pected requirements. Their interest rate is 2-1/2%. The Government, which
borrows from the local small capital market, prefers to lend to DBM rather
than let DBM borrow on the same market. In 1972, the Government decided to
subordinate its loans to DBM's other debt.
4.04      DBM accepts savings deposits from the public, and pays them the
same interest as commercial banks pay on deposits. Deposits have increased
from Rs 4.3 million at the end of FY1971 to Rs 5.8 million, or 10% of DBM's
total liabilities, at the end of FY1973.
Operations
4.05      A breakdown of DBM's total approvals, commitments, and disburse-
ments from 1967 to 1973 appears as Annex 6. About 90% of DBM's loans in the
last three years have been for industry, and 10% for agriculture. This is
consistent with the guidelines given to DBM when it was created; namely, that
it de-emphasize agriculture except for diversification projects, and that
it concentrate on employment-creating industrial projects.
4.06      DBM experienced a significant increase in its approvals of projects
in all categories during FY1973 (ending June 30). Loan and equity approvals
(net of cancellations) increased by 140% to Rs 22 million 1/ in FY1973 com-
pared to Rs 9 million in FY1972, and consisted of the following (in Rs mil-
lion):
1/   Excluding a Rs 4 million guarantee on a supplier's credit given to one
project at a one percent fee.

Total                      22.4           7.7
In addition, Rs 43 million was approved for the Coromandel industrial estate
project, which will be financed half by the second IDA credit to DBM, 1/ and
half by Government subscribing to additional shares in DBM. Total commit-
ments (excluding industrial estates) were Rs 7.7 million compared to Rs 5
million in FY1972, and disbursements were Rs 14 million compared to Rs 8
million in FY1972.
4.07      Industry.  Both the number and the average size of loans to indus-
try increased from FY1972 to FY1973 (22 loans averaging Rs 1.1 million in
FY1973 as compared to 17 loans averaging Rs 0.5 million in FY1972). However,
Rs 7 million of FY1973 industrial loan approvals were later cancelled (of
which Rs 6 million for a single project), compared to Rs 0.5 million of can-
cellations in FY1972.
4.08      A sectoral breakdown of DBM's approvals of industrial projects is
given in Annex 7. Hotels and textile projects have been the main sectors of
DBM's activity, representing respectively 56% and 31% of FY1973 approvals and
26% and 20% of total approvals since the company's inception. This concen-
tration is probably unavoidable given the constraints on Mauritius' indus-
trial development at this early phase; it is expected to decrease over time.
4.09      Of the six projects over the free limit already approved from
Credit 313-MAS, four are for industry and two for hotels. The projected
average economic return on investment for the six projects was about 16%.
The average investment cost per job created was about $2,200 for the indus-
trial projects and $15,000 for the hotels (see Annex 8).

number 178-MAS.



- 12 -
4.10      Small-Scale Industry.  In FY1973, DBMI approved Rs 732,000 for 122
small-scale industrial projects compared to Rs 494,000 for 77 projects in
FY1972. Commitments rose from Rs 137,000 for 23 projects to Rs 467,000 for
68 projects. This increased activity is partly due to DBM's hiring of re-
gional representatives whose primary function is to publicize the services
offered by DBM and help small-scale entrepreneurs fill out DBMI's application
form. The administrative costs for DBM's small-scale industry program are
borne by the Government, and amounted to Rs 106,000 in FY1973. DBM has
played a useful role in advising small-scale entrepreneurs in some cases,
particularly during the construction phase of their projects.
4.11      Agriculture.  DBM  approved 78 agricultural loans for Rs 1.6 million
in FY1973 compared to 45 loans for Rs 700,000 in FY1972. Commitments were
Rs 1.1 million for 42 projects compared to Rs 600,000 for 15 projects in
FY1972. About two-thirds of FY1973 approvals were loans of Rs 5,000 or
less to owners of ten arpents 1/ of land or less. Nearly half of DBM's
agricultural loans have been to promote diversification away from sugar.
At the Government's request and risk, DBM undertakes refinancing of prior
agricultural loans, and this type of operation represented 80% of FY1973
approvals in agriculture.
4.12      Industrial Estates.  The Government has asked DBM to undertake a
program of constructing and leasing buildings suitable for industrial enter-
prises. A first project, totaling about 250,000 square feet was under way
at Plaine Lauzun at the time of the first IDA credit to DBM, and the credit
included $100,000 for a feasibility study of a new project and $400,000 for
continuation of the current project until the feasibility study was completed,
in January 1973. An IDA credit of $4 million was extended for DBM in June
1973, for the financing of a second project located at Coromandel and total-
ing 1,260,000 square feet of floor space. Two thirds of the construction
will consist of ready-made factory buildings, and one third will be con-
structed according to the needs of individual enterprises, either by DBM,
or by the enterprises themselves on rented plots. DBM has been highly suc-
cessful in constructing and managing industrial estates. All finished build-
ings at Plaine Lauzun are fully occupied, and the demand for new buildings
remains strong.
Portfolio Evaluation
4.13      An analysis of DBM's loan portfolio at June 30, 1973 is given in
Annex 9 and summarized below:
1/   1 arpent = 1.043 acres.

/1   Arrears over three months.
4.14      On the total portfolio, arrears over three months amounted to Rs
3.3 million, or 8.5% of outstanding amounts, and about 20% of the portfolio
was affected by these arrears. The condition of the portfolio has deterio-
rated since DBM was appraised for its first IDA credit. The main reason for
this is the medium and large-scale industrial loan portfolio, 15% of which
was affected by arrears over three months at June 30, 1973, compared to 8%
at December 31, 1971. Discussions held with DBM's management and staff in-
dicated that many of the 22 industrial companies with loans in arrears over
three months are apparently doing well, and probably would repay if DBM under-
took more vigorous collection procedures. Eight companies, however, appear
to be encountering management or operating difficulties, including a compost
company, a producer of construction materials, a blade manufacturer, two food
processors, two textile firms and a tannery. A portion of DBM's Rs 1.9 mil-
lion in outstanding loans (and a Rs 23,000 equity investment) in these firms
may eventually be lost, but potential losses are adequately covered by the
Rs 1.8 million DBM has set aside for provisions. DBM is now undertaking an
investigation of each of these problem projects to determine what can be
done to improve their performance.
4.15      The large number of agricultural loans in arrears are now being
systematically reviewed by DBM's Board. They include loans to tea planters,
(guaranteed by the Government), many of which may need to be written off due
to depressed world market prices for tea, and other problems of the Mauritian
tea industry.
4.16      Equity Investments.  At June 30, 1973, DBM held Rs 7.6 million in
ten equity investments (representing 16% of its total loan and equity port-
folio). They include two fertilizer companies (with Rs 4.4 million partic-
ipation by DBM), three hotels (total DBM investment: Rs 1.3 million), the



- 14 -
State Commercial Bank (Rs 500,000), a distillery (Rs 450,000), a vegetable
oil mill (Rs 330,000), a bagasse board manufacturer (Rs 250,000), and a
casino (Rs 12,000). Only the casino, the hotel, and the oil milling proj-
ect have started paying dividends as yet. These are quite profitable, and
yielded a 4% dividend return on the total year end portfolio. Most of the
other companies have not yet begun operations. One loss seems probable; a
compost company in which DBM's equity investment was made by capitalization
of overdue interest payments on a previous loan.
Profitability
4.17      Summarized financial statements on DBM for fiscal years 1969 to
1973 appear as Annexes 10 and 11. Improved performance of DBM's equity port-
folio and increased rental income on industrial estates, in addition to a
continued high (3.7%) average spread on borrowed funds, allowed the company
to earn Rs 2.0 million profit in FY1973, representing 9% of average net worth,
compared to Rs 1.5 million in FY1972, equivalent to 7.6% of net worth.  Exclu-
ding depreciation on and assets in industrial estates, DBM has maintained its
administrative expenses at the quite low level of 1.3% of average total assets.
Financial Condition
4.18      DBM's financial condition is satisfactory at present.  Provisions
at 4% of the total loan and equity portfolio, are adequate to cover possible
losses (see para. 4.14). The term debt/equity ratio 1/ is low at 1.8/1 (or
0.2/1 when Government loans subordinate to other debt and maturing after
other debt are included as part of equity.
V. PROSPECTS
Forecast Activity
5.01      DBM plays a crucial role in financing industrial development in
Mauritius, and it is essential that it acquires and develops effective pro-
fessional staff in sufficient number to cope with additional business. As-
suming Mauritius continues to enjoy economic and social stability, the out-
look for industrial investment in export-oriented projects is favorable.
There could well be a slowdown on new investments in tourism projects, how-
ever, if airline traffic is reduced and fares are increased due to fuel
shortages. Also, it should be expected that wage increases will tend to re-
duce progressively the current competitive advantage Mauritius has in terms
of its low labor costs.

5.02      In September 1973, DBM had under consideration a pipeline of 13
medium to large-scale industrial projects with estimated total project costs
of Rs 111 million, of which about Rs 25 million might be required from DBM.
These included six textile companies (requiring Rs 18 million from DB1),
three food processors (including fishing, requiring Rs 43 million), and one
hotel (Rs 2.3 million).
5.03      DBMl's projected operations and financial statements 1/ from FY1972
to FY1978 are given in Annexes 14 to 17, and their detailed assumptions ap-
pear in Annex 13. DBM estimates that it will probably be able to approve
about Rs 14 million of industrial loans during FY1974 out of the above pipe-
line or other projects which may be substituted. This would be nearly as
much as FY1973's record level of net approvals of industrial loans, and it
seems a reasonable estimate. Approvals of industrial loans are expected to
grow by about Rs 1 million (7%) annually thereafter. Annual approvals of
equity investments are expected to be maintained at Rs 1.5 million, about
half the abnormally high level reached in FY1973. Investments in small-
scale industry and agriculture are expected to show moderate increases in
the future. A small amount of addition financing of industrial estates is
expected in the next few years outside of the Coromandel project (mostly
at Plaine Lauzun). The projections allow for cancellations of 10% of ap-
provals and an additional cancellation of 10% of commitments on industrial
loans. About 85% of loan commitments are expected to be completed within
a year after approval, and 85% of disbursements are expected to be made
within a year after commitment, in line with DBMi's experience.
Resource Requirements
5.04      DBM's statement of resources as of June 30, 1973, is shown in Annex
12. At that time, the company had Rs 6 million available for additional do-
mestic currency commitments. Uncommitted approvals exceeded that amount,
and the Government has agreed to provide DBMI with an additional loan of Rs 5
million (at a 2.5% interest rate) during FY1974. Additional loans are ex-
pected to be provided by the Government on the same terms. Over the next
few years, the Government will also be providing Rs 21.3 million in addi-
tional equity to DBI1 to help finance the Coromandel industrial estate proj-
ect.
5.05      Regarding foreign currency, DBM had, as of mid-December 1973,
US$1.5 million available for additional authorizations under IDA credit
313-MAS which is expected to be fully committed by March 1974. The foreign
exchange component on DBM's future industrial loans is assumed to be 70 per-
cent, which is in line with DBM's experience to date. The company's addi-
tional foreign exchange commitments for industrial loans are expected to be
about US$4.5 million through FY1976. DBM will also require an estimated
US$600,000 in foreign exchange to complete construction of industrial estates
primarily at Plaine Lauzun. A US$5 million Bank loan would therefore approxi-
mately cover DBM's foreign exchange requirements through June 1976.
1/   In constant prices.

5.06      Disbursements.  The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign
component of DBM's investments in industry and tourism (excluding small-scale
industry) 1/ which would include the CIF cost of direct imports, 75% of the
invoiced price of goods previously imported into Mauritius, 50% of the in-
voiced price of goods produced in Mauritius to a substantial extent from
imported inputs, and 45% of construction costs of industrial buildings and
hotels, such percentages representing the estimated foreign component of
these categories of investment goods. In order to permit continuity of
Bank financing of DBM's foreign exchange requirements, the proposed Bank
loan should permit retroactive financing of projects, though no earlier
than 90 days prior to submission of the project for Bank approval (as is
the standard rule for development finance companies). Annex 19 shows an
estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan.
DBM's Financial Charges
5.07      Interest Rates.  At present DBM's interest rates are 2.5% for small-
scale industrial loans, and 6-7% on agricultural loans. In November 1971 DBM
agreed to follow a recommendation from the Bank Group to raise its interest
rate on loans to medium and large-scale industry and tourism from 6.5% to
the commercial bank level of 8.5%. The recent inflation in Mauritius justified
a new increase. During negotiations for the proposed Bank loan, DBM agreed
to increase its interest rate further to 9.5%. A higher increase was considered
inappropriate because of competition with commercial banks mentioned in the
following paragraph.
5.08      DBM and the Commercial Banks.  There exists at present a healthy
relationship between DBM and the commercial banks, made of competition in
some cases, of cooperation through joint financing in other cases. From
the point of view of investors, DBM has the advantage over the commercial
banks of offering longer-term loans, and the disadvantage of the lengthier
investigations it must undertake. Its relative disadvantages will be increased
now due to its higher interest rate and the fact that it will pass on the
foreign exchange risk on its Bank loan to subborrowers. However, the Govern-
ment recently imposed credit limits on commercial banks and, therefore, it
is not expected that these disadvantages will be significantly detrimental
to DBM's business prospects.
Projected Financial Results
5.09      DBM's administrative costs (excluding depreciation on industrial
estates) are expected to rise by 60% in FY1974 due to the addition of at
least seven new staff members and to salary increases following increases
taking place in the country (see para. 3.07). Administrative costs will
still be relatively low, given the size of the company, equivalent to 1.6%
of average total assets. In FY1974, DBM will also experience an increase
sr* ts' ~could nor be used for DBN;'s small industrial loans given the
0' "  1 rate the Government has set for them (see para. 3.03).

in the cost of debt from 3.8% to 5.0% due to greater use of the first IDA
credit, which is onlent to DBM by the Government at a 7.25% interest rate.
Assuming no change in its lending rate, the resulting reduced spread on bor-
rowed funds (from 3.7% in FY1973 to 2.5% in FY1974), combined with higher
administrative costs, are expected to cause a drop in DBM's profits in
FY1974 to about 5% of share capital (2.3% of average net worth), compared
to 20% of share capital (2.3% of average net worth), compared to 207% of
share capital in FY1973. Increased rental income from industrial estates
(up to a level which will permit DBM to earn revenues net of depreciation
of 9% on these operations), and an increasing volume of loans outstanding
are expected to enable DBM's net income (after ample provisions) to rise
to 20% of share capital by FY1978 (11% of average net worth). Its net
term debt/equity ratio 1/ is expected to rise to 2.0 in FY1975 before Gov-
ernment equity contributions for the Coromandel project and earnings reduce
it to 1.6/1 by FY1978. When subordinated Government loans are included as
part of equity, the ratio never exceeds 0.7/1. Since borrowings from Gov-
ernment are expected to mature after borrowings from the Bank Group, DBM's
debt service coverage will be ample (e.g., it will exceed 1.3 through FY1978).
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      DBM has an important role to play in financing the development of
industry in Mauritius, a sector of major importance, given the Government's
development strategy of increasing employment substantially. DBM deserves
further financial assistance and institutional support from the Bank Group.
A US$5 million Bank loan is recommended to meet DBM's estimated foreign ex-
change requirements for industrial and tourism projects and a small amount
(estimated at US$600,000) for industrial estates outside of the Coromandel
project.
6.02      The following agreements were reached with DBM and the Government:
(1) DBM would raise its interest rate on medium and large-
scale industrial and tourism loans from 8.5% to 9.5%
(see para. 5.07) and it would pass on the foreign exchange
risk under the Bank loan to subborrowers; and
(2) the Government would submit its land use plan for Mauritius
together with measures for its enforcement to the Bank for
comments (para. 2.07).

In addition, the following assurances were obtained and recorded in the
minutes of negotiation:
(1) DBM would undertake, with the Bank's assistance, a review
of its small scale industry lending program (para. 3.03);
(2)  DBM would take meas-res to increase the delegation of
responsibility to investment officers and to clarify its
lines of authority (para. 3.08);
(3) DBM would send projects for Bank financing early enough to
receive the Bank's views before committing itself to them
(para. 3.09);
(4) DBM would undertake more systematic follow-up work and more
vigorous collections on loans (para. 3.10); and
(5) DBM would continue investigating possible measures to
reduce the time needed to sign loan contracts and will
inform the Bank of its conclusions (para. 3.12).
6.03      The terms of the proposed Bank loan should be those generally
applied to recent Bank loans to development finance companies, including
standard commitment fees. The amortization of the loan will be the ag-
gregate of the amortization schedules of sub-loans and fixed schedules
of repayment to the Bank in the case of investments. The maximum maturity
on DBM sub-projects under the Bank loan would be 15 years for industrial sub-
loans, and 20 years for tourism projects, industrial estates, and equity invest-
ments (the latter being subject to the Bank's approval in each case). It is
recommended that the free limit for the loan be increased from US$50,000 to
US$150,000, and the aggregate free limit be increased from US$750,000 to
US$1 million. This would permit the Bank to review at least 80% of the
financing provided by DBM under the proposed loan and about one-third the
number of projects.

ANNEX 4
Page 1
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
Statement of General Policy
Approved by the Board of Directors of DBM on October 27, 1971 and Amended
on February 9, 1972 and May 30, 1972
1.        The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) was established in the
year 1964 as a result of Ordinance No. 34 of 1963 and may be described as
a Successor to the Mauritius Agricultural Bank (MAB) whose assets and li-
abilities it took over.
The main reason leading to the establishment of the DBMI was to
bring into existence a single institution which would cater to the needs of
industry, agriculture and tourism and other related activities that have
relevance to the country's economic development.
2.        The purpose for which the Bank has been established have been
defined in the Ordinance itself under Section 5 quoted hereunder:-
5.(1)  The purposes of the Bank shall be to facilitate the
industrial, agricultural and economic development of
the country by promoting, encouraging and assisting
in all or any of the following activities:
(a) the financing, management and establishment of:
i) new undertalcings;
ii) schemes for the expansion, better organization,
modernization and more beneficial exploitation
of any undertakings;
(b)  the conduct of research into the industrial, agri-
cultural, mineral, maritime and commercial poten-
tialities of the country;
(e)  the participation of private enterprise and capital,
whether from abroad or from within the country, in
the said activities;
(2)   Subject to the provision of Section 15 of this Ordinance, in
carrying out the objects provided for in subsection (1) of
this section, the Bank shall, when considering the economic
and commercial interests and the merits of any undertaking,
have due regard to the general economic interests of the
country."



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(3) W4hile under Section 15 of the Ordinance the Minister of
Finance is empowered to give the Bank general directives
as to the policy to be followed by it under certain con-
ditions, the administration shall be in the hands of the
Mlanaging Director subject to the control and supervision
of the Board of Directors.
II. RESOURCES
1.        The Bank, subject to the approval of the Bank of Mauritius, would
raise funds from public and private sources upon which terms and conditions
as the Board may determine by any or all of the following means:
(1)  negotiating loans within or outside Mauritius;
(2) the issue of bonds, debentures or certificates of
indebtedness;
(3) negotiations or arrangements with any bank for
overdrafts;
(4) acceptance of deposits on demand or at term.
2.        DB.I will accept deposits from the public in the shape of savings
and fixed deposits and short-term bills, but the fixed deposits will not be
for a period of less than 1 year.
3.        The total amount of moneys borrowed, raised or guarantee and owing
or outstanding shall not at any time exceed in the aggregate 3 times the total
amount of the Paid-up Capital Surplus and Reserves of the DBM plus any subor-
dinated loans provided by the Government.
III.  OPEPATIONS
A. Industry
1. The Bank will provide assistance to industry in the following ways:
a) Medium and long-term loans.
b) Equity participation (through underwriting, direct sub-
scription, conversion rights or in any other manner).
c) Issue of guarantees (arising out of payment for machinery
and equipment imported or otherwise or for any other purpose).
d) Allotment of Sheds in Industrial Estates owned by the Bank.
e) In any other appropriate manner.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
2.   DBM's financial assistance will primarily be for expenditure
on fixed assets, save in exceptional cases where working capital
requirements, if they are not forthcoming from other usual
channels will be considered at the discretion of the Board,
provided adequate security as normally required for its lending
operations is available.
3.   The Bank will normally require that each loan is adequately
secured according to terms and conditions prescribed by the
Board at its discretion. It is, however, the present policy
(which is subject to modification at the discretion of the
Board and without any formal notice) to provide loans to the
extent of 50% (which may be extended to 75% depending on the
circumstances of each case) of the available security by way
of fixed assets.
4.   The total commitments of the DBM in a single enterprise -
loans, equity, guarantee and any other type of assistance -
will normally not exceed 15% of the DBM's Paid-up Capital,
Free Reserves and subordinated Government loan outstanding.
5.   The DBM's investments in the Share Capital of a single enter-
prise will normally not exceed 25% of the Issued Capital of
the enterprise or 10% of the DBM's Capital, Reserves and
Subordinated Government Loan outstanding and disbursement
thereof will be proportionate to the amount of capital paid-up.
The DBM will normally not seek to acquire controlling interests
in any enterprise. The aggregate investments of the DBM in
Share Capital of enterprises will not exceed the DBM's Paid-up
Capital, and Free Reserves.
6.   Assistance by the Bank will be decided purely on merits of each
case. The feasibility of the project, its viability, profitability,
debt service coverage, the market potential, its quality of manage-
ment, its ability to earn foreign exchange or save foreign ex-
change, the extent of employment opportunities created and its
ultimate contribution to the economy of the country will be the
paramount considerations in deciding whether or not to render
assistance to a project.
7.   The DBM may grant loans or provide other forms of assistance
either by itself or jointly with other institutions both local
and overseas.
8.   The period of the loans/assistance will depend upon a study of
each case depending on the repayment potential. The period of
repayments for loans for investment projects for tourism may
extend to 20 years and for other investment projects to 15 years.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
9.   The Bank would save in exceptional circumstances, expect
long-term debts of the Company charged against its fixed
assets not to exceed its Paid-up capital.
The Bank will normally require personal guarantees in the case of Companies.
B.   Small Industries
In the case of Small Scale Industries, the Bank would lend
against the security of Fixed Assets of the borrower. Where
the primary security is not adequate, non-industrial assets
provided by the borrower may also be considered for acceptance
as security. In addition, the Bank may ask for the guarantee
of third parties wherever it is considered necessary. All loans
to Small Scale Industries i.e., loans to manufacturing activities
for loans below Rs. 15,000 will be automatically guaranteed by
the Government. In deciding assistance to Small Scale Industries,
a liberal attitude will be taken regarding the Loan/Fixed Assets
Coverage.
C.   Industrial Estates
The DBM will also engage in the building of industrial sheds
in Industrial Estates and provide the sheds to industries at
reasonable rents and on such terms and conditions fixed by
the Board.
General Conditions
1.        The Bank, in cases where the Board considers appropriate, would
seek a right to convert its loans to industries into equity. It will be the
policy of the Bank to gradually dispose its equity holdings in the market or
elsewhere and in so doing it will, to the extent possible, see to it that
the Shares are dispersed as widely as possible and that the Shares do not,
by such sale, get into the hands of rival groups.
2.        The DBE  will have the right to inspect the enterprises including
their operations and accounts and will therefore have the right of access to
visit the factory at any time to carry out its inspections. The DBM will
require its borrowers to keep records and maintain accounts in accordance
with sound accounting practices and to furnish whatever information DBM may
seek on their operations and accounts.
D.   Agriculture
1. The Bank will provide assistance to agriculture for the
following purposes:
a) Application of planting materials, manure and fertilizers;
b) diversification of crops;

Page 5
c) mechanical preparation of land;
d) repayment of prior debts
e) development of land including replantation and
planting of virgin soil;
f) improvement of yields;
g) breeding and rearing of livestock.
2. Agricultural loans are provided as under:
1) Sugar Cane Cultivation - The following are the criteria:
(a) Loan applied for
(b) 80% security value
(c) Rs. 2,000 per arpent, and the loan sanctioned is
usually the lowest of the three figures of a, b & c.
2) Tea Cultivation - The same criteria as for sugar
cultivation are applied.
3) Other Agricultural Loans - In the context of agricultural
diversification and agro-industrial projects, loans may
be sanctioned between 50 to 75% of the project cost. It is
the present practice to limit this type of loan to around
50% of the project cost.
IV. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
1.   DBM will diversify its portfolio in order to spread its risks
widely so that such risks are kept at a reasonable level. Such
diversification will be sought to be achieved through investment
in different types of enterprises and through different types
financing.
2.   DBM will lend and invest its resources in such a way as to
maintain the value of its capital. In appropriating its profits,
due care will be taken to see that adequate reserves are built
to provide for any bad debts, possible losses or any other risks
that the Bank may have to undertake.
3.   The DBM will not incur any exchange risk in respect of those of
its borrowings that are repayable in foreign currencies. DBM
will pass to its clients any foreign exchange risk it assumes
or find other suitable means to cover it.



ANNEX 4
Page 6

not provide assistance to industries owned by the Government wholly
or partly or in works undertaken by the Government.

by the Board without notice) are as under:
(a)  2-1/2%  (Small Scale Industries)
(b)  8-1/2%  (Other Industries)
(c)  6-7%    (Agriculture)

ANNEX 13
Page 1
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS
Assumptions of Projected Operations and Financial Statements 1974-78
A.   Forecast of operations (Annex 13):
1.   Approvals.  Approvals of industrial loans are Rs. 14 million in
FY74, increasing by Rs 1 million annually thereafter, 70% being for
imports. Annual approvals of equity investments are maintained at
a level of Rs. 1.5 million, about half the abnormally high level
reached in FY73. Small scale industry investments increase somewhat
beyond their FY73 level, until a Rs 1 million annual approval level
is reached in FY75. Investments in agriculture are maintained at
their high FY73 level, and experience a gradual rise after FY75. A
small amount of industrial estate financing takes place outside of
Coromandel (mostly at Plaine Lauzun).
2.   Cancellations, commitments, disbursements.  Equity approvals are
assumed committed and disbursed in the year of approval. Cancellations
are assumed at 10% of all loan approvals, and additional 10% of loan
commitments. Industrial loans are assumed committed:
15% in year of approval,
60% the following year,
15% the second year after approval,
and disbursed:
25% in year of commitment,
50% the following year,
15% the second year after commitment.
Small-scale industry and agricultural loans are assumed committed and dis-
bursed in the year of approval. Disbursements on the Coromandel industrial
estate are assumed to be completed in FY77.
B.   Revenues
3.   Interest and charges on loans:  Increase gradually from 7% of
average loan portfolio in FY73 to 8.25% in FY78. This reflects the
increase in DBM's interest rate on industrial loans to 9.5%.
4.   Rent on industrial buildings:  Rents are set at a level where income
(net of depreciation) from industrial estate operations equals 9% of the
book value of industrial buildings the previous year.
5.   Dividends on equity investments:  4% return on present portfolio
assumed. New investments return 7% after the three years.
6.   Income from short-term investments (including sinking fund):  5%.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
C.   Operating Expenses:
7.  Administrative expenses:  Recruitment of new staff and salary
increases (in line with the Sedgwick recommendations for increases
in Government salaries) are expected to cause a 60% rise in DBM's
administrative expenses (excluding depreciation) in FY74. There-
after annual increases of 7% are assumed.
8.   Depreciation on industrial estates:  straight line for 20 years.
9.   Provisions:  increased annually to maintain total provisions at
a constant 4% of the loan and equity portfolio.
10.   Interest on new borrowing:  7.25% on foreign funds, 2.5% on
subordinated loans from Government.
