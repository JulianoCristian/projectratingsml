Technical assistance in\n            support of politically difficult transition reforms have a\n            higher chance of success if designed as an integral part of\n            Bank's broader sector assistance strategy. The\n            implementation of a complex and politically sensitive\n            Technical Assistance (TA) program does not only require a\n            fully functioning implementing agency, but also constant\n            support at the level of senior policy-making. The effective\n            coordination by the Bank of technical assistance provided by\n            bilateral donors can be a critical factor in quickly\n            developing the institutional capacity to implement high\n            impact reforms. Flexibility built into the TA operations is\n            essential when dealing with rapidly evolving operational\n            environment. Creating efficient institutional arrangements\n            is a critical factor for implementing the complex technical\n            assistance program."}, "docdt": "2005-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
