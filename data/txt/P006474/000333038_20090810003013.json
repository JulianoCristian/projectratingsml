satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: organized beneficiary farmers, having\n            witnessed the impact of technological change and better land\n            management practices on their lands, are now poised to\n            exploit the productive benefits they were promised as a\n            result. Further, the micro-catchments is an effective forum\n            for rural organization and planning important for more\n            complex productive and other activities and a building block\n            for exploring and facilitating territorial and/or regional\n            development approaches. First-cycle micro-catchments\n            projects need to build installed capacity to more rapidly\n            and successfully execute follow-up operations. The\n            inevitable result is the short time available under the\n            initial project to capitalize on and consolidate acquired\n            knowledge and experience. Scaling-up should be balanced with\n            further innovation under follow-on operations. There is a\n            need to continuously 'sell' the project rationale,\n            objectives and results to senior authorities, budget\n            officials and policy makers across the political spectrum,\n            in all related agencies, and beyond the rural sector. Visits\n            by authorities to the project area/micro-catchments to\n            demonstrate project activities and impact, and meet\n            beneficiaries and local collaborators, are recommended."}, "docdt": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
