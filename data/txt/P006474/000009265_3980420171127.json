model developed for\n            previous projects in this series and on Brazil's pilot\n            experience in the State Program of Microcatchments (PEMBH),\n            the Third Land Management Project will promote the adoption\n            of integrated measures for natural resource management and\n            conservation, using the microcatchment area as the unit for\n            participatory planning, monitoring, and collective\n            implementation. The project is composed of six components:\n            1)a technology and institutional development component,\n            consisting of: a) rural extension encouraging a new form of\n            agricultural extension that modifies the current\n            product-focused extension, towards one focused on the\n            microcatchment productivity systems in which families and\n            rural communities actively participate; b) rural\n            associations which have financed selective administrative\n            and managerial equipment and consultant services; and c)\n            agro-ecological mapping at the microcatchment level in soil\n            classification and land use planning, and resource\n            information; 2) an adaptive agricultural research component,\n            which finances of specialized services, infrastructure,\n            field equipment, and inputs for research trials, and\n            incremental operating costs;  3) an incentive program for\n            natural resources management and conservation component,\n            which finances: environmental education, an incentives fund\n            for soil management and conservation and pollution control,\n            an incentive for recovery of degraded lands, reforestation,\n            and enforcement of the soil use law and of project\n            incentives; 4) an erosion control works in the rural roads\n            component, an integral part part of the microcatchment\n            interventions, consisting of minor reshaping of road\n            profiles, with shoulder remodeling, various drainage and\n            erosion control works, and road regraveling; 5) training and\n            dissemination; and 6) project coordination and administration."}, "docdt": "1997-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
