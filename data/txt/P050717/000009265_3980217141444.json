Savings Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project for Uruguay supports the development\n            of the capitalized system of individual pension accounts,\n            established as part of Uruguay's 1996 pension reform.\n            Pension reform success depends on the level of pension\n            benefits that the capitalization regime can provide its\n            affiliates. Good financial performance by the capitalization\n            regime would only be achieved if the AFAPs (Pension Fund\n            Administrators) are able to invest in relatively high return\n            marketable securities and reduce their operating costs. This\n            loan supports a number of measures to 1) liberalize the\n            investment regime of the AFAPs to allow greater investment\n            in private securities; 2) increase the availability of\n            private securities to match the growth of capitalized\n            pension funds; and 3) create incentives to improve cost\n            consciousness among the AFAPs and transparency in reporting."}, "docdt": "1998-01-07T00:00:00Z"}
