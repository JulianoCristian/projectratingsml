the outcome of the project is\n            considered highly satisfactory. The principal lessons\n            learned in the implementation of the project are: i) In\n            preparing complex sector adjustment operations, the Bank\n            should lead with its comparative advantage - bringing to\n            bear strong technical capacity, honed by practical\n            cross-country experience. ii) Political factors and the\n            legislative needs of the client need to be understood at\n            entry, and should be included in the Bank's dialogue\n            with the client. iii) It is important to select an\n            appropriate instrument. Rather than risk delays and failure\n            in the achievement of the program's long term aims, the\n            Bank team chose to negotiate a medium-term reform strategy,\n            and to allocate its reform goals over a series of\n            single-tranche adjustment operations (STOs). This provided\n            the Bank with greater agility in the disbursement, and will\n            enhance the institution's efficiency and leverage in\n            establishing the conditions of the proposed second loan."}, "docdt": "1998-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
