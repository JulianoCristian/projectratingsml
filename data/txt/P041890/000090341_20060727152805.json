satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: A transport strategy endorsed by\n            the city is essential to provide a framework for\n            investments. Political risk is not easy to assess or guard\n            against. Sensitization of key decision makers is crucial for\n            successful implementation of urban transport innovations.\n            Foreign consultants should be selected for tasks for which\n            the Borrower recognizes a clear value added. Traffic\n            management concepts require a process that should involve\n            testing and adaptation before it can be fully implemented or\n            expanded. There is an inherent priority given to road\n            construction and improvement that hinders the development of\n            public transport.
