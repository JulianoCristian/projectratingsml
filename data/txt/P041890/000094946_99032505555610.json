alleviate bottlenecks in the road system; b)\n            increase efficiency and effectiveness of public transport\n            services; c) improve maintenance of road investments; d)\n            improve environmental sustainability of project investments;\n            e) improve operational efficiency and safety of the road\n            system; and f) strengthen local capacity for urban transport\n            system management. The project will support the development\n            of infrastructure, services, and institutions in the cities\n            of Shenyang, Fushun, and Anshan. In Shenyang, the project\n            will augment the existing urban road network through the\n            construction of additional capacity in the principal\n            east-west corridors, provide additional crossings of the\n            railways lines, provide exclusive bus lanes, and strengthen\n            local capacity for the management of urban transport\n            operations and services through studies, technical\n            assistance, and training. In Fushun, the project will\n            finance the construction of the Hunhenan Corridor, the\n            provision of bus priority facilities and non-motorized\n            vehicle exclusive roads, and support studies, technical\n            assistance, and training. In Anshan, the project will\n            finance the reconstruction of the main north-south corridor\n            and the construction of an interchange between the primary\n            north-south and east-west corridors. The project will also\n            support the development of selected sector institutions in\n            the three cities."}, "docdt": "1999-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
