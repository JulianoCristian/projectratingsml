Major\n            mitigation measures to be undertaken include: construction\n            of sound barriers, and sound absorption pavement;\n            installation of double glazed windows and air conditioners;\n            promotion of public transportation, clean fuels, vehicle\n            inspection, and maintenance programs; installation of street\n            crossing signals, zebra lines, and designated non-motor\n            vehicle lanes; re-plantation and landscaping programs;\n            interception of surface runoff; and establishment of\n            environmental emergency teams to minimize impacts of motor\n            vehicle accidents involving hazardous materials. Remaining\n            noticeable impacts include an increase in noise; loss of\n            agricultural land; temporary traffic obstruction and\n            detouring; and accidental hazardous material release."}, "docdt": "1998-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
