Financial Management\n            Project for Colombia has two developmental aims. It\n            strengthens the capacity of the Direccion de Impuestos y\n            Aduanas Nacionales (Directorate of National Taxes and\n            Customs)(DIAN) to foster voluntary compliance; collects\n            revenues efficiently, effectively, and equitably; and\n            combats tax evasion and smuggling, for the DIAN to mobilize\n            adequate tax revenues to finance public expenditures. It\n            also aims to strengthen public expenditure management at the\n            central government level, to facilitate achievement of\n            fiscal and national development objectives, improve cost\n            effectiveness of public services, and increase transparency\n            and accountability. The project has two main components:\n            revenue administration and public expenditure. The first\n            component comprises six sub-components which strengthen\n            organization and management of the DIAN; facilitate\n            voluntary compliance; improve the effectiveness of the DIAN\n            in managing routine processing of tax declarations and\n            payments, and cargo, customs declarations, and payments;\n            strengthen the capacity of the DIAN in enforcement\n            operations; and improve policy and the legal framework of\n            revenue administration. The second component comprises three\n            sub-components that improve macro-programming and\n            formulation and monitoring of the budget; strengthen budget\n            execution, treasury, and public credit and accounting;\n            improve the evaluation of results of public expenditure; and\n            strengthen public procurement and contracting."}, "docdt": "2001-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
