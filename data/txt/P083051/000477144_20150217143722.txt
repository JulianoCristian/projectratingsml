Project Development Objectives
The objective of the Project is to test a model to improve accessibility to markets for poor
rural producers in the Pilot Areas by: (a) promoting strategic productive alliances between
different economic players at the local level; (b) empowering rural producers through the
development of self-managed grass-root organizations; (c) increasing access to productive
assets and technology; and (d) promoting more effective, responsive and accountable
service organizations at the local level.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1. Country and Sector Background.
The Project was designed during a period of social unrest in the administration of President Carlos
Mesa (2003-2005). Previously, Bolivia had undergone a long period of structural reforms
supported by the World Bank. To enhance the opportunities for rural growth and income increases
for the poor the previous administrations introduced the Popular Participation Law of 1994, the
Administrative Decentralization Law of 1995 and the Municipalities Law of 1999. These laws
established a set of instruments to boost campesino (peasant) and indigenous rural production
through the transfer of resources to local governments for productive investments. The National
Dialogue Law of 2000 introduced new instruments to strengthen the incentives to local
governments to support rural production: (a) the creation of Municipal Productive Councils; (b) the
eligibility of support to productive initiatives in the use of Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC
II) resources; and (c) support for productive investments and public productive infrastructure
through the Productive and Social Investment Fund (FPS).
1.1.2. These reforms did not result in the expected rural growth and increases in rural incomes.
The contribution of agriculture to Bolivia’s GNP had remained practically unchanged for 15 years
(at about 16%) but all of the growth in the sector had been concentrated in large lowland farms that
produced soy and related agricultural commodities for export while the contribution of small
producers, focused mostly on the internal markets, stagnated. The incidence of rural poverty stood
at 77.7% and extreme poverty at 53.7%, 6.7 and 14.1 percentage points lower than in 1996,
respectively, and significantly higher than in urban areas. Following the social unrest that peaked
in October 2003, the new Administration was highly committed to respond to the demands of
peasant and indigenous groups, particularly in relation to productive investments and income
opportunities. It convened a Third National Dialogue process with a focus on production and
completed a National Rural Development Strategy (ENDAR) whose main objective was to increase
rural incomes and employment through the provision of tools and knowledge to increase market
accessibility in a sustainable way. These two initiatives, and their main objectives, provided the
framework for project preparation.
1.1.3. President Mesa resigned in June 2005 and was replaced by the interim administration of
President Eduardo Rodriguez until January 2016, when Mr. Evo Morales became the new elected
President. The Morales administration represented a break with the past as it was led mainly by
representatives of peasant organizations and indigenous peoples.
1.1.4. Rationale for Bank Involvement. During the reform process of the 1990s, Bolivia
became a major focus of Bank support in Latin America and a model for macro-economic and
decentralization policies. The Bank’s assistance to this reform process was embedded in several
investment and adjustment operations, and in supporting the preparation of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy, whose principles were included in the National Dialogue Law of 2000. The Bank also
maintained a strong dialogue for the preparation of the ENDAR, and accompanied its national
consultation process simultaneously with the preparation of this project. The Bank had supported
rural development efforts mainly through the decentralization and popular participation reforms,
which devolved functions and resources to rural areas, ending decades of urban bias in public
investment and institutional development. The successful Rural Communities Development (1995-
1999) and the follow up Participatory Rural Investment (1998-2006) projects focused on
empowerment of rural communities, municipal strengthening and investments in rural
infrastructure and productive support. By 2003, however, it became evident that fiscal transfers and
complementary investment financing for municipalities were not the appropriate vehicle for



                                                 1
supporting agriculture and income-generating activities in rural areas, as local authorities preferred
to invest in social sector infrastructure and did not have the technical know-how to support
productive initiatives adequately. In 2001-2005, the Bank also financed the Indigenous Peoples
Learning and Innovation Credit, a small operation that aimed at creating a dedicated line of
financing for indigenous economic initiatives. These projects established a solid rationale for the
Bank’s support to rural development in the following decade. Key insights derived from this
experience led to the need to differentiate lines of financing by function and to the preparation of a
new rural development portfolio: (i) rural infrastructure and institution building for municipalities
and communities (the Second Participatory Rural Investment Project); (ii) inclusion of rural
producers in dynamic markets (the Rural Alliances Project); (iii) infrastructure for marginalized
rural communities (the Community Investment in Rural Areas Project); and (iv) agricultural
technology development (the Agricultural Innovation and Services Project).1
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
1.2.1. The objective of the Project was to test a model to improve accessibility to markets for
poor rural producers in the Pilot Areas by: (a) promoting strategic productive alliances between
different economic players at the local level; (b) empowering rural producers through the
development of self-managed grass-root organizations; (c) increasing access to productive assets
and technology; and (d) promoting more effective, responsive and accountable service
organizations at the local level.
1.2.2. Original Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for the Project were: (i) income of rural
productive households; (ii) earned income by work day; (iii) new employment generated; (iv)
volume (quantity and price) sold by producers; (v) unit sale price of product, and (vi) the
implementation of the alliance model itself.
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
1.3.1. Over the course of the Project the PDO was not changed. The key indicators underwent
some change at the approval of the Board-approved Additional Financing (AF) in April 2009. Two
outcome indicators were dropped: the “Increase in income per day of labor” and the “Increment in
the sale price of product” since both indicators depended mostly on factors outside of project
control. Two other outcome indicators were changed: the expected values of the “Growth in
income of rural productive units” and the “Increase in the volume marketed per rural productive
unit” were modified from an accumulated end-of-project increase of 54% to an accumulated three-
year increase of 45% per alliance, in order to facilitate measurement during the life of the project.
One indicator was added: “Number of financed alliances with an Internal Rate of Return greater
than 12.5%” in order to provide a more accurate measure of success. These changes applied to the
original Credit and the Additional Financing.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1. The original Project covered 54 municipalities in (a) the northern expansion zone of Santa
Cruz; (b) the Cochabamba valleys; and (c) the area around the Uyuni Salt Lake in Oruro and Potosi.
These areas were selected on the basis of their potential for growth, poverty reduction requirements,
and the capacity to establish local productive alliances. Total population was estimated at about
one million inhabitants (235,000 households). Within this population, there was an extraordinarily
high degree of social, ethnic, economic and organizational diversity. The majority (70.4%) of the
population in the project areas was indigenous, and the project was designed to ensure that it was

consistent and compatible with indigenous culture, values, and economic and political organization.
During implementation 11 adjacent municipalities were added.
1.4.2. The project was to benefit directly 8,400 families with support for productive investments
and 18,000 families with indirect assistance (through municipal investments) for public
infrastructure. Beneficiaries were to be self-selected following a set of criteria including: (i) poverty
level; (ii) living in centers with less than 2000 inhabitants; (iii) being members of producer
associations; (iv) a minimum level of education and (v) experience in production.
1.4.3. The AF added 29 municipalities in two new areas: 16 municipalities in the Lake Titikaka
region and 13 municipalities in the La Paz-Beni subtropical area, increasing the target population
from 125,000 to 200,000 families. Taking into account some other project area adjustments, the
estimated number of direct beneficiaries increased from 8,400 to 33,700. The number of indirect
beneficiaries was reduced from 18,000 families to 12,000 because of the decision to reduce the
number of municipal investments.
1.5 Original Components
1.5.1. Component 1: Institutional Support (USD3.33 million of which IDA USD3.33 million).
This component financed technical assistance and training for the creation of productive alliances.
It focused on the institutional capacity development of small producer organizations to become
partners in new marketing arrangements with the private sector. The component’s main outputs
were the formation of rural productive alliances2 and the preparation of viable alliance plans.
1.5.2. To realize this objective, the component (a) implemented a project dissemination
campaign; (b) carried out collective action and promoted empowerment of rural producer groups;
(c) applied the process of calling for proposals, preparing pre-feasibility and feasibility studies and
their evaluation and approval; and (d) supported the formalization of the alliances.
1.5.3. Component 2: Implementation of Rural Productive Alliances (USD26.6 million of
which IDA USD20.16 million). This component supported the implementation of the rural
alliances prepared under component 1. The component’s main outputs included: (i) producers and
their marketing partners working together efficiently and effectively in long term relations; (ii)
improved production by the rural producers to meet their new market requirements; (iii) market
systems adapted to work with the alliances’ small producers; and (iv) service providers and local
governments co-participating in alliance plans.
1.5.4. The Project co-financed the potential alliance members: small producers, market agents
and/or local governments. It proposed to deploy three alliance “models”. Project assistance was
made available to: (a) co-finance works, goods and services for the implementation of producer’s
subprojects up to the storage stage (model 1); (b) provide resources for technical assistance
subprojects which include post-production transformation and processing (model 2); (c) co-
finance technical assistance for market agents (model 3). In addition, financing was allocated for
incentives for supervision to finance agencies to facilitate access to credit for both producers and
purchasers when required; and for local governments which decide to support alliances through the
design and construction of public infrastructure (in collaboration with the Productive and Social
Investment Fund – FPS).




2
 The PAD defined a rural alliance as an “economic agreement between a group of small rural producers and
other economic actors, in which all contribute and gain, thus assuring the continuity of the agreement in the
medium and long term.”


                                                     3
The assistance provided by this component directly to producer organizations had a ceiling of
approximately USD 1,500 per participating household. The producer organizations (in models 1
and 3) were to contribute at least 20% of the alliance investment costs in kind or cash.
1.5.5. Component 3: Project administration, supervision, monitoring and evaluation
(USD4.91 million of which IDA USD4.91 million) This component supported the efficient and
effective coordination of the project and a M&E system capable of measuring producers’ improved
market access and the growth in rural incomes. The component financed technical assistance,
goods, equipment and incremental operating costs for the establishment and operation of a Project
coordinating team in Ministry of Peasant Affairs and Agriculture (MACA) and its successors--the
Ministry of Rural Development, Agriculture and Environment (MDRAMA) and the Ministry of
Rural Development and Land (MDRT)--, the setting up and operation of a management information
system, the implementation of monitoring, evaluation and learning arrangements, and the
completion of technical studies.
1.6 Institutional Arrangements
1.6.1. The Project was initially implemented by the Ministry of Peasant and Agricultural Affairs
(MACA) which set up a National Coordination Unit (UCN) and Regional Operational Units (UOR)
in the three project areas. Reflecting successive reforms of the executive branch, MACA was
succeeded by the Ministry of Rural Development, Agriculture and Environment (MDRAMA) and
finally by the Ministry of Rural Development and Land (MDRT). MACA and its successors (i)
represented the Project’s strategic management level: assuring the implementation of government
policies in the Project, in coordination with other sector programs and projects; and (ii) delegated
to the UCN the operational responsibility for implementation.
1.6.2. The UCN had the responsibility of coordinating and administering the project at central and
regional levels, including the management of the information system, monitoring and evaluation,
financial management and procurement. This included the appraisal and financing of the alliance
proposals. The UCN was composed of a project coordinator and individual consultants appointed
by MACA. Staff performance was evaluated annually by an external agency.
1.6.3. A Project Council comprised of members of the Interministerial Committee, national
representatives of small producers, traders, business people, Prefectures involved and the National
Project Coordinator was to be set up to approve management guidelines, review annual operating
programs, assure coordination with other programs and recommend strategies, and policies to
facilitate project implementation. The “Council” was to meet twice a year during project
implementation.
1.7 Revised Components
1.7.1. The AF dropped the Finance Enhancement Incentives subcomponent because demand for
complementary credit from outside financial institutions could be satisfied through technical
assistance provision to the alliances themselves, rather than through incentives to those institutions.
The Municipal Infrastructure subcomponent was reduced in scope due to the fact that fewer than
expected alliances required complementary public works to be viable. In addition, the Project
Council was abolished as the Morales government considered the new social participation
mechanisms sufficient for project purposes.
1.8 Other significant changes
1.8.1. Additional Financing: On April 25, 2009 the Bank and the Government signed an
additional financing agreement (AF) to the amount of USD30 million to scale up operations. The
bulk of the AF financing was to expand project activities into two new areas: 16 municipalities in
the Lake Titicaca region and 13 municipalities in the La Paz-Beni subtropical area. The AF included
a 2.5 year extension of the closing date and closed on time.


                                                  4
1.8.2. Implementation changes: Apart from the scaling-up and changes mentioned above, the
Project underwent no significant design changes during implementation. The Project became the
lead entity of a de-concentrated unit “EMPODERAR” within the MDRT that coordinates other
programs financed by external donors and the Treasury.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1. Background analysis. The Project was prepared and approved during a socially and
politically turbulent period in Bolivia’s history and presented substantial risks. The preparation
team was well aware of the changing political context. It made the project responsive to the needs
of small peasants and indigenous people and consulted and involved peasant and indigenous
organizations into the project’s design process. Project design was anchored in the analyses
commissioned for the draft rural development strategy (ENDAR) and benefitted from lessons
learned from more than a decade of Bank involvement in the sector.
2.1.2. Project Objectives and Indicators: The PDO was realistic and reachable, important for
the country, aligned with the administration’s poverty reduction and economic opportunity creation
objectives, and with the ENDAR. After a normal time of acquaintance with the Project, the
Administration fully adopted the Project’s objectives and methodologies. The Project did not
require adjustments following Bolivia’s substantial constitutional reform of 2009.
2.1.3. The outcome indicators were focused on measuring the results of the alliance models being
tested, including the economic and financial impact of the alliances: changes in productivity,
income, sales and other economic variables. This required the measurement of variables that are
difficult and costly to measure in rural areas. The inclusion of different-level indicators (outcome
and impact) as targets was ambitious and created measurement issues as they could not all be
measured simultaneously at EOP. The Project had little control over two outcome indicators which
were changed during restructuring.
2.1.4. Institutional arrangements: The institutional arrangements were adequate for project
implementation. Upon effectiveness Bolivia’s government structure was modified and the Project
was located in MACA’s successor, MDRAMA. As the Project’s implementation unit--composed
of a National Coordination Unit (UCN) and Regional Operating Units (UOR)--was relatively
autonomous from the changing government structure, it could be implemented without staff
changes. The Project Council was to reduce political interference and to facilitate coordination
with other programs. The presence of peasant and indigenous organizations in the Government
made this Council redundant.
2.1.5. Project design: The project design was sound and no major changes or design
restructurings were needed during implementation, apart from continually incorporating lessons
learned. The design was informed by lessons learned from the Bolivia rural development portfolio
and of the Colombia Rural Productive Partnership Project. Project design emphasized a flexible
alliance model, with clear rules, that allowed the project to adjust to the requirements of each
particular business case, identified in bottom-up processes and not through the pre-selection of
products or supply chains. The Project implemented an adaptive management approach which
focused on continuous learning and operational adjustment. The follow-up project (PAR II) is built
on the same design principles.
2.1.6. Adequacy of Government commitment: President Mesa’s government led the
preparation of the ENDAR and the project. Effectiveness was delayed during President Rodriguez’
caretaker administration (2005-2006) by objections from the Ministry of Finance partly derived
from fiscal constraints but also due to hesitations about financial transfers to communities and poor-


                                                  5
producer groups. These characteristics later became one of the pillars of GOB’s rural development
policy.
2.1.7. Risk assessment: The Project’s risk assessment at Board presentation was “substantial”
due to the (i) Project’s pilot nature, and (ii) country conditions. The project was prepared amidst a
moment of widespread political conflict in the country, with rising social movements, discussions
on regional autonomy, prefectural elections, and possible constitutional changes. The preparation
team successfully introduced measures to mitigate political risk impacts on project outcomes and
implementation. One of the most important measures was the competitive UCN and UOR staff
recruitment process and yearly performance evaluations by an outside agency, which protected the
management team from political interference.
2.1.8. Quality at Entry: The quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The project team carried out
all necessary preparation studies, took into account the political and social context, consulted
continuously with representatives of indigenous and peasant organizations, the design included
important features to protect the project against political interference and was based on lessons
learned in other rural alliances projects in the region. Some PDO indicators measured impacts and
others were non-attributable.
2.2 Implementation Factors influenced project implementation:
2.2.1.   External factors:
   An important factor influencing Project implementation was the 2005-2006 change in
    Administration which was accompanied by changes in the structure of the government as well
    as the introduction of new ideas, policies and attitudes towards public programs and the role of
    government. At effectiveness, the Project was located in the Ministry of Rural Development,
    Agriculture and Environment (MDRAMA) and its kick-off was delayed by some eighteen
    months during which the UCN and UOR staff hiring process became a challenge and
    MDRAMA had difficulties signing agreements with regional governments that were under
    political opposition leadership. The Project’s DO rating became moderately unsatisfactory for
    about one year (2006-2007).
   While the new Administration’s initial hesitation was an issue at first, the government became
    consequently a strong supporter of the Project and created a favorable political environment.
    Moreover, the new Administration introduced rural development policies fully aligned with the
    Project’s objectives so that the Project enjoyed complete political support.
   The prices of agricultural commodities have evolved favorably over the period. In particular
    the price of quinoa, a traditional staple food in the Andes tripled over the last 10 years creating
    incentives for alliances involving quinoa (12.6% of the alliances).
   Tax issues. The Bolivian Treasury has emitted an opinion that formal producer organizations
    have to comply with the general tax laws which has complicated the formalization of the
    organizations and their administrative management, given that small producers are tax-exempt
    but their organizations are not.
2.2.2.   Internal factors.
   The Project’s strong achievements are mainly the result of the UCN and UOR (EMPODERAR)
    performance and delivery capacity. This strong performance is based on: (i) the quality of the
    staff selection process by an external agency in spite of the less than attractive salary level; (ii)
    the annual 360-degree performance evaluations by an external agency; (iii) a focus on results
    coupled by the absence of political involvement in the Project’s management; and (iv) a process
    of continuous learning and adaptation supported by strong M&E. Moreover the regional



                                                   6
    presence of the UORs assured that producers could be in daily contact with Project staff for
    information and problem solving.
   Other elements contributing to the Project’s remarkable achievements are related to the project
    design and procedural improvements during implementation.
        o   The emphasis on flexibility and tailoring at the alliance level permitted producer
            groups to design and implement a variety of organizational forms, reflecting particular
            technical choices and group preferences. These ranged from individualized production
            systems with minimal involvement of the producer organization to joint production
            facilities operated by all group members. Producer organizations thus assumed a
            variety of roles and provided a range of services to their members.
        o   The requirement that the producers contribute at least 30% of the cost of the alliance
            investment in cash before the Project’s resource transfers to the producer organizations
            can take place assures that producers are fully committed to the objectives of the
            alliance, avoids over-dimensioning of the investments and is an incentive for good
            management and social control of the alliance funds.
        o   The contracting by the producer organizations of alliance brokers (facilitadores) and
            alliance assistants (acompañantes) from a list of eligible consultants contributed
            considerably to the speed of alliance preparation and quality of implementation.
        o   Another element was the contracting of a firm that carried out a financial analysis of
            all alliance proposals and approved or rejected their financial viability. This enabled
            the Project to obtain independent confirmation of viability, shielding it from political
            interference and interest-group dynamics, as well as simplify the analytical process.
        o   Streamlined procedures and agile and transparent funds flow arrangements allowed the
            Project to make direct disbursements from the Treasury Single Account to
            beneficiaries’ bank accounts without additional layers and within the country’s
            budgetary system, with minimum, though meaningful checks and balances.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1. Design: The monitoring arrangements as described in the PAD were in accordance with
generally accepted practices. They included the establishment and operation of an Information
System to monitor Project implementation, procurement and financial audits, monitoring and
evaluation reports. The design of the Results Framework was adequate, taking into account the
Project’s model-testing nature. Some of the indicator targets, however, were over ambitious: 54%
increase in income, sales and employment are hard to achieve in a five year period and in a project
that has to establish a structure and work methodology. An institutional capacity development of
producer organizations indicator might have been able to measure the Project’s institutional impact.
2.3.2. Implementation: The M&E system was implemented from the outset of the Project and
linked to the administrative cycle of alliance implementation. During implementation, the M&E
system evolved to include a fully-fledged Geo-referenced Management Information System
(SIGG) built around the administrative cycle of alliance implementation. This allowed the UCN to
generate a wealth of data on process and results, as fulfilment of the information requirements of
each stage of the cycle by the UORs was linked to administrative approvals, disbursements and
payments. A baseline survey was carried out, though it was later found too small to generate a
control group to measure impact. The baseline also did not take into account selection bias, making
the small control group non-comparable. There were some initial problems in data collection due
to the fact that the technical staff did not regularly update the SIGG to make it an effective
monitoring instrument as well as inconsistencies in data collection. The initial monitoring by the



                                                 7
producer organizations themselves was also weak as the monitoring committee members were
insufficiently trained and did not appreciate the usefulness of monitoring. Over the years, the SIGG
became a reliable information base.
2.3.3. Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR mission report provided inputs to the scale-up and
other adjustments in the AF. The MTR evaluation report presented important recommendations
including a proposal to reduce the municipal investment component and to focus the Project on
model 1 alliances. Furthermore, the MTR also confirmed the appropriateness of some lessons
learned and minor changes in the project’s methodology. These changes were incorporated into
the AF implementation.
2.3.4. Impact Evaluation: A Project impact evaluation was carried out in 2014 through a survey
of about 6,000 producers (of which 3,800 were surveyed for the PAR II baseline survey and
functioned as a control group). The survey methodology and results are described in Annex 5. The
impact evaluation arrived at statistically significant results for sales and income increases. This
analysis was complemented by an extensive beneficiary survey aimed at understanding the factors
that underlie alliance success.
2.3.5. Utilization: Most conclusions and recommendations of the supervision missions and MTR
report were supported by SIGG data, allowing their incorporation into project implementation, the
AF and in the follow-up project. The results of the economic analysis and the impact evaluation
will be used to improve the data collection by the SIGG incorporating the revenue of byproducts
and the registration of the use of family labor.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1. Safeguards: Safeguard policies applicable to the Project were Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01), Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09), Cultural Property (OP 4.11), Forests (OP/BP
4.36) and Indigenous People (OD 4.20). No cultural property issues were identified.
2.4.2. The supervision missions rated Safeguards as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory in
all ISRs. The MTR identified some environmental issues with the application of Integrated
Pesticide Management techniques that were properly addressed in the remainder of the Project.
2.4.3. Procurement: The ex-post procurement audits did not identify any significant
procurement issues. Procurement is rated Satisfactory. Most of the procurement activities were the
responsibility of the small producer organizations, under the control of their members and the
guidance of the UORs. The procurement specialists of the national and regional offices trained the
“fiduciary staff members” of each producer organization.
2.4.4. Financial Management (FM) and audit: FM is rated Satisfactory and audits are
unqualified. There was one issue with mismanagement of funds by a leader of a producer
organization. The project team has taken immediate action and a court trial is ongoing.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1. Alliance sustainability depends on: (i) production viability at the level of the producers
themselves; (ii) continuance of producer organization services to members; and (iii) sustained
relations with market agents. Close to 94% of producer groups financed had an IRR at closing
higher than 12.5%, thus most of the producers are currently engaged in financially viable initiatives.
Data on continuance of services by producer organizations was not available at ICR but anecdotal
evidence collected during supervision indicates that it is more likely in the cases in which the
organization itself assumes a role in the production cycle (e.g. input purchases, technical assistance,
post-production processing and sales. Results from the beneficiary survey indicate that alliances
which reconcile the main interests of producers (higher income) and buyers (product quality) are
likely to be sustainable. Both conditions are present predominantly in the Project outcomes. About


                                                  8
33 per cent of the producer groups changed their buyer between alliance identification and
completion (SIGG) and preliminary results from the beneficiary survey indicate that about 25%
had quit a formal arrangement with a buyer. It is too early to tell if this implies loss of access to
markets or if it may reduce future income. On December 12, 2012 the Plurinational State of Bolivia
and the World Bank signed a USD50 million follow-up financing agreement for a follow-up project
in 120 municipalities and benefiting 285,000 households. The PAR II project includes support for
alliance enlargement and co-financing of technical assistance for Project alliances which require
support for production issues and access to credit.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1. Relevance of PDO. PDO relevance is rated High. Improving small producer’s access to
markets has been a main issue in rural development in Bolivia and is considered a key instrument
for increasing incomes of poor rural producer households. Although this project has only touched
about 5% of small rural producers, these form a significant part of the estimated 20% of producers
that have an adequate endowment and risk profile for agricultural growth3. The follow-up project
and similar projects financed by other development agencies are implementing the project’s
methodology reaching a more significant number of producers. The Project successfully tested a
way to increase market access, empowering and linking producer organizations to input and output
markets, and proved that this has a significant impact on total household income. The Project has
become the anchor for the EMPODERAR program created by MDRT as part of its “Rural and
Agrarian Revolution Agricultural Sector Plan” and whose main line of action is to improve access
to markets, production and competitiveness on the part of poor rural producers. The Project, and
the follow-up operation, was included in the latest Country Partnership Strategy (Report No. 65108-
BO, November 1, 2011). The PAR is considered one of the Bank’s flagship projects in Bolivia.
3.1.2. Relevance of design and implementation: The design was and remains relevant. The
Project’s objective was to test three alliance models as well as the need for rural infrastructure
enhancements to increase access to markets. There was little to no demand for model 2 and 3
alliances. However, there is now some emerging demand for model 2 in the follow-up project, as
producer organizations build internal management capacity and increase post-harvest, value-added
activities. The follow-up project has a stronger capacity building component, including support for
access to credit. Purchasers do not seem to require project-based support (model 3). There was
less demand than expected for municipal infrastructure investments to enhance access to markets.
Project design allowed for tailored support to a variety of initiatives.
3.1.3. Project implementation also was and remains relevant as lessons have been learned and are
incorporated into the follow-up project. These lessons include the importance of transparent
instruments for self-selection of producers, requiring a substantial upfront payment from alliance
participants, the use of independent brokers for alliance preparation and technical assistants during
implementation, the contracting of an independent agency to evaluate the feasibility studies, the
significance of real-time monitoring, the adaptability of the project management system and the
use of an external agency to recruit project staff and evaluate their performance.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives: Satisfactory.
3.2.1. The project objective was to test models to improve accessibility to markets for poor rural
producers. To achieve this objective, the Project would (i) promote strategic productive alliances
between different economic players at the local level, (ii) empower rural producers through the
strengthening of self-managed grass-root organizations, (iii) increase access to productive assets
and technology, and (iv) promote more effective, responsive and accountable service organizations
at the local level. The Project has achieved the PDO by implementing the above-mentioned four
strategic actions.
3.2.2. The testing of the alliance model to access markets. The Project initiated with three alliance
models and complementary municipal infrastructure. There was only real demand for alliance
model 1 and the Project dropped models 2 and 3 at mid-term. As mentioned under paragraph 3.1.3
above, the project’s testing of the model consisted of successfully incorporating lessons and
improvements to increase the model’s efficiency and effectiveness. The implementation of model
1 increased producer market access. According to the project’s data monitoring system (SIGG),
the increase in marketed produce reached on average 60% (in two years) compared to the target of
45% (over three years). According to the impact study agricultural sales of alliance producers were
between 29 and 39% higher than those of a control group (see below). In conclusion, model 1 was
tested and proved to be effective to increase rural producer market access.
3.2.3. The municipal infrastructure subcomponent implementation, however, was slow. This
may have been due to the fact that municipal managers do not always have a direct interest in
improving access to markets, and more marginal producers have greater difficulties finding market
opportunities, so demand was relatively slow to emerge. Moreover, FPS was slow to channel the
funding to the municipalities. There is no real indication that the improvement of eight rural roads,
the construction of eight bridges and three irrigation schemes had a discernable impact on overall
market access. This may change as similar efforts begin to reach households with poorer access
to infrastructure.
3.2.4. The project successfully promoted productive alliances between different local players at
the local level. The Project carried out four campaigns to disseminate information about the Project
and generated demand through open invitations to submit proposals reaching close to 80,000
producers. It carried out information workshops (of which 17 were specifically for women), and
joint evaluations of 2,029 alliance proposals of which 1,403 obtained financing for developing
alliance plans. This promotion resulted in a strong interest from the part of the producers and
buyers. By the end of the Project, 1,137 alliances (150% of the number programmed) with a viable
business plan were identified, and 768 had been financed (114% of the number programmed) and
implemented.
3.2.5. Empowerment of rural producers through the strengthening of self-managed grass-root
organizations. The Project trained some 12,072 members of producer groups in organization,
management and negotiation skills. It supported the legal formalization of 752 producer groups
into officially recognized producer organizations, allowing them to enter into contracts, open bank
accounts and receive support through government systems. Although the SIGG did not record
progress on organizational strengthening, the fact that most alliances remain sustainable several
years after the Project’s intervention is proof that the producer organizations have acquired the
skills to continue their relationship with buyers. During the beneficiary consultations (paragraph
3.6.2.), the producers mentioned the strengthening of their organizations as one of the main project
achievements.
3.2.6. Increasing access to productive assets and technology. The Project financed new
production technologies that allowed the producers to increase land productivity (yields) by some
45% (SIGG). Some 58% of the producer groups now practice integrated pest management (IPM)


                                                 10
and 187 ha have been certified as organic production. A lot of the technologies have increased
labor productivity through labor saving mechanization. During the beneficiary consultations on
sustainability (paragraph 3.6.2), the producers considered the impact on productivity as one of the
main Project achievements.
3.2.7. Promoting more effective, responsive and accountable service organizations at the local
level. The Project developed a network of service providers. It engaged in 608 contracts with local
“brokers” who participated in the identification of business opportunities and developed the
business plans with the producers. Producer groups contracted also 1,402 facilitators to assist
producers in several aspects such as production, marketing and management of the producer
organizations. Moreover, the Project also recruited a consulting firm as an independent evaluator
of the alliance business plans. These brokers and facilitators are now also working with the follow-
up project and other similar projects in Bolivia. Many are selling their services directly to producer
organizations.
3.2.8. In conclusion, there is a causal relationship between the alliance model design, its
implementation and this generally successful outcome. The alliance model introduced more formal
linkages between producer groups and buyers and the alliance agreements specified the rules by
which both parties would act. The model was instrumental in strengthening the producer
organizations, it significantly increased productivity resulting in more marketable produce, and it
financed a network of service providers that contributed to the Project’s results and outcomes. The
increase in the volume marketed (compared to the control group) is obviously the result of the
alliances. Hence the project design and implementation resulted in the successful testing of the
alliance model and improvement of, the first (alliance model testing) and fifth PDO indicator
(increased market access) are rated satisfactory.
3.2.9. The second PDO indicator (growth in income of rural productive units) measures the extent
to which the model had impact on income. The indicator refers to the total income of the productive
units and not only the income from the product included in the alliance business plan. The results
framework target was to reach an income increase of 54% revised to 45% after the AF approval.
The strongest indication that the alliances had a positive impact on income are the conclusions of
the impact study. According to this counterfactual evaluation (see below and Annex 5) the net
agricultural income and total income of participating producer households was in 2014 respectively
32-39% and 29% higher (results significant at the 5% level) than the net agricultural income and
total income of a wide control group of households (see table 4 below). This statistically robust
result shows income differences in 2014 and cannot be compared to the PDO target (45%) which
requires ex-ante and ex-post income data over three years.
3.2.10. To compare ex-ante and ex-post, there are two data sources:
       Data from the project monitoring and evaluation system (SIGG) signal that the average
        revenue increase from the alliance crops (quinoa, coffee, honey, livestock, etc.) was 200%
        of the increase estimated in the alliance business plans. This major increase is, according
        to the sustainability study and beneficiary assessment (Annex 6), due to productivity
        increases stimulated by the alliances (45% compared to an expected 34% at alliance ex
        ante evaluation) and higher prices in the alliances (44% increase compared to an expected
        11%).
       According to the economic analysis, producers’ income from the alliance product increased
        by USD 2,382 (Bs 16,340) per productive unit which is about 39% of the baseline figure
        in the results framework. This is below the 45% total agricultural income target. This
        increase, however, is not counterfactually demonstrated and prices or other factors have
        certainly contributed to this result.




                                                 11
3.2.11. There is a clear link between the Project design and implementation and this outcome
indicator. The larger sales, increased productivity (see beneficiary evaluation Annex 6) resulted in
higher profit margins and income. This level of income increases would not have been achieved
without the Project. The impact study and the other data clearly demonstrate that alliances have
had a positive impact on income, which the testing of the alliance model had to show. The rather
ambitious 45% overall income target may have only been substantially achieved and is rated
satisfactory.
3.2.12. The third PDO indicator (number of alliances with IRR>12.5%) is exceeded. The number
of alliances with an IRR>12.5 reached 720, which is 94% of all financed alliances and 133% of the
number programmed (540). Having a high percentage of viable business proposals is the result of
the Project’s involvement with well-trained brokers and a quality control mechanism of the
feasibility studies. This PDO indicator is the direct outcome of the Project’s performance and is
considered highly satisfactory.
3.2.13. The fourth PDO indicator (number of new wage-earning jobs generated) reached only 38%
of the target number of jobs and has not been achieved. One explanation is that a substantial amount
of the alliance investments has gone to wage saving equipment. This resulted in less jobs generated.
The target may also have been too ambitious and employment generation up- and downstream was
not measured. Nevertheless, family farm employment may also have increased, although it was not
recorded in the SIGG. Quinoa, coffee, cocoa, potato seed production are very labor intensive and
when production increases, more family labor is needed for harvesting and initial processing. In
any case, the testing of the alliance model shows that the impact on remunerated employment may
not be as high as originally estimated. Achievement is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
3.2.14. Conclusion: The achievement of the PDO objectives is rated Satisfactory. Three of the
five PDO indicator targets have been exceeded or can be considered achieved. These three
indicators include the two most important ones measuring the PDO achievement: the testing of the
alliance model and the access to markets indicators. One indicator target (income) can be
considered substantially achieved and one indicator target was not achieved. The justification of
the weights given to each individual indicator in table 1 is as follows: testing the alliance model
was the main objective and received 50% of the weight. Since access to markets was part of the
PDO statement, indicator 5 (increase in volume marketed) receives 20% of the weight. The other
indicators all refer the impact of the model on economic factors which are also highly dependent
on the specific circumstances of certain price hikes. They receive 30% of the weight (each 10%).

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1. Considering that project implementation and results far exceed the expectations, the
reasonable level of management costs and the high economic returns, the project’s efficiency is
rated Substantial. Efficiency refers to the project’s efficient use of resources and cost effectiveness.
The analysis is based on three core questions. First, could the resources transferred to the producer
organizations have been used more efficiently and was there any waste? Second, were the


                                                  12
administrative costs reasonable? Third, are the alliances worthwhile in the economic sense and do
they provide value for money?
3.3.2. Use of resources by producer organizations. The 30% mostly financial (cash)
contribution by the participants towards the investment costs of the alliance guarantees the efficient
use of resources: it avoids over-dimensioning of the investments as each additional Boliviano
invested requires an additional participant contribution of 0.3 Boliviano. Moreover, as the SIGG
and economic evaluation show, many investments have been in labor saving equipment, thus
increasing labor productivity.
3.3.3. Administrative Costs: The project management costs amount to 11.6% of total project
costs. This is a rather low level considering the project’s tailored support and decentralized set up
with five regional offices and compares favorably with other sector projects in Bolivia.
3.3.4. Economic Evaluation: A detailed ex-post financial and economic evaluation of the project
and the likely impact that the intervention had on the participants has been conducted on the basis
of project experience and data registered in the Geo-referenced Management Information System
(SIGG) – see Annex 3. The evaluation estimates the returns derived from the investments on small
producer subprojects, which used the bulk of the resources invested (75.5%) in relation with the
resources devoted to municipal subprojects (6.3%), to institutional support (6.4%), and to the
Project Management (11.6%). The ex-post evaluation has been undertaken on the nine (9) sub-
sectors that dominate the investment, as follows: milk, quinoa, coffee, cattle, pig breeding, cocoa,
potato seed, peach and sesame. These represented 72.45% of the investment in alliances, involving
535 small producers’ subprojects (70% of the total number of subprojects) and 70% of the direct
participants.
3.3.5. Financial Analysis. The results of the study shows that the financial NPV of aggregated
cash flows (including 13% VAT) is USD 60.57 million (USD 113,428/alliance and USD
2,934/member) and the Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) 49%. Considering all project costs
against only the incremental net benefit derived from the 535 analyzed producers’ subprojects, the
NPV and FIRR are USD 40.4 million and 26%. A 20% reduction of income level to account of risk
factors (technical or social/organizational aspects) and climate or market related variability would
result in a NPV of USD 18.57 million and FIRR of 21%.
3.3.6. Economic analysis. The Economic NPV of the 535 analyzed alliances is USD 49.2 million
(USD 92,060/alliance and USD 2,382/member) and the Economic Internal rate of Return is 45%.
In the scenario of including all Project costs against only the incremental net benefit derived from
the analyzed producers’ subprojects, the Economic NPV and EIRR are USD 31.29 million and 25%
respectively; and a 20% reduction of income level would result in a NPV of USD 13.59 and IRR
of 19%. The figures do not account for incremental family labor, which has not been recorded in
the SIGG.
3.3.7. Fiscal analysis. The Fiscal NPV of the analyzed alliance plans are: USD - 23.4 million
(USD -43,717/alliance and USD -1,130 per /member). As expected, fiscal revenues (through VAT)
do not compensate the project’s direct transfers to poor producer groups.
3.3.8. Table 2 provides the aggregated financial, economic and fiscal results for the different
scenarios. Scenario 2 shows that considering only the incremental benefits from 535 alliances plans
(70% of the total) within six years against all Project costs, the financial and economic IRR would
be 26% and 25% respectively. However, since incremental family labor is not accounted for and
in order not to overestimate the returns, the ICR team decided to use the most conservative figure
in table 2 (19%) as the economic IRR of the project. This is an excellent return on a project whose
objective was to test a methodology for producers to increase access to markets.

Impact evaluation
3.3.9. The survey methodology and results are described in Annex 5. Four income variables were
assessed, including: (i) agricultural sales including the market value of crops, cattle and derivative
production; (ii) total agricultural income that includes the market value of sales and the estimated
value of subsistence production; (iii) net agriculture income that subtracts reported costs from total
agricultural income; and (iv) total household income that includes all labor income of all household
members after taxes and costs, resulting from primary and/or secondary activities as salaried or
self-employed persons.
3.3.10. The project had a positive and significant impact on almost all income variables.
Depending on the matching procedure, the project increased total agricultural sales and total
agricultural income between 28 to 39% over the average agricultural sales and total agricultural
income of the control group—these improvements were significant at the 5% level (Table 3). The
impact on net agricultural income attains 32 to 39% increase but the differences is not significant
at 5% under propensity score matching due to problems in the collection of costs information.
Finally, the project had a significant impact on household income of about 28%.

Note: (*) The absolute income difference after matching is significant at 5% based on a bootstrapping with
100 replications. All these results were attained based on 5-nearest neighbors as this specification is less
sensitive to outliers than nearest neighbor and 3-nearest neighbors. See Annex 5.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
3.4.1. The overall outcome rating of Satisfactory (table 4) is justified based on the PDO
achievement, project relevance, efficacy and efficiency.
3.4.2. As explained in paragraph 3.2.14, the PDO can be considered satisfactorily achieved with
only minor shortcomings. The alliance models were tested. The municipal infrastructure, although
maybe needed, is hard to implement under this project set-up. The Project developed and
implemented the four main instruments to reach the PDO in a satisfactory manner.


                                                    14
3.4.3. The testing has provided very positive results. The accessibility by about 29,000 poor
producers to markets is reflected in the substantially increased sales through farmer organizations.
The alliance model also showed an important impact on income through increased aggregate farm
income and employment (if family labor is included). The project has also generated important
lessons which have been incorporated into the additional financing and follow-up project (PAR II).
Hence the project objectives have been reached and most PDO and results targets have been
substantially achieved or exceeded.
3.4.4. Relevance: The PDO, design and implementation remain highly relevant as the
Government has mainstreamed the Project into a wider, policy mandated program (EMPODERAR)
and asked the Bank for a follow-up project, which was included in the 2011 CPS. The follow-up
project, approved in 2014, can hardly process the applications by producers and purchasers fast
enough. Project design and lessons have been widely disseminated and are incorporated into
projects financed by other development agencies.
3.4.5. Efficacy: The project result indicators (see data sheet and Annex 2) as measured by the
original and revised indicators, show highly satisfactory levels of achievement. With a partial
exception, all results indicators have been achieved or exceeded. For a low-income country as
Bolivia, and in regions such as the highlands of Potosi and La Paz, this is a remarkable achievement.
3.4.4. Efficiency. Efficiency is rated substantial. Production and marketing became more
efficient and the project’s administrative costs were low. A conservative 19% economic rate of
return and a significant aggregate impact on incomes and employment compared to a control group
provide the basis for this rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1. Poverty Impact: The impact on poverty has been significant for most of the 28,896
families participating in the project as is demonstrated in the economic analysis and the impact
study. The project has most likely also had a positive impact on the depth of poverty in the rural
areas by providing additional income to the poorest quintiles of rural society. A recent independent
study carried out by FAO showed that almost 90% of small producer organizations in operating
alliances showed net positive incremental real returns (compared to an expected failure rate of
20%), with significant effects on production, agricultural yields and demand for labor.
3.5.2. Gender Aspects: The project had no specific gender focus, nevertheless according to the
Borrower’s Completion Report some 32% of the members of producer organizations are women.
Some 27% of the representatives in the alliance management and monitoring committees are
women. The project has also organized 17 sub-regional workshops specifically promoting the
participation of women in alliances.
3.5.3. Social Development: PAR I has successfully proven a model of socio-economic and
ethnic inclusion, empowering community-based and grass root organizations in order to enhance


                                                 15
small producer access to markets, with significant positive effects on indigenous poor rural
households. Project success in the implementation of the Indigenous Peoples safeguard (OP/BP
4.10) is demonstrated by the fact that 90% of direct beneficiaries identify themselves as belonging
to an indigenous group: 35% Quechua, 41% Aymara, 9% Guarani and 5% other indigenous groups.
Bolivia’s rural indigenous and small farmers are over-represented amongst the very poor.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.4. The project has filled an urgent need to strengthen indigenous and peasant producer
associations and helped these organizations to structure a vision towards the future, as well as the
tools and instruments to implement such vision. This project, and a Government that is very
supportive of self-determination and grassroots development, has created a dynamic of self-esteem
and fulfillment that inspires development in other sectors as well. The project has shown that
efficient implementation, based on competitive, rules-based and non-discretionary allocations, with
full participation of local leaders has a transformative effect.
3.5.5. At the Ministerial level, the Project has formed the basis for its EMPODERAR executing
unit, in charge of implementing donor- and government-funded programs focused on economic
opportunities of rural peasant and indigenous producers.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.5.6. The project has served as a testing ground for operational innovation in Bolivia. Its
influence is felt in other government programs as well as in the NGO sector. The PAR II builds on
this rich experience, reaching out to new producers, scaling up to new municipalities and further
strengthening managerial capacities of producer organizations. Project lessons have been widely
disseminated to other development agencies in Bolivia and to delegations from Argentina, Bhutan,
Brazil, Guatemala, Jamaica, Nepal, Viet Nam and Yemen that have visited the project to learn from
its experience.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1. A team of social specialists carried out a survey of 86 randomly selected alliances to measure,
in the opinion of participants, the factors that underlie alliance sustainability. This research applied
three instruments: (i) focus groups with producers applying a participatory analysis methodology;
(ii) semi-structured interviews with producer organizations and buyers; and (iii) life stories of
producer families.
3.6.2. The preliminary results of the consultations are:
       Product quality improvement, productivity increases and organizational strengthening are
        the three main impacts mentioned by the producers.
       In the perception of producers, impact on income is too dependent on weather conditions
        and price fluctuations. For the vast majority of producers, the main impacts of alliances
        should not be sought in the commercial field, but in the development of production systems
        that result in improving the quality of products, increasing productivity and the
        development of their capacities. The producers perceive that these impacts must lead to
        increases in household income or access to safer markets in the short and medium term.
       For the buyers, the main reasons to step and remain in an alliance are assurance of product
        quality and regular supply, and dealing with a reliable producer organization. The producer
        organizations consider that increases in income, stability of sales volumes and prices and
        a relation of trust with the buyer are the main reasons to stay within the alliance.
       Market access seems to be less important for organizations and producers. Most producers
        have reduced marketing risks, so that market security is no longer a priority, as it was in


                                                  16
        the past. Additional services provided by the buyers are less important for alliance
        sustainability. Only a small fraction of leaders and producers saw it as compelling reason
        to maintain the alliance.
3.6.3. In short, the people consulted stated that alliances are sustainable to the extent that the main
interests of producers (higher income) are consistent with the best interests of buyers (product
quality). Partnerships that reconcile both interests are sustainable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low
4.1.1. The risks to development outcomes are low because of the high level of alliance
sustainability (as indicated 2 above), their economic advantages for producers and buyers alike and
the presence of a follow-up project operating in the regions. There is no direct evidence to assess
if sustainability of access to markets is lost for producers who are no longer allied with buyers, but
information from the impact study and the beneficiary survey indicate that is not the case. The
initial success of the follow-up project is an additional motivation for existing alliances to continue
and also facilitates upgrading the alliances’ operations through credit and technical assistance.

5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance

5.1 Bank Performance. The Bank performance is assessed to be Satisfactory.
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry -- Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.1. A team that included seasoned professionals and staff based in the country office carried
out project preparation. An excellent social assessment was done including consultations with
leaders of peasant and indigenous organizations. The Project was based on sound sector analysis
and lessons learned from previous operations in Bolivia and in a similar project in Colombia.
Inclusion of an organizational strengthening outcome indicator could have been useful to measure
institutional impact.
(b) Quality of Supervision -- Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.2. The Bank functioned as a partner to the Government. Throughout project implementation
there were two supervision missions per year including technical, fiduciary and safeguards staff
and consultants as needed, plus constant communication with a task team leader stationed in La
Paz. This allowed for engagement in all aspects of project implementation. Supervision missions
timely identified several issues that helped overcome operational challenges. The supervision team
was also instrumental in instituting a permanent process of improvement and self-learning,
covering the administrative, financial, procurement, business, and environmental, social, planning
and monitoring aspects.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance - Rating: Satisfactory. Preparation was supported by the
formulation of a rural development strategy (ENDAR). Effectiveness delays, as a result of divided
support to key design concepts of the Project (see 2.1.6) were quickly overcome. After an initial
period of hesitation and some resistance to the project staff recruitment procedures, the
Administration became fully engaged in the project and provided full support during
implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance -- Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.2.   The performance of the implementing agencies was characterized by the following:
        (a) the National Coordination Unit (UCN) provided operational guidance, quality
assurance (including technical, economic, social and environmental aspects), fiduciary control. It
developed and managed a solid project management system that integrated operational,
administrative and monitoring dimensions. It instituted a focus on results and transparency.
         (b) the Regional Coordination Units (UORs) implemented most of the Project activities,
from calls for proposals to data collection, accompanying producer associations throughout the
alliance cycle. Performance was generally solid, though uneven at times, particularly due to staff
rotation given low salary levels and distant office locations.
          (c) FPS, which managed the municipal infrastructure part of the Project was less in
demand. Slower than expected implementation was due to the fact that FPS increased its own
portfolio five-fold and had less control over Project investments. FPS works in its own time
schedule and requires financial commitments from the Municipalities that sometime have agreed
to co-financing infrastructure works but lack the funds at the moment the subproject is scheduled
to start.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance -- Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.3. Overall, the Borrower has played a very supportive role in project implementation. The
project implementation units (UCN, UORs) were efficient, stimulated innovation and incorporated
lessons learned during implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1      The following are among the more important lessons from this operation:
6.1.1. Beneficiary targeting should take into consideration endowments and opportunities.
Not all small producers have the capacity or risk profile required for entering into market-driven
partnerships. Buyers’ incentives to deal with small producers relate to product quality, volume and
timely delivery. Small producers can reach these requirements through their organizations;
however, though collective action reduces transaction costs when dealing with input and output
markets, it cannot overcome absolute constraints in access to land and water.
6.1.2. The importance of using self-selection instruments transparently. In particular, the
requirement that 30% of the alliance investment cost be covered by the participants in cash and
upfront in every tranche serves to: (i) ensure that the producers who join an initiative have the
necessary resource endowment; (ii) avoid over-dimensioning of the investments; and (iii) focus on
participants that have the risk profile for engaging in innovation processes. In addition, the
participants’ contributions ensure that the alliances remains profitable from their point of view and
their participation is a motivation for transparent management and control of funds. Counterpart
requirement need to be publicized clearly at the outset.
6.1.3. Linking social accountability and formal controls has multiple benefits. Formal
accountability mechanisms and documentation requirements can be significantly strengthened and
simplified by the use of and reliance on social accountability mechanisms within the beneficiary
organizations. Approval by organization members of tranche execution reports (executed activities,
procurement and expenditures) in open assemblies was the basis for Project fiduciary control. This
requires an important change in the mind-set of public sector officials. It also ensured producer
organization leaders were primarily accountable to their members rather than to the project. Social
control is strongly incentivized if producers provide cash contributions.




                                                 18
6.1.4. Successful producer associations require new support instruments. To encourage the
further growth of the producer organizations after alliance financing ends, a new line of financing
should be available to producers so as to graduate them from donor support and to facilitate their
access to credit. This requires training and technical assistance, reaching a wider number of
beneficiaries and developing capacities to provide specific services to its members after the end of
the Project, including, as in the case of the Colombia Rural Productive Partnerships Project
(P104567), the possibility of implementing revolving funds for member credit.
6.1.5. Initial buyer assessments ensure continuity. Some producer organizations found that
their increased productive capacity (including that to innovate) surpassed their current buyer’s
capacity. Measures to mitigate this are: improved buyer identification; brokerage services for
organizations that outgrow their current alliance arrangements; and increased outreach to potential
buyers outside the local spheres of most organizations.
6.1.6. Women’s participation requires differentiated support. Thirty two percent of the
producers in alliances were women but their representation at the producer organization directorate
levels remains low. To improve access to project opportunities by women it is necessary to deploy
a wider range of targeted activities, including radio messages in indigenous languages at adequate
times, separate workshops for women and women’s groups, more intensive technical assistance
during the whole alliance cycle, and targeting women in leadership training activities.
6.1.5. Transparent and competitive staff selection procedures and performance evaluations
were a key element of project implementation success. Staff recruitment by an independent firm
encouraged unaffiliated professionals to apply for project positions, widening the candidate pool.
Yearly performance evaluations based on individual work plans were also conducted by a different
firm and included interviews with beneficiaries for front-line staff. This permitted the Project to
focus on results and compliance with rules, and provided a shield from undue political interference.
In spite of strong Government pressure initially, the Bank team held on to the agreed procedures
with corresponding successful results.
6.1.6. External viability assessment of alliances improved quality of alliance plans, provided
an independent confirmation of feasibility and a benchmark for project ex ante evaluation, and
permitted adequate tailoring of producer organization subprojects to local context and alliance
objectives.
6.1.7. Producer organization capacity building needs to take into account business needs.
Capacity building of organizations initially focused on general subproject managerial requirements
(accounting, procurement) but it soon became evident that it also needs to be tailored to the specific
functions each organization assumes in the alliance. Organizations may be called to reduce
transaction costs for producers (e.g. input purchases) and negotiate with current and future partners,
but they may also need to operate collective infrastructure (e.g. storage, processing and packaging),
and organize the provision of technical assistance services to members. The latter require specific
knowledge and support and should be included in the alliance plan.
6.1.8. Use of country public financial management systems increases transparency and
efficiency. This may be challenging for a beneficiary-managed (CDD-type) operation at the
beginning, but worth pursuing. The Project established a model in which transfers of public funds
to producer organizations became explicitly provided in the Budget law and) were processed
through the country’s financial management system (SIGMA). This allowed
payments/disbursements to be made directly from the Treasury Single Account (TSA) to
beneficiaries’ bank accounts, opened and maintained in formal financial sector institutions. Such
arrangement allowed for a more transparent, efficient and agile flow of funds.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Investments: the project financed over 768 demand-driven alliances. As per appraisal, eligible
   rural alliances were classified into three models: (i) Type 1 alliances, where the project co-
   finances small producers (up to storage); (ii) Type 2 alliances, where the project supports small
   producer up to processing; and (iii) Type 3 alliances, where the project supports producers and
   their market partners. Based on requests received by the project, it only financed Type 1
   alliances. Matching grants covered (i) goods, (ii) works for infrastructure; (iii) technical
   assistance and livestock purchase. As originally designed, municipalities and the project
   financed nineteen (19) subprojects involving rehabilitation of rural roads and community
   irrigation infrastructure.
2. Target regions: The project supported productive alliances in 110 selected municipalities,
   which were classified within six regions, namely Salar de Uyuni (14 municipalities); Valles de
   Cochabamba (19 municipalities); Trópico=Norte de Santa Cruz (32 municipalities); Lago
   Titicaca (16 municipalities); Norte de la Paz (13 municipalities) and El Chaco (16
   municipalities).
3. As a result of the investments, the main economic impacts have been: improved farmer incomes,
   primarily due to increase in production and/or productivity (yield), increased volume marketed
   per rural productive unit, and enhanced product quality and unit prices. The project has also
   created new wage earning jobs.
4. Project benefits and outputs: As a result of project activities, over 90% of alliances presented
   positive financial results, thus contributing to the long term sustainability of the participating
   rural production units. See Table 1. The direct economic impact of the municipal subprojects
   has not been measured.

         municipal projects

5. The project also promoted private sector participation through capacity building and the
   provision of production support services, particularly technical assistance to producers, pre-
   investment studies, training events, and administrative enhancement of alliances. The project
   recruited 608 facilitators (brokers) to empower producers’ organizations in alliances’
   implementation and trained 6,640 producers in alliance management (institutional
   strengthening for alliance operation). Other quality training was delivered to farmers and




                                                 33
    producer organizations in several technical areas, particularly in Good Agricultural Practices
    and Pest Management.
6. The economic benefits of producer organizations as a result of empowerment, capacity building
   and technical assistance are difficult to measure, but could translate into increased access to
   market in the medium and long term.
7. With regard to positive environmental impacts, the project supported innovative mitigation
   practices and technological improvements such as livestock manure management and
   utilization and Agricultural Good Practices (AGP), contributing to positive environmental
   externalities (regeneration of natural pastures, enhanced prevention of soil erosion and
   improved soil quality, primarily through better retention of organic material and nutrients).
8. Economic and financial evaluation. A detailed ex-post project financial and economic
   evaluation and the likely impact on the beneficiaries has been conducted on the basis of data
   registered in the Geo-referenced Management Information System (SIGG, in Spanish). SIGG
   is managed by the project staff and an independent consultant carried out field checks to verify
   the coherence of SIGG data with field results. SIGG contains primary information on the “with
   and without project” situation, performance of the investments and profitability of the alliances.
   SIGG, however, has no data on family labor. Estimated parameters include: incremental annual
   revenues; input/service costs, hired labor costs, net benefits/incomes; incremental labor; Net
   Present Value (NPV) of benefits flows (at a 12% annual discount rate) and Internal Rate of
   Return (IRR).
9. Methodology. The evaluation team estimated the returns on small producer subprojects, which
   represent the bulk of the project resources invested (75.5%). The other costs are municipal
   subprojects (6.3%), institutional support (6.4%), and project management (11.6%).
10. The ex-post evaluation covered the nine most important sub-sectors (see table 2): (i) dairy
    production; (ii) quinoa; (iii) coffee; (iv) beef; (v) pigs; (vi) cocoa; (vii) potato seeds; (viii)
    peaches; and (ix) sesame. The nine subsectors represent 72.45% of the investment in alliances,
    a total of 535 subprojects (70% of the total number of subprojects) and benefited 70% of the
    direct beneficiaries. The other 27.55% of the investments went to a mixed bag of alliances
    including artisanal production and agro-tourism and are difficult to categorize. No analysis was
    carried out on the uncategorized alliances.
11. Results and impacts of the investments were analyzed at the sub-sector level and at project-
    level as a whole. Within each sub-sector, economic parameters and indicators were estimated
    for each rural alliance as well as for the average alliance and beneficiary family. To estimate
    the aggregate impacts at the sub-sector level, the incremental net income flows for the total
    number of alliances in the analyzed sub-sector were added, and relevant aggregated indicators
    calculated. To estimate aggregated impacts at project level, the aggregated net income flows
    for each sub-sector analyzed were added and aggregated feasibility indicators are estimated for
    three basic scenarios: (i) considering only the direct investment costs of the rural alliances
    analyzed; (ii) including costs of component 1 and 3 proportionate to the investments analyzed;
    and (iii) including all project costs. The details are in an EFA Working paper; for the sake of
    simplicity this annex presents only the results (i) and (iii).
12. Table 2 shows the investments in each sub-sector, the number of subprojects in each sub-sector
    and the number of direct beneficiaries.

13. The cost-benefit analysis builds on a ten-year projection period after the last investments have
    been carried out. As such, the reference period is 2006-2023 (with last investments occurring
    in 2013). As the SIGG has collected one or two cycles of production and sales of the alliances,
    an arrhythmic average of those years is used to estimate the projected fund flows. The
    investment includes the funds transfers by the project to the producer organizations plus the
    counterpart funds (both monetary and in kind).
14. To make a comparative analysis, current prices were converted into constant prices of 2011
    (last year in which there is not “without PAR situation” and first year where there is “with PAR
    situation”) using the GDP Deflator (Source: IMF - Staff Report for the 2013 Article IV
    Consultation, Dec 2013). The index of consumer prices (CPI) was not used because it does not
    reflect the actual price changes of the products concerned and of their production costs.
    Bolivian Pesos were converted into USD using an exchange rate of Bs6.83 per USD.
15. The analysis focused on three assessments: financial analysis, economic analysis and fiscal
    analysis. The financial analysis strictly includes producers’ cash inflows (sales) and outflows
    (inputs, services and taxes). The sales include a 13% Value Added Tax (VAT). The economic
    analysis applies economic (social) or shadow prices based on a Conversation Factor of 0.885
    for products, inputs and services (shadow prices calculated by deducting the 13% VAT from
    the unit price). Finally the fiscal impact analysis principally considers a 13% of VAT included
    in incremental revenues, after deducting VAT paid on the matching grant, inputs purchased
    and services contracted. For sensitivity analysis, a 20% reduction of income level to account
    of risk factors (technical or social/organizational aspects) and climate or market variability
    were calculated in all analyses.

16. Results of the analysis are detailed in an EFA Working Paper. A snap shot at project
    completion shows that the quinoa sub-sector has generated USD11.60 million in annual
    incremental revenue at market prices, more than double the annual incremental revenue
    generated by the milk sector (USD5.13 million) although the investment in milk (USD 18.20
    million and 211 alliances) were much larger than in quinoa (USD 7.23 million and 96 alliances).
    This is because quinoa prices have substantially increased during the evaluation period.
17. The subsectors that show maximum performance are quinoa (an incremental revenue of USD
    120,850 per alliance and USD 3,128 per family) and coffee (USD 139,642 per alliance and
    USD 2,230 per family), followed by potato seed production (USD 81,397 per alliance and USD
    1,536 per family) and peaches (USD 61,401 per alliance and USD 1,616 per family). At the
    level of the alliances, annual incremental revenues are higher for coffee than for quinoa but it
    is the opposite at the family level. This is due to a higher number of participating families in
    coffee alliances (63 members/alliance average) compared to quinoa (39 members/alliance
    average). The same occurs for potato seeds with an
                                                                Table 3: Results per sub-sector

18. Employment generation. The SIGG recorded the                                  flow (million
    incremental number of hired labor days per rural                                   USD)

    Dairy, coffee, cattle, cacao, and peach production
    were less intense in contracting labor (between 0 and     Peaches            46%        2.92

    in innovative or improved technologies and machinery has maintained or reduced the
    employment of rural labor. In average terms, the project has contributed to a total incremental
    labor of 112,946 person-days per year for the nine analyzed subsectors, which means an
    average use per alliance of 160 person-days and an average incremental hired labor use of 4
    person days per family per year.
19. Financial analysis. As a reminder, this analysis examines in and outflows only. As shown in
    Table 4 the NPV and FIRR of aggregated cash flows for the analyzed alliance plans within the
    nine subsectors are: USD60.57 million (USD 113,428/alliance and USD 2,934/member) and
    49%, respectively. Considering all Project costs against only the incremental net benefit
    derived from the analyzed producers’ subprojects (535 alliances out of 768 alliances), the NPV
    and FIRR are USD 40.4 million and 26%. A 20% reduction of income level to account of risk
    factors (technical or social/organizational aspects) and climate or market related variability will
    result in a NPV of USD 18.57 million and FIRR of 21%.
20. Economic analysis. The Economic NPV and EIRR of the analyzed alliance plans are: USD
    49.2 million (USD 92.060/alliance and USD 2,382/member), 45%. In the scenario of including
    all Project costs against only the incremental net benefit derived from the analyzed producers’
    subprojects, the Economic NPV and EIRR are USD 31.29 million and 25%; and a 20%
    reduction of income level will result in a NPV of USD 13.59 and IRR of 19%.



                                                  36
21. Fiscal analysis. The Fiscal NPV of the analyzed alliance plans are: USD - 23.4 million (USD
    -43,717/alliance and USD -1,130 per /member). As expected, fiscal revenues (through VAT)
    do not compensate the project’s direct transfers to poor producer groups.
22. Table 4 provides the aggregated financial, economic and fiscal results for the different
    scenarios. Scenario 2 shows that considering only the incremental benefits from 535 alliances
    plans within six years against all Project costs, the financial and economic IRR would be 26%
    and 25% respectively.

           NPV (USD million)            60.6                   N/A                   N/A
           IRR                          49%                    N/A                   N/A
           Scenario 2 : Including the results of 535 alliances and total project costs
           NPV (USD                     40.4                   31.3                 -23.4
           million)
           IRR                          26%                    25%                     -
           Sensitivity – 20% in incremental benefits
           NPV (USD                     18.6                   13.6
           million)
           IRR                          21%                    19%

23. These figures do not take into account incremental family labor which the SIGG has not
    recorded and which the analysis assumes to be constant. This assumption, however, although
    practical, results in an overestimation of the economic return as most crops like quinoa, coffee
    and cacao are very labor intensive and production increases result in proportional family labor
    increases for harvesting alone. Even at the economic opportunity cost of family labor at 0.47%
    of market rates (determined by a Government decree) the incremental cost of family labor could
    have a sizeable impact on the returns. For this reason, and because it is impossible to estimate
    family labor on the basis of the used methodology, the ICR will use the most conservative
    returns of table 4 (-20% in incremental benefits): FIRR 21% and EIRR 19%4. This results are
    very conservative as they also assume that 27.55% of the alliances had a zero return, and that
    aggregate incremental family labor amounts to 20% of the aggregate benefits.




4
  The EIRR is lower than the FIRR for two reasons: (i) an error was made in the financial analysis by
including 13% VAT in the inflow figures from alliance sales (and not in the outflows = VAT has to be paid
to the Treasury) and (ii) the absence of incremental family labor in the economic cost calculations.

Annex 5. Impact Evaluation and Beneficiary Survey Results:

Impact evaluation

1.       The project aimed to implement an impact evaluation since its inception. Although two
baseline surveys were carried out to inform project design and execution, they could not in the end
be used for the impact evaluation as they did not allow for the adequate identification of treated
and non-treated groups. The 2006 survey collected information on local producers within the
project intervention areas but did not incorporate sufficient information to identify the surveyed
farmers for follow-up. Similarly, the 2008 survey collected information only from people who were
already effectively receiving support from the project.
2.        The baseline survey for the follow-up project (PAR II) has been used to estimate the
counterfactual outcomes of the project (PAR). A PAR II baseline survey was carried out with
producers who had applied to the first call for proposals and who had passed the pre-feasibility
filter (“opportunity evaluation”). This survey of potential PAR II beneficiaries was used to build a
counterfactual control group for the project’s (PAR) impact evaluation, as those surveyed were
considered by the project but had yet to receive support, thus eliminating selection bias. A sample
of PAR beneficiaries was surveyed using the same questionnaire employed for the PAR II baseline
so as to allow for comparison.5
3.         The survey was designed to show impact in four intervention areas. Given that it is
impossible to know which producer organization will effectively receive PAR II support, the
project’s baseline survey includes a random sample of 3,824 producers pulled from all the
organizations which passed the pre-feasibility phase. In accordance with the trend observed in PAR
I, it is expected that about half of these organizations will receive project support. Simultaneously,
a sample of 2,142 PAR I beneficiaries was surveyed in the four regions where both PAR and PAR
II have had activities (Norte, Valle, Chaco, Trópico) 6 . This sample was designed to ensure
significant results in each region so as to evaluate PAR’s regional impact given that the intervention
areas are varied in terms of agro-ecological, cultural, marketing and socio-economic settings. The
samples were extracted from the project’s information system (SIGG).
4.       Project impacts were estimated using Propensity Score Matching and Mahalanobis-
distance Matching. PAR beneficiaries were matched with producers who had applied to PAR II’s
first call and passed the pre-feasibility phase. The beneficiaries were then matched with non-
beneficiaries that are closer to each other in accordance to the Mahalanobis distance, having taken
into account a set of pre-treatment observable characteristics (Table 1).7 In order to evaluate the
robustness of the results, a Propensity Score Matching was also carried out even though the treated




5
  In order to ensure the possibility of a follow-up survey for PAR II, this survey only included people
registered in the project’s administrative system (Sistema de Información Georeferenciado, SIGG). Surveyed
households were also geo-referenced. Given that only a fraction of these producers will be able to effectively
receive support from PAR II, this survey will allow for a comparison between beneficiaries and non-
beneficiaries by using a double difference that could be complemented by a propensity score matching.
6
  The Salar and Lago regions were excluded from this impact evaluation as PAR II does not operate in these
regions.
7
  As with Propensity Scores, Mahalanobis-distance collapses several observable variables into a single scalar
that reduces the dimensionality conflict of exact matching. In addition, as Mahalanobis-distance uses the
complete variance and covariance matrix to standardize distances, it does not assume that covariates are
independent as the standardized weighed Euclidian distances.

and non-treated groups did not participate in the same selection process.8 Several variables were
included in this matching process, comprising characteristics related to the producer, their
household and their families, as collected through the survey: sex, age, years of education, number
of family members, migration status, ethnicity, department of residence, access to basic services
(electricity, water and sanitation), use of combustibles to cook, number of rooms per household
members and household construction materials. Non-significant variables at 10% of significance
within the binary model were excluded from the matching processes. Although the analysis uses
the ‘5-nearest neighbors’ procedure, summarized results of ‘nearest neighbor’ and ‘3-nearest
neighbors’ are also reported to show the robustness of the results in accordance with different
specifications.

5.      The matching allowed for a better comparison of various income variables to estimate
the project’s impact. The matching allowed for a reweighting of the non-beneficiary group so as
to become closer to the beneficiary group in order to reduce the selection bias caused by observable
characteristics. These weights were used to estimate the counterfactual outcomes which were
compared to the outcomes effectively attained by beneficiaries. In order to properly evaluate the
project’s impact, four income variables were assessed, including: (i) agricultural sales that include
the market value of crops, cattle and derivative productions; (ii) total agricultural income that
includes the market value of sales and the estimated value of subsistence production; (iii) net
agriculture income that subtracts reported costs from total agricultural income; and (iv) total
household labor income that includes all beneficiary labor income after taxes and cost resulting
from primary and/or secondary activities as salaried or self-employed persons of all household
members. The agricultural income variables were estimated using product by product information
requested during the survey; total labor income variables were calculated using a different set of
questions regarding income by labor activity.
6.     The project had a positive and significant impact on almost all income variables.
Depending on the matching procedure, the project increased agricultural sales and total agricultural

  In this case, the prosperity scores were estimated using a binominal probit model in order to collapse all
significant pre-treatment characteristics into a single scalar that facilitates the matching.

income between 28 to 39% over the average agricultural sales and total agricultural income of the
control group—these improvements were significant at 5 percent. The impact on net agricultural
income attains a 32 to 39% increase but the difference is not significant at 5% under propensity
score matching, due probably to problems in the collection of costs information. Despite being
more aggregate income variable, the impacts household income was positive and significant. In
effect, the household labor income increased by about 28 percent—an improvement that was
significant at 5 percent. Although matching under nearest neighbor and the 3-nearest neighbors
algorithms generate other point estimations, they ratify the Project’s positive impact on
beneficiaries’ income.
7.       Observation. In the absence of a baseline survey, this impact evaluation is based on
matching procedures—a weaker impact evaluation methodology. In this sense, the results presented
in this section should be interpreted as preliminary findings until the more robust PAR II impact
evaluation is carried out in a couple of years—this evaluation will be carried out through an analysis
of double differences with propensity score matching.

Beneficiary Survey

8.       At the end of the project, a team of social specialists carried out a survey of 86 randomly
selected alliances to measure the likely sustainability of the relationship between the alliance
partners. To measure this, the team studied the characteristics of the partners and the perceptions
of each of the partners. Through the characteristics of the partners the team collected data on size,
age, gender, services offered, capital, and others. The team drew up a typology of the partners to
establish how certain characteristics influence the sustainability of partnerships over time. But the
bulk of the study focused on identifying the perception of the different partners on the factors
affecting the alliance sustainability.
9.      This research applied three instruments: (i) focus groups with producers applying a
participatory analysis methodology; (ii) semi-structured interviews with producer organization
leaders and with buyers; and (iii) life stories of producer group families.

      Results of the surveys

the three main impacts mentioned by the producers.

    Market access                                             36%

11.     In the perception of producers, impact on income is too dependent on weather conditions
and price fluctuations. For the vast majority of producers, the main impacts of partnerships should
be sought in the development of production systems that result in improving the quality of products,
increasing productivity and the development of productive capacities. The producers perceive that


                                                 42
these impacts must lead to increases in household income or access to safer markets in the short
and medium term.
12.      For the buyers, the main reasons to step and remain in an alliance are assurance of product
quality and dealing with a reliable producer organization.
         Table 3: Buyers’ principal reasons to remain in an alliance
           Reasons to remain in an alliance                                   Percentage
           Compliance with produce quality required in the market             95%
           Reliability of the producer association                            55%
           Production of the quantity agreed upon                             18%
           Cost reduction                                                     9%
13.     The producer organizations consider that increases in income, stability of sales volumes
and prices and a relation of trust with the buyer are the main reasons to stay within the alliance.
         Table 4: Principal reasons of producer organizations to stay within an alliance
           Reasons to stay within the alliance                                  Percentage
           Increase income for the producers                                    93%
           Relation of trust with the buyer                                     59%
           Stability of volumes and prices                                      56%
           Additional services provided by the buyer                            7%
14.    From the producer point of view the principal reasons to stay within the alliance are the same
       as for the producer organizations
      Table 5: Principal reasons of producers to stay within an alliance
           Reasons to stay within the alliance                                  Percentage
           Increase income for the producers                                    88%
           Relation of trust with the buyer                                     35%
           Stability of volumes and prices                                      38%
           Additional services provided by the buyer                            15%
15.      Conclusions. The actors identified several factors that affect the sustainability of
partnerships, factors related to: the characteristics of the partners, the type of relationship
established between the alliance partners and the benefits it generates.
                The views of the leaders of producers and their organizations are similar: what
                 matters are the economic benefits partnerships bring. Higher income generation
                 was the most commonly mentioned reason to stay within alliances. This
                 improvement in revenue can come, as indicated, from improvements in prices or
                 increase in production volumes or cost reduction.
                Market access as a concept seems to be less important for organizations and
                 producers. Most producers have reduced marketing risks, so that market security
                 is no longer a priority, as it was in the past.
                Finally, another aspect that stands out is that additional services (e.g. technical
                 assistance) provided by the buyers are less important for alliance sustainability.
                 Only a small fraction of leaders and producers saw it as compelling reason to
                 maintain the alliance.

                For buyers, the alliance must ensure a quality product. For them, alliances are
                 important because they allow them to ensure product supply the market needs, and
                 give them the assurance of the product quality.
16.     In short, alliances are sustainable to the extent that the main interests of producers (higher
income) are consistent with the best interests of buyers (product quality and delivery); the
partnerships that reconcile both interests are sustainable. The other sustainability criteria linked to
the characteristics of alliance partners (age, size, legal status) or the type of relationship established
between actors (friendship, honesty, respect) are apparently secondary.

Lessons Learned

1. The rural development strategy of the Rural Alliances Project (PAR) is an inclusive model in
    which local actors–such as low-income smallholder producers, minority indigenous people and
    women with great productive potential are brought together and organized with common
    goals,--and where an alliance with buyers has provided them with greater market access and
    increased incomes.
2. The markets for organic and eco-friendly products demand changes in production systems,
    practices, and techniques which require new investments and, hence, funding for producers to
    fulfill their commitments to market players. The PAR has effectively contributed to the
    expansion of organic and certified production.
3. The PAR model is simple and flexible. It is adaptable to producers i) with medium but also
    very low income levels, ii) who are close or far from the market, iii) in large or small producer
    associations, and iv) better less well organized.
4. In the PAR model producers assume greater responsibilities (in the formalization, development
    of the alliance business plans, implementation, and in monitoring and social accountability and
    sustainability of their businesses). Therefore, the process of empowerment is quicker and leads
    to better results. Moreover, it also reduces the cost of the PAR.
5. The PAR contributed to the development of a legal framework on channeling the transfer of
    resources, the formalization of the producer organizations and their projections on the market.
6. The contributions of the beneficiaries ("contrapartes") to realize their plans determine the
    appropriation of the project, define the size of the project, and strengthen social accountability.
    If beneficiaries contribute, all work together in the project and control the leaders.
7. Smallholder producers generally have (in one way or another) a connection to and experience
    with the market. PAR aims to enhance this relation, not to create it. Rather, PAR seeks to
    directly link producers with buyers, leaving the development of this relation to their initiative.
8. PAR contributes to food security through increased production volumes, expansion of
    cultivated land, improvements in yield, and capacity building and human capital, contributing
    to the sustainability of the domestic food market.
9. The economic development of the families of beneficiary small producers has led to increased
    economic growth at local level, as reinvestment takes place not only on farms, but also in other
    sectors that improve the quality of life in the rural communities. Surpluses are not reinvested
    in cities or abroad.
10. The activities of PAR have contributed to the growth of the agricultural and food sector and,
    to some extent, also of certain economic sectors in rural areas that are important to national
    economic development.
11. The participatory process of formulating the alliance business plans -in which producers pose
    strategies on organization, production, marketing and finance- leads to the financing of a
    business plan that is adapted to their situation and capacities. Thereby, the level of
    strengthening required for each of the beneficiary organizations is better defined.
12. PAR has generated local capacities at the technical level in the formulation of business plans
    (partnerships), in monitoring the implementation, and the marketing of productive operations.
13. PAR has improved local access to technical services and equipment, and to infrastructure and
    supplies, given the direct implementation of their investments by the producers.
14. Producer organizations are led by entrepreneurs who are not necessarily the poorest of the
    community, but who bring into their dynamics other small producers, so their role should not
    only be recognized but also supported.


                                                  45
15. PAR funds business initiatives of poor rural producers and the development of ecological and
    organic business plans responding to domestic and foreign market demand.
16. The level of ownership of PAR by potential beneficiaries and farmers has been very strong, so
    that rural conditional transfers have been set on the national political agenda and have
    contributed to protect the institutionally of the Project.

Future Challenges
17. In Bolivia, there are about 700,000 rural productive units. PAR and the EMPODERAR
    Program have reached coverage of support for 40,000 rural families. The challenge is to
    provide opportunities to support 100% of producers in the whole national territory with
    sufficient resources and in a timely manner.
18. The direct transfers of resources to producers have generated organizational capabilities and
    capitalization, which demand further investments to grow in size or to move up the value chain.
    At this point, the financial sector should respond to these needs of the organizations and
    facilitate their transition.
19. PAR has been financed through World Bank credits. In the future, sub-national governments
    that have the competency and resources should participate given that PAR has proven to be an
    effective vehicle to reach small, rural producers. PAR has to leverage additional investments,
    especially by the Autonomous Departmental Governments, and above all regarding transfers
    to producer organizations.
20. PAR has strengthened producer organizations and production systems in rural areas, projecting
    higher growth and demand for resources, which in the future should be linked into the financial
    sector.

Questions for the Future
21. To which extent can the rural alliances generate national economic growth, increase the labor
    efficiency, and decrease in income inequality?
22. Could rural alliances decrease the rates of migration from rural areas to urban centers, or
    incentivize migration to other sectors like services?
23. Could rural alliances directly or indirectly contribute to generate greater value in other sectors,
    such as agro-industry, or generate employment in rural areas?
24. What are relevant factors in other countries that the rural alliances in Bolivia should draw most
    attention to? Which could be considered in order to improve the model in Bolivia?
