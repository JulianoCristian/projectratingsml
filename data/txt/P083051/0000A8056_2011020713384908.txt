                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This report was drafted in July 2010 and reflects advances reached until that date. An updated report will be prepared and filed shortly afterwards. Project implementation continues
                         to be satisfactory, as measured in terms of results, quality and disbursements. The Fourth call for alliances has been highly successful, so much so that all funds may be committed
                         by year's end and a planned Fifth call may be unnecessary. Most of the new alliances will be financed in the three new regions included through the Additional Financing.
