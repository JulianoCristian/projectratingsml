The project did not\n            achieve its main objectives and was not completed, its\n            impact was very modest, sustainability is not likely, and\n            the Borrower performed less than satisfactory. However, the\n            Bank performed its duties satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, in retrospect, the\n            Association was overly optimistic about how quickly the\n            railway management could begin to respond to the challenge\n            of road competition. As such, it might have been better to\n            delay appraisal until it was clear that the Railway Board\n            understood the need for adjustment and was willing to take\n            appropriate measures. Second, regarding the implementation\n            of the major project components, the results would have been\n            more satisfactory had the necessary PC-1 documents been\n            approved before project effectiveness. This approval should\n            be a prerequisite for project effectiveness. Lastly,\n            compliance with certain covenants in the Credit Agreement\n            was too little and too late. Some of the requirements of the\n            covenants and the Plan of Action called for measures that\n            invited reaction from local politicians. These measures were\n            essential given the rapidly growing deficit and need for\n            financial discipline."}, "docdt": "1989-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
