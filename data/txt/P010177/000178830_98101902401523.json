improve the utilization of PR's existing assets and\n            consists of the following main components: (a) improvement\n            in locomotive maintenance through the introduction of a\n            locomotive component remanufacturing facility and a unit\n            exchange maintenance system; (b) installation of a\n            management information system; (c) facilities and equipment\n            for operating an international container service; (d)\n            provision of spare parts; and (e) technical assistance and\n            staff training in support of the project's objectives.\n            The benefits would accrue mainly from increased availability\n            and reliability of PR's diesel electric locomotive fleet."}, "docdt": "1982-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
