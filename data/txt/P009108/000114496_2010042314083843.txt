Re:
Canadian Grant Agreement (No. 05-20232-UA)
(Rehabilitation Project)
Amendment to the Grant Agreement
Excellency:
We refer to the Canadian Grant Agreement for the above-mentioned Grant between 
Ukraine and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, dated December 
23, 1994, and our recent discussions concerning the utilization of funds under the 
Grant to finance expenditures incurred prior to the date of the Grant Agreement.  We 
hereby suggest to amend said Canadian Grant Agreement as follows:
1.
Paragraph 3 of the Schedule shall read:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no withdrawals 
shall be made and no commitments shall be entered into to pay amounts to the 
Recipient or others in respect of payments made for expenditures (i) prior to 
the date of August 23, 1994; (ii) in the currency of the Recipient or for 
goods supplied from the territory of the Recipient; (iii) for goods included 
in the SITC groups or subgroups listed in subparagraph 2 (a) of Schedule 1 to 
the 
IBRD Loan Agreement and (iv) for goods specified in subparagraph 2 (e) of 
the 
said Schedule."
2.
Paragraph 4 shall be added to the Schedule, which Paragraph 4 shall read:
"Withdrawals for expenditures under contracts for the procurement of 
goods estimated to cost less than $3,000,000 may be required by the 
Administrator upon the basis of statements of expenditure under such terms and 
conditions as the Administrator shall specify."
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing, dating and returning 
to us the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter.
This amendment shall become effective upon receipt of the countersigned copy of 
this letter by us.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
   AND DEVELOPMENT
