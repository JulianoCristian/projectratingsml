uncertain, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            there is a strong tendency in the Bank to be over-optimistic\n            about the outcomes of adjustment operations, both in terms\n            of macroeconomic objectives as well as structural changes.\n            To the extent possible, the Bank should seek to involve in\n            policy discussions those in government who are skeptical\n            about reforms, especially when they pertain to agriculture\n            and the social sectors. This may be time consuming and\n            difficult, but ultimately beneficial. Given the uncertain\n            political support for reforms, the limited institutional\n            capacity and the uncertainties of predicting the nature and\n            size of supply response, it would be prudent to maintain\n            realistic expectations and to be flexible in response to\n            slippages in policy and projected outcomes. The phased\n            disbursement design of the Ukraine Rehabilitation Loan was a\n            useful innovation in this regard. A suitably empowered\n            authority within the Government to coordinate and oversee\n            progress in reforms is vital not only for the indigenous\n            development of the reform program, but also to prevent\n            implementation of sectoral policies that go against the\n            spirit of the economy-wide reforms."}, "docdt": "1997-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
