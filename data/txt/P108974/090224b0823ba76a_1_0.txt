                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The original Credit (Cr. 4392-NI) closed on December 31, 2013. At the request of the Government of Nicaragua, the Bank canceled US$1.3 million equivalent before the Credit
                         closing date, and this amount has been returned to the country's IDA allocation. The GoN is committed to finance the community infrastructure works and small health centers that
                         could not be completed under the Original Credit. The next mission is planned for May 2014.
