Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project will close on December 31, 2014 with unsatisfactory results. Nevertheless, recent supervision missions and preliminary findings from the
 final evaluation indicate that progress was made in the reconstruction of community infrastructure, housing and roof rehabilitation, and the line of credit
 to support the small-scale fisheries sector. The Project benefited over 3,900 families from roof rehabilitation (original target surpassed), and 200 families
 from housing reconstruction. Moreover, women in the small fisheries sector had benefited through microcredits and training, several fisher folk had
 received credits for boats, and a revolving fund established to continue providing microcredits in the future. However, 12 of the 16 community
 infrastructure works financed with the original Credit remained unfinished while the Government has reiterated its commitment to finding resources to
 complete them.
 Given the challenging Project situation, the Government of Nicaragua decided to request a cancellation of the remaining funds of the original Credit and
 of most of the funds of the additional financing (AF) grant, effectively also canceling the new community infrastructure and small health clinics included
 under the AF. Accordingly, the Bank canceled US$1.3 million equivalent before the original Credit closing date, and US$4.8 million equivalent under the
 Additional Financing. These amounts were returned to the country's IDA allocation and re-allocated to new Bank-financed operations.

         Comments
         Final increase will be measured during the Project Evaluation. Preliminary results indicate that there have been
         improvements in the livelihoods of the credit line beneficiaries. In particular, initial surveys suggest that the
         incomes of the Pikineras who received credit have likely increased by more than 100 per cent. Nevertheless, low
         credit recovery rates experienced recently by the Revolving Fund (90 days for credits to Pikineras and 294 days
         for boats beneficiaries) represent a sustainability risk. Problems faced by some credit beneficiaries with the
         engines of some of the boats also pose sustainability challenges.

         Comments
         Final increase will be measured during the Project Evaluation. It should be noted that project impact on this
         target will be limited given reductions in the final number of boats provided under the Project and other changes
         to the fisheries component.

               30 boats have been transferred to beneficiaries through the Revolving Fund. These beneficiaries have also
               received capacity-building courses to improve fishing and navigation techniques. Nevertheless, delivery of the
               boats to the beneficiaries took longer than planned due to bureaucratic issues in Banco Produzcamos (BP), the
               financial institution administering the Revolving Fund and lach of leadership by the Regional Government. In
               some cases, beneficiaries received boats with defective engines and other mechanical problems due, among
               other things, to long and inadequate storage . Moreover, lack of spare parts have prevented the proper use of
               some boats. An Action Plan has been agreed by the Regional Government and BP to help resolve these
               issues.

               Sustainability of the revolving fund will be assessed during the final Project evaluation. Nevertheless, its
               sustainability is currently at stake due to a recent dramtic drop in credit recovery rates:; 90 days for Pikineras
               and 294 days for boats on average. Although, a series of mitigation measures have been carried out by GRAAN,
               Banco Produzcamos hasn’t yet provided additional human resources support to its loan office in Bilwi.

               No survey has been conducted to measure this indicator. Given delays with reconstruction of community
               infrastructure, it is highly likely that this target will not be met.

               This indicator will be assessed during the final Project evaluation. Nevertheless, preliminary capacity assessment
               show limited improvements in certain areas, and continuous challenges in other areas. An IDF for institutional
               strengthening of GRAAN, currently under implementation, will help address some of the remaining weaknesses
               in fiduciary and administrative aspects.
