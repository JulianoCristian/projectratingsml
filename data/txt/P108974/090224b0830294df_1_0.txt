I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Context and Sector Background. Hurricane Felix’s effects were overwhelmingly
felt by communities in the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCN)2, one of
the poorest regions in one of the poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Felix, a Category 5 hurricane, made landfall at 4:45 AM (local time) on September 4, 2007,
51 kilometers north of Bilwi, the region’s capital. According to official estimates,
Hurricane Felix caused 102 deaths and directly affected approximately 200,000 persons.
The hurricane disrupted the basic life of many communities as it destroyed over 10,000
houses and blew off the roofs of an additional 9,000, destroyed 20 churches and badly
damaged an additional 37, and contaminated approximately 11,500 wells while destroying
over 13,000 latrines. At the same time, it also badly damaged or destroyed 84 public
buildings, 107 schools, and 134 clinics of various sizes. Transport, normally difficult, was
disrupted as the storm damaged 994 km of roads and many bridges.

2.      Fisheries and agriculture, two key economic sectors in the region, were critically
affected. The storm seriously disrupted extensive marine areas, uprooting mangroves and
destroying entire fishing villages, displacing at least 2,100 fishermen and 3,500 people
associated with fisheries. The impact on the agricultural sector had serious implications on
food security, and it was estimated that over 86,000 hectares of agricultural land were
damaged with losses to livestock reaching 21 percent of the region’s total. In addition, the
hurricane affected 1.3 million hectares of forest areas (of which 477,000 were devastated),
where an estimated 12 million cubic meters of potentially usable wood fell to the ground,
with limited capacity to salvage most of it.

3.      Country and Regional Background. At the time of appraisal, Nicaragua was
ranked as the second poorest country in Latin America after Haiti, and as one of the most
disaster-prone countries in the world. Modest and highly variable GDP growth, reflecting
the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks, such as disasters associated with extreme
weather events, had been hindering poverty reduction efforts. Despite progress, between
2002 and 2006 the annual GDP growth averaged 3.2 percent, or 1.3 percent in per capita
terms. Poverty remained high with about 46 percent of the country’s 5.5 million people
living under the poverty line.

4.     Hurricane Felix’s effects weighed heavily on a region that still has some of the
highest incidences of poverty and malnutrition, and lowest levels of education and health
in Nicaragua. With approximately 308,000 inhabitants, RACCN covers almost 33,000
square kilometers of the Caribbean region, the largest and the poorest of the three distinct
regions that comprise Nicaragua.3 The Caribbean region, which RACCN shares with the
South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCS), comprises about 43 percent of the


2 At appraisal, the region was known as North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN). This ICR uses the current official

name, adopted in 2014, of North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region.
3 Other regions are: the Pacific lowlands, where most of the country’s population lives, and the North-Central Mountains.




                                                           1
country’s territory but only 11 percent of its population. About 60 percent of the Caribbean
autonomous regions’ total population – and almost 77 percent of their rural population –
lives in poverty. A large rainforest crossed by several large rivers covers the region,
characterized by a hot and humid climate and a sparse yet multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and
multi-lingual population, including many of Miskito and Afro-Caribbean descent. Most of
the territory has a pattern of collectively owned land tenure, traditional institutions such as
communal councils and assemblies, and well-established processes of community-based
decision-making. Given their distinct culture and history, both RACCN and RACCS have
enjoyed partial autonomy since the mid-1980s.

5.      Government strategy. Confronted with the dramatic losses caused by Felix, on
September 4, 2007, the Government of Nicaragua (GoN) declared a State of Emergency in
RACCN by which all ministries, as well as local and regional government entities, were
instructed by the National Emergency Committee under the National System for Disaster
Prevention, Mitigation and Response (SINAPRED) to make available the necessary
resources to respond to the disaster and help initiate rehabilitation activities as soon as
possible. In line with the National Emergency Response Plan, the Governor of RACCN
led the response, while the Regional and Municipal emergency committees were activated
to coordinate the search and rescue and overall relief operations. Efforts were also focused
on completing an assessment of damage and needs that would allow for the preparation of
a recovery plan consistent with regional development priorities.

6.      Rationale for Bank involvement. Given the impact of the hurricane on such a poor
region, the Bank responded to the Government’s request and approved an Emergency
Recovery Credit of SDR 10.7 million (US$17 million equivalent) on March 6, 2008.
Consistent with OP/BP 8.0, the Credit, processed on a fast track basis in less than four
months, sought to finance the costs associated with the recovery of affected communities
in RACCN. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF, IDA-Q5960) of US$5.0 million had also
been rapidly processed and approved on December 19, 2007, to finance technical and
fiduciary capacity building to ensure the regional government’s readiness for project
implementation, and preparation of social, environmental, and other assessments in line
with Bank safeguard and fiduciary requirements.

7.      Considering other development partners’ efforts, 4 the Bank complemented its
support to the Government’s recovery strategy through the GEF-financed Corazon
Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Project (P085488) and the Education for All (EFA)
Trust Fund for Nicaragua (TF057311). With support from the Corazon Project, the regional
government and INAFOR revised the 2007-2008 Emergency Plan for Prevention and
Control of Forest Fires for RACCN, to promote community-based forestry management
and to identify options to salvage fallen trees. Likewise, EFA funds of US$3.5 million were
allocated to help reconstruct schools in the region.



4 As a result of the United Nations’ flash appeal, US$18.8 million were committed and US$9.1 million were pledged to
relief and recovery operations through UN agencies. There was also aid from some bilateral agencies particularly for
emergency response, but financial support for recovery was relatively low.


                                                         2
8.      On November 13, 2012, the Bank approved an Additional Financing (AF) Grant of
SDR 3.3 million (US$ 5.0 million equivalent) to help cover cost overruns related to
social/community infrastructure. With this AF, the GoN planned to complete the original
Project activities for reconstruction of housing and social infrastructure, including
community centers, churches and small health clinics.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.       The project was originally prepared as an Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) from
the International Development Association (IDA). The Project Development Objective
(PDO) was to support the sustainable recovery of the communities affected by Hurricane
Felix in the North Atlantic Autonomous Region of Nicaragua. There were three main
proposed outcomes related to the PDO: (i) Ensuring timely restoration of basic social and
economic life through early rehabilitation and recovery activities; (ii) rehabilitating and
improving the productive capacity and sustainability of the small-scale fishery sector; and
(iii) supporting the reconstruction of housing and social infrastructure.

10.       Accordingly, the original Project key indicators were:

         Income of fishermen and women participating in the Project is restored or improved
         At least 120 percent increase in sustainable fish production in the region by end of
          project
         At least 40 percent of beneficiaries receiving boats and fishing equipment and
          supplies under the Project are women
         At least 3,200 families living in houses rehabilitated or reconstructed to safer
          standards under the Project
         At least 40 affected communities given access to safer buildings for emergency
          shelter through the Project

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.     There were no revisions to the PDO. Key indicators underwent some adjustments,
including one that was dropped after the 2011 Project Restructuring, namely “at least 120
percent increase in sustainable fish production in the region by end of project.” This
indicator was considered unrealistic and beyond what the Project could directly contribute
to improving fish production in the region, particularly after the decision was made to not
finance the fish processing plant, and to reduce the number of boats that would be provided
under the project.

12.     Specific adjustments to targets of some key indicators include: (i) through the
Project Restructuring approved in January 20, 2012, which adjusted some Project
indicators to reflect reductions of 50 percent in targets under Component 3 (Reconstruction
of Housing and Social Infrastructure) due to increased reconstruction costs; and (ii) under
the Additional Financing, indicators under Component 3 were brought back to Project’s
original target levels.


                                               3
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.     The Project’s direct beneficiaries included: (a) Local, mainly poor indigenous
communities who were expected to benefit from the reconstruction of housing and social
infrastructure; (b) eligible fisher folk and other people who would benefit from provision
of fishing equipment and materials, and access to credit through a revolving fund; and (c)
GRACCN, which would benefit from institutional strengthening and increased capacity
for project implementation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.    The Project had four components. Based on the implementation strategy agreed
with the GoN, Component 1 was implemented by the Executive Secretariat of SINAPRED
and the rest by GRACCN:

15.      Component 1-Early recovery (US$5.0 million or 29.4 percent of total project cost):
Activities under this component were aimed at ensuring timely implementation of critical
rehabilitation and recovery activities, as well as readiness of the GRACCN to start project
implementation. Sub-Component 1.1 – Provision of Early Reconstruction Materials
(US$2.0 million) provided retroactive financing for construction materials and operating
costs directly related to relief and early disaster rehabilitation efforts. Sub-Component 1.2
- Institutional Strengthening and Rehabilitation (US$3.0 million) financed (i) institutional
strengthening for project management for SE-SINAPRED and GRACCN, and (ii)
rehabilitation of housing (mainly roofs), and of the agriculture and fisheries sectors. This
component also included financing for the social and environmental assessments and
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which thanks to the flexibility of OP 8.0 could
be completed after Board approval.

16.     Component 2-Recovery of small-scale fisheries sector (US$6.3 million or 37
percent of total project cost): Activities under this component sought to restore, and
potentially improve, the socioeconomic conditions of the population engaged in the small-
scale fisheries sector in the region. Sub-Component 2.1 - Rehabilitation of Small-Scale
Fisheries Sector (US$5.0 million): (i) established a Revolving Fund to provide better
equipped boats and working capital to affected households to restart their fishing activities
in a more productive and sustainable way, (ii) provided technical assistance and training to
affected coastal communities, and (iii) provided fishing equipment and supplies. Sub-
Component 2.2 - Rehabilitation of Fish Processing Plant and Related Facilities (US$1.0
million) sought to restore income generation opportunities to women and the local
economy through: (i) the rehabilitation of the Lamlaya Fish Processing Plant, along with a
small shipyard and a community store for fishing supplies, and (ii) credit to affected
women. Sub-Component 2.3 – Reconstruction of Small Infrastructure (US$0.3 million)
sought to finance the rehabilitation of several community landing docks and small piers.

17.    Component 3-Reconstruction of housing and social infrastructure (US$5.4
million or 31.8 percent of total project cost): Activities under this Component aimed at



                                             4
reestablishing the social and economic environment of affected communities through the
provision of safer and culturally responsive housing and social infrastructure. Sub-
Component 3.1 – Reconstruction of Housing (US$2.5 million) financed general housing
reconstruction in wood and in traditional yet safer design applying new standards that
consider disaster risk, with the participation of beneficiaries in the reconstruction process.
Sub-Component 3.2 – Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure (US$2.9 million) funded
activities for reconstruction of community churches and community centers with the dual
purpose to serve as emergency shelters, and small health clinics.

18.     Component 4-Institutional strengthening for project management, coordination,
and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (US$0.3 million or 1.7 percent of total project
cost): Activities under this component aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of
GRACCN to implement the recovery emergency program, and to lead general regional
development efforts. This component also financed external audits and the implementation
of the Project’s M&E system.

1.6 Revised Components

19.     While the four components were maintained throughout Project implementation,
the Project Restructuring and the Additional Financing (AF) approved in January and
November of 2012 respectively, introduced adjustments to components and indicators. The
AF sought to cover cost overruns related to social/community infrastructure, in order to
complete the original Project activities for Component 3 adjusted by a previous project
restructuring.5 The original project components 1 and 2 did not receive additional resources
under the AF since their activities had been completed under the original Credit. The
specific changes are as follows:

    Component 1 - Early recovery (US$5.0 million or 22.7 percent of total project cost):
     No change.

    Component 2 - Recovery of small-scale fisheries sector (US$6.3 million or 28.6 percent
     of total project cost): The 2012 Project Restructuring cancelled the rehabilitation of the
     fish processing plant and shipyard (and therefore removed the related indicator). This
     decision was based on the conclusion that its financing was not economically justified.6

    Component 3 - Reconstruction of housing and social infrastructure (US$4.6 million
     under the AF, for a total of US$10 million or 45.4 percent of total project cost): The
     original targets for this component had been reduced by almost 50 percent under the
     2012 project restructuring, and the AF restored these targets. Specifically, the AF was
     expected to finance the supervision and construction of eight churches, eight




5 Project Restructuring (Level 2) approved on January 20, 2012 based on MTR recommendations to revise activities of
Component 3 reducing it from originally planned. Further details provided in Section 1.7
6 The Financing Agreement had a legal clause that established the need for a feasibility analysis before funding for these

structures could be confirmed under the Credit.


                                                            5
    community centers, and two small health centers, and to allow equipping the health
    centers and completing the training on improved construction techniques.

   Component 4 - Institutional strengthening for project management, coordination, and
    monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (US$0.4 million under the AF, for a total of US$0.7
    million or 3.2 percent of total project cost): The AF added funds for project
    management, and Monitoring and Evaluation. As described, this included, among
    others, coordination, training, financial management, external auditing, and
    implementation of the Communication Strategy.

1.7 Other significant changes

20.    Project Restructuring 1 (Level 2), approved on August 10, 2009, to include the
financing of services associated with the processing of timber under the definition of “non-
consultant services.”

21.    Project Restructuring 2 (Level 2), approved on June 9, 2011, including (i) a
change in the entity responsible for administering the Project’s revolving fund from the
Rural Credit Fund (FCR) to the newly created Banco Produzcamos (BP), (ii) a reallocation
of proceeds, (iii) a revision of the definition of non-consulting services to include
expenditures related to the Communication Strategy under Component 4, and (iv)
adjustments to some targets under Component 2 to reflect the revised fisheries sector
recovery strategy.

22.     Project Restructuring 3 (Level 2), approved on January 20, 2012, including (i) a
seven-month extension of the Credit closing date from May 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012,
and (ii) adjustments to the Project’s original targets under Component 3 to reflect cost
overruns, based on the agreements of the Mid-Term Review (MTR).

23.     Project Restructuring 4 (Level 2), approved on October 10, 2012, extending the
Credit closing date from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013.

24.     Additional Financing (IDA Grant of US$5.0 million equivalent) approved on
November 13, 2012, in order to complete original activities and meet targets under
Component 3; and provide, under Component 4, resources for additional project
management, monitoring and evaluation, and to finalize training to promote Hurricane-
resistant construction practices.

25.     Extension of Closing Dates. Project implementation lasted more than six years
from Credit effectiveness. The Project officially closed in December 2014 after two closing
date extensions of the original Credit, and the expected implementation period of the AF.
The closing date extensions of the original Credit included: (a) with the January 20, 2012
restructuring, from May 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 to allow the completion of
activities under Component 3, and the rolling out of the revolving fund for the small scale
fisheries sector; (b) with the October 10, 2012 restructuring, extending the original Credit




                                             6
closing date from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 to provide additional time for
the completion of key activities; and (d) with the approval of the AF, to December 31, 2014.

26.     Reallocation of Credit funds. The Project Restructuring approved on June 9, 2011
included a reallocation of credit proceeds reflecting adjustments made to the scope of some
of the Project’s components, and to reflect the unused funds of the PPF. As a result, the
original appraisal amount of Category 1 (corresponding to Component 1) was decreased
by 36 percent, while Category 2 (corresponding to the rest of the project with the exception
of the revolving fund and the fish processing plant and shipyard) was increased by 68
percent, and Category 3 (corresponding to the revolving fund) was increased by 96 percent.

27.      Funds cancellation. A total of SDR 4,422,182.07 (US$6,834,177.02) were
cancelled from both the original Credit and the AF Grant. These cancellations correspond
to the following: (a) at the request of the Government, SDR 875,265.00 (US$1,345,238.54)
were cancelled from the original Credit on December 30, 2013, right before its closing
date; and SDR 453,256.79 (US$699,828.48) were cancelled on July 28, 2014 reflecting
unused Credit funds; and (b) also at the request of the Government, SDR 3,093,660.37
(US$4,789,110.00 million), or most of the AF Grant amount, was cancelled on April 22,
2014. The funds cancelled before the Credit’s and AF grant’s closing dates were returned
to the IDA pool of Nicaragua to be used in other projects that were under preparation at
the time. With the cancellation of Credit funds requested by the Government, no funds
were left allocated for the fish processing plant and shipyard (Category 4).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28.     Soundness of Background Analysis. The Project was originally designed as an
emergency operation (based on former OP/BP 8.0 streamlined procedures), and as such, it
was rapidly prepared within four months.7 The Project focused on selected sectors, such as
emergency recovery as well as social infrastructure and housing reconstruction, where the
Bank had a comparative advantage. Although the results matrix focused mainly on output
indicators, it also considered outcomes on income and fisheries production improvements,
and beneficiaries’ satisfaction, while also paying attention to gender equity issues. Project
design was for the most part based on knowledge and lessons learned on disaster risk
management efforts, including emergency recovery with and without the support of the
Bank. The IDA-financed Natural Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (NDVRP,
P064916), which was in its final stage, provided specific country knowledge and
experience on emergency recovery (see more on lessons learned below). However, given
the Project’s short preparation time, analyses of institutional and implementation
challenges, which would later affect project performance, were not sufficiently
comprehensive. At the same time, as part of the original design, Project preparation and
readiness for implementation was supposed to have been supported by a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF, IDA-Q5960) of US$5.0 million approved on December 17,
2007.


7   The Additional Financing Grant was prepared in 2012 under regular procedures given the time past since the disaster.


                                                            7
29.     Assessment of Project design. The PDO’s focus on supporting the sustainable
recovery of the communities affected by Hurricane Felix seemed achievable in a four-year
period. This objective was clear and important for the country and region, as indicated in
the FY08-12 Country Partnership Strategy for Nicaragua that recognized the significant
disaster risks faced by the country and noted the assistance being provided by the World
Bank for disaster risk management. The Project was also framed within the Development
Strategy that had been recently completed for the Caribbean Region through a participatory
process. Positively, the Project went beyond the simple reconstruction of damaged housing
and social infrastructure by promoting the integration of flood and wind resistance
standards into their designs. However, although Project design considered the social and
cultural characteristics of the affected communities, it does not seem to have taken
adequately into account implementation challenges inherent to RACCN, including for
example remoteness and widespread location of the affected communities, underdeveloped
regional markets, and weak inter-institutional coordination.

30.      The Project’s design reflected several specific requests from the Government of
Nicaragua (GoN), which could have benefited from a more in depth analysis if more time
had been available for project preparation. First, it was agreed that GRACCN – lacking in
implementation experience and capacity – would be the implementing agency, with close
support from central agencies. The reason for this request was the Government’s objective
of promoting regional autonomy and better participation of traditional authorities in the
affected communities. Second, and consistent with this objective, it was also agreed to
integrate project staff within GRACCN’s organizational structure in order to promote
institutional strengthening. And third, considering that RACCN is one the poorest regions
in Nicaragua, and that it faced critical development challenges before the disaster, the GoN
and local authorities saw the project as an opportunity to promote long-term regional
development goals, especially regarding the small scale fisheries sector.

31.     In the attempt to respond to the above requests, there were several important lessons
that were not applied to Project design, and that as detailed below, resulted in
implementation issues later on: (i) as experience from other emergency operations shows,
there is a need to find an experienced and well performing implementing agency to ensure
smooth progress and rapid results; (ii) an emergency project should limit itself to
sustainable recovery activities even if within a medium-term development strategy
framework; and (iii) as much as possible, the Project should focus on sectors where the
Bank has a comparative advantage while ensuring complementarity with other
development partners’ support.

32.     Although the strategy for ensuring quality at entry – which is challenging for most
emergency operations – became unfeasible during HFERP’s preparation, Project design
did not consider alternative measures. To ensure that GRACCN would be ready for project
implementation, it was expected that SE-SINAPRED, which had been implementing the
NDVRP relatively satisfactorily, would execute the PPF and provide support, training and
technical assistance for capacity strengthening to GRACCN. The strategy fell through as
SE-SINAPRED’s capacity was lost due to a change of staff. In addition, the PPF could not



                                             8
be used as planned since it only became effective in March 2008, and its approval was
delayed in the National Assembly for several months. Under the optimistic assumption that
SE-SINAPRED could recover its implementation capacity rapidly, it was agreed that it
would implement Component 1 as a continuation of the activities originally proposed under
the PPF. In retrospect, the latter decision likely made project design and implementation
arrangements more complex.

33.     Although the PDO was well focused on recovery efforts, the objectives and
activities of Component 2 and 4 were overly ambitious. Justifiably, GoN and GRACCN
saw the project as an opportunity to promote the long-term development goals of the
region. Positively, the Project integrated activities to restore, and potentially improve, the
socioeconomic conditions of population engaged in the small-scale fisheries sector, and to
promote income generation opportunities for women. However, Component 2 went beyond
the emergency recovery of the small fisheries sector and sought to promote a major,
medium term change by diversifying it from lobster and shrimp capture into hitherto
unexploited fish species, and by promoting new fishing practices. While the Bank relied
on advice from FAO, it had not conducted analytical work or provided financial support to
this sector in many years. Moreover, Component 4, in addition to building project
implementation capacity, aimed to develop the medium-term institutional capacity of
GRACCN to lead regional development efforts under the challenging conditions of a post-
disaster and complex socio-political environment.

34.      Risk Assessment. The Project was assessed as being a high-risk operation, with
several initial high or substantial risks, and a residual substantial risk after mitigation. This
rating properly estimated the challenges of the project related to the socio-political situation,
institutional capacity, and the nature of the Project and provided a series of mitigation
measures. Most of the risks identified in the matrix materialized at some point during
Project implementation, while several of the proposed mitigation measures had limited
effectiveness.

35.     One of these risks, Implementation – weak capacity for project implementation –
rated as High, became manifest early in implementation. The mitigation measure of having
SE-SINAPRED provide the required support to GRACCN under Component 1 was
insufficient. Although GRACCN had some experience implementing externally funded
projects, its implementation capacity remained weak throughout Project implementation.
Two additional risks, rated as substantial at appraisal, also materialized: (i) Political,
reflecting the often difficult relationship between GRACCN and the central government,
and that had historically affected allocation and implementation of development
investments in the region; and (ii) Institutional, considering that ministries and sector
agencies had not traditionally played a supporting role to the main Implementing Agency
proposed under the Project. In addition to inter-institutional coordination, some of the key
agencies could not adequately transfer technical capacity to the regional government.

36.    Although mitigation measures included in the Project design were carried out, such
as financing of the necessary fiduciary and technical expertise to meet implementation
demands along with intensive Bank supervision, agreed implementation responsibilities



                                               9
between agencies were not fully met. In addition, the political relationship between the
region and the central government became difficult at times during implementation. Under
these circumstances, and with the weak leadership from GRACCN, the Project
Coordination Committee was for the most part ineffective.

2.2 Implementation

37.     Despite Government’s efforts and Bank intensive support, the Project suffered
several difficult periods reflected in implementation ratings of moderately unsatisfactory
to highly unsatisfactory when the Project reached its most critical point. On the one hand,
several factors helped implementation positively:

38.     Government-Bank partnership for the Caribbean Region’s Development. The
Government and the Bank built a partnership, which has ensured continuous technical and
financial support and close collaboration following the FY08-F12 CPS. The Project
represented a key mechanism to work together to improve implementation capacity in the
Region, and to address project implementation issues, even though this effort was not
always as successful due to the factors discussed below.

39.     Engagement of territorial and communal authorities and application of traditional
decision making processes. Despite being an emergency operation, the Project was
designed taking well into account the culture and traditions of the beneficiary communities.
Eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of the different activities were established in
consultation with traditional authorities and community representatives. These were
important factors that helped in project implementation, even more when the project
suffered delays or faced a difficult situation.

40.      Provision of additional expertise through grant funding. GRACCN benefited from
the provision of specialized technical assistance for fiduciary capacity strengthening
financed by trust funds. In 2009 the Public Sector Technical Assistance Project (MDTF-
PSTAC, P078891) provided US$160,000 to improve quality, transparency and
effectiveness of public administration of GRACCN. In addition, the Strengthening
Institutional Capacity of GRACCN Project (P144415), an Institutional Development Fund
(IDF) grant of US$600,000 (expected to conclude in July 2016) was granted in 2013 to
improve GRACCN organizational structure, governance, planning, financial management,
human resource management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation capacities.

41.    On the other hand, several factors – some outside of and some within the
control of the GoN and SE-SINAPRED and GRACCN – adversely affected the
Project:

42.      Dynamic socio-political context. The project suffered delays and related
performance issues due to the regional and municipal electoral cycles and the evolving
relationship between the central and regional governments. Two regional elections and one
municipal election took place during the Project’s life, and some of these resulted in public
demonstrations and regional government shutdowns. Moreover, often misleading



                                             10
allegations, reflecting in part weaknesses in the communication strategy, were raised
against the Project during the political cycles. Such allegations distracted attention from
actual implementation issues. Support to GRACCN by the central government also varied
during political cycles, and was particularly limited during the last regional election period
of 2013-2014. After a new regional government came into office in May 2014, further
delays were experienced due to the government transition and brief civil unrest given initial
disagreements of the local population with the election results.

43.     Challenging implementation context. The Project faced several implementation
challenges due to: (a) the remoteness and widespread location of most of the beneficiary
communities, many of which could only be accessed by boat; (b) variable seasonal and
limited window for construction activities; and (c) very limited regional market regarding
suppliers and civil work contractors. More critically, several decisions made dealing with
these challenges more difficult. First, and reflecting the high fiduciary risk rating given to
the Project, it was initially decided to limit the flexibility usually afforded to emergency
operations. Accordingly, among other measures, it was required from SE-SINAPRED and
GRACCN to prepare a common and coordinated Procurement Plan; and that all
procurement processes should have the previous no objection of the Bank, regardless of its
type or estimated amount, while consolidating processes into bidding packages that were
often too big for the regional or even the national market. These measures, in turn, resulted
in work overload for the Bank team while slowing down procurement activities. In many
cases it was necessary to carry out a process several times until finding qualified or
interested suppliers or contractors. In contrast, the case of the procurement of timber for
housing rehabilitation through local community cooperatives represents an example of how
solutions could be found 8 – even if after a protracted internal discussion – that would
respond to the project and regional context in a more practical yet still adequate manner
from a fiduciary perspective. Certainly, the situation improved over the years as the Bank
team learned to strike a better balance between ensuring due diligence of a high risk
operation and an implementation pace consistent with the Project’s emergency nature.

44.      Difficulty in building and keeping project implementation capacity. Due to the
issues noted before, GRACCN and SE-SINAPRED suffered from weak implementation
capacity, and had difficulty in keeping an adequate capacity throughout the Project’s life.
Maintaining fiduciary capacity was a challenge, which affected contract management,
documentation of expenditures, budget planning and other key administrative issues. First,
GRACCN experienced weak internal collaboration across the technical and fiduciary
departments with Project implementation responsibilities. Second, GRACCN, and to some
extent SE-SINAPRED, suffered from high turnover of staff and consultants, especially
after elections. Eventually, to improve project implementation, an agreement was reached
to establish a specialized Implementing Team in GRACCN, including technical and
fiduciary consultants from Nicaragua’s Pacific Region. However, this measure was only


8The original plan was to package all the procurement of timber under one international bidding process. Given the post-
disaster situation, and the amount of usable wood left on the ground by the hurricane, regional authorities and
communities opposed this proposal. By agreeing that the local cooperatives could supply the timber to the Project through
shopping processes, the communities benefitted economically while also allowing the use of local materials closer to the
construction sites.


                                                          11
partially successful given that the expert team did not manage to integrate itself fully with
GRACCN staff working in the project, as evidenced by conflict and lack of collaboration.
Moreover, due to their work load, these experts did not have sufficient time to transfer their
expertise and knowledge to local staff. Finally, the expected additional technical assistance
was provided a bit late in May 2014, when most of the AF funds had been cancelled and
the Project was already in its final closing phase. To have had a meaningful impact, the
technical assistance should have been provided sooner.

45.     Poor inter-institutional coordination and collaboration. The Project represented
for GRACCN a first major leading effort, which several central agencies were supposed to
support. Although these central agencies signed co-execution agreements with GRACCN,
their support throughout the project was generally uneven and inadequate. To some extent,
this was due to weak GRACCN project leadership, which also affected the effectiveness
of the Project Coordination Committee. Moreover, central agencies were not used to this
type of arrangement and were slow in learning to collaborate with the regional government.
As a result, coordination gaps at all levels jeopardized the implementation of Project
activities and the sustainability of some of its outcomes.

46.      Weak ownership and management of the revolving fund. The launching of the
revolving fund suffered delays when the Government eliminated FCR, the financial
institution originally designated as the fund’s administrator, and established BP as the new
development bank for the country. This change, that affected several Bank-financed
operations in Nicaragua, required a long restructuring process including a technical, legal,
and fiduciary analysis that assessed the viability of BP for handling Bank-funded lines of
credit and the required transfer of assets from FCR to BP, as well as a reconfirmation of
compliance with OP 8.30 (Financial Intermediary Lending). Delays in finalizing the
technical specifications and the need to repeat the bidding process twice delayed the
procuring of the boats that would be provided to eligible beneficiaries through the fund.
More fundamentally, the establishment and implementation of the revolving fund suffered
from weak ownership by GRACCN, and poor collaboration from BP, the new fund’s
administrator, and INPESCA, the specialized technical agency expected to provide
technical expertise. Despite repeated commitments, neither BP nor INPESCA adequately
supported GRACCN in the implementation of the revolving fund as evidenced by the
delays in providing technical advice for the boats and poor administration of the credit
portfolio. In spite of having beneficiaries screened and qualified technically and financially
to receive credits for boats and fishing equipment, there were processing delays, including
the submission of the boats’ import documents, in completing the legal transfer of the boats
to BP; and delays in deciding on the insurance required for the boats. Lack of GRACCN-
BP collaboration has resulted recently in low credit recovery rates that pose a serious threat
to the Fund’s sustainability.

47.     Lack of internal coordination of Bank team. Despite intensive supervision and
additional technical assistance, the Project remained in a critical situation in its final years.
In the final stages of the Project, different views were expressed to the Government by the
Bank team that led to confusion on the part of GoN and GRACCN. It is likely that a quicker




                                               12
convergence of views, as was eventually done, would have helped more effectively project
implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

48.      M&E design. Overall M&E was rated at Project closing as Moderately Satisfactory.
Emergency projects mostly focus on reconstruction and rehabilitation, thus their main
results tend to be cost-efficient outputs. In contrast, the Project’s results matrix introduced
socio-economic variables reflected in outcome indicators related to income and fish
production increases and social accountability mechanisms to measure beneficiary
satisfaction with project activities. M&E was also mainstreamed into all project
components at three levels: (a) contract monitoring, (b) implementation progress, and less
successfully (c) project impact. Moreover, with Bank technical assistance, an M&E
strategy was prepared for the Project, including key instruments such as surveys, and the
program for a database of beneficiaries designed.

49.     M&E implementation and utilization. M&E was carried out through the
evaluation of results against pre-established indicators according to the operations manual,
and periodic monitoring was used to adjust activities, budget and procurement plans.
Nevertheless, M&E implementation and utilization was limited at times due to institutional
capacity weaknesses and technological problems (such as lack of hardware and continuous
power outages). Specifically, the establishment and maintenance of a beneficiaries’
database was severely affected by the lack of updated and accessible information, which
in turn hindered the completion of the final project impact assessments. GRACCN hired
an independent consultancy firm to help prepare a final project evaluation, which, in spite
of some limitations, served as an important input for this ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

50.     Safeguards Compliance. The Project was given a B category, which required the
preparation of an environmental analysis and environmental management plan. The
safeguards triggered included: Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Natural Habitats
(OP/BP 4.04), Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10), and Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP
4.11). Given the flexibility of OP 8.00, the EA and EMP, as well as the social assessment,
were expected to be finalized six months after Credit effectiveness. Although these
documents were completed more than 18 months after effectiveness due to delays in
contracting the required consultancy firms, no negative environmental impacts occurred
due to close project supervision and the slow pace of implementation of civil works. Based
on the needs assessment (and eventually the EMP), the type of works considered fell under
the environmental classification Category B.

51.     Environmental Safeguards. At project closing, compliance with environmental
safeguards was rated Satisfactory (S). The Environmental Assessment and Management
Plan (EMP) was completed following broad-based consultations and was duly published.
In compliance with the national environmental law, the Project obtained an Environmental
Certification (License). The Natural Resources and Environment Secretariat (SERENA),



                                             13
as the regional environmental authority, followed-up and monitored compliance with the
EMP.

52.     Social Safeguards. At Project closing, social safeguard rating was considered
Satisfactory (S). As required, a Social Assessment was completed and published following
broad-based consultations. Considering that the region is predominantly multi-cultural and
multi-ethnic with a majority of indigenous population, the project was designed and
implemented in a manner consistent with OP 4.10. GRACCN and SE-SINAPRED
consulted widely with beneficiaries and their representatives, and beneficiaries’ concerns
were integrated in project activities to improve their social relevance, equity and
sustainability. A Communication Strategy complemented this approach, including for a
while weekly broadcasts detailing project activities on popular local radio stations where
potential beneficiaries were encouraged to provide feedback and voice their concerns.
Special attention was also paid to social inclusion and gender equity. As originally assessed,
reflecting the fact that all land in the beneficiary communities is collectively owned, no
resettlement issues emerged when making final decisions regarding reconstruction and
rehabilitation activities especially since these decisions, when needed, where taken
following traditional practices.

53.     At the end of Project implementation, communities were not informed properly
about the decision made by the GoN to cancel project funds for some of the social
infrastructure works. This resulted in a downgrading of the IP safeguard policy to
Moderately Unsatisfactory. This issue was addressed through a special communication
plan conducted by GRACCN whereby communities were informed about the
Government’s decision and the official commitment to continue the construction of social
infrastructure with other funds.

54.    Fiduciary Compliance. Fiduciary performance was weak despite an increase in
MHCP’s technical support to GRACCN during the last months of implementation and
Bank’s close monitoring and support.

55.     Financial Management. At Project closing, financial management under the Project
was rated as Unsatisfactory, considering substantial shortcomings that jeopardized
GRACCN’s capacity to provide timely and reliable information required to manage and
monitor project implementation. Moreover, resolution of many pending FM issues was
uncertain, particularly those related to reconciliation of accounts, ineligible expenses, lack
of supporting documentation and accounting deficiencies. Performance was affected by
high turnover of financial staff in both GRACCN and SE-SINAPRED throughout most of
the Project’s life, coupled with weaknesses in internal control systems, poor coordination
between GRACCN’s technical and fiduciary areas, lack of reliable financial information
reflecting weak capacity to register, monitor and reconcile funds, deficiencies of supporting
documentation of certain expenses, and also delays in payments to providers. In addition,
GRACCN offices suffered from constant power blackouts and technical limitations of the
IT system. As a result, the Project suffered from overdue IFRs repeatedly. All of these
shortcomings affected project implementation and created uncertainty on the proper use of
Credit and AF grant funds.



                                             14
56.      More critically, the Project suffered from overdue audits and uneven follow up to
audit recommendations. Some audit reports presented a disclaimer or qualified opinion
mainly due to limitation on scope because of substantial uncertainties found in the Project’s
financial statements and deficiencies in support documentation. This situation has resulted
in the identification of potential ineligible expenses totaling approximately US$ 1,300,000
(Audits 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013). The final determination of ineligible expenses will
be done once the results of the closing audit are available.

57.    The delays on the submission of the external audits posed a financial management
challenge with serious implications affecting the Country’s portfolio. Bank close
supervision was conducted to address these issues and many action plans agreed with
GRACCN were partially met. In the final implementation period, financial staff from
MHCP helped GRACCN in compiling the documentation required for supervision and
external audits.

58.     Procurement. The management of procurement processes at project closing was
rated Moderate Unsatisfactory, due principally to lack of capacity in contract management.
The ex-post Procurement Review Reports and the aide memoires of different supervision
missions included recommendations that helped improve the management of procurement
processes, especially in: (i) procurement planning, (ii) preparation of bidding documents,
and (iii) evaluation practices. Although the Procurement Unit in GRACCN received
substantial training and support from the Bank, it could not maintain adequate capacity
throughout project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

59.      Due to the Project’s emergency recovery nature, no follow-up operation was
planned. Since several churches, community centers, and small health centers were left
unfinished, the GoN has committed to allocate funding to complete them. At Project
closing, updating of the designs for these social infrastructure works was completed but no
budget has yet been allocated. With respect to operation and maintenance (O&M), the
churches and community centers that were finalized were formally transferred to traditional
territorial and communal authorities. Religious authorities in the community that benefited
from the construction of churches confirmed their commitment to ensure their maintenance
with support from community members. At the same time, people who benefitted from the
community centers have organized maintenance committees led by their traditional
authorities. Finally, GRACCN informed the Bank about the plan to of balance the
Revolving Fund debt portfolio through a debt recovery strategy, bringing it to sustainable
levels that would allow an improved operation with a potential to increase the beneficiary
base.




                                             15
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

60.    The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains relevant and is consistent
with the current Country Partnership Strategy (FY2013-2017) and National Human
Development Plan (2012-2026). Communities in the region remain poor and vulnerable
to disasters, while the Government continues its support for RACCN’s sustainable
development. While progress has been achieved, several challenges remain to be addressed
for enhancing Project impact and ensuring sustainability of results (see Section 2.2).

61.      Project design is consistent with the PDO, but its current relevance is considered
modest given that design weaknesses make its applicability unadvisable in any new
emergency recovery operation in the country. Specifically, the Project’s implementation
strategy and arrangements, as well as the overambitious design of the fisheries and
institutional strengthening components, would have a very modest relevance for promoting
sustainable emergency recovery. On the other hand, some aspects of Project design remain
relevant, including the focus on building back better while ensuring that the culture and
traditions of the affected communities are taken into consideration in the design of housing
and social infrastructure, and in general in all project activities.

62.      Project implementation allowed the Project to remain relevant, even if in an
overall modest level. Project design was flexible, allowing for adjustments regarding
institutional strengthening and engagement of local communities in the decision-making
process. These adjustments include, for example, the establishment of a specialized
implementation team and the preparation of a communication and community engagement
strategy. Moreover, for the first time, a sustained effort was carried out to improve
GRACCN’s governance, planning, financial management, human resource management,
procurement, and monitoring and evaluation capacities. Despite the serious challenges
faced at the coordination level, and high rotation of personnel that jeopardized the
sustainability of Project activities, GRACCN and other regional agencies are overall better
prepared, or at least have to some extent learned to implement externally funded projects.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

63.    The PDO was not fully achieved, although some activities were completed with
some level of success. The achievement of the PDO, which was to support the sustainable
recovery of the communities affected by Hurricane Felix in RACCN, can be analyzed
through three main outcomes:

Ensuring timely restoration of basic social and economic life in the affected communities
through implementation of early rehabilitation and recovery activities (Partially
Achieved)

64.     The Project contributed to the restoration of basic social and economic life in the
affected communities, but implementation delays limited the achievement of some results
and reduced the impact of early rehabilitation and recovery activities. This situation is
evidenced by:


                                            16
        The immediate emergency recovery activities (under Component 1) benefited more
         than 4,200 families (which surpassed the Project’s target) through rehabilitation
         of roofs, but such rehabilitation was completed after substantial delays that kept
         many families living in difficult conditions for a prolonged period after the disaster.

        Inputs and seeds were distributed along with technical assistance that helped
         rehabilitate 1,000 family gardens and small farms, meeting the Project’s target.
         Moreover, these inputs and seeds were distributed on time for the planting season,
         thus helping promote food security and likely, albeit in a limited scale, the overall
         local agriculture sector.

        Finally, SINAPRED distributed materials financed by the Project directly related
         to Hurricane Felix’s relief and early disaster rehabilitation efforts, which helped
         communities cope with the initial aftermath of the hurricane. Surveys indicate that
         beneficiaries considered this initial support satisfactory.

Rehabilitating and improving the productive capacity and sustainability of the small-
scale fishery sector – the primary source of income of the affected coastal communities
(Partially Achieved)

65.     The Project helped, although in a more limited way than originally expected,
rehabilitate the productive capacity and sustainability of the small-scale fisheries. This is
evident through some key results such as:

        Income of fishermen and women participating in the Project was to some extent
         restored or improved. Project Evaluation results showed improvements in the
         livelihoods of the revolving fund’s beneficiaries. According to a December 2014
         survey, income of pikineras9 and fisher folk compared to baseline income estimated
         before the Hurricane increased by 19.6 percent (very close to the Project’s target of
         20 percent for this indicator).10 However, previous surveys show that income varies
         due to the fisheries sector’s cyclical nature, market prices, and limited access to
         credit.

        A 15 percent increase in sustainable fish production was estimated through the
         2014 final survey of the revolving fund’s beneficiaries, which indicates that the
         Project’s target for this indicator was met. This figure is similar to INPESCA’s
         estimates for Nicaragua’s North Caribbean Region during the same period.
         Although this result shows the achievement of the revised target, it should be noted
         that its impact is limited given significant reductions in the final number of boats
         provided under the Project and other changes to the fisheries component – including


9 Pikineras are women who work in the region buying and trading lobsters from the divers, among other economic
activities related to the fisheries sector.
10 The baseline was established based on the 2010 FAO assessment of Nicaragua’s small-scale fisheries sector socio-

economic indicators referenced in the Government’s Project Final Evaluation.


                                                         17
       the decision of not rehabilitating the fish processing plant and shipyard due to the
       economic unfeasibility of the investment. On the other hand, specific training in
       first aid, survival in open sea, basic navigation skills, fishing techniques, on-board
       fish handling, and boat maintenance was provided to 160 fisher folk.

      Women benefited from boats and fishing equipment and supplies under the Project,
       albeit not at the level expected. In spite of the partial achievement of this indicator
       (which was expected to be in general 40 percent), women in the region received
       outboard motors (24 percent of total), fishing supplies (30 percent of total) and
       lobster traps or nasas (18 percent of total). In addition, a specific microcredit line
       was established under the Revolving Fund to support the economic activities of
       pikineras. Moreover, 108 pikineras received training in business administration,
       marketing, and seafood conservation and processing.

      Finally, the establishment of the revolving fund, seen as a key mechanism for the
       recovery of the small fisheries sector, suffered delays and faces sustainability
       issues. As a direct result of the revolving fund, a total of 108 pikineras benefited
       from seed capital and 30 fisher folk, including women, were beneficiaries of in-
       kind credit (boats and fishing equipment). Overall, however, Project results were
       limited by the lack of adequate management of the Revolving Fund, as evidenced
       by delays in delivering boats to beneficiaries in satisfactory operational conditions,
       and in providing technical assistance for boat engine operation and maintenance,
       coupled with weak debt portfolio administration leading to poor recovery rates.
       Under these circumstances, the Government decided to cancel more than 60 percent
       of the resources allocated for the revolving fund in its request for partial
       cancellation of Credit funds of December 2013.

Supporting the reconstruction of housing and social infrastructure such as community
centers, community churches, and small health clinics (Not achieved)

66.     The Project had very limited results related to reconstruction of housing and social
infrastructure. This is evident through the following:

      At least 5,000 families were living in houses rehabilitated or reconstructed to safer
       standards under the Project. The target set for this indicator was surpassed by 27
       percent, although with substantial delays. Specifically, 3,985 roofs were
       rehabilitated and 215 new houses were built, for a total conservative estimate of at
       least 5,000 families benefited through the Project (assuming 1.6 families per
       house). On a positive note, beneficiaries of selected affected communities
       participated in the construction of their own houses, and thus received training in
       building techniques, safety, and risk mitigation.

      Only 10 communities of the planned 40 communities, were given access to safer
       buildings for emergency shelter through the Project. The limited achievement of
       this indicator reflects the lack of completion of social infrastructure works. In the
       end, only 4 social infrastructure works out of 21 planned were completed,


                                             18
          benefiting only 10 communities. A total of 5 works were cancelled and 12 works
          remained unfinished by the Project’s closing date. In addition, four of these
          unfinished works will have to be demolished and re-started due to technical
          deficiencies. The GoN informed that additional funding from other sources would
          be available to carry out the pending construction.

3.3 Efficiency

67.      Overall economic efficiency is considered low. Since the Project was prepared
under OP/BP 8.0, an economic analysis was not required at appraisal. In any case, economic
analyses of the Project were not feasible until studies for key investments had been completed.11
However, a cost/benefit analysis, detailed in Annex 3, was conducted for the final Project
evaluation. The flow of benefits was estimated as (i) the avoided damage cost, meaning the
costs of damages that are now prevented by the works completed under the Project, and
(ii) social resilience activities from the various subcomponents, as well as other collateral
benefits derived from them.

68.     The results obtained as outputs from the model designed show that all the
subcomponents analyzed have positive NPV values, although modest in quantity. The
Revolving Fund and the four partially built social facilities had negative values and no IRR
results. Although the analysis did not calculate an overall IRR (given that some social
infrastructure works were not concluded), an IRR of 34.54% was obtained when only
considering those subcomponents with positive results

69.     In addition, Project delays and initial technical deficiencies in some of the works
likely impacted final costs and adversely affected efficiency.12 In particular, it should be
considered that none of the unfinished works are providing benefits to the communities.
Moreover, four of these unfinished works will have to be demolished and work restarted.
Critically, if the construction of the remaining 8 works is not restarted soon, their exposed
structures will deteriorate to the point that they will also have to be demolished. Finally,
specific results from the ex post economic analysis for the revolving fund, under current
circumstances, are negative.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

70.     As detailed above, the PDO remains relevant but design and implementation’s
relevance is modest. Overall, the PDO was not achieved. Some key indicators were
achieved, although several of them with a high sustainability risk. Shortcomings mostly in
project management and institutional coordination jeopardized Project implementation and


11
    For the fish processing plant, shipyard and community store, a legal covenant was included in the Financing
Agreement that established that financing for these investments would only be provided if their economic feasibility was
confirmed through a sound analysis. Since such feasibility was not confirmed, these investments were cancelled from the
Project.
12 For example, the square meter of wooden houses cost 25 percent more than originally estimated. In the case of churches

and community centers, the square meter cost approximately twice as much as originally estimated.


                                                          19
prevented the construction of safer social infrastructure doubling as emergency shelter. In
addition, construction delays requiring closing date extensions, paired with weak
ownership and management of the revolving fund (with low credit recovery rates and hence
low sustainability) contribute to a low economic efficiency. Thus, overall outcome rating
is considered Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71.      Damage and loss assessments indicate that disasters tend to affect the poor
disproportionately due to their social and physical vulnerability. Consequently, post-
disaster recovery time and costs for the poor also tend to be relatively higher than for the
better off. In this respect, although not expressly considered in the PDO, the Project had an
impact by helping to increase the resilience of poor communities in highly vulnerable
targeted areas of one of the poorest regions in Nicaragua, thus providing the difficult-to-
estimate benefit of avoiding increased poverty levels after disasters. The Project also
helped strengthening the social capital of these communities by supporting participatory
decision-making processes of reconstruction works. This social capital is also reflected in
communities’ engagement in the activities to restore, and potentially improve, their
socioeconomic conditions after the disaster. More broadly, Project implementation
facilitated the recognition by the national government of regional governments and
indigenous communities as viable partners for disaster risk management.

72.     Gender equity was mainstreamed into Project design by promoting women’s
participation and access to information, targeting women under certain activities, and
collecting key gender disaggregated data for M&E. According to interviews in selected
communities, female beneficiaries were generally satisfied with their engagement in
project activities. This is an important result since women tend to have more limited
literacy levels and time availability to participate in meetings due to socially and culturally
assigned gender roles. Women also benefited directly from credits and training. A total of
55 percent of training beneficiaries were women; in addition, they were recipients of 96
percent of micro-credits, 24 percent of outboard motors, 30 percent of fishing supplies, and
18 percent of improved lobster traps (nasas).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.     GRACCN and other government related project implementation personnel were
beneficiaries of capacity building. By Project closing, the staff at GRACCN and former
staff currently working in other local government agencies and private sector in Bilwi have
strengthened capacity to perform fiduciary responsibilities, planning, and monitoring and
evaluation. Moreover, the Project provided a learning mechanism for collaboration
between the GoN and GRACCN for training personnel in the use for the first time of
national administration information systems,13 including data management, procurement
and management.


13   Information management systems: SIGFA, SIGFAPRO, SISCAE, SEPA and Client Connection


                                                     20
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

74.    The procurement processes carried out by the Project have supported indirectly the
development of a local market for suppliers, construction companies and consulting firms.
Compliance of documentation and transparency required by the Bank’s procurement
guidelines have exposed local bidders to a higher quality level of proposal submissions,
which can set a trend for other procurement processes carried out by GRACCN. In addition,
the publication of calls for proposals in international sites opened up these processes to
more bidders and therefore provided a better base for selection.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

75.    In February 2015, representatives of governmental agencies directly involved with
the project implementation were interviewed for firsthand views on the Project’s results
and impact. During the same month, additional input was sought during a stakeholder
workshop involving the Bank, GRACCN and GoN representatives. Please refer to Annex
6 for main findings and commentary.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
76.    Overall risk for Project Development Outcome is rated high. In addition to the
overall disaster vulnerability of the region, difficulties related to enduring capacity
weaknesses in GRACCN, social and political factors, and physical conditions and isolation
of beneficiary communities, will continue at varying degrees after Project closing.
Development outcome faces several internal risks, including:

77.     Institutional coordination. Limitations on the institutional structure for
coordination among national agencies and GRACCN need to be better addressed in order
to effectively advance with an adequate implementation of the regional development
strategy, both operationally and technically.

78.     Sustaining technical capacities at the local level. Staff turnover after government
changes challenge the effectiveness of the investment in capacity building, inter alia
training and updating fiduciary management and risk reduction. This requires keeping up
the strategic relevance of recruiting and maintaining qualified technical staff to further
strengthen GRACCN’s capacity.

79.    Securing adequate funding for DRM. Fiscal constraints associated with a
progressive reduction of international aid funds for emergency recovery and rehabilitation
make more urgent the need for developing a risk financing strategy to secure resources to
address emergencies, as well as to strengthen DRM investments in the country. In the
Caribbean coast, such investments include mitigation works, and establishing of a hydro-
meteorological network and of a community-based early warning system.




                                            21
80.     Completion of Project activities. At Project closing, several challenges remained to
be addressed for enhancing Project impact and ensuring sustainability of results: (a)
Continuity of the Revolving Fund, particularly the need to improve the loan recovery rate
(currently with delays of 90 days for credits to pikineras, and 294 days for boats
beneficiaries, placing a serious sustainability risk) by, inter alia, increasing BP staff for
administration and debt collection in the region, and helping beneficiaries of the credits for
boats to repair their defective engines and obtaining spare parts; and (b) prompt completion
of unfinished civil works cancelled before Project closing so that their exposed structures
do not deteriorate to a point that they are no longer technically sound.

81.     There are also several external risks related to the country’s growing disaster
vulnerability and the magnitude of DRM challenges, and the difficult business environment
of the region.

82.     Regional disaster vulnerability. Although SINAPRED has been strengthened with
the creation of numerous community-level hazard and risk management organizations, and
the identification, prioritization and implementation of various risk mitigation and
emergency response activities throughout the country, it is not clear that GRACCN has
either benefited from or developed its own disaster response capacity. Environmental
degradation and the vulnerability of communities living in high-risk locations could
overwhelm the impacts of the Project’s mitigation investments.

83.    Business development in an extremely vulnerable region. Efforts to foster any type
of sustainable businesses, including fishing operations, always represents an enormous
challenge in places with a myriad of limitations like RACCN. In this environment, any
economic endeavor will face high transaction costs, price volatility, lack of skilled labor
and other unexpected factors that constitute major impediments in the local economy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
84.     The ICR rating is based on the fact that although Project design responded
adequately to the Borrower’s objectives, especially the request to make GRACCN the main
implementing agency in order to foster regional autonomy, it had shortcomings that were
not addressed during preparation. It must be recognized that the Bank provided a quick
response by preparing the Project in four months, which limited the ability to carry out in
depth institutional and operational analyses. There were also inherent risks due to regional
socio-political conditions and the remote and widespread locations of the affected
communities. It is positive that Project design reflects the close collaboration between the
Bank and the Borrower and the relevance of the Project to both parties. Project design also
includes, for the most part, reasonable targets under a context of post-disaster uncertainty.
However, project design was overly optimistic with respect to the speed with which SE-
SINAPRED would recover its implementation capacity to ensure readiness of GRACCN.
The Bank could have helped identify a more effective strategy to ensure quality at entry



                                             22
once it became evident that SE-SINAPRED had lost its capacity to support GRACCN to
get ready for project implementation, and that the PPF would not help in ensuring readiness
for implementation. Moreover, although the PDO was well focused, some of the specific
components’ objectives and activities were overly ambitious.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
85.     The Project was intensively supervised, as reflected in the 21 missions that were
conducted and the resources allocated.14 Moreover, supervision was co-located with part
of the team following up directly from the Country Office. As such, the ICR rating
recognizes that in general supervision missions were timely and solution oriented, that
there was a Mid-term Review that resulted in effective decisions and agreements (through
Project restructuring), and that several critical issues affecting Project implementation were
adequately handled, including by, among other things, bringing in additional expertise
through the Bank agreement with FAO and trust fund resources. Procurement and financial
management were also well supervised, though fiduciary challenges remained throughout
implementation. Safeguards supervision was also adequately conducted and no negative
social or environmental impacts were identified as a result of Project activities. The Bank
should have, however, followed up closer on the weak inter-institutional coordination and
the sustainability of the revolving fund, as well as ensuring sooner the internal coordination
of the Bank’s advice during one of the most critical periods of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderate Unsatisfactory
86.     Bank performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory considering that ratings for
quality at entry and supervision are both considered to be moderately unsatisfactory. There
were shortcomings supervising the Project implementation and securing implementing
agencies’ performance that prevented the achievement of better outcomes, even though
some key indicators were achieved.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
87.     The ICR rating recognizes the priority given by the Government to the Project in
light of the socio-economic conditions of the region and communities affected by the
hurricane. It also recognizes the objective of promoting regional autonomy and
participation of the affected communities. Despite the Government’s commitment to PDO
achievement, however, its performance had some shortcomings considering the uneven
support provided to GRACCN, especially at critical times and despite commitments
included in signed Aide Memoirs. Given the unconsolidated institutional framework for
emergency activities at the regional level and the inter-sectoral nature of the Project,
coordination and implementation issues were bound to arise, but more effort from the


14 It should be noted that not all missions were registered in the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) since

some of them were considered technical or fiduciary follow up missions.


                                                          23
central level should have been made to address these. Although the priority given to the
Project by the Government facilitated resolution of some critical constraints, delays due to
limited implementation capacity and personnel changes jeopardized outcomes.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

88.    The overall unsatisfactory rating considers the different performance levels of the
two agencies that were responsible for project implementation, namely, SE-SINAPRED
and GRACCN. The specific performances of each implementation agency are discussed
below.

89.      SE-SINAPRED performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. After initial
delays, SE-SINAPRED performance faced continued shortcomings, including: (a)
inadequate attention to implementation issues that led to delays of some key activities
needed for immediate emergency recovery of the affected communities, which resulted in
a protracted completion of Component 1 of more than two years; and (b) weak inter-
institutional coordination with GRACCN.

90.     GRACCN performance is rated as unsatisfactory. Despite the commitment of the
Regional Government throughout implementation, uneven performance levels of the
various components under its responsibility jeopardized Project outcomes. In the initial
stage (up to one year after the effectiveness) GRACCN did not perform as expected in part
due to complex institutional arrangements that led to a lack of Project leadership and slow
decision making. In the intermediate phase of the Project (from 2011 to 2012 Project
restructuring), with a greater stability in terms of personnel turnover and renewed
commitment from the GoN, the project experienced an improvement of its implementation
pace and performance. Nevertheless, management and institutional coordination
shortcomings prevented the timely delivery of outputs and completion of activities
according to the original implementation plan. In its final phase, a series of restructurings
were needed to extend the Project closing date and meet some legal commitments under
the Financing Agreement. In the end, all these efforts did not ensure the delivery of several
social infrastructure works to affected communities and the sustainability of the Revolving
Fund.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
91.     Borrower performance is rated as unsatisfactory considering a combination of the
ratings of moderately satisfactory for Government performance and unsatisfactory for
implementing agencies. There were shortcomings in implementing agencies’ performance
that were not fully overcome, even though some of the Project outcomes were achieved.

6. Lessons Learned

92.     The design of emergency recovery operations should be relatively simple,
flexible, and focused on sustainable activities directly related to the recovery, while



                                             24
also reflecting the priorities of the affected communities. The recovery program for
RACCN reflected the regional priorities and was developed with broad consultation of the
communities, including women, elderly and other vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, Project
experience shows that considering longer-term development goals beyond the emergency
recovery needs, even if justifiably prioritized by the government and affected communities,
can make Project design more complex and implementation more challenging. While in
high capacity contexts emergency operations may include rebuilding medium-term
productive capacity, in low capacity contexts such as the North Caribbean Coast of
Nicaragua emergency operations should focus on emergency recovery needs. Therefore, a
thorough analysis of implementation capacity, prioritization of recovery activities, and
setting of realistic emergency recovery goals are of outmost importance to effectively
restore livelihoods in a sustainable manner.

93.      Implementation arrangements for emergency operations should be
straightforward and pragmatic, even if attempting to be responsive to national
decentralization efforts and special geopolitical conditions. Certainly, the Project
provided a unique opportunity for the regional government to take the lead in the recovery
process, while also strengthening its capacity for implementing future projects and taking
charge of development efforts. Nevertheless, while the involvement of the relevant sub-
national government is necessary, in an emergency recovery operation it is important to
secure the participation of an experienced implementing agency that can effectively lead
overall implementation, minimizing risks of weak management and implementation delays
due to poor technical and operational capacity. An emergency operation is not the most
adequate instrument for larger institutional development objectives, as evidenced by the
effects of the Project’s implementation arrangements. On the other hand, it is very
important to provide through project design and implementation the right mechanisms and
incentives for involvement of the local authorities and population of the affected areas. It
is also advisable to address implementation capacity weaknesses through practical options
such as short-term secondment of experienced staff from well-performing project
implementation units and well-focused provision of specialized external expertise (through
consultants or government staff).

94.     In countries or areas prone to disasters, emergency recovery operations should
strive to mainstream disaster mitigation in a socially and culturally responsive
manner. The Project focused on rebuilding safer communities, with houses and buildings
rehabilitated or reconstructed with improved construction standards that considered
disaster risk mitigation and traditional designs and social organization. Accordingly, an
emergency project can be a vehicle to apply lessons learned on promoting resilience to
disasters, and preparedness and risk mitigation through non-structural measures such as
evacuation plans, shelter planning, etc. Moreover, Project design should take into account
livelihood patterns and the needs of widows and single female-headed households in
activities such as housing reconstruction requiring direct labor contribution of beneficiaries.

95.    In emergency operations monitoring and evaluation are key to ensure the
achievement of goals set in the recovery plan. Project design adequately considered
socio-economic variables as part of the key outcome indicators, complementing the focus



                                             25
on reconstruction and rehabilitation indicators typically used in emergency operations. The
introduction of socio-economic variables is key for a comprehensive recovery, however
this requires an additional effort and resources to ensure that related activities are fully
completed and evaluated. While this effort under the Project represented an opportunity to
address development issues through the restoration of livelihoods in a more inclusive way,
basic challenges of monitoring and evaluating social and economic outcomes remained.
Lack of reliable information to establish baselines (given that previous historical data was
not available) coupled with a lack of proper survey design and database administration and
updating proved to be challenges that overwhelmed the Project implementation team.
Future emergency operations should not only ensure monitoring and evaluation guidelines
and training for the implementing agency, but should also focus on mainstreaming M&E
into the day-to-day project administration, particularly when socio-economic outcomes are
part of the results matrix.

96.      Technical criteria should guide the establishment and operation of financial
mechanisms for reactivation of economic activity. While the establishment of a
revolving fund for restoring and improving the economic conditions in the small-scale
fisheries sector seems appropriate initially, given the local socio-economic conditions, its
implementation proved to be of a high complexity. In light of the Project’s revolving fund’s
administration problems, key considerations to be taken into account in future operations
include: (i) provide incentives and mechanisms to promote a credit culture in the target
area (in RACCN, for example, few beneficiaries understand that a loan entails legal
obligations and is not a government handout); (ii) establish clear and expeditious
processing of in-kind credits (in the case of the Project, purchase and delivery of capital
goods, such as boats, became entangled in protracted bureaucratic processes); and (iii) set
up an efficient collection system that facilitates payment by minimizing the distance that
beneficiaries should travel to honor their credit, along with a mechanism to sanction
delinquent beneficiaries (under the Project, beneficiaries needed to go to the only regional
branch of BP, often having to travel long distances even by boat). In brief, establishment
of a credit line or revolving fund should be conducted through a consolidated financial
institution with a track record of providing sustainable micro-finance services and
knowledge of the target beneficiaries / clients. On the other hand, as experience from other
emergency operations indicate, provision of grants for fisher folk could have provided
faster results and more sustainable impacts, although it may not be directly compatible with
the medium-term goal of establishing a sustainable mechanism to provide funds to an often
overlooked sector such as the small scale fisheries sector.

97.     Reactivation of small-scale fisheries and related commercial activities does not
finish when in-kind/financial credits are provided to the beneficiaries. GRACCN
conducted broad-based consultations with fisher folk to determine the characteristics of
fishing gear and boats that later were validated by the National Fisheries Agency
(INPESCA), in order to secure the best technically and culturally sound solution for the
beneficiaries. However, in spite of a promising start, impact of the activity was jeopardized
by delays in the procurement and delivery of fishing equipment, particularly boats, along
with the lack of insurance and engine spare parts in the local market for the boats. Moreover,
lower education levels, constraints to adaptation to new technologies and lack of proper



                                             26
training for the use of new boat engines resulted in a great number of vessels with broken
motors unable to operate. On the financial credit provided to women, the lack of follow up
to beneficiaries led in some cases to the use of loan funds in unprofitable, high-risk or
miscalculated investments setting back some of the gains obtained by the affected
beneficiaries. Overall, the absence of a close follow up and continuous assessments to
identify corrective measures adversely affected sustainability. Similar future operations
should thus consider these elements as part of a comprehensive strategy.

98.    It is important that both the Government and the Bank continue to learn from
project design and implementation in the Caribbean region, given its particular socio-
economic and political context and development challenges. It is advisable to carry out
a review of projects that had components or were fully aimed at the Caribbean region, in
order to consolidate knowledge and lessons learned. Addressing the dual challenge of
building institutional capacity at the regional and territorial level, while ensuring smooth
implementation of projects and programs, will benefit from such a review.

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

99.     The Borrower and implementing agencies confirmed their overall agreement with
the ICR. However, the Borrower noted that the ICR should reconsider the assessment of
the central government and in particular MHCP (as representative of the Borrower) in
paragraphs 36, 44 and 45. 15 Upon careful consideration, where possible, Government
comments have been taken into account and language adjusted accordingly.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support the sustainable recovery of the
communities affected by Hurricane Felix in the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous
Region of Nicaragua.

The PDO was to be achieved through (i) ensuring timely restoration of basic social and
economic life in the affected communities through implementation of early rehabilitation
and recovery activities; (ii) rehabilitating and improving the productive capacity and
sustainability of the small-scale fisheries sector – the primary source of income of the
affected coastal communities; and (iii) supporting the reconstruction of housing and social
infrastructure such as community centers and community churches, and small health clinics.

Component 1 - Early Recovery

The objective of this component was to ensure timely implementation of critical
rehabilitation and recovery activities, as well as readiness of the Government of the North
Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (GRACCN) to start project implementation. This
component was financed through the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), and activities
under this component that were not completed by the time of Credit effectiveness continued
to be implemented by GRACCN.

This component was completed in August 2012, and financed critical rehabilitation and
recovery activities such as provision of early reconstruction materials, housing
rehabilitation for approximately 4,200 families, restoration of family gardens, and fishing
gear. The Executive Secretariat of the National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation
and Response (SE-SINAPRED) was responsible for the implementation of this component
in coordination with GRACCN. Key institutions involved in implementation were Rural


                                             30
and Urban National Housing Institute (INVUR), Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure
(MTI), Nicaraguan Institute for the Fisheries Sector (INPESCA), Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry (MAGFOR), and National Forestry Institute (INAFOR). The total cost of
activities assigned for this component was US$5.0 million (29.4% of the total budget).
Accordingly, the component included the following specific sub-components:

       1.1 Provision of Early Reconstruction Materials
       1.2 Institutional Strengthening and Rehabilitation

1.1 Provision of Early Reconstruction Materials. This sub-component provided retroactive
financing for a total of US$ 2 million on October 31, 2008 to SE-SINAPRED for materials
and operating costs directly related to Hurricane Felix’s relief and early disaster
rehabilitation efforts. These included, inter alia, (i) gas and gasoline (land vehicles and
airplanes) used for transportation of materials; and (ii) construction materials used for the
rehabilitation of houses and buildings.

1.2 Institutional Strengthening and Rehabilitation. This sub-component provided funding
for relief of the most affected families. Activities under this sub-component included:

Institutional strengthening of GRACNN. This activity included (a) financing of capacity
building and technical support to the regional government to be ready for project
implementation; (b) Project preparation, including carrying out of (i) the social and
environmental assessments required for the Project in line with the applicable Bank
safeguards, and preparation of related project management manuals such as the Project
Implementation Plan (PIP), Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and the Operations
Manual; and (ii) workshops to disseminate information (particularly during initial
activities) and continue consulting target communities about the Project. .

The Damage and Needs Assessment Report (EDAN) prepared by SINAPRED provided an
initial list of beneficiaries, which was validated by communities, through a participatory
mechanism that considered social inclusion, gender, and eligibility criterion.
Environmental and social assessments required by Bank’s safeguard policies were carried
out with the support of MAGFOR, INPESCA and INVUR; likewise operation manuals
were prepared with the support of SE-SINAPRED.

Support to the Executive Secretariat of SINAPRED for the implementation of the PPF. This
activity financed consultants, software, equipment and operational costs that enabled SE-
SINAPRED to administer the PPF and help prepare GRACCN for project implementation.

Rehabilitation of housing. The rehabilitation of roofs was carried out with the technical
assistance of INVUR and MTI benefiting 4,200 families. Works were carried out by
community members and supervised by technical personnel; this approach allowed the
development of new skills for construction and maintenance while also creating a
temporary source of income. Civil works supervision committees composed by
communities’ traditional social structures and local government representatives were
established as part of the community participation strategy. Construction guides in local



                                             31
languages (Miskitu and Mayangna) explaining the self-building process with improved
design and construction standards were distributed to beneficiary communities.

Early rehabilitation of agriculture sector. GRACCN, assisted by MAGFOR, distributed
inputs and seeds and provided technical assistance to help rehabilitate 1,000 family gardens
and small farms, thereby also promoting food security. The seeds distributed included
traditional crops affected by the disaster such as plantain, yucca, malanga, ayote and
quiquisque, among others.

The activities for early rehabilitation of small-scale fisheries (artisanal) consisted of
providing 50 outboard motors (40 and 25 HP) to 15 women with any activity related to
seafood and 35 artisanal low incomes fishermen in order to provide a quick and effective
restoration of their working capabilities. The list of beneficiaries was provided by the
INPESCA and ratified by the GRAAN.

Component 2 - Strengthening of Small-Scale Fisheries Sector

The objective of this component was to help restore and improve the socioeconomic
conditions of the men and women engaged in the small-scale fisheries sector. This
component, implemented by GRACCN with technical support from INPESCA, National
Technological Institute (INATEC) and Banco Produzcamos (BP), focused on 19 coastal
communities affected by the disaster for which fishing is the main income source. In
addition to training and provision of fishing equipment, this component included the
establishment of a revolving fund to provide credit to affected fisher folk.

The component is based on a sector-specific recovery strategy prepared by INPESCA in
consultation with Rural Credit Fund (FCR), the regional and local governments, and
affected communities. The total cost of activities assigned for this component was US$6.3
million (37.0% of the total budget). Accordingly, it included the following sub-
components:

       2.1 Rehabilitation of Small Scale Fisheries Sector
       2.2 Rehabilitation of Fish Processing Plant
       2.3 Reconstruction of Small Infrastructure

2.1 Rehabilitation of Small Scale Fisheries Sector. This sub-component aimed to restore,
and potentially improve, the incomes of men and women engaged in the small-scale
fisheries sector. Activities under this sub-component included:


                                            32
Establishment of Revolving Fund. The establishment of a revolving fund to continue
offering credit to the sector in the future was one of the main objectives of this sub-
component. The fund, originally to be administered by FCR, was transferred to the state-
owned BP. Beneficiaries organized in cooperatives, community associations, and small
family enterprises, had access to credit for buying boats, and working capital to re-start
their fishing activities in a more efficient and sustainable way.

Once targets were revised and adjusted based on cost increase and feasibility studies for
repayment, 30 small fishing boats (approximately 8.53 meters in length, with diesel-
powered engines, ice container, and navigation/communication equipment) were financed.
Technical specifications were prepared with the support of INPESCA. The vessels were
delivered with fishing equipment and initial operating capital for a total of US$ 1.3 million.

The Revolving Fund had two operational committees, the (i) Coordination Committee,
composed by GRACCN, MAGFOR, MINSA, INPESCA, BP, SE-SINAPRED e INVUR,
responsible for selection of beneficiaries, and the (ii) Credit Committee, composed by
GRACCN, BP, INPESCA and two representatives from eligible beneficiaries (a man and
a woman). At Project closing, the Fund had placed US$ 328,125 in loans and recovered
US$ 281,754. Overall, US$ 150,000 was allocated to women (pikineras) and US$ 245,500
was provided as seed capital to beneficiaries of in-kind credit (boats and fishing equipment).
However, the credit portfolio has 161 delinquent loans (32% to fishermen and 68% to
pikineras) with 24% of them overdue, for a total of US$ 176,317.04.

Technical assistance and training. With support from INPESCA and INATEC,
beneficiaries in all 19 coastal communities received technical assistance and training. A
total of six workshops were carried out with the participation of 160 fishermen with
specific training in first-aid, survival in open sea, basic navigation skills, fishing techniques,
on-board fish handling, and boat maintenance. In addition, 108 women (pikineras) received
training in business administration, marketing, and seafood conservation and processing.

Restoration of fishing equipment and supplies (US$1.76 million). This activity sought to
ensure a basic level of rehabilitation through the provision of equipment and supplies (cast
nets, seines, thermos, traps, hand lines) to 2,187 women and men belonging to families
engaged in artisanal fishing but who were not creditworthy. Potential beneficiaries were
initially identified by INPESCA (on the basis of EDAN), with the final list of beneficiaries
having been agreed upon by the communities.

2.2 Rehabilitation of Fish Processing Plant and Related Facilities. Under this sub-
component, the Project aimed to help restore income generation opportunities for women,
and improve the productivity of the fisheries sector and the local economy. Activities
originally planned included civil works to rehabilitate the structures and working areas;
restitution of equipment for the Lamlaya Processing Plant, the associated shipyard, and the
small community store; and the provision of initial operating capital. However, studies
carried out indicated that this activity was not economically feasible, and was therefore
cancelled. Funding for this activity was reallocated to the purchase of boats and credit for



                                               33
women (pikineras) under the Revolving Fund.

2.3 Reconstruction of Small Infrastructure. Under this sub-component, the Project aimed
to help rehabilitate or reconstruct several community landing docks and small piers
affected by the disaster, and that are critical to the small scale fisheries sector in RACCN
in general and to the 19 most affected coastal communities in particular. The Project also
aimed to finance any necessary engineering designs, environmental studies, and technical
supervision. However, this activity was cancelled due to delays in implementing
procurement processes to contract studies for civil works, which led the communities to
seek alternative sources of funding for the works (mainly from the regional government).
Planned funds were reallocated to the purchase of boats.

Component 3 – Reconstruction of Housing and Social Infrastructure

This component aimed to reestablish the social and economic environment of affected
communities by providing safer and culturally responsive housing and social infrastructure,
including reconstruction of community centers, churches, and small health clinics that
double as shelters. This component was implemented by GRACCN with support from
INVUR, technical assistance from FISE and MTI, and in coordination with the local
governments. The total cost of activities assigned to this component was US$5.4 million
(31.8% of the total budget). It included the following sub-components:

       3.1 Reconstruction of Housing
       3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure




                                             34
3.1 Reconstruction of Housing. Under this sub-component, the Project planned to benefit
approximately 3,500 people in selected affected communities through the construction of
houses, and training in building techniques, safety, and risk prevention.

During implementation, the original target of 500 wood houses was reduced to 361 houses
made of wood and bamboo. Finally, only 262 houses were built (202 wood and 60 bamboo).
The reconstruction of houses made of wood was carried out through a self-construction
system, contributing to a greater sense of inclusion, identity, and ownership. Competitively
selected contractors performed the construction of houses made of bamboo; technical
specifications were reviewed by INVUR, agreed with the community, and approved by the
GRACCN. The project promoted the use of wood from trees felled by the Hurricane and
the introduction of a new sustainable technology for homebuilding with bamboo.

The houses were formally delivered to each representative of the beneficiary families
through a legal document certifying property ownership. In addition, this legal document
also commits beneficiaries for a period of ten years to not to sell, exchange, donate, pawn,
or transfer the house to a different site.

3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure. This sub-component included the
reconstruction of community churches, community centers, and small health clinics. All
structures would be built to better standards and with adequate technical supervision.
Specifically, and given that local communities use churches and community centers as
emergency shelter, the sub-component included the reconstruction of 14 churches, 15
community centers, and 5 small health clinics. However, only 4 social infrastructures (2
community centers and 2 churches) out of the 16 contracted were finished (funded with Cr
4392).

However, disputes related to the siting of some of the civil works within the community,
paired with a variable seasonal window for construction activities caused implementation
delays. By the time the procurement of civil works started, the cost had almost doubled,
which led the Government to request an additional financing in June 2012, reestablishing
the original targets for this component.

The unfinished works include 4 small health clinics, 4 community centers, and 4 churches
in different selected communities; some of these unfinished works also present serious
technical issues.

Component 4 – Institutional Strengthening for Project Management, Coordination,
and Monitoring and Evaluation,

This component sought to ensure adequate capacity in GRACCN to implement the project,
and to lead regional development efforts in general. It aimed to fully integrate project
implementation in the organizational structure of the regional government instead of
establishing a separate Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The total cost of activities
assigned for this component was US$0.3 million (1.8% of the total budget). Nonetheless,
after an initial good implementation pace, performance of SE-SINAPRED faced
shortcomings due to changes in its personnel and operating structure. This situation in turn
affected the support provided to GRACCN and the implementation of activities related to
Component 1.

Throughout Project implementation, GRACCN displayed lack of institutional and
technical capacity for managing activities under an inter-institutional collaboration setting.
A series of factors contributed to delays in Project implementation, including: (i)
GRACCN’s lack of experience in managing external resources with highly demanding
technical requirements, including for fiduciary and administrative management; (ii)
GRACCN’s lack of leadership among Project institutional partners and stakeholders; and
(iii) annual operational plans focused on process management rather than results
achievement. This situation led to the establishment of a PIU within GRACCN, setting
back the original objective of this component.

The establishment of the PIU sought to facilitate GRACCN’s ownership of the Project
through improved managerial capacity and the ability to bring to a closure pending
activities; it also sought to improve the implementation pace and efficiency. However, the
PIU did not have the autonomy to move forward with Project implementation. In addition,
high personnel turnover and non-technically oriented decisions impacted negatively in
contract management, fiduciary reporting, and overall implementation.

Once the new Regional Government came into office in May 2014, the PIU was dissolved
and project activities integrated within the Government structure. However, due to the
Credit closing date and to delays in bidding processes, several activities, particularly from
Component 3, were dropped. In terms of outcomes, while the Regional Government
benefited for a period of time from training and institutional strengthening efforts, it
continues to have limited capacity for managing externally funded projects.

                                    Annex 3. Economic Analysis

      A. Introduction

A cost/benefit analysis was conducted as part of the final evaluation of the Project. Key
aspects were identified under each of the Project`s components that represent economic
and financial benefits to the communities, such as rehabilitation of damaged houses or
building of new ones, reconstruction of social infrastructure, and restoration of income of
fishing communities and other economic activities.

Selected sub-components analyzed include: housing rehabilitation, early rehabilitation of
fisheries sector by providing outboard motors and fishing gear and supplies, as well as the
rehabilitation of small scale fisheries sector by financing boats, fishing gear and working
capital (through the revolving fund), and reconstruction of housing and social infrastructure.

      B. Methodology

The flow of benefits was estimated as the avoided damage cost (i.e., the costs of damages
that are now preventable by the works completed under the project), and social resilience
activities under the various subcomponents. The flow is related to the damages observed
before intervention, equivalent to the “without” project scenario, and those expected to be
avoided with the rehabilitation and improvement works in the new “with” project scenario.

The specific methodology applied is based on cost/benefit analysis of the investments made
in each of the subcomponents, accounting for the number of direct and indirect
beneficiaries, damages and repairs done in affected houses, as well as construction of new
houses and social infrastructure, the negative effects on the livelihood of fishing villages,
and measures to restore social and economic activities and enhance social and economic
resilience. See tables 1 and 2 below.

Economic and financial costs and benefits were estimated according to each of the social
and economic activities carried out, i.e., equipment donations and revolving fund; and the
works and the type of solutions presented in the 3 categories studied: houses, churches, and
community centers.

Cost Estimates. Costs related to roof rehabilitation and timber contracts, 16 outboard
motors and fishing gear, and donated supplies were provided by GRACCN. Revolving
fund investment financial data was provided by GRACCN and Banco Produzcamos.
Finally, costs of reconstruction works, equipment and supplies, feasibility studies and

Benefits and Possible Avoided Losses. Estimated benefits, equivalent to damage costs
or possible losses avoided by works constructed, varied according to the type of works and
expected benefits from rehabilitated and newly built houses, churches and community
centers. Also, more benefits are expected from the revolving fund, which adds to the social
and economic resilience of the affected communities and beneficiaries, by providing
readily available funds, much needed when a disaster occurs.

Tangible and intangible benefits derived from the social and economic impacts of the
subcomponents and subprojects included: (a) reduction of damages to private and public
buildings, (b) reduction of days public buildings stayed closed due to hurricane and tropical
storm damages, (c) maintenance savings and value added, (d) reduction of fatalities and
injured people, (e) increase of employment due to less interruptions of the social and
economic activities, (f) reduction of social and economic vulnerability by ways of adequate
financial response, and (i) reduction of migration as a signal of improvement of the quality
of life (Charvériat 2000 revised17).

Quantifiable benefits resulting from improved conditions in buildings and houses, and in
the fishing and financial industry are provided for items (a), (c), (e), and (f) above, always
taking into consideration the “with” and “without” Project scenarios, and the resulting
impacts. The remaining items were considered as qualitative information, gathered through
personal interviews with administrative personnel from GRACCN, INPESCA and direct
beneficiaries.

Benefits from reduction of damages to public and private buildings are indicated by the
roof rehabilitation works and construction of new houses and social infrastructure, with
their corresponding values added, such as better designs and construction technology (for
instance, through the use of metal pieces attached to the roof structure, reinforced roof
structures in churches, among others).

These details are expected to allow for the newly constructed public buildings to fare better
than the old churches that did not withstand the brunt of Hurricane Felix (for example, the
roof blew off from the old Santa Martha church when it was being used as a shelter by the
community, according to beneficiaries and church personnel interviewed).

Construction works provided benefits such as less maintenance costs and value added, as
new housing and public buildings have improved design and are rendered less vulnerable
than the old structures. The amount of carpenters trained and hired for roof rehabilitation
was used as an indication of employment increases. These same trained carpenters later
kept on working in the target and other communities, according to beneficiaries
interviewed, thus creating a long term Project benefit. Another group of carpenters,
selected from the local labor force, was trained to enhance their construction and
maintenance skills to work in the construction of new houses and public buildings, in turn
increasing current and future job opportunities. In addition, timber cooperatives mostly run

employment and earnings for their members.

Furthermore, keeping fishing communities working by means of donating outboard motors
created an important impact on fishermen that kept their boats running, which in turn
employed in average up to 7 people per boat, including the direct beneficiaries.

Average yearly earnings were obtained from extrapolating 2007 figures from INPESCA’s
Project Report. 18 Also, a significant impact on the fisher folk labor resulted from the
donation of 9,000 lobster traps or nasas that allowed scuba divers to start adopting safer
fishing practices, reducing fatalities and injuries while increasing earnings in the process.
Average yearly benefits for this donation were investigated using the Hernandez, J.R. 2008
report19 for average yearly costs for all lobster nasas, and the Lee, R. 09/201320 report for
average industry income.

The creation of the revolving fund, despite its shortcomings, has been useful to an
underserved fisheries sector in remote locations, by providing most needed funds for
buying equipment and working capital, adding to the social and economic resilience of the
communities and individual beneficiaries. In this respect, financial indicators were
investigated from publication by banking sector regulators to determine possible earnings.
Other benefits derived from potential fishing income increases, once the new boats were
working, were estimated from the Hernandez report mentioned above.

Additionally, no relevant migration phenomena was mentioned by the beneficiaries
interviewed, indicating that social, economic and environmental conditions have improved
or at least have not deteriorated further since Project appraisal.

Data Sources and Estimates. The model created used selected variables and statistics,
including an annual average inflation of 8.614% during the 2005-2014 period. The same
was done for other key factors, such as the minimum wage average which was adjusted
considering a 9.254% average annual increase in the 2011-2015 period;21 exchange rates
used were the ones reported in the different reports used as sources.22

Financial sector average annual increase rates for income (-12.35%), costs (-3.15%), and
profit margins (-9.20%) were extracted from reports from the Nicaraguan Financial Sector
Regulator23 for the 2008-2014 period.

The discount rate for calculating NPV was 10%. The return period used for outboard
motors, lobster traps, boats and revolving fund was 15 years, which is equivalent to the

expected useful life of the financed boats; for lobster nasas, a replacement rotation period
of 2 years was also considered. .24

A return period of 15 years was also defined for all construction works, i.e. roof
rehabilitation, new wood and bamboo houses, community centers, and churches, based on
INVUR estimates for the roof repairs designs and references from similar works in the
Caribbean region.

NPV and IRR estimates for each of the activities and works were calculated in order to
define trends and results of the use of Project funds in general, and for each subcomponent
is particular. Data was subject to statistical and analytical rigor to provide for the most
accurate results possible.

Limitations of the Analysis. The results of the economic analysis are limited by several
factors: limited information about the total number of beneficiaries of the social
infrastructure projects, absence of information on the financial results of the lumber
cooperatives contracted under Project activities, lack of specific benefits from partially
built social infrastructure, and the potential demolition costs for unfinished social
infrastructure,25 among others.

     C. Analysis by Component

Component 1
1.2.c Rehabilitation of Housing; Roof Repairs
Employment benefits were accounted for by assuming that trained carpenters have stayed
in the job market, as stated by villagers interviewed, using the 2010 salary that these
workers earned under the Project, $2,440, indexed to 2014.26

Value added to the houses that benefited from roof rehabilitation was another aspect
considered, assuming that roof expenditures amounted to 24.1%27 of the cost of houses
designed by INVUR for Component 3. This would indicate that having a rehabilitated roof
should increase the value of an old house by this same quantity.

Assuming that rehabilitated houses in general were half the size of the new houses, or that
rehabilitation covered only half the roof of a house of the same size, then the $141.10
budget per house amounted to 3.88% of a $3,634 rehabilitated house. INVUR’s budget for
new wood houses valued the roof at 24.1% of the total house value. This would leave a
value gain of 20.22% over the old house price with the works done, equivalent to repaired
depreciation of $734.69.28

This value added includes beneficial externalities such as sturdier roof structures to help
withstand disasters better than the old houses. Maintenance costs associated with the
natural depreciation of the roof was in this case estimated as 6.67% annually, with an
assumed return period of 15 years.

1.2.e Early Rehabilitation of Fisheries Sector; Outboard Motors Donation
Total cost of US$ 156,750 for 50 outboard motors was revised to 2014 prices.29 Average
yearly earnings were calculated using INPESCA income figures, considering the motors
as being equivalent to 33% of a small size boat (8.53 m). Figures from the same INPESCA
report for a 10 HP motor were utilized to determine average operational costs, adding a
50% increase for fuel and oil expenses estimates to adjust for the larger motor units bought
by the project. Labor costs were estimated for one worker in charge of the motor
maintenance and operation.

1.2.e Early Rehabilitation of Fisheries Sector; Lobster Traps (nasas) Donation
Benefits were estimated by using average annual profit figures for the 9,000 donated
lobster traps or nasas, from the Lee, R. report mentioned above, indexed to 2014 prices.
Maintenance costs were considered as 50% of lobster trap price for one year, as they only
last 18 months to 2 years on average. Capturing costs were determined by extrapolating
figures for the most efficient vessel example from the Hernandez report, indexed to 2014
prices.

Component 2
2.1.a Establishment of Revolving Fund
Yearly financial income and costs were taken from 2014 figures for the revolving fund,
provided by Banco Produzcamos, discounted by means of yearly average financial income
and costs indicators for the Nicaraguan financial industry, according to the Nicaragua
Financial Sector Regulator mentioned above.

Calculated benefits included the revolving fund’s annual financial income, and the annual
income increases for 109 pikineras beneficiaries. On the cost side, annual financial costs
and preventive provision for credit risks were accounted for. Published financial
regulations establish that said provision must cover 100% or more of the unproductive
portfolios (as boat loans are considered).30

2.1.a Establishment of Revolving Fund; Boat Loans
With respect to the boat loans, boat expenditures were adjusted to 2014 prices; the same
was done for average income generated by fishing boats. In addition, a 25% increase was
added to average income, as figures were extracted from the Hernandez report for a smaller
boat sample. In a similar fashion, average operational cost estimates were increased by
50%, to account for boats with more powerful motors than the 10 HP boats considered in
the Hernandez report.



29   The donation consisted of 15 motors with 25 HP, and 35 motors with 40 HP. Data from INPESCA

Salaries for the direct beneficiaries and the average 5-man crews were reckoned with as
job creation benefits. In a related topic, although not included in the quantitative analysis,
fish capturing total for 2014 was 6,180,851 pounds for the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast, an
increase of 5.25%, or 308,380 pounds, over the 2013 result of 5,872,471 pounds.31

2.1.a Establishment of Revolving Fund; Microcredit Loans for Pikineras
It is worth mentioning that estimates from the Guia Agropecuaria Report32 indicate that
pikineras that received loans from the revolving fund increased their incomes by an average
of 37.5% by the end of the project (i.e., an average of US$900 annually per beneficiary).
For analysis purposes, only 50% of these gains were attributed to the credit operation.

Component 3
3.1 Reconstruction of Housing; Wooden Houses
Firstly, house prices were determined from INVUR reports. Employment created and
salaries were taken from project information. Value added in relation to undeveloped
communal land at market prices was estimated at 13.34% of house cost, taking into
consideration the better design and building technology.

3.1 Reconstruction of Housing; Bamboo Houses
This analysis was carried out with the same considerations and estimates as in the wooden
house case above, from figures provided by the project. Other institutions intervening in
the same target region donated complementary water harvesting systems and latrines for
all these houses, which were factored in the calculation of benefits at US$0.10 per day.

3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure
Analysis for this part of Component 3 included a visit paid to the 4 finished buildings, i.e.,
2 churches and 2 community centers, out of a total of 13 subprojects. The remaining 9
stopped construction at different stages. Quantitative analysis was carried out for the four
buildings completed, and for 4 more of the unfinished ones, selected based on the higher
investments criteria.

Value added for all cases was calculated at 13.34%. Maintenance cost, equivalent to annual
depreciation was estimated at 6.67%, for 15-year return period designs. Construction costs
for all cases were provided by the GRACCN.33 Feasibility study, design and supervision
costs were calculated employing the industry average of 15% of construction cost.34

Value added in relation to undeveloped communal land at market prices was estimated at
5% of the cost of construction, taking into consideration a better design and building
technology compared to the ones employed in the old church, which partially withstood

the effects of Hurricane Felix. Maintenance costs were defined as 2.5% of construction
cost, similar to a depreciation rate for a building design with a 40-year return period.

3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure; Krukira Moravian Church
A job creation benefit was observed for a pastor and a janitor, with salaries amounting to
twice the current Nicaraguan minimum wage for socially oriented jobs. Value added in an
undeveloped communal market of the sort found in the target region was determined
considering a better design and building technology used, in comparison to the ones
employed in the old church, which partially withstood the damaging effects of Hurricane
Felix. Important benefits are provided by a rehabilitated well on premises, supplying water
for the church and nearby neighbors on a continuous basis, which was factored in the
calculation of benefits at US$2.50 per day.

3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure; Krukira Community Center
Construction cost was determined by averaging the costs of building the Krukira
Community Center and the Moravian church. Job creation was determined for a
community chief and janitorial personnel, salaries for both were calculated as twice the
minimum wage for social activities.

Other benefits were estimated for the use of the facility as a clinic, paying US$1,114.14 a
year for rent, as mentioned by personnel interviewed. In addition, 1 well and 4 latrines
were also constructed and factored in the calculation of benefits at US$5 per day. Value
added in this case was considered as equivalent to 6.6% of construction cost, for a building
with a return period of 30 years in a community that did not previously have such a facility,
according to beneficiaries interviewed. Maintenance cost or depreciation rate was
determined at 3.3%.

3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure; Santa Martha Catholic Church
As in the previous church case, job creation was accounted for a priest and a janitor, with
salaries amounting to twice the current Nicaraguan minimum wage for this type of jobs.
Likewise, value added was estimated taking into consideration a better design and building
technology, compared to the ones employed in the old church, which was rendered useless
by the effects of Hurricane Felix, and was later demolished, as witnessed during the
inspection trip.

3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure; Sisin Community Center
As in the previous community center case, job creation was determined for judiciary and
janitorial personnel, salaries for both were calculated as twice the minimum wage for social
activities. As in the Krukira example, 1 well and 4 latrines were also constructed and
factored in the calculation of benefits at US$5 per day.

Benefits from rent paid for different uses by the community and outsiders was estimated at
US$1,114.14 on a yearly basis, following the same estimation made for the Krukira
Community Center (i.e., use of the facility as a clinic). Value added was calculated for a




                                             45
building in a community that previously had a facility of roughly 14 square meters, 35
(whereas the centers financed by the Project have an area of 110 square meters).

3.2 Reconstruction of Social Infrastructure: Pehara and Betania Churches, and Awas
Yari and Watla Community Centers.
The unfinished conditions of these 4 buildings did not allow for an estimation of either
benefits or depreciation costs. Demolition costs were allocated for 4 of the other 5
unfinished constructions,36 which on average add the equivalent of 10% of construction
costs to total Project costs.37

     D. Main Findings

Overall economic efficiency is considered low. The results obtained as outputs from the
model designed, presented in Table 3, show that all the subcomponents analyzed have
positive NPV values, although modest in quantity. The Revolving Fund and the 4 partially
built social facilities had negative values and no IRR results. IRR values for the
subcomponents with positive results are all equal or higher than the 10% discount rate
applied.

In addition, Project delays and initial technical deficiencies in some of the works likely
impacted final costs and adversely affected efficiency. In particular, it should be considered
that none of the unfinished works are providing benefits to the communities. Moreover,
four of these unfinished works will have to be demolished and work restarted. Critically,
if the construction of the remaining 8 works is not restarted soon, their exposed structures
will deteriorate to the point that they will also have to be demolished.

Although the analysis did not calculate an overall IRR (given that some construction works
were not concluded), an IRR of 34.54% was obtained when only considering those
subcomponents with positive results. See Table 3.

The most economically beneficial subcomponents were the boats and outboard motors,
followed by fishing gear. In terms of costs, boats, followed by outboard motors, had by far
the highest results. Total NPV values confirm boats as the most productive subcomponent
(US$3,681,620.85), with fishing gear and wood houses construction contributing each less
than 50% of the subtotal for boats.

Investments in boats, fishing gear and outboard motors had the 3 highest IRR results,
77.93%, 67.73%, and 64.66% respectively, followed by the Krukira Community Center,
housing rehabilitation, and Sisin Community Center subcomponents. The rest of the works
subcomponents had more modest IRRs within the 18.65%-12.86% range.

Results by subcomponent are presented in Table 4, where Component 1 obtained the
highest NVP value of US$3,093,430.04 and an IRR result of 52.02% due to the adequate
emergency response that helped restore living conditions and much needed income to
beneficiaries.

Component 2 had no overall IRR result, with a NPV of (-US$1,630,885.67), influenced
negatively by the meager performance of the revolving fund. An NPV value of
US$1,308,623.23 and an undefined IRR were accounted for Component 3, considering
both the finished and incomplete social infrastructure buildings.

An exercise was conducted to estimate the probable outcomes for the revolving fund if
administrative improvements were enforced at Banco Produzcamos. For example,
increasing collection efforts could allow transferring at least 10% of estimated profit
margins from boat owners, as payments for loans, thus reducing the Bank’s preventive
provision for credit risks. If this provision could be decreased to the reported average of
19.0733% of gross financial margin for this particular bank (down from the 100% currently
applied to the revolving fund), then the NPV of the revolving fund would increase to
US$1,089,314.80, from US$(-5,321,506.52), with an IRR of 21.40%.

An additional exercise was performed calculating average results based only on the
finished buildings, to show their benefits and motivate completion of the remaining
subprojects. The resulting NPV of US$9,511,030.06, and IRR of 33.34% are presented
below in Table 5. Likewise, results by components are shown in Table 6, where Component
2 now has the highest NPV (US$1,646,664.37), but Component 1 still has the highest IRR
(52.02%).

                          Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

In 2014, GRACCN hired a consulting firm to help carry out the Project’s final evaluation,
including a household survey of the socio-economic impacts of the emergency recovery
works (i.e., construction / rehabilitation of housing and social infrastructure). In addition,
the firm conducted focus groups to obtain qualitative data on the impact of the works and
the revolving fund. This Annex summarizes the methodology applied and the most
pertinent results of both the survey and the focus groups.

1.     Description of the Methodology

Household Survey

The survey was conducted in December 2014 on a sample of 5% of the households that
benefitted from roof rehabilitation and new housing construction to assess the effects of
the Project at the household and community level. In particular, the survey sought to
investigate whether the Project contributed to improving beneficiaries’ living conditions
and reducing their risk to future disasters. Moreover, regarding social infrastructure, a
survey was conducted on a sample that included communities where civil works were
finished and those where works were pending completion or would need to be demolished
due to technical deficiencies. Accordingly, the communities surveyed included Dakura,
Pahara, Krukira, Betania, Santa Marta, and Yulu.

The questionnaire covered issues related to the selection of beneficiaries, community
participation in the design and implementation of works, training, duration of construction,
issues related to contractors, recommendations for future similar projects, as well as
beneficiaries’ satisfaction with Project activities.

The consulting firm carried out the survey, while GRAACN contributed to the definition
of the methodology, and the design and pilot testing of the survey instrument. GRACCN
also supervised data input and analysis.

Focus Groups

A total of six focus groups, each with 10 to 15 participants from the same communities
surveyed, were carried out to provide a more in depth evaluation of the impacts of
Component 3 (Reconstruction of Housing and Social Infrastructure.) The questionnaire
used for the focus groups covered beneficiaries’ satisfaction with Project activities and
community participation in their implementation, as well as with the handling of issues
faced during the construction of civil works.

In addition, four focus groups were carried out in Bilwi and Sandy Bay with fisher folk and
women (pikineras) to evaluate the impact of Component 2 (Recovery of Small-Scale
Fisheries Sector.) The discussions focused on the effectiveness of the credit services
(revolving fund) delivered by the Project, and beneficiaries’ satisfaction with those services.




                                             52
The focus groups also gave beneficiaries an opportunity to report issues faced during
implementation of the Revolving Fund.

Analysis of Results

The survey data was subject to different levels of analysis; (a) a reliable characterization
of the direct beneficiaries of the housing and social infrastructure works was developed, in
terms of their social and economic assets as well as their vulnerability; (b) beneficiaries’
level of satisfaction with Project activities was analyzed by cross-referencing sample sub-
groups (i.e., beneficiaries of roof rehabilitation, housing, credit, etc.) with similar
characteristics for comparative analysis; and (c) a cross-analysis among some of different
sub-groups was undertaken to compare the situation of the beneficiaries and their assets
against “control groups.”

Finally, data from beneficiary groups were compared with other survey data, such as the
2012 National Agricultural Census, to triangulate survey findings. The analysis of the
survey and focus groups results also considered, to a limited extent, the results of the 2010
National Household Survey.38 This was facilitated by aligning the questionnaire for the
Project household evaluation survey with the questionnaire for the 2010 National
Household Survey.

2.        Main Findings

Recovery of Small-Scale Fisheries Sector

Artisanal fishing is a traditional source of income for communities in the Project area.
Results show that, on average, 5 people per household are employed in fishing activities,
and that women are often dependent on men. Most fishing boat owners (9 out of 10
interviewed) report employing 4 - 5 workers, and about half are estimated to employ at
least one family member.

Most fishermen interviewed reported having received working capital and boats through
the Project. However, most of them stated their dissatisfaction regarding income
generation, claiming that their situation had worsened; about a third claimed that their
income has remained stable; and only a minority reported that their income had improved.
In addition, all fishermen interviewed mentioned owing overdue payments to Banco
Produzcamos, arguing that the boats received were not in optimal conditions, which forced
them to take loans to purchase spare parts. In addition, most beneficiaries reported that the
boats were given to them in poor condition, and about a third reported that fishing gear was
also in bad condition.

Regarding income, fishermen report that before Hurricane Felix, their earnings ranged
from C$3,000 to C$45,000 per kilo of fish, C$16,000 to C$60,000 per kilo of lobster, and


38 It was not possible to use the 2010 National Household Survey data as a baseline for the Project due to differences in

household sizes.


                                                          53
C$24,000 for a similar amount of shrimp. Currently, due to a sharp decrease in production,
compared to pre-hurricane levels, fishermen report an average income ranging from
C$1,000 to C$16,000 per kilo of fish.39

About half of pikineras, on the other hand, report having 4 family members working in
their particular line of business (there are no men in this activity), and claim they employ
at least one worker. Most pikineras report having benefited from the Project (as 96% of
microcredit beneficiaries were women.) Among the main impacts reported by the pikineras
are: (a) recovery of business activity, (b) improvement of housing conditions, and (c)
increased living standards.

Despite a previous survey reporting that credit to pikineras had more than doubled their
income, at the end of the Project this value is estimated at 37.5%. Although this
improvement cannot be attributed exclusively to the benefits of Project activities, the
pikineras recognized the large contribution from the Project in increasing their income.

Housing and Social Infrastructure

Beneficiaries acknowledged that the Project supported the rehabilitation and reconstruction
of houses. However, 20% of the sample considered that some of the construction materials
used were of low quality. Moreover, the beneficiaries do not perceive the new houses as
being safer from hurricanes due to the use of what they considered inappropriate materials,
such as sinkers, soft pinewood, non-galvanized nails, and 8x8 beams.

At the time of the final evaluation, only 4 of the 16 contracted social infrastructure works
were completed. The main problems and/or issues reported were:

      In some cases, the social infrastructure was not built on the sites initially agreed upon
       with the community, prompting space limitations, and in one case increased risk of
       flooding.

      One of the contractors did not honor payment commitments to the local workforce.

      Due to the situation with the above contractor, in some cases temporary construction
       facilities had not been removed and areas occupied by unfinished works not cleaned at
       project closing.

In summary, Project beneficiaries were not completely satisfied with activities under
Component 3, particularly given that houses and social infrastructure were affected by
construction delays that in some cases jeopardized the completion of the works. Regarding
Component 2, although the line of credit to help reactivate the small-scale fisheries sector
had limitations in its results, overall, beneficiaries reported being in a better position
compared to pre-hurricane levels.



39   Fishermen report a 64% reduction in fish production, 95% for shrimp, and 62% for lobster.

                 Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

                                                                  Bilwi, February 26, 2015

The workshop entitled “Lessons Learned from Hurricane Felix Emergency Project” was
brought together representatives of the Bank, Borrower (GoN), and implementing agencies
(SE-SINAPRED and GRACCN) to share, discuss, and validate the results of the Project.

Present at the workshop were representatives of the World Bank (Country Office and
Headquarters), Project Implementation Unit (GRACCN), in addition to former governors,
project staff and representatives of governmental agencies associated with Project
implementation: Banco Produzcamos (BP), INVUR, INATEC, INPESCA, MHCP,
URACCAN, Municipality of Bilwi, and Congress.

Carlos Alemán, Governor of GRACCN, delivered opening remarks in representation of the
Borrower, and Enrique Pantoja, Task Team Leader, delivered remarks in representation of
the Bank.

The ICR Team presented the findings on achievement of Project targets, positive and
negative issues affecting implementation, and overall Project implementation.

The participation of an ample cross-section of Bank and Borrower interests fostered a
highly productive discussion in a relatively short period of time. The salient points of the
discussion and lessons learned are as follows:

Institutional and Management Aspects
 Projects should contribute to improve institutional capacity (technical and
    administrative). It is important to create the conditions to manage new projects with
    efficiency and efficacy, to avoid implementation delays and additional unforeseen costs.
 Inter-institutional coordination must be strengthened. It is key to avoid duplicity of
    tasks and to secure the efficient use of resources, fostering complementarity and
    monitoring of activities.
 Flexibilization of procedures. Early recovery activities should allow fast deployment
    in order to reduce response time and costs, under a transparent and accountable setting.
 Empowerment of project beneficiaries. Sustainability and satisfaction of beneficiaries
    are intrinsically related to participatory processes in the design and selection of
    solutions.

Fiduciary Aspects
 Continuous training in fiduciary topics. It is important to ensure quality in the use of
   fiduciary mechanisms and procedures to ensure the achievement of project objectives
   with the available resources.
 Supervision and monitoring through national systems. Connectivity is paramount for
   updating the register of transactions, budget management, and reporting.



                                            55
   Timely reporting. It is very important to timely present reports, audits, and any other
    documentation required by donors and financiers in order to maintain transparency in
    the management of resources.
   Procurement adapted to local conditions. Delays in bidding processes can be avoided
    if methods and methodologies are adapted to local market conditions and the capacity
    of the implementing institution.

Infrastructure
 Supervision according to works complexity. In order to make sure that civil works are
    delivered timely, with expected quality standards, close supervision with technical
    capacity is required.
 Use of local labor and providers. Procurement processes should take into consideration
    local conditions in order to secure the best contracts while promoting opportunities for
    local providers and employment.
 Operational decisions should be based on technical recommendations, in order to avoid
    delays, deficiencies in project implementation, and lack of quality of final product.

Fisheries
 Technical support to beneficiaries. Close support and training will secure the proper
   use of equipment and sustainability of the economic activity.
 Credit control and supervision. Close supervision is needed to ensure the proper use of
   financial resources, portfolio sustainability and the opportunity for others to benefit
   from credit lines.
 Inclusion of non-traditional beneficiaries. It is important to secure wider social
   participation to effectively reduce exclusion and help alleviate poverty.

Communication
 Communication strategy from Project inception. It is important to have communication
  channels with beneficiaries in order to promote ownership and maintain transparency.
 Information dissemination. All stakeholders should be informed of project activities to
  promote empowerment and social audit.


The workshop allowed for a productive discussion between the Bank and the implementing
agencies on the design, implementation, and results of the Project. In turn, this allowed for
a better understanding of the challenges faced during implementation, as well as the
impacts of (not) achieving the expected Project results.

The evaluation team recognizes the efforts made by officers in all governmental agencies

The Hurricane Felix Emergency Recovery Project was designed in response to the damages
caused by Hurricane Felix. It aimed to support the immediate rehabilitation of housing and
social infrastructure, and the rehabilitation of the small scale fisheries sector in the RACCN.
The Project also sought to strengthen the autonomy and capacity of the GRACCN to
manage and implement externally financed projects. Component 1 was implemented by
SINAPRED, while Components 2, 3, and 4 were implemented by GRACCN, with
assistance from INPESCA, INVUR, MAGFOR, MTI and MINSA. The Project had a
participatory approach that enabled community leaders to participate in the definition of
eligibility criteria for selecting beneficiaries; social infrastructure works were also
prioritized through a participatory process.

Context. The Project spanned two regional government administrations, and suffered
important delays and shortcomings. The implementation strategy included the immediate
execution of early rehabilitation works to be financed through a PPF approved in December
2007. However, the PPF was not implemented given a six-month delay in obtaining Project
effectiveness. The Bank approved the US$17 million emergency credit in March 2008, and
Additional Financing (AF) for US$5.1 million in 2012. Given continued delays in Project
implementation, the GoN requested a cancellation of most of the AF, as well as US$1.35
million from the original credit. The Project also underwent four restructurings in 2009,
2011, and twice in 2012. The loss of key people working in the Project, following a change
in Government Administration, further affected Project implementation.

Achievement of PDO. The Project achieved important development indicators: (i) almost
4,000 houses rehabilitated or reconstructed; (ii) 30 fishermen received boats and fishing
equipment and supplies, (iii) 40 percent of beneficiaries who received fishing equipment
and supplies were women, (iv) beneficiaries of the revolving fund saw a 15 percent increase
in fishing production, and (v) fishermen’s and pikinera’s incomes increased by 20 percent.
However, other indicators were not fully achieved: (i) only 10 of the projected 40
communities now have access to safer buildings for emergency shelter; (ii) only 4
community churches and centers were fully reconstructed; (iii) a revolving fund was
established but its financial sustainability was in doubt at Project closing; (iv) only 60
percent of beneficiaries were satisfied with Project support to the small-scale fisheries
sector, and only 40 percent of families were satisfied with rehabilitation and reconstruction
works; (v) the planned health facilities were not built; and (vi) GRACCN did not develop
in a substantial manner its capacity to prepare and implement externally financed projects.
However, although the revolving fund was not sustainable at Project closing, the granting
of credit with extended repayment deadlines and competitive interest rates had great impact
for pikineras and fishermen, as it contributed to offset the economic losses of groups who
do not usually have access to formal financing. Overall, Project design is considered
satisfactory, but implementation is considered unsatisfactory.

The project was evaluated according to its relevance, effectiveness, and efficiency. In terms
of relevance, Project components contributed to improving the living conditions of



                                             57
beneficiary families, and to reactivating the regional economy. In terms of effectiveness,
the Project did not achieve the objectives satisfactorily, since GRACCN did not achieve
sufficient or steady technical and administrative capacity throughout project
implementation. Regarding efficiency, resources were not used efficiently; as of October
2014, the repayment of 161 loans to the revolving fund was overdue. In addition, only 4 of
16 social infrastructure works were concluded, while four of the unfinished ones will need
to be demolished.

Sustainability. It is not clear whether Project activities will contribute to sustainable
regional economic growth. Sustainability of Project activities is conditioned by several
factors: (i) at Project closing, GRACCN did not have resources to continue monitoring
Project results (e.g., the sale of new housing built with Project financing, or the operation
of the revolving fund), nor to conclude the unfinished social infrastructure works (although
budget allocation was expected from the central government.) Boat maintenance by
beneficiaries is not assured given that spare parts for the fishing equipment and supplies
are not available in Bilwi; (ii) human resources at Banco Produzcamos in RACN lacked
technical capacity to manage the revolving fund, and pikineras and fishermen also have
limited capacity to administer resources; and (iii) the Project was not completely successful
in strengthening partnerships among communities, municipalities, and the regional and
central governments.

Bank Performance. The Bank’s technical assistance during Project preparation was
pertinent and Project design addressed the critical needs of the affected communities.
During implementation, the Bank’s technical, environmental and social specialists visited
the beneficiary communities several times, and interviewed the local authorities to
document progress and assess the difficulties faced. To address the weak technical capacity
of GRACCN, the Bank also recommended the hiring of staff with experience in
implementing Bank-financed projects.

Borrower Performance. The Project was not implemented as expected mainly due to
GRACCN’s lack of experience in implementing procurement processes, and in handling
complex processes. GRACCN faced serious weaknesses in internal coordination between
the fiduciary and the technical areas. In addition, high staff rotation affected Project
progress, and the Project’s image among the communities and related institutions. The
Bank’s recommendation to hire external specialists with experience in Bank-financed
projects did not lead to better outcomes due most likely to the difficulty these specialists
and GRACCN staff faced in working together. Although by 2014 the Project team
(GRACCN staff and external specialists) was finally complete, it could not reach the
performance level needed to resolve critical issues and accelerate Project implementation.

Lessons Learned. The main lessons learned include: (i) the relevance of adopting a
participatory approach to strengthen Project sustainability, despite a more onerous
implementation; (ii) the critical need for effective coordination between the implementing
agency and any external team in order take advantage of its expertise and knowledge. In
this regard, it may help if the Project’s administrative and fiduciary requirements are better
aligned with the procedures of the implementing agency; (iii) the need for constant



                                             58
supervision to ensure compliance with safeguards, particularly concerning communication
and grievance redress mechanisms; (iv) the importance of an effective Communication
Strategy to inform and consult beneficiaries. In a context where most beneficiaries are
indigenous, the Communication Strategy must reflect the indigenous cultural views
(cosmovision) to ensure its relevance; and (v) the importance of engaging the
municipalities and territorial governments in Project implementation in order to promote
the Project’s legitimacy among beneficiaries.
