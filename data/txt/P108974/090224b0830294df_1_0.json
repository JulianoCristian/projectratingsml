Recovery Project for Nicaragua were as follows:\n            outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            implementation arrangements for emergency operations should\n            be straightforward and pragmatic, even if attempting to be\n            responsive to national decentralization efforts and special\n            geopolitical conditions. In countries or areas prone to\n            disasters, emergency recovery operations should strive to\n            mainstream disaster mitigation in a socially and culturally\n            responsive manner. The Project focused on rebuilding safer\n            communities, with houses and buildings rehabilitated or\n            reconstructed with improved construction standards that\n            considered disaster risk mitigation and traditional designs\n            and social organization. Accordingly, an emergency project\n            can be a vehicle to apply lessons learned on promoting\n            resilience to disasters, and preparedness and risk\n            mitigation through non-structural measures such as\n            evacuation plans, shelter planning, etc. Moreover, Project\n            design should take into account livelihood patterns and the\n            needs of widows and single female-headed households in\n            activities such as housing reconstruction requiring direct\n            labor contribution of beneficiaries. It is important that\n            both the Government and the Bank continue to learn from\n            project design and implementation in the Caribbean region,\n            given its particular socioeconomic and political context and\n            development challenges. It is advisable to carry out a\n            review of projects that had components or were fully aimed\n            at the Caribbean region, in order to consolidate knowledge\n            and lessons learned."}, "docdt": "2015-06-14T02:48:02Z"}
