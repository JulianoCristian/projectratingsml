                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Given continuous implementation delays, the Government of Nicaragua decided to request a cancellation of most of the funds of the additional financing (AF) grant, effectively also
                         canceling the new community infrastructure and small health clinics included under the AF. When the original Credit closed in December 2013, progress had been made in the

                         credits and training, several fisher folk had received credits for boats, and a revolving fund established to continue providing micro-credits in the future. However, 12 of the 16

                         The next mission is planned for August 2014. The original Credit (Cr. 4392-NI) closed on December 31, 2013 and the Additional Financing Grant is currently scheduled to close on
                         December 31, 2014. At the request of the Government of Nicaragua, the Bank canceled US$1.3 million equivalent before the Credit closing date, and US$4.8 million equivalent under
                         the Additional Financing. These amounts were returned to the country's IDA allocation and re-allocated to new Bank-financed operations. The Government has reiterated its
                         commitment to finding resources for the completion of the 12 unfinished civil works.
