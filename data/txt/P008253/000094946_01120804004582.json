The main lessons\n            flowing from this project are: The Staff Appraisal Report\n            indicated that the upgrading of hospital and primary care\n            facilities would be accompanied by closures or downsizing of\n            the services provided in those facilities not selected for\n            upgrading. The project design provided no resources or\n            activities to support this streamlinin gprocess, and assumed\n            that staff redeployment and resource allocation would be\n            automatically implemented by the local health authorities.\n            The design underestimated the level of effort and resources\n            to achieve a heath service rationalization, and may have\n            overlooked the technical and poltical complexity associated\n            with such activities. In the future consider preparing a\n            regional health plan in advance of any future health service\n            rationalizationplan to ensure better integration and\n            coordination amon the different elements and stakeholders in\n            the planning process. In addition the project would have\n            benefited from strengthened maintenance management capacity,\n            a review and discussion of the main findings from technical\n            assistance activities, and allocating specific resources for\n            monitoring and evaluation. The District Health Management\n            training program offers an effective model for designing a\n            flexible recruitment of trainers. The report also evaluates\n            procurement and supervision."}, "docdt": "2001-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
