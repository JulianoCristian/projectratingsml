This will be\n            accomplished by upgrading primary and secondary facilities\n            to minimum sanitary and physical standards, improving\n            treatment skills of hospital physicians and nurses and\n            building capacity at the central and district levels to\n            manage health resources and implement sectoral reforms. The\n            project consists of a main component to rehabilitate primary\n            and secondary health services, and a complementary component\n            to build institutional capacity at the district and central\n            levels. The first main component will support: 1)\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of 100 primary health centers\n            out of an initial network of 200 in six pilot districts; 2)\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of two secondary referral\n            hospitals; 3) strengthened capacity to plan and implement a\n            comprehensive public health facilities maintenance program\n            (buildings and equipment) through development of maintenance\n            norms and staff training. The second component will provide\n            assistance to: 1) improve management of basic health\n            services at the district level; 2) provide in-service\n            training for hospital physicians and nurses; and 3) build\n            institutional capacity at the central level to improve\n            sector planning, health financing and drug distribution."}, "docdt": "1994-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
