Each year,\n            four hundred new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in\n            Albanian women. Most of them were discovered at a late\n            stage, when the disease had advanced, was hard to treat, and\n            often resulted in death. Health System Modernization Project\n            supported by the World Bank, put four mammography machines\n            in four big cities in different areas of Albania. The\n            testing was free to all patients. A new campaign was\n            launched urging health care practitioners to routinely\n            screen women for breast cancer and to refer them for\n            mammograms so that early diagnosis would both increase\n            women's chances of living longer and reduce medical costs"}, "docdt": "2011-07-19T04:57:02Z"}
