gains in restoring macroeconomic stability and will\n            support the implementation of a deeper phase of the reform\n            program in the cocoa, energy, and banking sectors. Fiscal\n            policies supported under the credit improve fiscal\n            sustainability while raising the efficiency of resource\n            mobilization and use. In particular, the termination of\n            specific road contracts removes an important source of\n            fiscal imbalance and resource misallocation. Also,\n            eliminating the \"special tax\" on imports begins a\n            process to further rationalize the import tariff regime so\n            as to provide adequate incentives to local industry within a\n            regional context. Very importantly, the Credit will\n            implement a revised strategy for the cocoa sector developed\n            with strong stakeholder ownership. As part of this strategy,\n            the increase in the farmers' share of the fob price\n            will be further accelerated while external marketing will be\n            gradually opened to private competition. The Credit\n            implements key elements of the remaining reform agenda by\n            establishing market regulations, divesting the distribution\n            units of Ghana's electric company, enhancing financial\n            system soundness by targeting the closure of distressed\n            banks, and continuing the divestiture of the remaining\n            government banks. The Credit helps cover Ghana's\n            external financing requirements while it assists in reducing\n            the government's domestic financing requirements."}, "docdt": "1999-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
