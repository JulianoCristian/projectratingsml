Project for Ghana were as\n            follows: the outcome was unsatisfactory, the sustainability\n            was substantial, the institutional development impact was\n            negligible, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            unsatisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the recent\n            Bank support to adjustment in Ghana has been provided under\n            a series of Economic Reform Support Operations: Economic\n            Reform Support Operation - ERSO I, II, and III. Progress in\n            the implementation of the ERSOs has been uneven and\n            experience points to the following main lessons: (i)\n            Pressing financial needs was a primary reason to proceed\n            fast with ERSO II and III. Both Credits were prepared in\n            about 3 months. When there is a need to act fast, there is a\n            basis to be cautious about the depth of the\n            Government's commitment; (ii) Despite satisfactory\n            identification of risks, mitigation measures related to the\n            political environment and capacity may not be able to\n            overcome the problem of an ambitious Credit design. The\n            above shortcomings can be tackled in an environment such as\n            the one provided by programmatic lending under the PRSCs in\n            which resource transfer decisions are linked to achievements\n            in the implementation of the country's medium-term\n            poverty reduction strategies."}, "docdt": "2003-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
