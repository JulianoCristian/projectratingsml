APPRAISAL OF
A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
ETHIOPIA
SUMMARY
i.        For a country of its size and population, Ethiopia's transport
facilities are poorly developed with most of the country still remote from
modern means of communications and still relying predominantly on animal
transport. The transport system focuses primarily on Addis Abeba, and
secondarily on Asmera in the north, Jima in the southwest, and Aseb on the
Red Sea. Ilighways are the dominant mode. The main trunk road system is
fairly well developed with about 8,000 km of all-weather roads serving
about 42,000 registered vehicles. The Imperial Highway Authority (IIIA),
created and developed with Bank Group assistance, administers highway
operations. An extensive internal air system unifies the country and
links the administrative districts, and an international airline links
Ethiopia with Europe and Asia. The ports of Aseb and Mitsiwa on its own
territorial coast and Djibouti in the French Territory of the Afars and the
Issas serve Ethiopia. The Franco-Ethiopian Railway joins Addis Abeba and
Djibouti and the Mitsiwa-Asmera-Akordat Railway operates in northern Eritrea.
Future development planning in transportation will be aided by the recently
completed General Roads Study and an ongoing study of domestic aviation, both
UNDP-financed with the Bank as executing agency.
ii.       The Bank Group lending strategy for Ethiopia assigns highest prior-
ity to agricultural development. The emphasis on Bank Group lending in the
transport sector will be on roads and, in particular, those roads which com-
plement and promote expansion and improvement in the agricultural sector.
In line with this strategy, the proposed highway project assists in the con-
struction and improvement of lower class roads oriented principally towards
area development and represents a marked change from the past highway proj-
ects which emphasized the extension and improvement of the primary road
system.
iii.      The proposed project includes construction of six gravel surfaced
roads to IITA feeder road standards (about 430 km) and supervision of their
construction. Most feasibility studies and all detailed engineering of the
roads to be constructed were completed by IHA staff, assisted by Bank Group
preappraisal missions. The feasibility study of one road was completed by
consultants under the Fourth Highway Project financed by the Bank Group.
Technical assistance by consultants will be provided to the Planning Commis-
sion Office (PCO) for a study of rural roads (farm-to-highway) and to the IHA
for management, road maintenance, design, planning, and research. The local
road contracting industry will be assisted through training and loans for
equipment purchases. Funds will be provided for purchases of equipment for
training and materials research.



- ii -
iv.       The project will be implemented over a period of about four years,
with the IHA, assisted by consultants under the project, responsible for exe-
cuting all items but the rural roads study, for which the PCO will be respon-
sible, and the loans to Ethiopian contractors, which will be handled by the
Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank (AIDB). The civil works con-
tracts will be awarded after international competitive bidding. Several of
the contracts are of a size suited to the participation of Ethiopian con-
tractors.
v.        The six gravel road construction projects have a combined Economic
Return (ER) on investment of 23%, with individual ER's from 16% to 43%.
They will provide reductions in transport costs and permit access for exten-
sion services to guide intensification of agriculture and to open up new land
for cultivation.
vi.       The total project cost is estimated at US$22.0 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$14.0 million. Costs of the civil works
are based on detailed engineering estimates by the IHA, revised by the ap-
praisal mission to include additional drainage and protection works and
reflect the estimated cost at the time of bidding. For construction super-
vision and technical assistance, costs are based on current figures avail-
able in the Bank for comparable services. The cost provisions for equip-
ment purchases are estimated on the basis of discussions with IHA.
vii.      The project will be financed by an IDA credit of US$17.0 million,
which will cover the foreign exchange expenditure of US$14.0 million and
US$3.0 million of local expenditures. The Government has indicated that it
will finance the remaining US$5.0 million of local costs.
viii.     A condition of credit effectiveness is the execution and delivery
of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and the AIDB for the
purposes of onward lending to Ethiopian contractors.
ix.       The project as originally envisaged and appraised included the bi-
tuminous surfacing of about 430 kms of primary roads and procurement of
emergency road maintenance equipment. These elements of the project are now
proposed for parallel financing by the United States Agency for International
Development (US A.I.D.) under a separate project. Details of US A.I.D. fi-
nanced project are given in Annex B.



APPRAISAL OF
A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
ETHIOPIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Imperial Government of Ethiopia (Ethiopia) has asked the Asso-
ciation to help finance a highway project consisting of: (i) construction of
six gravel feeder roads (about 430 km); (ii) supervision of (i); (iii) tech-
nical assistance to the Planning Commission Office (PCO) to study rural
roads (farm-to-highway) and to carry out the recommendations; (iv) technical
assistance to the Imperial Highway Authority (IHA) for management, road main-
tenance, design, planning, and materials research; (v) aid to the local road
contracting industry through training and equipment loans; and (vi) purchases
of equipment for training and research.
1.02      The proposed project emphasizes roads principally oriented toward
agricultural development, a marked change from the past emphasis on extending
and improving the primary road system. Lower class roads are necessary for
development of areas adjacent to the present primary network and it is essen-
tial for the country's economic growth, particularly in agriculture, that full
support be given to this shift toward a better balanced road system.
1.03      The project cost is estimated at US$22.0 million.  An IDA credit of
US$17.0 million will finance 75% of construction and supervision costs and
the actual foreign exchange costs of all other project elements. This would
be the fifth Bank Group operation in Ethiopia's transport sector. The first
four loans and credits for highways totalled US$54.7 million, financing the
foreign exchange costs of: (a) construction of about 1,480 km of primary
roads and paving of about 970 km of roads; (b) equipment purchases for road
reconstruction and maintenance; and (c) consulting services for feasibility
studies and detailed engineering, an institutional review of IHA management,
technical assistance, and training. The first three projects have been com-
pleted. After some initial delays in finalizing plans and bidding documents,
the construction works under the fourth project are now more than half com-
pleted and the rate of progress is satisfactory. Details of all 4 projects
are given in Annex A.
1.04      The roads to be constructed and improved under the proposed project
agree largely with the priorities allocated in the General Road Study (GRS) of
1969, financed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with the
Bank as Executing Agency.
1.05      The project was appraised in November, 1971 by Messrs. F.D.T. Reid
(Engineer), A.J. Stone (Engineer/Economist) and M.H.F. Cooper (Agricultural
Consultant), who, with Mr. B. P. Kennedy (Engineer), prepared this report.



-2-
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   General 2/
2.01      Ethiopia is one of the largest countries in Africa, about twice
the size of France. The topography is dominated by a vast plateau rising
from torrid plains in the east and cut diagonally northeast to southwest by
the Rift Valley. Two distinct rainy seasons occur and the country is gen-
erally well-watered, with rivers originating in the highlands and flowing
mainly through deep gorges. The topographical and climatic conditions have
made provision of communications and transport networks very difficult and
expensive, consequently many parts of the country remain isolated with only
minimum development of agriculture and other potentials.
2.02      In addition to topography and climate, the transport system in
Ethiopia is greatly influenced by an administrative and economic focus on
the centrally-located capital, Addis Abeba where just under one million of
Ethiopia's estimated 25 million people live. Economic activity is further
concentrated at Asmera, in the north; Jima, in the southwest coffee area
(seasonal); and Aseb, the major Red Sea port. Commodity flows between Addis
Abeba and other centers create the main demand for goods transport which is
satisfied mainly by road transport. An extensive internal air system uni-
fies the country and links the administrative districts. The import-export
flow between Addis Abeba and the port of Djibouti in the French Territory
of the Afars and the Issas is served by the Franco-Ethiopian Railway (FER).
Except for a fairly well developed trunk road network and domestic aviation
system, the country's transport facilities are inadequate in size and capac-
ity. Most of the country is still remote from modern means of communication
and still relies heavily on animal transport.
B.   The Modes
(a) Highways
2.03      Details of the highway sector are given in Chapter III.
(b)  Civil Aviation
2.04      Ethiopia has an extensive domestic aviation system plus an inter-
national airline linking it with Europe and Asia. Forty-three airfields
operate for domestic service and airports at Addis Abeba, Asmera, and Dire
Dawa operate for international service. Except for the civil airfield at Jima
and the international airports, the runways are unpaved. Presently only day-
light operations are possible at any of the airports; however, lighting is

being installed at Addis Abeba and Asmera. The fleet serving scheduled
flights consists of four Boeing aircraft, two 707's and two 720's, two Douglas
DC6B's, and ten Douglas DC3's. A major decision on replacement of the DC3
fleet is pending. Although daily flights are scheduled to most airports,
climate, altitude and poor runways disrupt service in the rainy season. The
domestic air system is an important means of unifying remote regions, the capi-
tal, and other main centers. A UNDP-financed study on aviation and tourism
in Ethiopia has recently been carried out with the Bank as executing agent and
the final report of the study is expected to be available soon.
(c) Ports
2.05      Ethiopia is served by Aseb and Mitsiwa on its own territorial
coast and by Djibouti in the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas.
The Ethiopian ports are operated by the Marine Department of the Ministry
of Communications. Traffic at all three ports has been affected by the
Suez Canal closure and the number of ships calling has been substantially
reduced. Djibouti, in particular, has lost the substantial servicing of
vessels previously using the Canal and, in addition a part of its previous
traffic has been diverted to the nearby port Aseb. Traffic statistics are
unreliable, but Aseb and Mitsiwa handle about 70% of all cargo.
2.06      The GRS, financed by the UNDP, recommended studies to develop master
plans for future improvement and expansion of Aseb and Mitsiwa and suggested
that any study of Aseb should examine the comparative advantage to Ethiopia
from using Aseb and its road route or Djibouti and its rail route. As inter-
national commitments are involved, however, it is expected that such a decision
will take some time. Recently, the Japanese Government has agreed to finance
the preparation of a ports master plan for Ethiopia, which should be based on
comparative analysis of the Aseb and Djibouti alternatives.
(d) Railways
2.07      Two railways operate in Ethiopia:  the 781 km FER linking Addis
Abeba with the port of Djibouti and the 306 km Mitsiwa-Asmera-Akordat Rail-
way (NER) in northern Eritrea. The FER is the more important and is owned
by the Ethiopian Government (50%) and by the French Government and private
French shareholders (50%). Its source of revenue is Ethiopian traffic passing
through the French port of Djibouti. Both tonnage and revenues have been in-
creasing recently and the FER is now in a stronger financial position than
previously. Competition from road transport between the port of Aseb and
Addis Abeba may develop when a Bank/IDA-financed road between Awash and
Tendaho, scheduled to be completed late 1973, provides a much better route
than at present.
2.08      The NER's principal revenues come from freight transported between
Asmera and the port of Mitsiwa with a sizable portion coming from licenses
issued to road haulers. The railway alignment is tortuous with very steep
grades and a limited load carrying ability. Freight and passenger traffic
on the railway has been declining since 1966 due to continuing deterioration



-4-
of equipment and a necessary heavier reliance on road transport. The fi-
nancial position of NER has deteriorated sharply, with increasingly serious
annual deficits since 1967. The Planning Commission is currently carrying
out a study of the possibilities of closing this railway.
C.   Planning and Coordination
2.09      The Planning Commission Office (POO) of the Prime Minsiter's De-
partment is responsible for coordinating budget expenditures proposed by
the various ministries for development. Within the transport sector, co-
ordination of planning for all modes except roads, but including trucking,
is to be carried out in the recently established Research and Planning Unit
of the Ministry of Communications. The PC0 is responsible for coordinating
road planning with planning of other modes.
2.10      The basic structure for coordination of planning in the Ethiopian
Government is sound. However, available manpower is limited in the planning
units of the various ministries and the POO. This has resulted in problems
in project planning where the services are required of more than one minis-
try, such as in agricultural development regarding road projects. Coordina-
tion between road planning and domestic aviation planning is now being inves-
tigated in a UNDP study of internal aviation for which the Bank is Executing
Agency. Formal planning concerning coordination between road and rail ser-
vice to the competing ports of Aseb and Djibouti is lacking, but it is expect-
ed that the Japanese financed study (para. 2.06) will examine this matter.
2.11      Road planning originates in the Planning and Programming Division
of the DIA. This Division is staffed by young, inexperienced economists who
nonetheless are developing considerable ability in applying economic criteria
to highway projects. However, the present administrative arrangement whereby
the Executive Assistant to the General Manager also is the head of this Di-
vision does not provide the concentrated direction that this important Divi-
sion deserves. During negotiations the Government agreed to separate the re-
sponsibilities of the Executive Assistant to the General Manager and of the
head of the Planning and Programming Division and to appoint suitable quali-
fied individuals to work full-time in these posts. In addition, the Govern-
ment requested, and the Association agreed to, the provision of an expert
under the project, to assist the Planning a-nd Programming Division in its
work.
2.12      A more organized approach is needed to planning, constructing, and
maintaining rural roads (farm-to-highway) as this deficiency now inhibits
agricultural development. The IHA does not consider these roads to be their
responsibility. Some provincial governors have accepted the responsibility
without financial support from the Central Government, but their efforts are
necessarily limited. The Central Government has been considering establish-
ing a suitable organization to carry out this function, but has not reached
a decision. A study of the organizational and operational requirements for
construction of rural roads has been initiated by the Planning Commission



working through a Ministerial Steering Committee and the Government has re-
quested that two foreign experts, one engineer and one administrator, be
provided to the PCO under the project to assist the Committee in final-
izing the study and in the implementation of the findings and recommenda-
tions of such study. The scope and timing of this study was discussed and
agreed during negotiations, and the Government gave an assurance that the
findings and recommendations of the study would be reviewed with the Asso-
ciation and that the recommendations would be implemented in accordance
with a timetable to be agreed with the Association.
III. THE HIGIWAY SECTOR
A.   The Network
3.01      The existing highway network totals about 23,000 km, of which
about 8,000 km are all-weather roads and the balance dry-weather trails.
Details are shown in Table 1. About 6,900 km of all-weather roads are now
being maintained by the IHA and about 800 km will be taken over from con-
tractors for maintenance between 1972 and 1974. The main road network is
fairly adequate at present but there is almost a complete lack of rural
roads.
B.   Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
3.02      The marked growth in the vehicle fleet between 1960 and 1965 has
been followed by a period of stagnation, principally due to the impact of
depressed earnings on the coffee crop (the major contributor to the economy).
Accurate vehicle statistics are difficult to obtain. The vehicle fleet in
1970 was estimated at 42,300 units, composed of cars (72%), trucks, pickups,
and trailers (21%), and buses (7%). Details are shown in Table 2. Military
and police vehicles have been estimated at 5,000 units.
3.03      Vehicle fuel consumption between 1965 and 1969 increased at an
average annual rate of 12.5%, with gasoline increasing 8.5% and diesel 15.6%.
Details are shown ill Table 3. In 1969, 66.4 million tons of gasoline and
147.2 million tons of diesel were consumed. Statistics on vehicle registra-
tions and fuel sales show that the vehicle fleet is generally adequate but
continues to be disproportionately concentrated in the capital, Addis Abeba.
3.04      The trucking industry continues to operate under relatively free
competition, except on the Aseb-Addis Abeba route where fixed tariffs are
in force and between Mitsiwa and Asmera where the railway controls freight
movements. Freight charges are relatively low due to considerable competi-
tion on most main routes. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained
from the Government that it will continue to enforce vehicle weight and
dimension regulations.



- 6 -
3.05      Rural traffic movement is recorded by the lILA at 48 counting sta-
tions, each surveyed manually twice in the dry season and once in the wet
season. These surveys continue to be carried out only in daylight, with no
mechanical checking. No origin and destination studies are regularly carried
out by IHA, although some statistical data were prepared in the GRS. With
increasing sophistication in planning roads, the present system of data col-
lection needs further improvement and the Government has agreed to improve
methods of traffic data collection.
C.   Administration (see Chart)
3.06      The IHA, created in 1951, to develop and maintain the highway net-
work, is divided into nine districts and two sub-districts, each with its
own workshops and administrative offices under a district engineer. The
governing body is a Board of Commissioners comprising the Minister of Public
Works as chairman, the Vice Minister of Finance, the Vice Minister of Com-
merce and Industry, and two other members appointed by the Emperor. One of
these members is the IHA General Manager, a qualified engineer.
3.07      From the IRA's inception until mid-1963, staff of the United States
Bureau of Public Roads assisted in management. In May 1963 Ethiopians as-
sumed the management, supported by foreign managerial and technical advisers
from consulting firms employed under individual contracts which ended in 1967.
The tendency of IHA to depend on foreigners is being overcome and during the
past 2-3 years Ethiopian staff has been replacing foreigners. Ethiopianization
will continue to be encouraged by the Bank as formal and on-the-job training
produces improved local staff.
3.08      In 1966 the Bank Group arranged for a United States firm of man-
agement consultants, Public Administration Service (PAS), to investigate
thoroughly the organization and administration of IHA. The IHIA asked the
PAS to assist in carrying out the recommendations of the investigations,
and funds were provided for this purpose under the Fourth Highway Project.
The recommendations have generally been carried out satisfactorily but dif-
ficulties have arisen in implementing certain improvements, particularly in
the Equipment and Supplies Division, mainly because failure to implement
some management directives has led to lack of coordination in interdivisional
activities. The proposed project contains funds for two experts; one to as-
sist IHA further in the implementation of PAS's general organizational recom-
mendations (including technical auditing and costing) and the other to as-
sist in the implementation of procedural recommendations for the IlIA's Equip-
ment and Supplies Division. During negotiations the Government gave assur-
ances that it would take the necessary action to improve the implementation
of IHA management directives and the supervision of IHA divisional and dis-
trict operations.
D.   Planning and Financing
3.09      In the past, only limited road planning to prepare Five-Year De-
velopment Plans has been carried out by the IHA Planning and Programming



Division. The third Plan is now in its fourth year. The Division is now
using more sophisticated economic methods to plan road construction proj-
ects and needs to be strengthened (para. 2.11). The PCO is becoming in-
creasingly active in coordinating road planning with planning in other
economic sectors.
3.10      The IHA Planning and Programming Division prepares the highway
budget. After approval by the IHA Board of Commissioners, capital expendi-
tures for particular projects are reviewed by the PCO and ordinary expendi-
tures (administrative, engineering and technical services, and maintenance),
by the Ministry of Finance. Highway construction and maintenance expenditures
have increased from approximately US$21.2 million equivalent for FY1967/68
to an allocation of US$38 million equivalent for FY1971/72. Details of
budgets and expenditures are shown in Table 4. Expenditures are financed by
domestic general revenue funds and foreign loans and credits.
3.11      After Parliament approves or modifies the budget, the Ministry of
Finance disburses funds. Once the IHA receives the funds, they are solely
within the control of the General Manager. The Ministry of Finance audits
IHA financial accounts, but no technical auditing takes place. Partly in
consequence, costing in 1l1A is virtually meaningless as no inspection of
the technical works costed is done. During negotiations, the Government
gave an assurance that effective technical auditing and costing of IHA
operations, along the lines of the PAS recommendations, would be imple-
mented. The expert to be provided under the project to assist in the im-
plementation of PAS organizational recommendations will assist IHA in this
regard (para. 3.08).
E.   Engineering
3.12      The IHA Design Division is carrying out an increasing amount of
road design, but consultants still carry out some designs and supervise new
major road works. The quality of work produced by the Design Division is
generally reasonable, but a tendency exists to apply design standards too
rigidly. Therefore, continued technical assistance is needed to advise the
Design Division on proper design techniques and to review their work; funds
for this purpose are included in the proposed project (para. 4.05).
3.13      Design standards, shown in Table 5, are generally satisfactory for
the classes of road for which they are intended although, certain aspects of
the general standards, related mainly to geometrics, need to be amended; this
matter was discussed and agreed during negotiations for the roads included in
the project.
3.14      More use of local materials and adjustments in design and con-
struction practices to take advantage of subsurface conditions could lead
to improved road structure and, in some cases, to substantial cost savings
in construction and maintenance. Therefore, the proposed project includes
funds for an expert and equipment to undertake research and develop recom-
mendations for design and construction practices related to local materials
and sub-surface conditions (paras. 4.05 and 4.07).



F.   Construction
3.15      Past major road construction has been carried out by foreign con-
tractors supervised by consultants. However, under the Fourth Highway Proj-
ect, local IHA staff supervised the bituminous surfacing of two roads; the
result was generally satisfactory. Two other large construction contracts,
awarded to foreign contractors under that project and supervised by foreign
consultants with a number of IHA staff attached for training, are progress-
ing well. For the purpose of further training the Government has requested,
and the Association has agreed, that IHA staff participate more fully in the
supervision of the construction of the project roads under the supervision
of experts financed under the project.
3.16      Some road construction could be carried out by competent local
civil works contractors who appear to be interested in expanding into road-
works. However, they generally lack experience in pricing, administering,
and executing roadworks and, therefore, funds have been included in the pro-
posed project for training of local contractors (para. 4.06). Local con-
tractors also generally lack the funds to purchase needed basic equipment.
and have considerable difficulties borrowing privately. The project, there-
fore, includes funds with which to purchase needed equipment to be loaned
to local contractors who are successful in bidding for roadworks. The loan
funds will be administered by the Agricultural and Industrial Development
Bank (AIDB) through which Bank Group funds are being channeled in other
projects and which the Bank Group considers to be a suitable and dependable
organization. Confirmation of the AIDB's interest in administering these
loan funds has been obtained and detailed procedures to be followed regard-
ing contractor qualification, loan guarantees, etc. were discussed and
agreed during negotiations. Continuity of work is essential to encourage
contractor development, and an assurance that the IHA will plan their fu-
ture construction programs accordingly was obtained during negotiations.
G.   Maintenance
3.17      The IHA Operation Division, under the overall supervision of the
Chief Engineer, performs road maintenance. In the last fiscal year, an
average of about US$600 equivalent per km was allocated for road maintenance,
excluding equipment depreciation and salaries of IHA permanent staff employed
on maintenance work. If salaries were included in the total sum, the amount
probably would exceed US$635 per km, which is considered more than ample if
all were used for maintenance. However, some funds have been used to produce
materials to upgrade existing roads to higher standards and other funds have
been used to supplement road construction works lacking adequate capital
funds. The quality of maintenance depends partly on the individual field
engineer in charge. In most cases, headquarters staff do not provide proper
direction and control. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from
the Government that it will spend funds allocated to the IRA for maintenance
for that purpose, establish proper costing and technical auditing procedures,
and improve headquarters supervision and coordination of district operations.
IHIA gave a further assurance that it would submit to the Association a de-
tailed quarterly report on road maintenance expenditures and work output.



- 9 -
3.18      A condition inventory of the road network to be maintained by IHA
is under preparation. However maintenance standards need to be established
and maintenance operations and techniques require improvement. The US A.I.D.
has provided finance for an ongoing study of the problems of providing bet-
ter road maintenance. The first phase of the study has been completed and
has identified emergency road maintenance equipment which US A.I.D. are to
finance under their project (see Annex B). The second and final phase of the
study is expected to be available at the end of 1972 and will provide a re-
alistic routine and periodic road maintenance program between 1973 and 1977
and related budget allocation needs. During negotiations, an assurance was
obtained from the Government that it will implement the study recommendations
as agreed between the Government and the Association and in accordance with
a time schedule acceptable to the Association. The Government has requested,
and the Association has agreed, that two foreign experts be provided under
the project to assist IHA in the improvement of road maintenance organization,
operations and techniques, and in the implementation of the recommendations
of the road maintenance study.
3.19      Recognizing that operations for the maintenance of road equipment
need improvement, US A.I.D. has provided the IHA with a US$3.5 million loan
for technical assistance, tools, and spare parts to reorganize and improve
equipment maintenance and to train local personnel in planning and organiz-
ing their work. Progress under this loan is satisfactory. All 12 of the
technical assistance personnel have started work and have compiled a list
of required workshop tools and spare parts. Tools and spare parts have been
ordered and are expected about mid-1972; the percentage of deadlined equipment
has already decreased by about 10%. Training of local personnel will not be
completed by mid-1973 when this aspect of the present US A.I.D. scheme ends,
and US A.I.D. has agreed to extend its technical assistance in this field.
H.   Training
3.20      Recognizing that the local labor market could not meet the skilled
manpower needs of the IHA, a training center was established in 1956 to pro-
vide the necessary skills for road construction and maintenance and today
nearly 3,900 have been trained there. In addition, some 400 senior employees
have received advanced training in schools and universities in Ethiopia and
abroad.
3.21      The training center is located in Alemgana, near Addis Abeba, and
comprises classrooms, library, dormitories and mess facilities equipped to
handle 70 trainees at a time.  The facilities include training aids and
equipment demonstration models, some of which are out of date and need
modernizing. Additional aids and books are also needed. While some of the
courses are well organized, others need to be revised to meet modern condi-
tions. Courses are planned for local contractors in subjects such as cost-
ing, organization, and bidding procedures. The proposed project includes
funds for these purposes. The provision of an expert to further plan and
reorganize training programs is being planned under the extended US A.I.D.
Technical Assistance Program (para. 3.19).

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Description
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(i)  construction and supervision of six gravel feeder roads
(about 430 km);
(ii)  technical assistance by consultants to the PCO to study
rural roads (farm-to-highway) and recommend the organi-
zation necessary for planning, financing, constructing,
and maintaining these roads and to help carry out the
recommendations;
(iii)  technical assistance by consultants to the IHA for manage-
ment, road maintenance, design, planning, and research;
(iv)  aid to the local road contracting industry; training in
costing, organization, and bidding procedures, and loan
funds for equipment purchases by successful local bidders
for road works; and
(v) purchases of equipment for training, and for materials
research.
Consultants and technical experts for items (i) - (iv) are expected to be
provided from outside Ethiopia. During negotiations, the terms of reference
for these services were generally discussed and agreed by the Association and
the Government. An assurance was obtained from the Government that it will
retain consulting firms and individual experts for these services under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
4.02      Details are given in Annex B of those project elements appraised
by the Bank Group mission and subsequently proposed for financing by US A.I.D.
under a separate project. These elements comprise: (i) upgrading and bitu-
minous surfacing to IRA primary road standards of three roads including super-
vision; and (ii) procurement of emergency road maintenance equipment.
(a)  Gravel Roads to be Constructed to IHA Feeder Road Standards
4.03      The following roads will be constructed:
(i) Asela-Dodola (120 km);
(ii)  Bonga-Mizan Teferi (80 km);
(iii) Agaro-Ghera-Chira (48 km);
(iv) Dejen-Mota (96 km);
(v)  Gelemso-Mechara (42 km); and
(vi) Butajira Ziway (48 km).



- 11 -
The roads are described in detail in Annex C and the design standards in
Table 5; the standards are satisfactory. Most feasibility studies and all
detailed engineering of these roads were completed by IHA staff, assisted
by Bank Group pre-appraisal missions. The feasibility study of the Bonga-
Mizan Teferi Road was completed by consultants (Sauti, Italy), under the
Fourth Highway Project.
(b) Technical Assistance to the PC0
4.04      To assist the Government in completing a study to identify the
structure, staffing and policies of an organization capable of administering,
planning, constructing, and maintaining farm-to-highway roads and to assist
in implementing the findings (para. 2.12), two foreign experts (an administra-
tor and an engineer) will provide assistance for two years. They will be
attached to the PC0.
(c) Technical Assistance to the IHA
4.05      An estimated 12 man-years of technical assistance for management,
training, design, planning, and research will be provided as follows:
(i)  an expert to continue advise and assistance
on reorganization procedures and help implement
improved technical auditing and costing (paras.
3.08 and 3.11);
(ii)  two experts to advise and assist in the improve-
ment of road maintenance organization, operations
and techniques (para. 3.18);
(iii) a design expert to assist in improving the quality
of design work (para. 3.12);
(iv)  a planning expert to advise the Planning and Pro-
gramming Division on improved planning procedures
(para. 2.11);
(v)  an expert on road construction materials to undertake
research to develop pavement design and construction
practices related to local materials and sub-surface
conditions (para. 3.14); and
(vi)  an expert to assist on coordinating the procurement,
storage and workshop procedures of IHA's Equipment
and Supplies Division (para. 3.08).
(d) Aid to the Local Contracting Industry
4.06      To train local contractors in subjects such as costing, organiza-
tion, and bidding procedures for road construction contracts (para. 3.16),



- 12 -
a construction expert will be available for two years. The training will be
carried out at the IHA Training Center at Alemgana. Funds will also be pro-
vided under the project from which successful domestic bidders on roadworks
may borrow to purchase essential construction equlpment. These loans will
be subject to commercial interest rates and will be administered by the AIDB
(para. 3.16). The execution and delivery of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement be-
tween the Government and the AIDB in conformity with provisions agreed with
the Association during negotiations, is a condition of Credit effectiveness.
(e) Purchases of Equipment
4.07      Equipment to be purchased under the project includes:
(i) additional training equipment and materials to
bring up-to-date several courses at Alemgana
Training Centre, near Addis Abeba (para. 3.21);
and
(ii) research equipment to develop pavement design and
construction practices related to local materials
and sub-surface conditions (para. 3.14).
B.   Cost Estimates and Financing
4.08      The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at
US$22.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$14.0 million. A
summary of the project costs is given on page 13.
4.09      Costs of road construction are based on detailed engineering estimates
prepared by the IHA and revised by the appraisal mission to include necessary
additional drainage and protection works (see Table 6). The estimates are
based on unit prices obtained recently in bidding for similar works in Ethio-
pia adjusted to reflect costs expected at time of bidding. For technical as-
sistance, including aid to local contractors, cost estimates are based on
current cost figures available in the Bank for comparable services. The cost
provision for loans for contractor equipment purchases is notional. Contin-
gency allowances totaling about 24% are included for the construction and
equipment purchase elements of the project; 10% for possible quantity in-
crease and about 14% for price escalation. The 14% allowance for price in-
creases is based on a 10% p.a. increase in local and foreign costs over the
implementation periods for the various project elements with the rates for
local and foreign costs assumed to be the same. For construction supervision
and technical assistance a physical contingency allowance of 10% is consid-
ered adequate. During negotiations, the Association and the Government dis-
cussed and agreed on the cost estimates.
4.10      The foreign exchange component for gravel road construction is
estimated at 60% with foreign contractors and at 50% with Ethiopian contrac-
tors. The foreign exchange cost of supervision of construction is estimated
at 55%. This is based on the Government's request that consultants provide

the responsible resident engineering personnel on the contract sites, and
that the remaining supervisory personnel be provided by IHA, according to a
staffing plan to be agreed between the IHA and the Association (para. 3.15).
The foreign exchange component for technical assistance to the PCO and IHA,
including training of local contractors, is 85%. For equipment purchases
the foreign exchange component is 98% and for loans to domestic contractors
100%.
4.11      The proposed credit will finance US$14.0 million of foreign cost
and US$3.0 million of the local costs of the project. During negotiations
an assurance was obtained that the Government will provide the remaining lo-
cal costs of US$5.0 million.
C.   Execution
4.12      The IHA, assisted by consultants under the project, will be re-
sponsible for executing all project items except the rural roads study, for
which the PCO will be responsible, and the equipment loans to Ethiopian con-
tractors which will be handled by the AIDB.
4.13      The contracts for the civil works will be let on the basis of unit
prices after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank
Group's Guidelines on Procurement. To attract foreign bidders, as well as
to permit local contractors to tender for works of a size within their ca-
pabilities, contracts will be combined into bidding groups whose totals
would range between about US$900,000 and US$5.8 million. A contracting
proposal, shown in Annex D, was reviewed and agreed with Government during
negotiations.
4.14      It is expected that all road construction will be underway by mid-
1973 and completed by mid-1976; all right-of-way for road construction has
been acquired. Technical assistance, including aid to local contractors,
should begin by early 1973 and be completed in about two years. Equipment
should be purchased by mid-1973. During negotiations, the Bank Group and
the Government discussed and agreed the timing of project execution.
4.15      Some unemployment exists in Ethiopia principally in the major urban
areas of Asmera and Addis Abeba but reliable statistics on the magnitude are
not available. In general, the IHA prefers that major road construction be
carried out by mainly equipment intensive methods. Their standard specifica-
tion, however, permit contractors to use alternative methods of construction
whereby more labor can be utilized provided quality standards are met. More
labor intensive construction methods could be applied on low-class rural
(farm-to-highway) roads and the study of such roads to be carried out under
this project (para. 2.12) will make recommendations on this aspect.
D.   Disbursements
4.16      Disbursements from the Credit Account will be on the basis of
75% of the cost of road construction and supervision, the actual foreign ex-
change costs of technical assistance and consulting services and the CIF



- 15 -
costs of equipment for training, and materials research, and for the equip-
ment loans to Ethiopian contractors either 100% of the CIF costs of equip-
ment financed under the loans or 100% of such loans net of any payments to
finance import duties, transaction taxes or any other taxes. Based on the
foregoing and on the schedule of project execution in para. 4.14, an Esti-
mated Schedule of Disbursements has been prepared. The Schedule, shown in
Annex E, was reviewed and agreed in conjunction with the timing of project
execution (para. 4.14) during negotiations. Any surplus funds remaining in
the Credit Account after the project has been completed will be cancelled.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      Economic analysis showed the project to be well justified.  The six
project roads to be constructed have a combined Economic Return (ER) on in-
vestment of 23%, with individual ER's from 16% to 43%. Details are given in
Table 7.
5.02      Five of the six roads to be constructed are the initial planned
development for their respective areas. The sixth road (Asela-Dodola) com-
plements an existing agricultural extension project financed by the Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA). For the first five roads, agricul-
tural extension services to improve crop yields and guide development are
considered to be a mandatory part of the project. During negotiations an
assurance was obtained that the Government would establish Minimum Package
Programs (NPP's) on these roads on completion of their construction.
5.03      For these five roads, it is impossible to differentiate between
the benefits of the road and those of the MPP. The analysis, therefore, com-
pared the net benefits of the road and MPP with the costs of the road and
the cost of the MPP, including inputs such as fertilizer. As no reliable
traffic flow data are available for these developmental roads, the basic
tool of the analysis was an equilibrium agricultural model which estimated
production surpluses. Briefly, the model related: population, area cul-
tivated (and maximum area of road influence), yields, losses, and consumption;
the result was a marketable surplus. Existing and future traffic was esti-
mated on the basis of the surplus and IRA and GRS statistics on truck load
factors and the relation between trucks and other vehicles. Benefits to
existing traffic and generated non-agricultural traffic were estimated by
comparing estimates of existing transport cost by four-wheel-drive vehicles
or pack animals with cost on the proposed road. The value-added of the net
increase in marketable surplus was calculated using estimated import parity
prices at the farm gate with the new roads. Adding the agricultural value
added to the benefits to existing and generated traffic gives the total bene-
fits wlhich are expressed on Table 7 as an ER on the investment in roads and
MPP's.
5.04      For analysis of the Asela-Dodola Road, agricultural production was
used only to forecast local traffic. The benefits of agricultural develop-
ment in the area are not attributable to road investment but to the existing



- 16 -
investment in extension services. Hence, this road is economically justified
on savings in vehicle operating costs for local and through traffic. Through
traffic was estimated from GRS origin and destination information.
5.05      Estimated costs of construction, maintenance, and vehicle operation
were calculated at economic cost using factors developed in the GRS relating
financial and economic costs. Construction costs used in the analysis in-
cluded quantity contingencies and supervision.
5.06      Sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the effect on
the ER of changes in values of parameters affecting agricultural production,
consumption, prices, and of costs of construction. A 10% change in agricul-
tural production, consumption, and surplus resulted in an average change on
the ER of about 5%. A 10% change in construction costs changed the ER about
7%. A 25% change in the upgrading and surfacing costs change the ER about
20%. None of the effects produced by these analyses are critical for the
investment decision.
5.07      Benefits were not quantified for the proposed investments in:
technical assistance to the PC0 and IRA; aid to the local road contracting
industry; and equipment purchases for training and materials research.  As
discussed in Chapter III, these elements are essential for efficient opera-
tions and further improvements in the highway sector and, therefore, are
considered fully justified.
VI.  RECNMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will:
(i) enter into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with AIDB for the
purpose of onward lending to Ethiopian contractors, in
conformity with provisions agreed with the Association
(paras. 4.06 and 6.02);
(ii) spend funds allocated to the IHA for maintenance for that
purpose, establish proper costing and technical auditing
methods, and improve headquarters supervision and coordina-
tion of district operations (para. 3.17);
(iii)  implement the US A.I.D. maintenance study recommendations
as agreed with the Association and in accordance with a time
schedule acceptable to the Association (para. 3.18);
(iv) implement the recommendations of the rural road study in
accordance with a time schedule acceptable to the Associa-
tion (para. 2.12); and
(v) establish MPP's on the project roads following completion
of their construction (para. 5.02).



- 17 -
6.02      A condition of credit effectiveness is the execution and delivery
of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and AIDR.
6.03      The project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit of
US$17.0 million on the usual terms to Ethiopia.

APPRAISAL OF
A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
ETHIOPIA
Highway Projects Financed by the Bank Group
A.   First Highway Project, Loan 31-ET, September 1950 (US$5 million
1.        Purchases of urgently needed equipment for reconstruction and
maintenance of the road network were financed. This project was completed
satisfactorily, and the loan fully disbursed.
B.   Second Highway Project, Loan 166-ET, June 1957 (US$15 million)
2.        Foreign exchange costs were financed for:
(a)  constructing of main roads (about 850 km); and
(b) engineering by consultants of roads for future
construction (about 1,000 km).
Execution of this project was delayed mainly due to disagreement between the
Imperial Highway Authority (IHA) and the Ministry of Finance over the funds
needed to complete it. Road construction was satisfactorily completed in
1968.
C.   Third Hiihway Project, Credit 35-ET. February 1963 (US$13.5 million)
3.        Foreign costs were financed for:
(a)  completing road construction started under the Second
Highway Project;
(b)  constructing new roads (about 210 km) and several bridges;
(c)  bituminous surfacing of roads (about 800 km); and
(d) consulting services to:
(i) replace staff of the United States Bureau of
Public Roads in IHA management; and
(ii) carry out economic and engineering studies of a
road through the Awash Valley.

This project was completed, but substantial claims by contractors are current-
ly under arbitration.
D.   Fourth Highway Prolect. Loan 523-ET (US$13.5 million) and Credit 111-ET
(US$7.7 million), January 1968
4.        Foreign costs were financed for:
(a)  constructing main roads (about 420 km);
(b)  asphaltic paving of existing main roads (about 170 km); and
(c) consulting services for feasibility studies of further
roads, advice to the IHA, technical assistance, and training.
The Swedish Government also provided a US$5.8 million credit for this project,
bringing the total foreign participation to US$27 million. Some delays in the
commencement of the project resulted from slow progress in the preparation of
acceptable tender documents and contractors prequalification and the small
number of responses to the first tender necessitated a second tender with some
changed conditions. Road contracts were finally signed in July and August
1969 and work is now progressing satisfactorily. The two road paving contracts
were recently completed ahead of schedule, one road construction contract is
well ahead of schedule and the other is on schedule.

(Originally Appraised by Bank Group Mission)
1.   The Project
The project comprises:
(A) Upgrading and bituminous surfacing of the following roads;
feasibility studies and plans were prepared by IHA:
(M)  Weliso-Jima (223 km)
(ii)  Agaro-Bedele (95 km)
(iii)  Nekemte-Gimbi (111 km).
(B) Supervision of Construction.
(C) Emergency road maintenance equipment.
2.   Description
The Weliso-Jima road is the unsurfaced part of the Addis Abeba-Jima
road, constructed with Bank Group assistance to primary road standards under
the First Highway Project. This improvement will provide a bituminous sur-
faced road between Addis Abeba to Jima and thence to Agaro (the Jima-Agaro
road was bituminous surfaced with Bank Group assistance under the Fourth High-
way Project). The Nekemte-Gimbi and Agaro-Bedele roads were constructed to
gravel surfaced standards with Bank Group assistance under the Third Highway
Project. The emergency road maintenance equipment was identified in the first
phase of an ongoing US A.I.D. financed Road Maintenance Study (para. 3.18).

5.   Economic Evaluation
Existing ADT is 111 vehicles on Nekemte-Gimbi road, 185 vehicles on
Agaro-Bedele road and 224 vehicles on Weliso-Jima road. Growth rates fore-
cast in the GRS are about 10%, 7% and 6% respectively. Investments in up-
grading and bituminous surfacing are well justified on benefits from savings
in vehicle operating costs and maintenance costs.

Description of the Project Roads
A.   Gravel Roads to be Constructed to Feeder Road Standards of the
Imperial Highway Authority (IHAj:
1.        Asela-Dodola (120 km):  The road will replace a dry weather track
in a rich agricultural area now being developed with aid from the Swedish
Government. It is economically justified on savings in transport costs for
local and through traffic.
2.        Bonga-Mizan Teferi (80 km):  This road, passing through partly
forested hilly terrain, will link the coffee-rich Mizan Teferi area with the
all-weather road system. It will replace a pack-animal track and meet the
Bonga-Jima Road, built under the Second Highway Project. The influence
area is fertile, well-watered, and potentially rich in tea, coffee, and
grain. The local agricultural system, together with extension services pro-
vided in a Minimum Package Program (MPP), will result in considerable bene-
fits from agricultural development (excluding tea). Investments in the road
and MPP are economically justified on these benefits as well as on savings
in transport costs.
3.        Agaro-Chera-Chira (48 km):  The road will link Ghera and Chira to
the all-weather road system at Agaro. The influence area is hilly and well-
watered. Agriculture is partly developed between Agaro and Ghera and ex-
panding between Ghera and Chira. A MPP will permit intensification and guide
development, mainly of grain and coffee. Investments in the road and MPP are
economically justified on benefits from increased agricultural production
and savings in transport costs for ex-sting and generated non-agricultural
traffic.
4.        Dejen-Mota (96 km):  Construction of about 35 km of the road will
complete previous construction to formation level. It will join Mota to the
all-weather road system at Dejen on the Addis Abeba-Gonder Road. This com-
pletely developed area will require a MPP with the road to increase exports
of agricultural surpluses. Investments in the road and MPP are well justi-
fied on benefits from increased agricultural production and savings in trans-
port costs for existing and generated non-agricultural traffic.

5.        Gelemso-Mechara (42 km):  This road will replace a pack-animal track
traversing hilly terrain and extend the existing Dire Dawa-Gelemso Road. A
MPP is required to intensify grain and coffee production in a fertile, well-
watered, developed area. Investments in the road and MPP are economically
justified on benefits from increased agricultural production and savings in
transport costs to existing and generated non-agricultural traffic.
6.        Butalira-Ziway (48 km):  This road replaces a dry weather track
and will provide a cross link between two roads radiating from Addis Abeba.
About half the road length next to Butajira is an area of rich developed
agriculture, expanding towards Ziway into poorer land with a high erosion
risk. A NPP is required to control expansion of agriculture and intensify
production of grain, pulses and chillies in the rich area. Investments in
the road and NPP are economically justified on benefits from increased agri-
cultural production and savings in transport costs to existing and generated
non-agricultural traffic.
