         Government's training strategy by restructuring\n            technical education and vocational training systems (VET)\n            and spearheading the change from a socially oriented supply\n            driven training system to a demand driven system, which is\n            employment oriented and responsive to the needs of the\n            economy, particularly the private sector.  It will support\n            development of the planning and monitoring capacity of the\n            Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training\n            (METFP) and allow it to follow the labor market trends.  The\n            project will also finance the development of sector specific\n            vocational training centers, which will professionalize the\n            formal and informal training system through restructuring\n            and reorienting technical and vocational training.  Project\n            components are as follows : a) institutional development :\n            strengthening METFP's Directorates, creating a Labor\n            Market Information System, and monitoring the VET Reform\n            Program; b) training of sector personnel; and c) National\n            Training Fund : creating the managerial structures and\n            funding training activities."}, "docdt": "1990-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
