MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Republic of Togo for SDR 7.0 million
(US$ 9.2 million equivalent). The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with forty years maturity and would help finance a technical education
and vocational training project. The project would be cofinanced by a grant
from the European Development Fund (FED) for USS 3.7 million equivalent and by
a Government contribution of US$2.9 million equivalent.
2.    Country Sector Background: With the creation of the Ministry of
Technical Education and Professional Training (METFP) in 1984, the Government
started to focus attention on the need to reform technical education and
vocational training (VET). However, because the vocational training tax was
not used for training but fed Treasury's general resources, and because
METFP's structure was incomplete, little progress has taken place in reshaping
the system. VET continues to be regarded as a second choice for those who
cannot continue directly within general education. Yet, although VET will
continue to be rather limited in size (due in part to the small modern sector
of the economy which absorbs only 4? of school leavers), its importance for
long-term growth and development will increase. In particular, it is crucial
in addressing the employment needs of a private sector being enhanced by the
adjustment process.
3.    The key sectoral issues are: (i) the 'social' orientation of VET which
has aimed at fulfilling the aspirations of students for further studies rather
than enhancing employability; (ii) METFP's management and planning weakness
and the lack of linkages to employers and the private sector; (iii) outdated
qualifications of VET staff, inherited for the most part from general
education and thus unrelated to current labor market conditions; and (iv)
inadequate and unstable sector financing which has declined over the last six
years.
4.    Government's revised VET policy is designed to address the above issues.
It consists of a shift from a socially oriented supply-driven VET system to an
employment oriented demand-driven system. It requires greater involvement of
the business and industrial community, and will necessitate streamlining and
completing the METFP's organizational structure. New content and instructional
methods will be based upon two ideast 'professionalization' of content and the
use of "dual" training methods. "Professionalization' will increase both the
practical content of technical education and the theoretical content of
apprenticeship training. 'Dual' training will combine theory courses in



2
training establishments with part-time practical instruction and work
experience in business and industry. On the financial side, in 1989 the
vocational training tax was formally allocated to training and will thus
increase resources for VET. Revisions, based on a competitive national
training fund, in the method of allocating resources for training will lead to
more efficient and effective resource use.
5.    Rationale for IDA involvement: The thrust of IDA's country strategy is
to provide consistent and coherent support for the Government's efforts to
eliminate obstacles to long term growth and development. Education and
training issues, especially as they relate to labor market needs, have not
been explicitly addressed in past structural adjustment programs, and previous
human resources projects have been limited to general education with no
specific concern for training for employment in the private sect'r. Through
its involvement, IDA will help integrate these issues into the development
process, and assist in improving Government expenditure patterns in the
sector, while increasing the overall productivity of the work-force through a
better match between supply of and demand for skilled manpower. It will also
help coordinate other aid efforts, primarily through improvements in sector
analysis, planning, budgeting, and management, and the promotion of new
approaches to training.
6.    Proiect Obiectives: The first objective of the project is to make the
technical education and vocational training system demand driven, employment
oriented and responsive to the needs of the productive sectors. The main
strategy to address this objective is to create: (1) a capacity to monitor the
state of the labor market and the performance of training institutions, and
provide feedback to guide the funding of training; and (2) a flexible funding
mechanism to allocate finance to specific training programs based on
identified labor market needs. The second objective is to strengthen the
structure and activities of METFP, the key arm of the Government for
implementing VET policies. This will be achieved by strengthening the
institutional capacity of the METFP, and supporting the development of a
regional VET network.
7.    ProJect Description: The project has three components: (i) strengthening
the administrative capacity of all METFP directorates, and specifically
creating a 'Training and Employment Observatory, which will monitor the labor
market and the employability of VET trainees and provide feedback to guide the
funding of training; (ii) training and upgrading VET staff to improve manager-
ial and administrative staff's familiarity with dual training methods, and to
improve instructional staff's skill specializations; (iii) creating a
"National Training Fund' which will allocate finance to specific training sub-
projects such as the reform of existing training institutions and work
experience internships, based on labor market needs. The total project cost is
estimated at US$15.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$9.5 million (60Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement profile are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project



3
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Republic of
Togo are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8655-TO, dated July 23, 1990, is also attached.
8.    Agreed Actionst Agreement has been reached with the Government on
project objectives and design. Specific agreements cover: (1) the streamlining
and realignment of responsibilities between the METFP's Directorates; (2) the
effective allocation of the vocational training tax to the National Training
Fund (NT?) for the funding of training activities; (3) the legal texts
governing the administrative procedures and management of the NTF; (4) the
pipeline of training projects for the first eighteen months of the NTF's
operations; and (5) the criteria governing selection of training sub-projects
eligible for financing by the NTF. These criteria cover the economic,
instructional, and financial characteristics of sub-projects and include cost-
sharing between Government and the private sector. Other agreements reached
during negotiations include: (i) the overall size of the formal training
system and its share in the education sector's budget; (ii) the technical
education and vocational training investment program for the next three years
and its investment budget for 1991; and (iii) the appointment of personnel to
three key posts (Project Coordinator, Director of the METFP's Directorate of
Studies, Research and Strategic Studies, and the Executive Secretary of the
NTF).
9.    Environmental Aspects: As part of the instructional courses, the
environmental awareness of trainees will be raised. The project activities
themselves will have no adverse environmental effects.
10.   Proiect Benefits: The first benefit of the project is institutional. The
project will strengthen the key strategic functions of the METFP, and put in
place improved procedures for the allocation and use of public funds. Thus,
Government will be better able to administer the VET system. Direct
association of the private sector in the content and operation of the training
activities will establish automatic regulation of the system, thereby
improving its responsiveness to the needs of the economy. The second benefit
is economic. It will come in the form of an annual output of between 500 and
1000 highly skilled and productive workers ready for immediate employment in
pre-identified posts. This will reduce the level of graduate unemployment and
raise the productivity of the workforce, thereby contributing to private
enterprise competitiveness and economic growth. The third benefit is also
economic; the project will produce a number of efficiency gains. Changes in
testing and examinations, together with the adoption of dual training methods
should contribute to 4ecrease student repetitions. Dual training, besides
providing practical work experience, will also free-up training places
allowing more efficient use of existing training facilities and an increase in
the number of in-service trainees. Finally, the use of competitive funds will
promote both quality control of training and cost efficiency improvements.
Efficient resource allocation with better management will reinforce, at the
sector level, the Government's structural adjustment program.

11.   Riskss There are three main risks. First, Government's commitment to
allocate funds for VET through a competitive national training fund (NTF)
rather than through annual budgetary allocations might wane. This was
addressed during project preparation with the finalization of all necessary
legal documents needed to allocate the proceeds of the vocational training tax
to the training fund. To ensure implementation, a specific condition has been
attached to this credit. Resource allocation will also be addressed through
the regular annual reviews of public expenditures and public investments which
are due to take place for this sector in the framework of the macroeconomic
adjustment program. Second, there is a possibility of reluctance on the part
of the private sector to play an active role in training of the workforce. The
second risk has been addressed during project preparation. At that time, the
private sector was fully consulted and played an active role in the
preparation and design of the projects now in the pipeline awaiting NTF
financing approval. In addition, METFP is preparing a guide for employers
interested in using the NTF and will run a national publicity campaign.
Finally, the METFP has limited capacity to manage the implementation of a
project of this nature. This issue is addressed by phasing the implementation
of the project to minimize the burden on the institutions involved in the VET
system. The METFP will be reinforced with short-term consultant services in
specialized training issues, and training programs will be run for the
national team in charge of the project.
12.   Recommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
