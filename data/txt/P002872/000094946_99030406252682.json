Some of the key operational lessons\n            learned include: 1) Particular attention should be paid to\n            effective functioning of the multi-sectoral coordination\n            institutions and mechanisms during project supervision. 2)\n            Up-stream establishment of key procedures and operational\n            manuals before project implementation will help to avoid to\n            delays and facilitate the establishment of a mutual\n            understanding shared by all the actors. 3) A good balance\n            between support of reforms and capacities development is\n            necessary for successful project implementation. 4)\n            Leadership in support of changes is a critical factor for\n            project success. 4) Monitoring & evaluation activities\n            and follow-up of studies should receive adequate attention.\n            5) Programming annual activities requires solid preparation\n            and an in-depth review in order to provide a framework for\n            smooth implementation of the agreed upon activities."}, "docdt": "1998-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
