          Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency:
     Please refer to the above-mentioned Development Credit
Agreement between the Republic of Togo (the Borrower) and the
International Development Association (the Association), dated
October 5, 1990 (the Development Credit Agreement).
     It has occurred to us that a printing mistake has slipped in
the date set forth in Section 3.06 (c).  We wish to correct this
mistake by changing this date to read "February 15, 1991" instead of
"February 15,  1990".
     Please indicate your agreement with this amendment by signing
and dating the enclosed duplicate original of this letter in the
space provided therefor and returning it to us.  This amendment is
effective as of the date of this letter.
                      Very truly yours,
                     Michael J. Gillette
                          Director
