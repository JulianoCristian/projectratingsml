implementation of the Education Participation Improvement\n            Project, achieved through the following components. The\n            schools development grants component would help increase\n            student enrollment, attendance, and retention in primary and\n            secondary education, targeting this funding through\n            Kosovo's municipalities. Selected schools (on the basis\n            of documented problems in school access, and retention) will\n            receive technical assistance (TA), and training in the area\n            of school development planning, while grants finance will\n            also cover community outreach, educational materials, and\n            security activities in the educational environment. Auditing\n            of the school grants program will be conducted annually. The\n            improvement of the education management information system\n            (EMIS) will be strengthened, specifically, EMIS will help\n            monitor school enrollment, attendance, retention or dropout,\n            and completion, including accountability for children in\n            targeted municipalities, not participating in the school\n            system. For this purpose, TA, external training, and\n            necessary equipment supply for municipal, and central\n            offices, will be financed. Project management includes\n            monitoring and evaluation of the school development grants\n            results, further TA, limited computer and office equipment,\n            and staff training."}, "docdt": "2003-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
