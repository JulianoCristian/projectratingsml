"The objectives of the First Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC-1) for Zambia will be\n            to contribute towards: a) preserving macroeconomic stability\n            and improving public sector performance; and b) supporting\n            broad-based growth by improving efficiency in the energy\n            sector and reducing the costs of doing business This program\n            document presents a Development Policy Operation (DPO) to\n            the Republic of Zambia for SDR 12.9 million (US$20 million\n            equivalent) to finance the PRSC-1, designed to further the\n            government's reform program in support of Zambia's\n            Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP). The operation is\n            part of a collective effort by the Government of the\n            Republic of Zambia (GRZ) and Poverty Reduction Budget\n            Support (PRBS) cooperating partners. The PRSC-1 is being\n            designed and implemented within a harmonized framework for\n            the provision of budget support in Zambia. This framework\n            comprises a multi-year Performance Assessment Framework\n            (PAF) and a common review process aimed at reducing\n            transaction costs for the GRZ and the cooperating partners."}, "docdt": "2010-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
