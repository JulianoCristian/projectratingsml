CENTRAL POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
I.  THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      The development of India's economy and the improvement of its
people's standard of living depend to a large degree on the development of
the power sector. Over the last two decades, power demand has grown twice as
fast as the economy, and the power sector now takes the largest share of
public investment (12% of the Sixth Five-Year Plan outlay). This was due to
the rapid development of power-intensive industry and the expansion of rural
electrification tor irrigation.
1.02      In spite of an increase in generating capacity from 5,600 MW in
1960 to about 32,000 MW in 1982, power shortages have been experienced in
various -arts of the country for a number of years, and gaps between supply
and demand will impose major constraints for some years to come.
1.03      Before 1975, power facilities were planned, constructed and
operated by each State to meet its own needs. Because of the rapid growth of
thle power sector, the Government of India (GOI) decided to create new
institutional structures in the sector, and to emphasize central planning of
generation and high voltage transmission with the ultimate objective of
central control through a national grid. The Central Electricity Authority
{CFA) performed studies of a national power system, and GOI decidegvto
proceed with the construction of four large centrally-owned thermal power
stations located at coal fields, supplying bulk power to the States through
an interconnected 400 kV transmission system. The construction of these
power stations (2,000 MW at Singrauli, 2,100 MW at Korba, 2,100 MW at
Ramagundam, and 600 MW at Farakka) was begun with Bank Group financial
assistance. The first phase of the program comprised the first stage of 600
MW at each plant, and its associated transmission. In addition, IDA Credits
for the second stage of Singrauli (1,400 MW) and the second stage of Korba
(1,500 MW), and a Bank loan for the second stage of Ramagundam (1,500 MW),
have been approved. A proposal for the second stage of Farakka (1,500 MW)
has been submitted recently for consideration by the Bank Group. The subject
of this report is the extension of NTPCts 400 kV transmission system to
increase the capacity of power transmission from Ramagundam to the Southern
part of the country and to interconnect the Northern, Western and Southern
Regional grids. A Bank loan of US$250.7 million is proposed.
1.04    The energy and power sectors and the problems associated with the
latter have been fully described in the Staff Appraisal Report No. 3608b-IN



-2-
dated November 30, 1981 for the Second Ramagundam Thermal Power Project.1/
The following paragraphs deal only with the changes that have occurred since
or with sector aspects directly related to the proposed project. Updated
information in regard to the Indian power sector is provided in Annexes 2 to
5.
Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.05    The Bank has made thirteen loans for Indian power projects amounting
to US$982.5 million, and fifteen IDA credits totalling US$2,096.0 million
(Annex 1). Fifteen projects financed under the following loans and credits
have been completed: ten generating projects, the Beas Project (Credit
89-IN), the first three transmission projects (Loan 416-IN, Credits 242-IN
and 377-IN) and the First Rural Electrification Project (Credit 572-IN). The
Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) is expected to be completed in
the first half of 1983. The Third Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan
1549-IN), Singrauli (Credit 685-IN), Korba (Credit 793-IN), and Ramagundam
(Credit 874-IN and Loan 1648-IN) Thermal Power Projects, and the Second Rural
Electrification Project (Credit 911-IN) are in an advanced stage of
implementation. The credit for the Second Singrauli Thermal Project (Credit
1027-IN) and the credit/loan for the first stage of the Farakka Thermal Power
Project (Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN) were approved in May and June 1980.
Korba II (Credit 1172-IN) was approved in July 1981, Ramagundam II (Loan
2076-IN) in December 1981 and the Third Rural Electrification Project (Loan
2165-IN) in June 1982. The Trombay and Second Rural Electrification Projects
are on schedule. The three 200 MW units of the Singrauli Project and the
first 200 MW unit of the Korba Project were commissioned on schedule. The
Farakka and Ramagundam Projects are proceeding satisfactorily after initial
delays.
1.06    A Project Performance Audit Report on the Second Power Transmission
Project (Credit 242-IN), issued on June 3, 1980, stated that the project had
been successful in assisting nine State Electricity Boards in extending their
transmission systems to help meet their growing requirements. Utilization
of generating capacity in the nine SEBs exceeded the appraisal forecast.
Institutional objectives mainly concerned the rehabilitation of the finances
of the SEBs, and while the results achieved by project completion were
modest, improvement was continued by the Third and Fourth Power Transmission
Projects (Credits 377-IN and 604-IN). In FY 1980, seven of the nine
participating SEBs reached their target rate of return of 9.5%. The
conclusions of the Report pointed to: (a) the difficulty for the Bank Group
in adequately supervising work other than procurement on the project, since

No. 3608b-IN) paragraphs 1.04 to 1.12 and 1.17 to 1.35.



-3-
it consisted of many sub-projects scattered all over India, and (b) the
absence of a close working relationship between the Bank Group and the
beneficiary SEBs, which made efforts for institutional improvements
difficult. The Report suggested that more direct involvement with the SEBs
in projects of this nature, where an efficient intermediary is not available,
would be beneficial.
Bank Group's Strategy
1.07    The Bank Group's strategy in the Indian power sector has been to
cooperate with GOI in finding solutions to the many difficult and politically
sensitive problems confronting the Indian electricity supply industry. The
Bank's main objectives in the sector are:
(a)  to eliminate power shortages by the installation of generation
and transmis3ion capacity, and the promotion of measures to
improve the operation and maintenance of existing plant;
(b)  to introduce long-range system planning on a
nationwide basis so as to assure implementation of a
-'   least-cost power development program;
(c)  to promote improvements in sector organization and training; and
(d)  to strengthen the finances of the institutions
in the sector, particularly the State Electricity
Boards.
1.08    The States, through their Electricity Boards, develop and operate
most power facilities. Under the Constitution, power supply is a concurrent
subject, which means that responsibility is shared between the Central
Government and the State Governments, requiring full agreement between them
before action can be taken. Despite many difficulties, improvements achieved
so far have been encouraging. With the establishment of Regional Electricity
Boards (REBs), the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National
Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC), important steps towards an improved
organizational structuy'e of the power sector have been made. CEA was
reorganized and its powers enlarged; amendments in the financial provisions
of the Electricity (Supply) Act clarified the requirements to be followed in
tariff setting, the financial performance of SEBs improved, the majority of
SEBs have completed tariff studies based on marginal cost pricing principles,
CEA has prepared a national long-term power development plan, and the
implementation of increased investments in the sector will help eliminate the
power deficit.
1.09    Because of the rapid expansion of the power industry, all aspects of
the sector needed to be reviewed and solutions found for its various
problems. GOI established in 1978 the Committee on Power, which submitted



-4-
its conclusions to GOI in September 1980. They refer to all major aspects of
the power sector including planning, project formulation and implementation;
operation and maintenance; organization and management; finance, financial
management and tariffs; rural electrification; and research and development.
The recommendations of the Committee on Power, most of which are satisfactory
in light of the Bank Group's strategy, form a basis for improvement of all
those aspects of the power sector. Implementation of the Committee's
recommendations has already started with those aspects that do not require
GOI's formal approval, such as better planning procedures and improved
operating and maintenance management.
1.10    In accordance with undertakings agreed during negotiations for the
Second Korba Thermal Power Project, GOI submitted, in May 1982, a program for
the implementation of five categories of power sector improvements which the
Bank Group considered areas of high priority. Satisfactory progress has been
made in these five areas for which some of the more recent activities and
achievements are as follows:
(a)     Performance of Thermal Power Plants
The Department of Power in GOI has established teams of specialists,
including representatives from CEA, SEBs and manufacturers, to visit all
thermal power plants with 100/120 MW and 200/210 MW generating units in the
country to diagnose technical and operational problems, propose solutions,
and assign responsibilities for their implementation. Repeat visits are
planned to assess progress.
(b)     Coordination of Power Development and Growth in Other Sectors
The Bank Group received the draft national long-range plan for power
development in September 1982. This plan provides forecasts of power demand
through the year 2000 and projects the generating capacity and equipment that
will be required to meet this demand. The draft plan, which is expected to
be finally adopted by the Government, will provide the basis for both
five-year plans andl annual investment programs.
(c)     Intensification of Hydro-Electric Power Development
GOI is progressing with plans for a number of hydro projects, some of
which will be proposed for Bank Group financing and others for bilateral
assistance. Several projects -- among them Vishnu Prayag (UP), Lohari Nag
(UP), Naptha Zhakri (HP), Puyan Kutti (Kerala), and Lower Periyar (Kerala) --
have reached advanced stages of project preparation. The Upper Indravati
project, the first hydro-power project in India to be proposed for Bank Group
financing, is presently being appraised. In addition, GOI is planning to
begin investigations on what is expected to be the largest hydro-power
project in the world -- the 15,000 MW Dihang project in north-eastern India,
where a number of other projects are also under consideration.



-5-
(d)     Strengthening the Role of the Central Sector in Power Generation and
Inter-state High-Voltage Transmission
(i)  GOI, through NTPC, has under construction and partly in
operation over 9,000 MW of power generating capacity. In
addition to the four ongoing Bank-Group financed super-thermal
plants (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka), which (except
for Farakka) are now in their second phases of construction, two
large thermal power plants -- the 1000 MW plant at Rihand (UP)
and the 1260 MW plant at Vindhyachal (MP) -- are also being
undertaken by NTPC. Agreements with the UK and USSR,
respectively, for the financing of these plants were signed in
1982 (para 4.10).
(ii) The proposed project is designed to reinforce the Centrally-
owned NTPC power transmission grid, and provides the first stage
of integration of the Northern, Western, and Southern regional
grids, taking into account compatability for eventual energy
pooling.
(e)     Establishment of Financial Objectives and Policies for their
Implementation, Principles for Evolving Rational Tariff Policies and
Improvements in Management Information and Accounting Systems for
State Electricity Boards.
(i) Draft legislation for amendment of the financial provisions of
the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 has been prepared by GOI for
submission to Cabinet at the next session of Parliament, early
in 1983. These amendments will remove some of the anomalies in
the Act which have been in the past the source of a number of
problems relating to the financial performance of the SEBs
(Annex 2).
(ii) Management consultants have started the review of present
accounting practices in two of the SEBs with the ultimate
objective of developing a uniform system of commercial
accounting for adoption by all of the SEBs. Their review will
be followed by preparation of a draft accounting manual by
September 1983 which will form the basis of the new accounting
system scheduled for introduction in 1984. An accounting unit
is at present being established within CEA to monitor the
development of the new accounting system and the financial
performance of the SEBs.
(iii) With the Third Rural Electrification Project, approved in June
1982, new financial performance criteria for the SEBs were
introduced. These are designed to provide for reasonable



-6-
contributions by the SEBs to power investment, and to gradually
reduce State Government subsidies for rural electrifica;4ion
losses.
Southern Region Demand and Supply
1.11    Data concerning the all-India power demand and supply situation and
outlook are provided in Annex 4. The following paragraphs of this chapter
deal with the demand and supply situation of the Southern Region where the
proposed project is located. The major authorities supplying the Southern
Region are the Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala State
Electricity Boards, and the Mysore Power Corporation (MPC). In addition, a
number of small municipalities are engaged in power supply. All entities,
except MPC, supply electricity to final consumers, but only the four SEBs and
MPC own generation facilities.  MPC supplies about 85% of the power made
available to consumers by the Karnataka SEB.
1.12    The Southern Region is the only fully integrated electricity supply
region in India, controlled by a Regional Load Dispatch Center at Bangalore.
Load frequency control equipment at Bangalore is now operational. The large
hydro component in the system allows energy to be transferred during the
monsoon from SEBs with a reservoir-spilling surplus to others in the Region,
while in the early summer months thermal generation is maximized to husband
scarce water. In addition to its internal integration, the Region often
operates in parallel with the Western Region, particularly the States of
Maharashtra and Gujarat, and with Orissa in the Eastern Region.
1.13    In line with the national pattern, Regional consumption is heavily
oriented towards industry: about 61% of total consumption in the Region is
attributable to industrial consumers, and about 18% to agricultural
consumers. This pattern masks significant differences among States. The
share of agricultural consumption in Tamil Nadu is about 27%, while 70-75% of
Karnataka's and Kerala's supplies go to industry and only 5-8% to
agriculture. Tamil Nadu is the dominant State in the Region with about 40%
of the total consumption of electricity.  Sales in the Region have been
growing at a steady rate of about 7% p.a. between 1970 and 1980, most of
this in periods of supply restrictions. Generation and sales growth in
1979/80 was a minimal 2% largely due to widespread supply difficulties and
low reservoir levels, followed by a return to normal growth in 1980/81 (Annex
6).
1.14    Andhra Pradesh is the only State in the Region that has more than 50%
thermal capacity; Kerala and Karnataka are solely hydro. While installed
capacity has grown at about 7% p.a. between 1970 and 1980, actually available
capacity at peak showed a growth rate of about 7.5%, resulting in a
significant improvement in availability from about 65% to more than 70%. As
energy consumption has been increasing at an annual rate of 7% the system
load factor decreased to about 57% in 1980, from more than 60% in the early



-7-
1970s, making the system peak more pronounced. In recent years, development
has been erratic. Installed capacity has been increasing at about 7% p.a.,
but peak availability declined to just slightly above 60% of installed
capacity. Forced outages have suppressed the growth of peak demand,
increasing the system load factor to more than 70% (Annex 7). As in previous
years, severe supply restrictions were imposed mainly in Karnataka and
Kerala, especially on industrial consumers in 1981/82, ranging from 10% to
50% of potential demand or connected load (Annex 8).
1.15    Potential unconstrained peak capacity demand in the Region is
expected to grow at about 9% p.a. until 1995, energy demand at about 8%.
Large capacity additions due to come on stream during 1982/83 and in
subsequent years are expected to increase supply reliability almost
immediately. The expected loss of load probability during the 1980s is
reasonably low, even with high forced outage rates. Much depends on timely
approval and implementation of generation projects, and the provision of
appropriate transmission capacity (Annex 5).

II. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
Legal Status and Authorities
2.01    NTPC, the beneficiary of the proposed credit, was established in 1975
and is registered under the Companies Act, 1956. It is a company wholly
owned by GOI and functions under the general supervision cf the Ministry of
Energy. Its initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$132
million) was increased to Rs 8,000 million (US$842 million) in June 1980 and
Rs 15,000 million (US$1,579 million) in September 1981. The paid-up capital
of the Corporation on Septeber 30, 1982 was Rs 10,047 million. The
Corporation has a Board of ten Directors including the Chairman and Managing
Director.
2.02    Under its Memorandum and Articles of Association, NTPC has broad
powers to carry out its work. However, the tariffs to be applied as well as
any changes in such tariffs, its investment plans and annual capital budgets,
have to be approved by the Government. NTPC is also subject to periodic
examination by the Committee on Public Undertakings--a body established by
GOI to monitor the performance of public sector enterprises.
2.03    The main objectives for which the Corporation was established are:
(i)      to design, construct, and operate large central thermal
power stations and transmission systems; and
(ii)     to transmit anid sell the power generated.
With the approval of the proposed project, NTPC will be constructing most of
the EHV (extra high voltage) transmission system being established by the
Central Government to develop effective interconnected regional systems for
ultimate integration into a national grid.  NTPC will own and operate this
400 kV transmission system, over which power will be distributed from each
plant and sold in bulk to SEBs, as well as the inter and intra-regional links
being established under this project. Later these systems will be part of
the 400 kV interconnected regional systems which, subsequently, is intended
to be integrated into the national grid.
2.04    NTPC's present program provides for the construction of six thermal
power stations (Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam, Farakka, Rihand and
Vindhyachal). It is also possible that NTPC might ultimately take over
ownership of the 720 MW Badarpur station near Delhi, which is at present
being managed by NTPC on a management-fee basis. NTPC has also undertaken
investigations for identifying additional sites for thermal power stations in
the Central sector. Based on these studies, feasibility reports submitted by
NTPC for pithead developments at Kahalgaon (Bihar), Talcher (Orissa) and
Pench (Madhya Pradesh) are under consideration by COI. Feasibility studies
for other sites, i.e., a Capital Region project near Delhi, Birbhum (West
Bengal) and Mangur (Andhra Pradesh) are under formulation. The total
combined capacity to be installed at these sites in the first instance is



-9-
likely to be about 4,000 MW while the ultimate potential is estimated to be
nearly 10,000 MW.
Organization and Management
2.05    NTPC has entered the operational phase of its development with the
commissioning of the first three generating units constructed by NTPC. The
most recently installed 210 MW unit at the Badarpur Thermal Power Station
near Delhi was synchronized in December 1981 while the first two 200 MW units
at Singrauli were commissioned in February 1982 and November 1982
respectively.
2.06    JIi7PC's organization has so far been construction oriented to cater to
the predominant activity of construction work on the large power plants. A
revised corporate organization structure (Annex 9) has now been designed
keeping in view the beginning of the operations phase of the power plants and
the growth and expansion, in both power generation and transmission,
envisaged for the Corporation in the years to come.
2X07    Earlier, NTPC had adopted a three-tier organization structure.  The
first tier consisted of the corporate functions of Planning and Marketing,
Personnel and Finance which were entrusted with normal corporate level
responsibilities. The second tier consisting of other services relevant to
the construction phase of the projects such as Technical Services, Contract
and Procurement Services, Quality Control, Expediting and Project Management
Services were centralized as service functions and located at headquarters.
The third tier, which embraced direct project activities, consisted of a
project organization for each of the four power plants which were under
construction. Each project organization was headed by a General Manager
entrusted with total responsibility for implementation of all aspects of the
project's construction program. Under this structure, the heads of the
corporate and service functions departments, as well as heads of project
organizations, reported to the Chairman and Managing Director. This, with
accent on centralization at the corporate level, had some major advantages
which undoubtedly served the organization well during the formative years.
2.08    However, with the recent addition of the Rihand and Vindhyachal
projects and the advent of the operational phase of both generation and
transmission, there has been a significant increase in the task before NTPC
in terms of volume, dimension and complexity. The increased scale of
activities, as well as the geographically dispersed nature of operations,
brought into focus the need for greater decentralization. In consultation
with the Central Electricity Generating Board of U.K., an organizational
study was undertaken. As a result of this study, and in-house efforts, a
revised organization structure was developed. The proposals formulated in
this regard have now been considered and approved by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation.



-10-
2.09    Under the new organizational structure (Annex 9), regional groups
headed by Executive Directors have been formed with total responsibility for
planning, design, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations and
maintenance for thermal power stations and associated transmission facilities
in each region. These activities will be carried out within the framework of
overall guidelines laid down by the corporate headquarters. Teams for each
project have also been constituted at the regional level consisting of groups
for planning, engineering, contracts and expediting and will be headed by
senior level officers. This will enable greater accountability of the
technical support functions to the project organizations. At present the
regional headquarters are functioning from Delhi. However, at an appropriate
time they will be shifted to suitable locations within the boundaries of the
respective regions. The organizational set-up at project sites remains the
same as before.
2.10    Under the new set-up the role of the corporate center will be one of
policy making and providing functional guidance to the regional and project
organizations. In addition to the corporate functions of Finance, Personnel
and Planning and Monitoring, a core engineering group responsible to Director
(Technical) and a techno-commercial group responsible to Executive Director
(Commercial) are proposed to be created. In order to ensure uniform
implementation of policies and corporate guidelines, various groups and
departments at the regional and project levels will be functionally
responsible to the corresponding staff departments at the Corporate Center.
2.11    The decentralized organizational structure should contribute
significantly to the effective management of the expanding Corporation
through providing for a greater delegation of responsibility and authority
and through establishing accountability and measurement of performance on
regional and sub-regional levels.
Recruitment and Training
2.12    NTPC is a young organization which is growing rapidly to meet the
demands of its large construction program. The next phase of expansion wil1
involve the need to recruit and train operating staff. When all current
developments have been completed and commissioned, NTPC will have a staff of
about 21,000. The importance, therefore, of implementing training programs
for the various skills required during the construction and operational
phases cannot be too highly stressed. Manpower by category of staff at
September 30, 1982 and additional recruitment required to meet projected
requirements by FY1990 are provided in Annex 10. NTPC's present manpower
represents 43% of its FY1990 requirement (48% for executives, 50% for
Supervisors, and 37% for skilled and unskilled staff). These figures show
that recruitment is progressing at a sufficiently satisfactory level to meet
operational needs as plant completions progress and commercial operations
expand.



-11-
2.13    NTPC has placed special emphasis on the importance of training in its
organizational development, and programs are being developed by the
Corporation which will be backed by 200 MW and 500 MW simulators, financed
from the proceeds of Credits 793-IN and 1053-IN, as well as other modern
facilities for instructing and training the operating staff. Well planned
and well structured training programs have been developed for all categories
of staff. The program is being effectively executed and is modified and
improved on a continuing basis in light of actual experience. Trainee
recruitment, by category of staff, to date and projected requirements to
FY1990 are set forth in Annex 11. Actual trainee recruitment to date as a
percentage of projected requirements by FY1990 is 19% (executives 34%,
Supervisors 18%, and skilled workers 9%).
2.14    Training programs which previously have concentrated on
pre-operational activities such as Planning, Design and Construction
Management, are now aimed more at operations. Some of the current major
activities are:
(a) Training in professional engineering for executive
trainees.
(b) Training in professional engineering for supervisory
trainees.
(c) Accounting training for accounting and managerial staff.
(d) Management development programs.
(e) Seminars and lectures on selected topics.
(f) Familiarization courses for both accounting and managerial
staff on the accounting systems and procedures being
implemented.
Mainly engineering graduates (mechanical, electrical, civil) are being
recruited and inducted into a one-year training program. The first group of
35 young executive trainees was recruited in February 1977. Since then six
more groups consisting of 831 trainees have been recruited, the last of which
(150 trainees) was recruited in September 1982. The training programs have
been well designed to provide exposure to construction and operation,
equipment manufacturing plants, engineering and project management services.
For these purposes, assistance is taken from a large faculty of experienced
engineers and managers selected throughout the country. NTPC is also
utilizing the facilities of the Central Electricity Generating Board (U.K.)
for training of operation and maintenance staff.
2.15    The first two 200 MW generating unit (at Singrauli), which commenced
operation in February and November, 1982 respectively, have been adequately



-12-
staffed. Advance action has been taken for the requirement of subsequent
units for which 146 executives and 119 supervisors are in postion. NTPC has
finalized comprehensive plans for training operational staff, particularly
the non-supervisory staff in the various technical and non-technical trades,
and to provide foremen for the 200 MW units at Singrauli and Korba. The
manpower for these is being drawn from experienced staff as well as from
fresh recruitment. The personnel required for the first 200 MW unit at Korba
are already in position. Recruitment of operational manpower has also
commenced for the subsequent units at Korba and Ramagundam. Key personnel
required for the associated transmission systems, together with adequate
support staff, are in position.
2.16    On-the-job training has high priority.  The methodology includes
classroom lectures, participation in group exercises and discussions
supported by direct reading, audio-visual presentations and plant visits.
Overall training plans and arrangements at this time are satisfactory.
Accounting Organization and Systems
2.17    NTPC continues to report good progress in the planning and
implementation of its finance and accounting organization (Annex 12) and in
the design and implementation of accounting systems and procedures. The
design of accounting systems for both the construction and operational phases
of NTPC's activities has been completed. Implementation of systems for the
construction phase has been completed both at the corporate center at
headquarters, and also at the sites, while systems for the operational phase
have been designed and are being implemented at Singrauli. Consultants are
being utilized for the on-going implementation of systems. To familiarize
staff with the systems and procedures, training courses are being conducted
by the consultants in conjuction with staff members from NTPC's Corporate
Center.
Audit
2.18    The audit of NTPC's accounts and records is undertaken by a
professional auditor appointed by the Company Law Audit Board, on the
recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The auditor
is normally a member of the Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants, and
his audit report on NTPC's financial statements is subject to comment by the
Auditor General. For the audit of the accounts for FYs 1980, 1981 and 1982
two auditors were appointed, Messrs.Raghu Nath Rai and Company and Messrs.
Prasad Azad and Company, both firms of Indian Chartered Accountants. There
were no adverse comments from the auditors on the accounts of each respective
year and the audits were satisfactory to the Bank. It should be borne in
mind that NTPC's activities covered only project construction until FY 1982
when power was sold for the first time. NTPC has already undertaken in
connection with previous credits and loans to furnish to the Bank Group
audited financial statements within seven months of the end of the fiscal



-13-
year to which they relate, together with a certified report by the auditors,
and a review of the accounts by the Director of Commercial Audits. This
undertaking has been reconfirmed during negotiations for the proposed Loan.

III.     THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01    NTPC's development program, previously consisting of four central
power stations with associated 400 kV transmission (Singrauli, Korba,
Ramagundam and Farakka), has recently been expanded to include two additional
power stations, Vindhyachal and Rihand, as well as the proposed Fifth Power
Transmission Project. All power plants are situated at coal fields as the
resulting reduced coal transport costs far outweigh the increased costs of
power transmission. The Vindhyachal Project will be located near Waidhan in
Madhya Pradesh with an initial capacity of 1,260 MW and ultimate envisaged
capacity of 2,260 MW, while the Rihand Project will be located near Bijpur
in Uttar Pradesh with an initial capacity of 1,000 MW and an ultimate
capacity of 3,000 MW. With the addition of these two new projects NTPC's
approved current development program, which is compatible with the India Long
Term Power Plan, will provide a total capacity of 9,060 MW.
The Project
3.02    The Project would provide for:
(i) an increased capacity of power transmission from the Ramagundam
thermal power plant (2,100 MW final capacity) to the southern part
of the country;
(ii) a strong power transmission tie between the predominantly
hydro-based Southern Regional grid and the predominantly
thermal-based Western Regional grid; and
(iii) an asychronous inter-tie between the Northern and the Western
Regional grids which would permit larger power transfers to meet
the growing system needs in the context of the present stage of
system operation, control and communication facilities while also
ensuring the stability of the systems.                                K
3.03    The Project would include:  about 550 km of 400 kV double-circuit
lines, and 560 km of 400 kV single-circuit lines; the construction or
extension of a number of related 400/220 kV substations; a back-to-back high
voltage direct current (HVDC) substation at the future Vindhyachal thermal
power plant as part of the 400 kV asynchronous link between the Singrauli and
Korba thermal power stations; technical services for the carrying out of
detailed equipment and system engineering and supervision during
construction, for the HVDC back-to-back line at Vindhyachal; and, metering,
instrumentation and communication facilities. The proposed project also
provides power line carrier communication (PLCC) equipment for speech
transmission, line protection and data transmission on each 400 kV line.
3.04    The Central Power Transmission Project, which is described in detail
in Annex 13, provides for the construction of the following 400 kV lines and
400/220 kV substations (see attached map):

Singrauli  - extension for the 400 kV Singrauli - Vindhyachal
line
Vindhyachal- extension for the 400 kV Singrauli - Vindhyachal
line and a 500 MW twin modula (two 250 MW) HVDC
back-to-back inter-tie linking the Singrauli and
Korba thermal power plants.
Estimated Cost
3.05    The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during
construction, duties and taxes, and front-end fee is Rs 4,750 million US$500
million) Based on the experience with similar projects in India, the direct
and indirect foreign currency costs are estimated at about Rs 1,864 million
(US$193 million) and the local currency cost at Rs 2,916 million (US$307
million). The estimated costs of the Project are set out in Annex 14 and
summarized in Table 3.1 below:

3.06    The estimates for the main items of equipment and materials are based
on the quotations received since 1980 for similar projects, such as the 400
kV links and substations associated with the Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and
Farakka power plants, with prices updated to mid-1982 levels. It has been
assumed that the foreign cost would represent the following percentages of



-17-
the total cost:  100% of the cost of equipment for the HIIVDC substation, the
metering and instrumentation and the communication equipment; 80% of the cost
of steel in the towers for 400 kV lines; 50% of the cost of insulators and
hardware; 36% of the cost of conductors and 20% of the cost of 400/220 kV
transformers. The rest of the substation equipment is assumed to contain no
significant foreign components with the exception of the 50 MVar shunt
reactors for which the estimated cif price has been considered as foreign
cost. Inland freight and insurance is calculated at 4% of ex-works price
plus excise duty (8% of ex-factory component) for local supply, and 4% of cif
cost plus custom duty plus landing charges on imported equipment. Customs
duties and landing charges for imported equipment have been assumed as 50%
and 2% of the cif cost. Excise and sales tax is charged at 4% each on the
ex-works cost. Erection is estimated at 8% of the electrical equipment cost.
3.07    Physical contingencies of 10% on construction costs and 5% on the
equipment costs have been allowed to provide for unforseen factors. In
assessing price contingencies, it has been assumed that contracts will either
be on a fixed price basis or with ceiling on price inflation as was the case
in the past with some of NTPC's contracts. Costs for equipment and erection
have been escalated at 8.5% for FY1983, 8% for FY1984, 7.5% for FY1985, 7%
for FY1986 and 6% yearly after FY1986 to allow for estimated price increases.
Project Financing
3.08    The proposed loan of US$250.7 million, representing about 50% of the
project cost (excluding duties and taxes and interest during construction and
including the capitalized front-end fee), would be applied to the cif and/or
ex-factory prices of equipment and materials, and to the cost of consultants'
services. The credit would cover all the foreign exchange costs and about
18% of the local costs. GOI would provide the balance of the funds required
in the form of loan and equity share capital.
Engineering
3.09    The 400 kV transmission system, being implemented by NTPC under their
thermal power projects and by the SEBs under the power transmission projects,
has been based on the recommendation of CEA, and has been included in the
Long Term Power Plan as part of the least-cost transmission component of that
plan. CEA had employed under the Fourth Power Transmission Project (Credit
604-IN) consultants (Teshmont of Canada) for system planning. Their
recommendations in 1977 have been continuously updated by CEA based on
in-house studies to reflect changing system conditions. The major elements
of the 400 kV transmission design and construction have been standardized for
all India and form the basis for detailed design of the lines.
3.10    NTPC has also carried out comprehensive engineering studies on
over-voltage and stability problems to establish equipment parameters for the
systems implemented by them. As the digital model used in the studies is



-18-
limited in the representation of various non-linearities, over-voltage
studies are being taken up through the transient network analyzer technique
also. These studies are being financed under the Second Korba Thermal Power
Project (Credit 1172-IN).
3.11    The proposed project consists of inter-regional links using both HVDC
and 400 kV AC, as well as 400 kV AC intra-regional links. These have been
established by CEA on the basis of system studies aiming at evolving a power
transmission system based on requirements to the end of the decade. CEA,
with the assistance of consultants, is extending these studies to 1995. The
broad scope of these studies (not part of the project) includes:
-   expansion of the 400 kV system with an overlay of higher AC
voltage (e.g. 765 kV);
-   introduction of HVDC transmission of suitable voltage;
-   staging of system development for the intermediate period; and
-   economic evaluation and optimization of various alternatives.
3.12    As part of the proposed project, NITPC will undertake, with the
assistance of consultants, detailed equipment and system engineering and
supervision during construction for the back-to-back HVDC link at
Vindhyachal. These technical services would require an input of about 190
man-months of consultancy at an average rate of about US$13,000 per man-month
including salary, fees, international travel and subsistence.
Construction and Procurement
3.13      The Project involves construction of 400 kV transmission lines and
erection of substations and high voltage D.C. terminal equipment for the
back-to-back link. NTPC has been constructing through contractors 400 kV
lines and substations effectively over the last few years under each of its
thermal power projects financed by the Bank Group. The same arrangement for
construction of the lines and substations is proposed to be followed for this
project too. W4hile NTPC would procure through international competitive
bidding the conductors, line material such as insulators and hardware and the
electrical equipment including metering and instrumentation, for a total
amount of about US$145 million, separate contracts for supply and erection
of towers, stringing of conductors, design of structures, civil works and
commissioning of lines and substations, totalling about US$140 million, would
be entrusted to contractors based on local competitive bidding. The high
voltage DC back-to-back link, estimated at about US$118.5 million is a
technology being introduced for the first time in the Indian power sector and
therefore, the contract for the supply of equipment, would include adequate
provision for supervision of erection and commissioning. The engineering
of the link would be handled by competent consultants (see para. 3.12).



-19-
3.14      The project construction implementation schedule is shown in Annex
15. Project completion is expected by March 1988.
3.15      Procurement of equipment and materials in an amount of about US$240
million to be financed from the proposed credit would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's
guidelines. Documents for individual contracts above US$2,500,000 equivalent
would be subject to prior review by the Association. Bidding documents for
such equipment, and tender analyses and recommendations for award of
contracts, would be prepared by NTPC, where necessary with the assistance of
its consultants, and approved by the Bank Group. The contracts could include
civil works in certain cases where these cannot be disassociated from the
equipment contract, as for instance, the substation structure. Local
manufacturers would be expected to bid for almost all categories of equipment
and materials. A domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is
less, would be applied in bid comparison for equipment and material
contracts. To prevent administrative procurement delays, in cases where the
lowest evaluated bidder is a foreign manufacturer, GOI agreed during
negotiations to promptly grant import permission for such items.
Disbursement
3.16      Disbursements from the proposed credit would be made against 100%
of the cost of consultants retained for the equipment and system engineering
and supervision during construction for the HVDC back-to-back substation at
Vindhyachal (para. 3.12) and against the cost of equipment and materials to
be financed from the proposed credit, on the following basis:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment and materials procured
in India subject to international competitive bidding; and
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of equipment and materials procured
abroad.
Estimated disbursements as provided in Annex 16, have been determined by NTPd
and relate to the project implementation schedule (Annex 15). Although the
period of disbursements (5-1/2 years) corresponds to that of the Bank
disbursements profile, the proportionate disbursements by semester differ
somewhat to reflect NTPC's experience in implementation of transmission
components of other projects for which their disbursement estimates have
proven reasonably accurate.
Ecology
3.17      No ecological problems are expected.  Conductor sizes and spacing
will be designed to keep energy losses and radio interference within
acceptable limits. Since one 400 kV circuit is equivalent to approximately



-20-
three and a half 220 kV circuits, the amount of right of way is greatly
reduced and the appearance improved. The substations will be provided with a
fire fighting system which will conform to fire insurance regulations of
India and will be equipped with both AC and Diesel-driven pumps. An
automatic heat-actuated emulsifying system is proposed for transformers.
Project Risks
3.18      The principal risk is the possibility of slippage which could give
rise to delayed commissioning of the power transmission facilities. Such
possible slippage would normally have no negative impact on the continuity of
electricity supply, but would result in delay of the economic benefits of
system interconnection. To ensure effective coordination of the different
activities during project implementation, NTPC will use PERT charts, which
not only schedule the various physical activities but also indicate the
phasing and quantum of inputs such as financial resources, manpower of
different types, scarce materials, etc. In view of NTPC's previous
experience with transmission construction, it is expected that the risk of
slippage will be kept to a minimum through careful coordination and
supervision during construction, careful attention when placing contracts,
and to the capability of manufacturers to meet the delivery schedule.
3.19      Other risk areas are in engineering design, equipment quality and
cost overruns. These risks have been carefully assessed and the following
safeguards taken:
(a) NTPC will be assisted by consultants in those areas where it has
not sufficient experience, which should minimize problems due
to error at the engineering and design stages; and
(b) project costs are based on similar works currently in progress
in India; provision has been made for cost escalation and there
should be little risk of any substantial cost overrun.
3.20      There is also risk of damage due to fire, explosion, etc, which is
covered by insurance provided by the respective contractors during the
construction stage and by GOI through its self-insurance policy after
commissioning.

IV,  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A .   NATIONAUL THEWMAL POWER CORPORATIGN LIMITED (NTPC)
Investment Program
4.01    NTPC is currently in the seventh year of an investment program which
originally provided for the constrtuction of four large thermal power stations
with an aggregSate capacity of 7,300 P. together with about 6,000 circuit
kilometers of associated 400 kV transmission lines, estimated to cost about
Rs 4l1,i00 million (US84,767 million), However, because of rescheduling and
expansio;,i of the construction program, the investment program has been
subjeet ro conitinuous review over the past six years, with appropriate
revisions being made during appraisal of the previous projects.  Revisions
were made during appraisal of the proposed project to reflect (i) increase in
the expected base costs of equipment; (ii) increase in price contingency
factors attributable to higher projected inflation rates; (iii) rescheduling
of generating plant commissioning dates; (iv) provision for projects not yet
identified (3,000 MW), extending the investment program from FY1991 to
FY1996; and (v) inclusion of the proposed project.
4.02    NTPC's currently revised investment program is set out in Annexes 18
and 19 and indicates capital expenditure of Rs 159,162 million (US$16,754
aill-on) over the twenty-year period FY 1977 to FY 1996, reflecting an
increase of 138% (Rs 92,295 million, US$9,715 million) over the investment
program as previous"ly revised during the Second Ramagundam appraisal (FY 1977
to FY 1991). The increase in generating capacity and transmission facilities
accounts for about Rs 79,500 million (US$8,370 million) or 86% of the cost
increase. The remaining 14% of the increase in the investment program is due
to increased costs for station and transmission facilities at Singrauli,
Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka (Annex 19), largely attributable to (a) price
escalation resulting from slippage in commissioning of power units, (b)
revision of construction and main plant equipment base costs to 1982 prices,
(c) increase in foreign costs in terms of local currency resulting from
changes in the exchange rate applied, and (d) increase in price contingencies
resulting from application of revised inflation factors. Financial
statements showing both past performance and future forecasts of NTPC's
consolidated operations are provided in Annexes 21 through 23. Assumptions
upon which the forecasts are based are provided in Annex 24.
Future Earnings
4.03    NTPC commenced commercial operations in February 1982 when its first
200 MW generating unit at Singrauli was commissioned. The growth of power
generation and unit sales resulting from plant commissioning (Annex 17), and
the subsequent stabilization of generation, for the ensuing thirteen- year
period to FY 1995, is set forth in Annex 20. NTPC's projected earnings are
based on the assumption that NTPC will supply bulk power at 400 kV to State
Electricity Boards at regional tariff levels sufficient to enable it to earn



-22-
a 9.5% return on the historic value 1/ of average net fixed assets in
operation from FY199l when NTPC's sales volume is estimated to reach about
83% of the maximum output of the four power projects Singrauli, Korba,
Ramagundam and Farakka. Between FYs1984 and FY1990 NTPC should achieve a
minimum rate of return of 8%. This return is heavily influenced by the point
in time within any given year of commissioning of assets and the assumption
of stabilization periods of generation plant. Consequently, during
FY1984-1990 the revenues, investment costs and operating expenditures should
be adjusted to reflect the hypothetical situation of fully operative and
stabilized generation plant (for detailed explanation see Annex 21). During
negotiations an assurance was  obtained that NTPC will achieve in FY17917,and
maintain thereafter, a rate of return of not less than 9.5% on the net
average fixed assets in operation. Between FYs1984 and 1990 a minimum rate
of return of 8% per year will be achieved using the adjusted assets,
operating expenditures and revenues as explained above.
NTPC Consolidated Operations
4.04    The Income Statement set out in Annex 21 shows the projected
consolidated operating results of NTPC from FY1983 through FY1995. The
forecast earnings performance of NTPC is satisfactory. On the basis of the
projections the average bulk supply price in FY1991 will be 43.9 paise
(USc4.6) per kWh which represents an increase of 12.1 paise over the 31.8
paise per kWh projected during the Second Ramagundam appraisal. The increase
of 12.1 paise is comprised of:
(a)  Base fuel costs                      2.8 paise per kWh
(b)  Operations and Maintenance costs  1.1 paise per kWh
(c)  Depreciation                         2.0 paise per kWh
(d) Return at 9.5% on average net
fixed assets in operation           6.2  paise per kWh
Total                               12.1  paise per kWh
- of which 1.6 paise per kWh is attributable to the proposed
transmission project which is not directly revenue producing.
1/ Fixed assets are recorded at historical cost as the Government does not
permit NTPC to revalue to current price levels.



-23-
For the years FY1983 to FY1991 regional bulk supply tariffs have been
projected to progressively increase from 32.2 paise per kWh in FY1983 to the
43.9 paise per kWh (excluding fuel surcharge) required to achieve the
covenanted rate of return of 9.5% in FY 1991 (para. 4.03).
4.05    NTPC will become profitable in FY1983 and, as a consequence of the
rapid commissioning of plant from FY 1984, earnings will rise rapidly
thereafter. The rate of return will continue to increase to 12.3% in FY1994
when all generating units in each of the stations will be operating at full
capacity.
NTPC Regional Operations
4.06    Regional income statements for the Northern, Western, Southern and
Eastern Regions set out in Annexes 25 to 28 showing the projected operating
results for each region from FY1983-FY1995 are satisfactory. All four
Regions are projected to achieve a 9.5% rate of return in FY1991, the
qualifying year (para. 4.03) for NTPC consolidated operations. Minor losses
occur in FYs1984, 1985 and 1989 for the Southern Region, and in FYs1985 and
1986 for the Eastern Region, which are acceptable at that stage in NTPC's
development program. Power sales from the generating stations in each region
will be priced at a uniform regional bulk supply tariff (para. 4.17).
Operating costs of the transmission facilities provided by the proposed
project will be recovered through the regional tariffs.
Taxation
4.07    NTPC is liable for income tax under the Income Tax Acts.  However,
because of the large capital expenditure program between FY 1979 and FY 1995,
an income tax liability will not arise in the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, a tax equalization reserve is not necessary.
Internal Cash Generation FY 1977 - FY 1995
4.08    A Statement of Sources and Applications of Funds covering NTPC's    K
current investment program is provided in Annex 22. Internally generated
funds are expected to contribute 12% to NTPC's investment program between
FY1983 and FY1992 (Table 4.1), the year in which the last of the Bank Group
financed power units (Farakka) will be commissioned. Internal cash
generation rises rapidly from FY1989 and is projected to provide 100% of the
investment funds required by the investment program from FY 1993 to FY 1995
(Rs 11,924 million, US$1,255 million). This latter three year period of the
investment program covers only the provision for projects not yet identified
as all defined and approved projects are projected as completed by FY 1992.
Dividends on equity share capital are not included in the forecasts on the
assumption that surplus funds would be applied to the expansion of NTPC's
activities beyond its current investment program. From the Eirst year of



-24-
operations onward, debt service coverage is satisfactory at 1.3 times and
above.
NTPC's Financing Plan FY 1983 - FY 1992.
4.09    The financing plan for the ten year period FY1983-92 is set out in
Table 4.1 and is satisfactory. The investment cost of the proposed project
represents about 4% of the construction expenditures in the financing plan.
4.10    In addition to the proposed project and a provision for projects not
yet identified, two new projects (Rihand and Vindhyachal) have been added to
the investment program and financing plan since approval of the Second
Ramagundam project. The Rihand project (2 units of 500 MW) is being
implemented by a consortium of British companies led by Northern Engineering
Industries Limited and is being financed by the U.K. Government. The loan
of p344 million bears interest of 7.75% per annum with principal repayable in
semi-annual installments over ten years, excluding a five-year grace period.
Equipment and materials, supplied by the U.S.S.R., for the Vindhyachal
project (six units of 210 MW and associated transmission facilities) are
being financed by a credit of about U.S.S.R. roubles 317 million from the
U.S.S.R. Government. The credit bears interest at 2-1/2% per annum with
principal repayable in equal annual installments within a period of 17 years
and with the first installment being payable in the third year after the
first drawing from the credit. Interest and principal payments will be made
in Indian currency.
4.11     Bank financing of the proposed project, US$250.7 million, together
with Bank Group financing of NTPC's investment program to date, in total
US$2,101 million, represents about 17% of the total investment involved
(excluding the provision for projects not yet identified).

Onlending Agreement
4.12    The Bank Loan for the proposed project will be onlent to NTPC by GOI
in accordance with an acceptable onlending agreement as a condition of
effectiveness of the Credit. As in previous lending operations, the terms of
the onlending agreement would provide for maturity in 20 years, including a
grace period of 5 years, and repayment of principal in equal semi-annual
installments, with interest payable on outstanding balances at not less than
12% per annum, except as the Bank may otherwise agree. The rate of interest
at which GOI currently lends to industrial and commercial undertakings in the
power sector is 12.5% per annum and reflects an increase from the rate of
11.75% in effect at the time of the Second Ramagundam appraisal. The foreign
exchange risk would be borne by the Government. An, assurance was obtained
during negotiations that GOI will ensure prompt availability to NTPC of

U.S.S.R. loans.



-26-
sufficient funds to complete the project, including any additional funds
which might be required due to cost overruns or other unforeseeable factors.
Future Finances
4.13    Actual and forecast balance sheets, at March 31 annually from FY1977
through FY1995, are set out in Annex 23 and reflect a satisfactory financial
position for each of these years. The balance sheets reflect the phased
construction program, the commencement of commercial operations in FY1983,
and the financing of NTPC's capital requirements by GOI through a combination
of long-term borrowing and equity capital, in a ratio which would normally
not exceed 1:1. Initially the equity portion of financing would be released
by GOI followed by loan capital. Table 4.2 summarizes NTPC's financial
position at three significant points in its development.
(a)  at March 31, 1983 - end of the year in which NTPC will become
revenue earning;
(b)  at March 31, 1989 - end of the year following the year in
which the proposed project is completed; and
(c)  at March 31, 1994 - end of the first year in which all of
generating units of the approved projects in the investment
program are operating at full capacity.
4.14    These forecasts indicate that by March 31, 1983, when NTPC becomes
revenue earning, total capitalization will be Rs 17,005 million (US$1,790
million), divided between GOI loans (including the onlending of Bank Group
finance) and equity capital in a ratio of 30/70. Six years later (March 31,
1989), after the proposed project is completed, total capitalization will
have risen to Rs 113,973 million (US$11,997 million) reflecting a debt/equity
ratio of 48/52. No external debt or equity financing is forecast after
FY1992 for the current investment program and this, combined with a
significant increase in internal cash generation, will reduce the debt/equity
ratio to 33/67 by March 31, 1994.

Borrowing Powers
4.15    The Companies Act 1956 (Section 293.1d) limits borrowing by NTPC to
an amount equal to the aggregate of the paid up share capital and "free
reserves (i.e. those which are not set apart for specific purposes), except
with the consent of the Corporation in general meeting. During negotiations,
an assurance was obtained that NTPC will inform the Bank Group beforehand of
any proposal to alter or modify existing limitations on the borrowing powers
of its Board of Directors.
Commercial Arrangements for Sale of NTPC Energy
4.16    Under previous credits and loans GOI and NTPC agreed to prepare bulk
supply contracts for the sale of energy to the SEBs on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank Group. They also agreed to forward a final draft of
the contracts for the Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and Farakka power stations
six months prior to the first sale of energy from each respective power
station. Preliminary draft contracts have been provided to the Bank Group
for Singrauli and Korba which in principle are acceptable,however final
drafts for Singrauli and Korba which were due by August 1981 and July 1982
respectively have not yet been provided. The reason for this delay is that
NTPC has not yet been able to reach agreement on the financial terms of sale
with the relevant SEBs. In the interim NTPC has been selling power from the
Singrauli station at the inter-State rate of 35 paise per kWh with agreement



-28-
that such sales would be retroactively adjusted to the bulk sale contract
price when final agreement has been reached. Consequently GOI and NTPC agreed
during negotiations that bulk supply contracts for the sale of electricity
from the Singrauli and Korba power plants must be finalized and signed by all
concerned parties as a condition of effectiveness for the proposed project.
It was clarified during negotiations that inter-regional sales of power would
be priced at the tariff rate of the receiving Region for committed power
allocation. WThere sales are in excess of the committed power allocation,
the tariff rate of the generating Region would apply.
4.17    NTPC bulk supply contracts will establish regional tariffs which will
be applied to power sales in each respective region. Operating costs
applicable to the transmission facilities of-the proposed project are
absorbed by the relevant regional NTPC organizations. Recovery of such
costs, therefore, is reflected in the projected regional tariffs as a
separate component of these tariffs. The regional income statements set out
in Annexes 25 to 28 show the projected regional tariffs, in current rupees,
from FY1983 to FY1995. The regional tariffs projected for FY1991, the
qualifying year for NTPC to achieve the 9.5% rate of return, are as follows:
Paise/kWh
(as of FY1991)
Northern Region - Singrauli )
- Rihand       )             38.3
Western Region  - Korba         )
- Vindhyachal )              43.4
Southern Region - Ramagundam                  53.1
Eastern Region  - Farakka                     46.0
NTPC Consolidated Average Tariff              43.9
Variations in the above tariffs reflect regional differences in capital
investment, coal costs, investment timing and level of energy generation in
FY1991.
B. _NDHRA PRADESH STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD (APSEB)
4.18    APSEB will be the major beneficiary of the proposed project as the
substations and 400 kV transmission lines at Ramagundam, Vijayawada and
Nellore will be located in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Consequently a
significant proportion of the power carried by these facilities will be
consumed in this State.
4.19    APSEB uses full commercial accounting for project and operational
activities. Although internal reporting conforms to the commercial basis,



-29-
the annual audited statements of account do not as they are published in
accordance with the present requirements of the Electricity (Supply) Act
1948. Amendments to the Act, anticipated to be incorporated in early 1983,
will permit the presentation of audited accounts on a commercial basis.
Investment Program
4.20    The investment program for the seven year period FY1983 to FY1989
envisages capital expenditure of Rs 21,433 million (US$2,256) and will
provide additional installed capacity of 1,760 MW (1,340 MW hydro and 420 MW
thermal) or 81% over the present level. Power generation is projected to
increase by 7,554 GWh (90%) by FY1989 due to the added capacity and higher
efficiency of new plant.
Future Earnings
4.21    The Income Statement set out in Annex 29 shows the actual and
projected operating results from FY1980 through FY1989, adjusted for
inflation. The forecast earnings performance of APSEB is satisfactory,
reflecting a rate of return ranging between 9.5% and 12.3% between FY1983 and
FY1989. No State Government subsidies, covering rural electrification
losses, are projected for this period as APSEB will be able to achieve a
satisfactory cash generation without such State subsidization. The average
APSEB tariff is projected to increase from 42.4 paise per kWh in FY1982 to
55.5 paise per kWh in FY1989.
Internal Cash Generation
4.22    A statement of internal cash generation is provided in Annex 30
showing actual and forecast cash generation for the period FY1980 through
FY1989. Net cash generation, as a percentage of three-year average of
capital expenditure, ranges between 30.8% and 45.4% for the forecast period
FY1983 through FY1989 thus satisfying the covenant established under the
Third Rural Electrification Project which requires a minimum 20% contribution
to investment.

V. JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
5.01    The proposed project, consisting of (i) a 400 kV network expansion
within the Southern Region, (ii) a 400 kV transmission line linking the
Southern and Western Regions, and (iii) an HVDC back-to-back link between
NTPC stations in the Northern and Western Regions, is justified as part of
the least-cost transmission component of the recently completed long-term
generation capacity expansion plan for the Indian power sector. It provides
needed additional transmission within the Southern Region, and establishes
the initial high-voltage inter-Regional links that will be the first step
towards an integration of the national grid.
Method of Analysis
5.02    In September 1982, CEA completed a 15-year least-cost generation
expansion plan, which is reviewed in Annex 5. Having determined the optimum
plant program for the forecast demand in each Region, the plan develops an
optimum transmission grid configuration for that Region. This two-step
approach is reasonable in India where selection of plant sites (hydro,
pithead coal-fired) is fairly limited, and network costs do not influence the
optimal plant mix. This intra-Regional optimization results in a 400 kV grid
configuration which encompasses, inter alia, the lines proposed under the
project. As the intra-Regional lines are justified by 1995 as part of the
least-cost program, the analysis centers on the rate of return of the
transmission lines, and the appropriateness of the timing of the investment.
This is done by comparing the costs of the transmission facilities with the
cost incurred in case of an outage.
5.03    The two inter-Regional transmission links are examined in comparison
to the investment that would be necessary to provide peaking capacity in
either Region in the absence of the project. The method compares the present
values of the transmission links and those of expansions of thermal capacity
by amounts equivalent to the capacity made available by inter-Regional
transmission. In addition, energy cost savings arising from transfers of
energy between Regions with different generating costs are identified.
5.04    All costs are expressed in CIF (border price) terms or their
equivalents. For local cost components, a standard conversion factor of 0.8
is used. Unskilled labor is valued at 75% of its market wage.
Intra-Regional Lines
5.05    The transmission options related to the least-cost generation
expansion plan are outlined for the year 1995 in Annex 32. In the long run,
the transmission grid development in the Southern Region is straightforward,
as capacity expansion takes place relatively more in the North, whereas load
growth is higher in the South.



-31-
5.06    The load flow studies performed by the CEA examine various conditions
for the year 1989, the anticipated year of completion:
- maximum load, maximum thermal despatch
- maximum load, maximum hydro dispatch
- maximum load, normal dispatch, etc.
The variation in hydropower affects mostly the 220 kV network, and increases
only marginally the North to South power flow on the 400 kV network. By far
the most constraining condition consists in sending out the maximum output
from the Ramagundam thermal plant operating as base load. In this condition,
the proposed network would withstand single outages on the inland lines not
covered by the project, but this would be no longer true when one of the
following project components is delayed:
Section                                 Shortage (MW)
(a)  Ramagundam-Mangur                             100 to 400
(b)  Mangur-Vijayawada                             100 to 400
(c)  Vijayawada-Nellore                             50 to 200
(d)  Nellore-Redhills                                0 to 150
5.07    The shortages are in round figures; they vary according to which one
of the seven inland lines is tripped along the alternative route from
Ramagundam to Redhills. They disappear during the wet quarter when the 500
MW units are maintained and also another quarter on sections (c) and (d) when
200 MW units are maintained. They are reduced by 20% at all times due to
forced outages. The distribution of avoided shortages over the year is taken
as follows:
Section          6 Months            3 Months          3 Months
(a)         80 to 320 MW           0 to 160              0
(b)         80 to 320 MW           0 to 160              0
(c)         40 to 160 MW              0                  0
(d)          0 to 120 MW              0                   0
5.08    Assuming a 5% outage rate for each of the seven inland lines, the
probability of having an outage is 35%, i.e. 4.5 weeks per quarter. Further
assuming a 90% availability for line sections (c) and (d), and 97.5%
availability for sections (a) and (b), the total shortages avoided in 1989
amount to 208 GWh on all four sections.
5.09    The cost of outages avoided as proxy for benefits is estimated as the
economic costs incurred by consumers by the use of alternative energy during
periods of power cuts. For the major consumer categories, this amounts to
the following values:



-32-
Regional
share of total
Consumer category             Value (Rs/kWh)        consumption (%)
Industrial and similar            0.98                      74
Agriculture                       2.49                      18
Domestic/Commercial               3.33                      18
Weighted average                  1.77                     100
5.10    The economic internal rate of return of the intra-Regional
transmission links is about 13% (Annex 33).  The rate of return is not
significantly sensitive to reasonable variations in costs and benefits. The
appropriateness of timing of the transmission links within the Region can be
gauged by comparing the annuitized cost of the links per kWh of outage
avoided (about Rsl.10/kWh) with the estimated cost of outage in 1989 (Rs
1.77/kWh). The differential indicates that the lines are justified in or
before 1989.
Southern/Western Region Intertie
5.11    The AC link between the two Regions consists of a double circuit line
between Ramagundam and Chandrapur. The 1,000 MW capacity of this link
results, after netting out losses and taking into account availability, in
about 950 MW available capacity for the receiving Region. According to CEA
calculations, an increase of that magnitude in the peak demand would augment
the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) from the target of 1% to 1.8%, so that
this support would be available at least 98.2% of the time. Netting out 2%
of power losses, this link provides then a peaking capacity of 912 MW. This
capacity, in the absence of the link, would have to be provided by 2x5Q0 MW
additional capacity in the receiving Region. Under the circumstances
prevailing in India, this capacity would be coal-fired thermal.
5.12    The economic cost streams of the transmission link and the
alternative solution of an increase in generating capacity are shown in Annex
33. At any discount rate within a reasonable range, the transmission link
solution is the lower-cost option by a wide margin (Annex 34).
5.13    In addition to the justification as least-cost solution, the
existence of the transmission link will make possible energy transfers from
the Western to the Southern Region during off-peak periods. The estimated
marginal off-peak energy cost differentials in 1980 (in 1982 prices) are
expected to be about 3.7 paise/kWh during the wet (monsoon) quarter, and
about 6.7 paise/kWh during the dry season. Assuming an all-year weighted
average differential of about 5 paise/kWh, a feasible transfer period of
about 6,000 hours per year would result in an annual marginal energy cost
saving of about Rs300/kW, or about Rs273 million per year for the available
912 MW at the receiving end. By 1995, the wet season cost differential would



-33-
be negligible, but dry season transfers at a cost differential of about 2.8
paise/kWh would still be feasible.
Northern/Western Region HVDC Intertie
5.14    This link consists of a 400 kV line between Vindhyachal and Korba,
a new AC 400 kV substation and a HVDC back-to-back link at Vindhyachal, and
an expansion of the AC 400 kV substation at Korba. After taking into account
availability and losses, 466 MW of additional capacity could be made
available in the receiving Region. In the absence of the link, this would be
provided by a 500 MW thermal unit, most likely by expansion in one of the
pithead coal-fired stations.
5.15    The economic cost streams of the DC link (including the full AC part
of the link), and of the alternative solution of thermal capacity expansion
are shown in Annex 35. At any discount rate within a reasonable range, the
DC transmission link solution is the lowest-cost option by a ratio of almost
2:1.
5.16    As in the case of the Southern/Western link, the interconnection will
also make off-peak energy transfers possible. In 1989 and the following
early years, the flow would be from the Western to the Northern Region
because of off-peak marginal energy cost differentials of 6.5 paise/kWh (wet)
and 3.2 paise/kWh (dry). In 1995, off-peak marginal energy costs during the
dry period are approximately equal in both Regions, but wet season energy
would flow from the North to the West because of a cost differential of about
5.1/kWh resulting from accelerated hydro development in the North. Assuming
again initially 6,000 transfer hours per year, the annual marginal energy
cost saving would amount to about RslOO million, decreasing by 1995 to about
Rs7O million per year if only wet season transfers were made.
Tariffs and Cost of Supply
5.17    The main single beneficiary SEB under the project is the Andhra
Pradesh State Electricity Board. In recent years, average tariffs of APSEB
have been rising at a rate of about 11% per year to a FY82 level of 42.4
paise/kWh (USc4.5), and industrial tariffs at a rate of about 20% p.a.
Domestic and agricultural tariff development has been less encouraging as
these tariffs have actually decreased in real terms. Present tariffs are
summarized in Annex 36.
5.18    In 1975, the Bank, in collaboration with APSEB, prepared a marginal
cost-based tariff study (Report No. 851-IN). Subsequently, several updating
exercises have been performed by the Bank as well as APSEB (Annex 37). At
present, APSEB staff is preparing a detailed recalculation of the 1975 study,
which is expected to be completed early in 1983. In general, average tariffs
in FY82 were slightly below or roughly equivalent to Average Incremental Cost



-34-
(AIC) estimatesl/ (40-50 paise/kWh), a situation which is unchanged from
earlier years. More detailed marginal cost estimates, however, yield a
significantly higher sales-weighted overall marginal cost (about 80 paise/kWh
in FY82). This is due to the fact that APSEB's AIC is heavily influenced by
a strong future emphasis on hydro development in the State, while, at the
margin, non-APSEB thermal generation will have to satisfy demand.
5.19    Cross-subsidization among consumer categories in relation to the
marginal cost structure continues to be evident. Industrial consumers pay
tariffs of about 50-55 paise/kWh, while their marginal cost is more likely
to be about 45 paise/kWh (at the same load factor). On the other hand,
domestic consumers, whose marginal cost is about 130-150 paise/kWh, pay a
tariff of about 45-50 paise/kWh. Agricultural consumers enjoy an even larger
gap between cost of supply and tariff. This policy of cross-subsidization is
APSEB and Andhra Pradesh Government policy, and is unlikely to be abandoned
in the near future for social and political reasons. However, APSEB has been
improving its tariff structure in line with principles highlighted in the
1975 Tariff Study, and plans to continue to do so. Improvements effected in
recent years include (i) the replacement of decreasing block tariffs in the
domestic category by an increasing system, (ii) the abolishing of the
domestic bulk supply category, (iii) the introduction of customer charges,
(iv) the introduction of a two-part tariff for HT consumers, (v) the
enforcement of a power factor penalty clause in industry, and (vi) the
addition of a fuel cost adjustment clause.
5.20    Further improvements to tariff structure and practice are necessary.
The major changes would be:
(i)  Power factor regulations need to be enforced in the
agricultural sector, where 100,000 of 500,000 irrigation
pumps do not have capacitors, but have not been obliged to
pay the power factor penalty.
(ii)  The ratio between demand and energy charges for customers with
a two-part tariff is severely distorted. Marginal capacity
cost is much higher than the demand charge, while energy
charges exceed marginal energy cost.
(iii)  The fuel surcharge, while a welcome interim tool to reflect
cost changes, may distort the above ratio even more in the
long run, if it is carried on and increased instead of absorbed
into the tariff at regular revisions. A check on its potential
misuse as tariff adjustment substitute is called for.
1/ Depending on the valuation of large incremental purchases from outside
the State during the later 1980's.



-35-
(iv) The first ("lifeline") consumption block for domestic consumers
needs to be reduced from the present 100 kWh/month to about
25 kWh to justify the subsidized block for minimum needs. At
the same time, the price per unit above this block should be
increased significantly.
(v) The heterogeneous group of non-domestic LT consumers (hotels,
offices, shops, etc.) should be split to reflect consumption
patterns, while the two LT industrial categories could be
combined. The cottage industry category could usefully be
combined with the domestic category.
(vi) Tariffs for irrigation consumers should rise in general after a
long period of stagnation. The ceiling on LT agricultural
consumers' demand charge should be removed.
(vii) Street light tariffs for larger municipal corporations with
ability to pay should be raised to reflect cost.
(viii) Interstate exchange tariffs should be adjusted to reflect
cost at the time of supply. APSEB is now discussing a
marginal cost-based system with CEA and other SEBs.
5.21    The Chairman of APSEB reviewed the present status in regard to tariff
restructuring and gave assurance that the above points are being taken into
consideration in the continuing process of the restructuring of APSEB
tariffs.

Target rate of return in general is 9.5%.  When this was established in 1964, it was also           |
conceived that an average electricity duty equivalent to a return of 1.5% would be applied,
making the total expected return 11%.  Effective March 1978, GOI levied an additional
excise tax of 2 paise/kWh on generation which is not included above. This would add an
estimated 2-3 percentage points to the returns noted.

Long-Term System Expansion Plan
Demand Forecast
1.      The Plan is based on a new CEA exercise in demand forecasting, using
different methods for different consumer categories. The industrial demand
forecast is based on empirical relationships between electricity consumption
growth and growth of value added in industry; irrigation pumping forecasts
are dependent on the planned rate of new pump connections, the expected
utilization rates, and the replacement rate of diesel pumps. Residential
and commercial use is extrapolated from past relationship over time. Two
growth scenarios, depending on assumptions about higher or lower growth rates
of industrial value added, have been developed. The results of the
unconstrained forecast, by Region, are summarized in Table 1.

2.      While, by 1989/90, the new CEA estimate is pitched about midway
between all previous forecasts, it is on the high side by the year 2000.
This is mostly due to the high sustained industrial growth assumptions in the
high scenario. The average annual growth rates in All-India electricity
consumption resulting from this exercise are high initially (reflecting the
growth from present suppressed demand levels), tapering off to about 7-8%
p. a. by 1995 (Table 2).

3.      The pattern of electricity consumption in various consumer categories
is expected to undergo some change. The consumption in the agricultural
sector would gradually decline to about 13% from the present 18% by the end
of the century due to saturation of demand for agricultural pumping. There
would also be a slight decline in the share of industrial consumption, and
an increase in consumption in residential, commercial and other categories.
4.      Assumptions concerning the transformation of consumption forecasts
into energy generation and peak capacity requirements are (i) a reduction in
system losses in the two major Regions from more than 20% to 15-17%, and (ii)
a decline in system load factor as restrictions on supply are relaxed
gradually. For purposes of system expansion planning, CEA is using the high
consumption forecast scenario. While this scenario may be somewhat too
optimistic in the later years (high sustained industrial growth, little
emphasis on industrial energy conservation), its effect on generating
requirements, and, consequently, capacity expansion, may be compensated by a
likely failure to bring down system losses rapidly. The use of the high
scenario as basis for the least-cost expansion plan is therefore the most
reasonable choice at this stage.
Least-Cost Capacity Expansion Plan
5.      The model (WASP, version III) uses the committed generating projects
(under construction or sanctioned by CEA for construction) as fixed input,
and a list of new hydro and thermal projects with their associated capital
and recurrent costs as variable element, in determining the least-cost
expansion sequence necessary to meet forecast demand. For each of the five
Electricity Supply Regions, separate system optimizations were undertaken.
Each optimization was subjected to sensitivity tests with respect to:
(i)  constraints on the optimum hydro plant development because of
possible delays;
(ii)  the siting of coal-fired plants at pitheads or close to load
centers;
(iii)  the forced outage rate (FOR) of thermal plants; and



-48-
ANNEX 5
Page 4 of 12 pages
(iv) the discount rate.
6.      The main variations affecting the expansion program are those of
hydro construction and forced outage rates. The results show that the "high
hydro" option is usually cheapest (although not always significantly), and
that concentration of thermal power at pitheads would reduce the overall
costs considerably. High forced outage rates increase the cost
significantly. Table 3 summarizes the expansion scenarios for each major
Region, subject to a maximum desirable loss of load probability of 1%,
together with the least-cost transmission options for each generation option.
7.      In general, the high hydro/low FOR option turns out to be the
least-cost expansion solution for all Regions. This option is examined with
respect to expected future fund constraints in the ongoing Sixth and
forthcoming Seventh Plans. If no additional funds can be mobilized in these
two Plans, some capacity additions have to be postponed to the Eighth Plan,
resulting in higher LOLP and lower peak reserve margins. Table 4 illustrates
the effect on reserve margins of a delay in capacity expansion. Table 5
summarizes the final CEA judgement on desirable expansion programs in each
Region, taking into account fund constraints, qualitative features, and
possible difficulties in bringing down FOR. The program aims at reaching
LOLP of about 1% by the early 1990s.

Salient Features of the 400 kV Transmission Line
1.   Line Configuration
Single circuit lines would have a horizontal and double circuit
lines a vertical configuration.
2.   Equipment Description
Towers
Self-supporting latticed steel towers, fabricated from struc-
tural steel angle sections will be used. A1 the components of the towers
will be hot-dip galvanized.
Normally, the following four types of towers will be used:
- 'A' type suspension straight run tangent towers for up to
2 degrees angle of deviation;
- 'B' type tension towers for angles of deviation in the line
up to 15 degrees, also to be used as section towers;
- 'C' type tension towers for angles of deviation in the line
up to 30 degrees, also to be used as section towers in
difficult terrain; and
- 'D' type tension towers for angles of deviation in the line up
to 60 degrees and also as dead-end (terminal) towers.
In addition, special towers and foundations are envisaged for
major river and power line crossings and places where the right of way is
restricted or the terrain is particularly difficult. The design of these
towers and foundations will be finalised after detailed soil investigation
and route survey.
Conductors
Twin bundles of 54/7/3.53 'MOOSE' ACSR, or equivalent conduc-
tors, will be used per phase, which will provide a power transfer
capability of about 600 MW per circuit. As for all 400 kV NTPC lines, the
intra-phase spacing will be 450 mm, which will result in the optimum with
respect to line inductance and line loss characteristics.

Page 4 of 18 pages
Earthwire and Lightning Protection
Suitable galvanized steel earthwire will be used to withstand
two successive lightning strokes of 150 kiloampere. It will have a ten-
sion-to-weight ratio about 20% higher than the power conductor. Since
the lines would be passing for an appreciable length over hilly terrain,
the shielding angle is intended to be reduced to 20 degrees in order to
minimize snielding failure.
Grounding
The tower footing resistance will be kept below 10 ohms. Nor-
mally pipe type grounding will be used. In case of rocky ground where
the ground resistance is high, counterpoise earthing will be used to bring
tower footing resistance down to an acceptable level.
Insulators and Hardware
High strength glazed procelain disc insulators will be used.
Suspension strings will consist of 23 discs (255x145 mm) of 120 kN
mechanical strength and tension strings will consist of 23 discs (280x170
mm) of 160 KN mechanical strength.
3.   Summary of Regulations and Practices for Routing  400 kV lines in
India
Ground Clearance
As per item 77 of Chapter VIII of Indian Electricity Rules -
1956 (as amended upto June 1979) the clearance above ground shall not be
less than 5.20m plus 0.3m for every 33 kV or part thereof by which the
voltage of the line exceeds 33 kV. For 400 kV lines it works out at
8.84m.
Compensation
No compensation is normally required for land in case of trans-
mission lines. Compensation is, however, paid for plantations including
the land involved. Land compensation is also involved in traversing urban
areas but 400 kV lines are usually routed in such a manner as to avoid
urban areas. Compensation is made for the crop damaged, if any, during
erection work.
Forest Clearance
While fixing the alignment of the line all efforts are made to
avoid reserved forest land. In cases where it is unavoidable as per



-68-
Annex 13
Attachment 1
Page 5 of 18 pages
Forest (conservation) Act - 1980 advance clearance from the Forest Depart-
ment, Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India is required to be taken.
For trees cut down in a reserved forest, the cost of planting three trees,
for every tree cut down, is paid to the Forest Department of the State
Government.
For normal right of way, trees falling on the line route are to
be cut and compensation paid to the owner. A right of way of 26 m on
either side of the centre line of the route is provided.
4.   Measures Adopted to Avoid Electrical Interference in Telecom Circuits
Growth of Power and Telecom Systems is vital to any country,
especially for a developing country like India. Thus the concentration of
telecom and power lines in close vicinity is unavoidable as both have to
exist in serving common consumers. This brings in problems of extraneous
induction encountered by the telecom circuits.
To avoid induction, the transmission line routes are selected in
such a way that the alignment, as far as possible, is away from open wire
telephone/telegraph line alignment by at least 8 km.
Sometimes in unavoidable circumstances it becomes impossible to
maintain the adequate separation between the power and telecom lines. In
such cases, induced voltages in the paralleling telecom circuits are
computed under actual conditions and the following protective measures are
adopted as per present practice in India.
A..  Communication Circuits
i) For induced voltage up to 430 volt no protective measures
are considered necessary.
ii) Beyond 430 volt but up to 650 volt adequate numbers of gas
discharge (G.D.) tubes are installed on the affected telcom
circuits. Telecom authorities in such cases do not charge
compensation from power authorities.
iii)  Beyond 650 volt and up to 2000 volt again adequate numbers of
G.D. tubes are installed on the affected telecom circuits, but
in such cases, whoever, i.e. the power or telecom authority, is the
later entrant, has to pay the cost of such protective works.
iv) If induced voltage is much higher than 200 volt re-engineering
of the affected telecom circuits is done. The following
re-engineering works are commonly adopted in India.



-69-
Annex 13
Attachment 1
Page 6 of 18 pages
a) The telecom line is shifted from the existing alignment to
a different route to maintain the desired separation
distance. The cost of re-routing the telecom line is paid
by the later entrant (the power authority);
b) The removal of the affected overhead telecom alignment and
the provision of aluminium sheathed star quad cable of suitable
capacity with screening factor of 0.1 with provision of V.F.
repeaters to compensate the cable loss; and
c) The removal of the overhead telecom alignment and the provision
of the circuit on other media like UHF/Microwave system etc.
B.   Railway Block Circuits
Railway block circuits are provided basically for the safety
problems of the trains, although such circuits may also be protected
against high induced voltages by the installation of gas discharge tubes
and by changing the block instruments with 300 volt to 450 volt
immunization level.
In cases where induced voltage is higher, overhead block circuits
are removed and re-engineering of circuits like that of communication
circuits is done at the cost of the later entrant.
Conduction
As the name implies, conduction is brought about by actual
electrical contact between power and telecom lines. Crossing of both the
lines therefore is done under the following manner as per the code
prescribed by the Power and Telecom Co-ordination Committee constituted
by the Government of India.
i) Angle of crossing shall be as nearly a right angle as possible;
ii) Adequate clearances as prescribed by Central PTCC are to be
adopted between power and telecom lines;
iii) Adequate guardings shall be provided at the crossings for the
power lines below 36 kV; and
iv) No guarding arrangements are considered necessary in case of
crossings with high voltage power lines above 36 kV.

Installation of Tariff Metering Systems and Disturbance
Recorders in the Regional Grids in India
1.   Background
The power systems in the country are being interconnected
through 400 kV transmission lines to evolve the regional grids. The
construction of thermal power stations by NTPC together with 400 kV lines
is accelerating the process of interconnection in the regions. The power
generated at NTPC's thermal power stations is allocated to the different
States in the Region according to the policy laid down by the Government
of India. The power to the beneficiaries sometimes flows through trans-
mission systems in the integrated network belonging to other agencies such
as the States, the Damodar Valley Corporation (in the Eastern Region), the
Bhakra Beas Management Board (in the Nothern Region) etc., while in cer-
tain areas NTPC's transmission system carries power generated by the State
generating stations for transmission within the States or sometimes out-
side the States. The generation from the different agencies such as the
power generated by the National Hydro-Electric Power Corporation, the
Department of Atomic Energy, the Neyveli Lignite Corporation and other
agencies also gets fed into the respective regional grids. In order to
compute the energy that is fed into the system from different sources and
the energy actually drawn by the different systems, a special metering
system is necessary.
2.   Objectives of the Metering Schemes
The tariff metering schemes would provide for:
a)   Metering MS, MVar, MVA, MWh, kVar and MVarh exports and
imports continuously;
b)   Facilities for recording (printing) data according
to the prescribed format, and storing the data
for computing daily, weekly and monthly; and
c)   Facilities for transmitting data through telemetry
systems to the control center in the State and/or
in the Region.
The instruments will have facilities for dividing the day into
different periods to facilitate, if necessary, the introduction at a later
stage of time of day metering system. A single instrument shall be
capable of accepting all the input information for a mnaximum of ten cir-
cuits; at very large substations where the number of circuits is more than
ten, two such instruments would be used. The basic element in the instru-
ment is a conventional energy meter which again would receive the inputs
from CTs and VTs in the substation or generating station. The energy
meter would be interfaced to a microprocessor system which shall compute



-78-
Annex 13
Attachment 4
Page 15 of 18 pages
different quantities for record through a printout in the prescribed
format and also for display on demand. The display shall provide for the
instantaneous value in MW, MVar, '4VA and cumulative MWh, MVarh and also
for display of cumulative figures for say a day, week or a month.  The
printout facility shall print out different quantities every 30 minutes
and also over a period of 24 h as well as the cumulative figures over a
month.
The approximate cost of an instrument is US$120. The list of
stations where instruments of this type are proposed to be installed in
the Northern, Western and Southern Regions are given below. The stations
where the instruments would be installed would undergo some change when
the scheme is finally worked out in consultation with the Regional Elec-
tricity Boards.
2.   Disturbance Recorders
The interconnection of individual systems in the Region neces-
sitates that operating conditions should be carefully monitored and,
whenever abnormual conditions in the system arise these are also accurately
recorded so that the post-disturbance analysis could be carried out. Such
analysis would facilitate taking corrective measures to prevent recurren-
ces of the disturbances. The absence of suitable instruments for record-
ing the system conditions before, during and after the disturbance, has
left many of the disturbances in the systems incompletely analysed.
NTPC has been providing disturbance recorders on all its 400 kV
lines.  However, such recorders are not provided on some of the 400 kV
lines in the Northern and Western Regions and generally in most of the 220
kV systems in all the Regions.

(g)  Depreciation
Power Station  -  3.1% of original cost.

(h) Tariffs5
NTPC has an obligation to achieve a rate of return of not less
than 9.5% on the forecast average net fixed assets in service
by FY1991. On this basis, and bearing in mind the time it takes
for che generating plant to reach an operating level of 5,500
hours a year, regional average tariffs have been calculated which
result in a consolidated average NTPC tariff of 32.2 paise/kWh
for FY1983. Regional average tariffs have been progressively
increased for each subsequent year to levels resulting in an
average NTPC tariff of 43.9 paise/kWh in FY1991 which is
sufficient to achieve the required 9.5% rate of return in that
year. The regional tariffs include provision for the recovery
of operating costs of the proposed project.
(i) Fuel
Fuel costs are based on 1982-83 prices for all projects as indicated
in paragraph 2(c). Variations in fuel costs will be recovered
as a tariff fuel surcharge. The projected fuel cost increases
are shown separately on the income statements.
(j) Project Costs
(i)  Singrauli
Construction costs are based on June 1982 prices escalated
at rates given in the schedule below except for orders
already placed where escalation is applied from award dates
onward.

ANNEX 24
Page 5 of 6 pages
Physical Escalation
Civil works                     -  10% of construction costs
Equipment                       -  5% of the equipment costs
(k) Capital Requirements
(i) The proposed credit would be relent by the GOI to NTPC
for a period of 20 years from the date of withdrawal of
the first installment including a five year initial grace
period, and repayable in equal semi-annual installments
of principal, together with interest at the rate of 12.5%
per annum on unpaid balances.
(ii)  Other capital requirements would be advanced by GOI in
the form of debt and fully paid up equity capital, provided
that the unpaid debt at the end of each year would not
exceed the sum of the issued share capital and the "free"
reserves, that is to say, those which are not required for
specific purposes. Advances would be in the form of equity
capital followed by loan capital.
(iii)  GOI loans (including the onlending of both the proposed
credit and also previously approved credits and loan)
are assumed to finance either defined projects or
individual generation units and transmission lines included
in NTPC's investment program. Interest on the loans up to
the date of commissioning of each unit of plant would be
charged to construction, while subsequent interest accruals
would be charged to revenue. Repayment of principal is
assumed in 30 semi-annual installments commencng on the
first anniversary following the end of the five year grace
period.
(1)  Working Capital
Variations in working capital represent the difference between
the sums of the individual items making up current assets less
current liabilities at the beginning and at the end of the year.
(m)  Balance Sheets (Annex 23)
Current Assets
(i) Receivables are assumed at a level equivalent to one-twelfth
of the revenue for the year;
(ii) Inventories are assumed at 1% of gross assets at the end
of the year; and
