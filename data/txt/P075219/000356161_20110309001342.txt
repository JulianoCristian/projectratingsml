F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The development/global objective of the proposed project is to achieve more effective
biodiversity conservation in Central America (Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama) by strengthening the capacity of indigenous
communities to protect and manage their natural and cultural resources, and by
recuperating and promoting their cultural values and sustainable traditional land use
practices, thereby helping to (a) prevent further land degradation that threatens
environmental services, livelihoods, and economic well-being, and (b) conserve the
region's high, though increasingly threatened biodiversity resources.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. Region and Sector Background. The Project covered the Central American region1 which
was known for its broad natural richness and high biodiversity. From Guatemala to Panama, at
least 10 main ecological zones of importance for biodiversity conservation were identified within
the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), including the Moist Forests of Tehuantepec,
Central American Atlantic Moist Forests, Central American Pine and Oak Forests, Central
American Pacific Dry Forests, Isthmian Pacific Moist Forests, Miskito Pine Forests, Central
American Montane Forests, Talamancan Montane Forests, and Eastern Panamanian Montane
Forests (Conservation of the Terrestrial Ecoregions of Latin America and the Caribbean, World
Bank, WWWF, 1995).

1.1.2. At appraisal, the Region's total indigenous population was estimated at about 6.7 million
(or 24 percent of the total). Guatemala had the highest concentration of indigenous people (66
percent), followed by Belize (20 percent), and Honduras (15 percent). There was ample evidence
that indigenous peoples tended to settle in the less populated areas with intact natural forest and
ecosystems. While the extent of lands where indigenous peoples lived in Central America was
difficult to define, an analysis at that time estimated it to be as high as 170,000 square kilometers,
or almost 33 percent of the area of the seven countries. More than 50 percent of this land
contained forests or natural ecosystems, and a similar amount corresponded with the MBC.
Likewise, a disproportionate share of forests and natural ecosystems, and an even greater share of
national protected areas, overlapped with indigenous populations and territories.

1.1.3. The strong overlap between indigenous peoples and natural resources was not
coincidental. The ecosystems of many high biodiversity areas have been shaped by indigenous
management practices related to subsistence agriculture, home gardens, forest extraction, hunting
or gathering practices, and the use of forests as a refuge from mainstream society and as sacred
sites. Although there was no clear understanding of the complex population-nature relationships,
it was known that under certain circumstances higher population density combined with
appropriate land and resource practices could preserve biological diversity rather than destroy it.
In parts of Central America with supposedly "assimilated" Mayan populations, a study of
municipal forest management comparing communities in historically Mayan and "Mayan areas of
western Honduras had documented significantly better managed forests in Mayan areas. There
were at least five Bank-financed/executed projects which were under implementation at the time
of appraisal which were focused on biodiversity conservation in Central America. Two of these
projects were in Costa Rica, two in Guatemala and one in Belize.

1.1.4. Government Strategies. The development goals of all Central American countries
included poverty alleviation, natural resource management, and reduction of social and economic
inequalities, particularly in rural areas. There was a growing regional awareness on the need to
preserve and protect biodiversity, and on the need to include indigenous peoples both in
conservation efforts and in the benefits of socio-economic development. There was also a
growing recognition of the importance of protecting indigenous peoples' culture and traditional
knowledge. More than a dozen regional agreements on biodiversity and conservation
management had been already signed2 . Three countries - Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras-
had, at Appraisal, ratified ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Rights. More
recently, Nicaragua became a part of ILO Convention 169.

                                                            
1
  The Project geographical area included the following countries: Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panamá.
2
  These countries were all parties to the main international environmental conventions, including the Convention on
Biological Diversity, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) and Central American
Convention on Climate Change, the Mexico-Central America Declaration on Sustainable Development, and the
Convention for the Conservation of Biodiversity and the Protection of Priority Wild Areas.

                                                               1
1.1.5. At the time of appraisal, therefore, identifying and promoting sustainable ways of using
natural resources and achieving more effective biodiversity conservation had already become a
regional priority. All Central American countries had signed the Convention on Biological
Diversity in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro and as a result had received financing for the preparation
of National Biodiversity Strategies. There was a call to build compatible regional and national
agendas on biodiversity conservation. The Central American Commission for Environment and
Development (CCAD)3 undertook this challenge of seeking to build a regional common agenda
on biodiversity conservation while supporting indigenous peoples to manage their natural and
cultural resources in accordance with their values and traditions.

1.1.6. Historically, indigenous peoples had demonstrated a strong relationship with the natural
resource base in their culture, livelihood strategies, and value systems. However, three key issues
were beginning to constrain the effort to conserve biodiversity in areas inhabited by indigenous
peoples. These are discussed below:

1.1.6.1. Poverty-Induced Degradation of Natural Resources. Poverty and the need for immediate
         income streams led to shorter rotation or shifting cycles and continued clearing of
         agricultural plots by some indigenous people, resulting in less diversification of crops,
         plants, and forest products. Outside settlers moved into areas of traditional rotating
         agriculture and permanently cleared lands for pasture and agro-pasture, further displacing
         indigenous systems and degrading soils.

1.1.6.2. Lack of Attention to Indigenous Cultural Ties to Traditional Lands. Many rural
         development programs were based on a strategic framework focused on identifying areas
         of global competitiveness and increasing overall efficiency in the economy; expanding
         support where indigenous populations were concentrated or providing a strategic
         response to the expressed desire of indigenous peoples in many rural areas to maintain
         their links to traditional areas, and to use cultural land practices in assuring sustainability
         while improving quality of life, received little attention.

1.1.6.3. Lack of Resources for Exchange of Experiences. While there were numerous positive
         initiatives at the national level for specific formal protected areas and priority regions,
         and there was support for creating a network among indigenous communities to exchange
         experiences across countries and to share culturally driven standards for sustainable and
         culturally appropriate land use, adequate resources for setting up such a network were not
         available.

1.1.7. Against this background, CCAD approached the Bank-IADB duo to support the seven-
country regional initiative to strengthen their bio-diversity conservation effort.

1.1.8. Rationale for Bank involvement. The operation was justified on the following grounds:
(a) the project would deepen the Bank contribution to biodiversity conservation by supplementing
the already existing range of biodiversity conservation projects in Guatemala, Costa Rica and
Belize; (b) the project was a logical extension to the Bank's contribution to the consolidation of
the Meso-American Biodiversity Corridor (MBC) initiative, where it was assisting in a variety of
ways and in many thematic areas, with grant funds, research projects, trust funds, and executing
Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects; and (c) the project was consistent with the basic
principles of World Bank Country Assistance Strategies (CASs) agreed on with the seven
participating countries at the time of the appraisal. These principles included: (i) reducing

  CCAD. Central American Commission for Environment and Development is a regional body whose membership is
composed of Central American Environmental Ministers and which has a mandate for environmental and biodiversity
conservation policy decision-making at regional level and the establishment of a regional regime of environmental
integration and cooperation.



                                                               2
poverty among vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples, (ii) promoting environment
and biodiversity conservation; and (iii) promoting the inclusion of indigenous peoples in poverty
reduction strategies and natural resource management.

1.1.9. Consistency with GEF Strategic Priorities. The project was also consistent with the
GEF strategic priorities reflected in the preamble to the 1992 Earth Convention on Biological
Diversity Summit; particularly those related to the recognition of the traditional and close
dependence of many indigenous and local communities on biological resources. There was a clear
recognition of the contribution that traditional knowledge could make to both conservation and
the sustainable use of biological diversity. The Project was aligned with GEF's Biodiversity
Focal Areas and Operational Programs related to the protection of forest and mountain
ecosystems by promoting the sustainable use of biodiversity in indigenous communities across
the MBC.

1.2. Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1. Based on the constraints to effective biodiversity conservation identified during project
preparation, the project was focused on initiatives to alleviate them, and in the process create an
environment which would facilitate the achievement of the biodiversity conservation objective.
Therefore, the project identified support along three main strategies:

1.2.2. Networking and Capacity Building. The strategy addressed the lack of resources for
exchange of experiences by supporting regional and national networking and capacity building
among indigenous communities engaged in Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM). Such
community-to-community learning and knowledge exchange were expected to help build
networks across the region, create links between communities with comparable environmental
characteristics, and highlight successful and proven regional models for adoption in other local
and national initiatives.

1.2.3. Preparing and implementing Integrated Eco-system Management based land-use plans.
This strategy built on the fact that a growing number of indigenous communities had successfully
incorporated traditional knowledge, values, and normative systems into the development of
modem land use plans based on IEM. These plans drew from the same knowledge that was the
basis of traditional land use mosaics around different types of biodiversity, soil, water, and
implicitly forests, which provided habitat and environmental services such as carbon
sequestration. There was a need to assimilate and consolidate this knowledge, and train a larger
number of indigenous groups to scale up the successful IEM approach to land use plans
preparation and implementation.

1.2.4. Income Generation Opportunities Based on Sustainable Use and Biodiversity
Conservation. This strategy addressed the issue of poverty-induced degradation of natural
resources by providing communities with financial incentives for conservation which could
include establishment of businesses that are compatible with resource conservation, and
development of markets for providing environmental services such as watershed protection,
biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration.

1.2.5. There was an implicit assumption that support along these strategies to alleviate existing
constraints would contribute to increased biodiversity conservation. This assumption is implicitly
reflected in the stated objective of the project.

1.2.6. Global Environment Objective. The development/global objective of the project was to
achieve more effective biodiversity conservation in Central America (Guatemala, Belize,
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama) by strengthening the capacity of
indigenous communities to protect and manage their natural and cultural resources, and by
recuperating and promoting their cultural values and sustainable traditional land use practices,
thereby helping to: (a) prevent further land degradation that threatens environmental services,


                                                3
livelihoods, and economic well-being; and (b) conserve the region's high, though increasingly
threatened biodiversity resources.

1.2.7. Key Performance Indicators. (a) Incorporating 135,000 hectares under community
conservation and 45,000 hectares under sustainable cultural land use; (b) Stabilization of selected
biodiversity indicators in the Project intervention zones (forest cover, ecosystem fragmentation
and population levels of selected key species); (c) 50 indigenous villages or communities' of high
organization and management capacity with active conservation and sustainable cultural land use;
(d) 100 indigenous villages or communities' of medium management and organizational capacity
start engaging in active conservation and sustainable cultural land use; (e) at least 70 indigenous
communities participating in 3 regional networks of eco/ethno-tourism; (f) at least 3 regional
networks for marketing traditional indigenous products; and (g) at least 5 networks for marketing
of environmental services derived from traditional ecosystem management with the participation
of at least 400 indigenous communities.

1.2.8. Based on an understanding of the PAD, the following relationship can be derived
between the global biodiversity conservation GEO, the constraints, the strategic response (or sub-
GEOs), and the regrouping of the broad indicators under the three sub-GEOs.

1.3. Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and reasons/justification:

1.3.1. The Development Objectives were not changed during the life of the Project and the
indicators were not formally restructured.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1.   The PAD identified the following beneficiaries:

1.4.2. The primary beneficiaries were Indigenous communities and rural populations living in
the Eco-regions who were expected to benefit from the biodiversity conservation efforts. The
originally identified target population included roughly 607 indigenous organizations and 558
communities.

1.4.3. The secondary beneficiaries were: (a) Local, national, liaison and regional indigenous
organizations that were expected to benefit from strengthened capacity building to protect and
manage natural and cultural resources; (b) Central American Countries. It was expected that
Central American countries would benefit in several ways; first; from the impact of biodiversity
conservation efforts; second; from protection and rescue of spiritual and sacred sites as part of the
regional cultural heritage; and thirdly from the inclusion of indigenous peoples in sustainable
activities to conserve biodiversity and the income generating activities that were expected to have
an impact in counteracting land degradation while contributing to poverty alleviation; and (c)
CCAD. It was expected that CCAD would benefit by strengthening its decision-making capacity
in environmental issues and better position itself as a spokes-body on environmental and
biodiversity conservation in the region.

1.5. Original Components

1.5.1. The Project consisted of four Components. Components 1, 2 and 3 reflected the activities
which embodied the project strategic response to alleviating the constraints to achieving effective
biodiversity conservation. Component 4 relating to Monitoring and Evaluation was prepared to
monitor the implementation of the Project. Even though IADB was responsible for the execution
of Components 1 and 2, and the World Bank was responsible for the implementation of
Components 3 and 4, the project was conceived as an integrated whole to be co-executed by two
different institutions. The project was designed to follow a logical sequence across components,
and between activities within each component.

IADB-executed Components

1.5.2. Component 1. Cultural and Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building.
(US$ 2.78M or 31 % total Project Cost) - linked to strategic element, "Building Capacity
and Knowledge." This Component was designed to strengthen participating communities'
knowledge in customary law and rights as well technical, administrative and ICT capacity to
engage in biodiversity conservation within their communities and as part of regional networks.
The component included activities to: (a) strengthen indigenous communities' organizational,
technical and administrative capacities to articulate their cultural values and then apply them to
natural resource management; (b) systematize standards and criteria for traditional ecosystem
management, including a certification process for engagement in effective ecosystem
management; and (c) strengthening indigenous organizations' capacities in traditional ecosystem
management. These were to have been achieved through community exchanges, study tours,
community meetings, training on indigenous rights and customary law, and strengthening some
local NGOs and communities.

Component 2. Promotion of Sustainable Cultural Land Use and Traditional Ecosystem
Management. (US$ 2.22M, or 25% of total Project Cost) - linked to strategic element

                                                 5
"Preparing land use plans." This component was designed to build upon the capacities
developed through component 1. With their new competencies and knowledge, it was intended
that indigenous communities' would develop community conservation and sustainable cultural
land use plans based on IEM approach. These were to include: (a) Community Plans for
Territorial Management (PCGT), which focused on managing local ecosystems using traditional
knowledge; and (b) Integral Community Development Plans (PIDCO) which utilized western
techniques such as mapping and biodiversity inventories to delimitate the land according to
established conservation criteria. It was hoped that based on these plans, communities and
institutions would bring lands under conservation as per the respective plan's recommendations.
An additional key activity under this component was strengthening institutions to implement
these community developed IEM plans.

World Bank-executed Components

1.5.3. Component 3. Development of Culturally Appropriate Products, Markets, and Services
for Environmental Sustainability in Indigenous Communities. (US$ 3.07M or 34% of total
Project Cost) - linked to strategic element, "Providing conservation compatible income-
generating opportunities". This component was based on the underlying assumption that high
poverty levels in indigenous communities had led to land degradation activities in order to earn
income for subsistence. Therefore, the component aimed to introduce grant resources to develop
culturally appropriate and environmentally sustainable income-generating technical assistance
and very few actual income-generating production sub-projects so that communities would have
alternatives for revenue generation that were compatible with the objective of natural resource
conservation.

1.5.4. Component 4. Participatory Project Monitoring and Evaluation. (US$ 0.93 million,
or 10% of the total Project Cost). This component supported training and capacity building on
monitoring and evaluation of project impacts and also progress in conservation and sustainable
use of biological diversity. It financed scientifically sound monitoring and evaluation of
biodiversity to follow project implementation and biodiversity changes over time. Baseline
environmental information that goes beyond the data elaborated during project preparation
process was determined through in-depth environmental analysis in the six priority sub-regions.
Evaluation activities included the Mid-Term Review (MTR) and the documentation of lessons
learned to facilitate dissemination of project findings to other communities throughout the region.

1.6. Revised Components

1.6.1. During the MTR there adjustments to three indicators of Component 3; (a) the number of
regional networks developed for developing environmental services was decreased from 5 to 2;
(b) the original logic framework classified the capacity of indigenous communities to conserve
biodiversity in "low" and "high." The goal to build the capacity of 100 and of 50 communities
classified as low and high capacity respectively was changed to build the capacity of 150
communities; and (c) the number of carbon credits was decreased from 400 to 200.

1.7. Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
     schedule, and funding allocations)

1.7.1. Amendments to the Grant Agreement. There were five amendments to the Grant
Agreement (TF054186) with ACICAFOC to reallocate funds across financing categories
(December, 20, 2006; May 11, 2007; July 14, 2009; September 17, 2009; and August 26, 2010).

1.7.2. The Bank extended the closing date twice from one July 30, 2009 to January 30, 2010
and the second one to July 01, 2010, and the IADB three times. The last extension is to March
12, 2011. As a result, while the Bank-supported activities have been completed and closed, the
IADB project-assisted components are still under implementation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1.   The QSA7-2006 rated the overall quality at entry as moderately satisfactory.

Soundness of Background Analysis

2.1.2. Lessons learned from other projects. The project incorporated lessons learned from
previous initiatives (GEF, IADB, BIRF, CBM, USAID and other bilateral cooperation). Lessons
included: (a) involvement of communities and beneficiaries at all stages of the project; (b)
fostering information sharing among indigenous groups is essential to promote improved
conservation practices; (c) income generating activities are an effective mechanism to promote
sustainable biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. The first two lessons were
incorporated in the project preparation and design stage through highly participatory processes.
The third lesson took the form of a separate component in project design.

2.1.3. Participatory Design: The consultation strategy carried out during the preparation was
complex and innovative, and it included three levels of consultations: Regional, Sub-regional and
community level. It also included a variety of actors which held marked differences in their
organization capabilities, resource management, capacity to systematize knowledge on
biodiversity conservation practices, and to contribute to design and implementation of projects.

    At the regional level. The two regional indigenous organizations, ACICAFOC and CICA
    were fully consulted and participated in the designing phase of the project along with CCAD.

    At sub-regional level. The Liaison Organizations (LOs) were informed and consulted about
    the objectives and scope of the project during the preparation and implementation phases. As
    a result of this highly participatory process the LOs contributed to the supervision of sub-
    projects and the IEM plans.

    At the community level. The preparation stage involved consultations and dissemination of
    project details with the indigenous leaders and representatives. As a result, these grass roots
    organizations participated effectively in the design of the sub-projects and the IEM plans.

2.1.4. The Bank led consultations were extensive and funded out of the PDF Block B Grant.
This process was complemented by additional consultations carried out by all participating
agencies. For instance, the project incorporated results of consultations partially funded by the
Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program, the Japan Special Fund (managed by IADB), and the
consultations carried out by CICA with the participation of indigenous representatives which
contributed to outline the main principles for the territorial and culturally compatible IEM plans.

2.1.5. Background studies: Four comprehensive background studies were carried out which
included quantitative and qualitative data collection methodologies underpinning the design of
the project. The studies included: (a) social assessment; (b) environmental analysis; (c)
institutional assessment; and (d) legal assessment.

         The Social Assessment. The social assessment contributed to classify indigenous
         communities' according to following criteria: (a) socioeconomic and cultural
         characteristics; (b) biodiversity conservation areas; (c) land tenure indicators; (d)
         governance and decision-making processes on the use of natural resources; (e) communal
         and inter-communal forms of cooperation for the conservation and management of
         natural resources; (f) existent income generation activities for the agriculture and forestry
         sectors; and (g) technical assistance provided previously by other donors and the private


                                                  7
        sector. This helped the project to identify clearly priority areas for inclusion in the
        project, and also facilitated in focusing project capacity building initiatives based on the
        grouping of the institutions (low existing capacity to high existing capacity).

        The Environmental Analysis. One of the main contributions of the Environmental
        Analysis was the development of a very comprehensive Environmental Management
        Framework (EMF), which resulted from extensive consultations with the indigenous
        communities. Key environmental parameters to screen sub-projects for compliance with
        Bank safeguards policies were established in a collaborative manner.

        The Institutional Assessment identified the actions necessary to build the institutional
        capacity of key agencies involved in the project's implementation and monitoring,
        (ACICAFOC and CICA, as well as indigenous organizations in target communities). The
        study determined that to execute the project, ACICAFOC required institutional capacity
        building, particularly in procurement, finance management and social and environmental
        safeguards. These inadequacies were specifically addressed during preparation and
        project implementation.

        The Legal Assessment evaluated the participating countries' national legal frameworks
        and the treaties to which they had acceded. This information provided an accurate
        regional framework of commitments to indigenous peoples' rights.

2.1.6. Baseline data: While the background studies and the comprehensive consultations
provided the project with wide-ranging data that provided a solid foundation, there were no
baseline values related to the key biodiversity indicator (Stabilized biodiversity aspects in project
areas) based on which project progress could be quantitatively and accurately measured.
Establishing baseline values for various aspects of biodiversity would have been a huge endeavor,
perhaps beyond the capability of the project. This was a key constraint that limited the ability of
the project to demonstrate tangible achievements related to the GEO.

Assessment of the Project design

2.1.7. Relevance and consistency. The project design was appropriately based on the response
strategies to alleviate the constraints to achieving effective biodiversity conservation in Central
America. It was also properly aligned with the GEF priorities and the CASs of the seven
participating countries. However, the project design suffered a disconnect between the
overarching GEO biodiversity conservation objective and the expected direct outcomes of the
project components. Clearly, biodiversity conservation is influenced by a wide range of scientific
and institutional factors. The project components were primarily aimed at promoting local and
regional-level capacity building, which was an important, but only one among many factors that
influenced biodiversity conservation. The QALP-1 panel in 2008 recognized this, pointing out
that given the focus of the project, and the broader environmental goals were unlikely to be
reached while the capacity building goals were within reach. In this context, the QALP-1 panel
suggested revising the GEO to better reflect the actual project focus on capacity building. While
the project team was in full agreement with the QALP-1 panel's observation and conclusion, it
was decided that revising the PDO--which would have required the agreement of GEF, the
World Bank and IADB--was was not practical given that the project's expected completion date
(July 1, 2009) was only some nine months away at the time of the recommendation.

2.1.8. Discrepancies in the GEO. There are some discrepancies in the way the Global
Development Objective is described in different sections of the PAD and in the Grant Agreement.
In the section of the Project Development Objective of the PAD, the PDO reads as follows: "to
achieve more effective biodiversity conservation in Central America (Guatemala, Belize,
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama) by strengthening the capacity of
indigenous communities to protect and manage their natural and cultural resources, and by
recuperating and promoting their cultural values and sustainable traditional land use practices,

                                                  8
thereby helping to (a) prevent further land degradation that threatens environmental services,
livelihoods, and economic well-being, and (b) conserve the region's high, though increasingly
threatened biodiversity resources." The PAD GEO clearly focused on biodiversity conservation
as the key outcome of the project. In the Grant Agreement the GEO reads as, "achieving a more
comprehensive ecosystem management by strengthening the capacity of the Indigenous Peoples
to protect and manage their natural and cultural resources." The Grant Agreement GEO focuses
more on the indigenous capacity building to achieve the outcome of a better ecosystem. In the
Incremental Cost Analysis annex of the PAD, the goal of the project is "to promote Traditional
Ecosystems Management (TEM) in indigenous lands through support to an emerging network of
indigenous communities engaged in IEM in Central America". This lack of consistency in the
presentation of the GEO affected the formulation of indicators (biodiversity versus ecosystem
versus capacity building).

2.1.9. Components. The project's four components were designed to build upon one another
and did not represent stand-alone, independent sets of activities. The two GEF implementing
agencies split executing and supervision responsibilities by components (IADB components 1
and 2, and WBG components 3 and 4) which added an additional layer of complexity to the
project's ability to coordinate the implementation of the components as was necessary to achieve
desired results. Since the implementation of component 3 (World Bank), depended on the
implementation of components 1 and 2 (IADB), and component 2 was significantly delayed, the
spilt of responsibilities for different project components posed huge additional challenges during
the implementation process. The components also appear to be less than clearly defined,
resulting in ambiguities even at the level of the implementing agencies as to their intent.

2.1.10. Key Performance Indicators and the Results Framework. The results framework
includes indicators which are more in the form of output indicators than outcome indicators. The
indicators were intended to measure the impact of the project on the three underlying factors that
contributed to promoting biodiversity. One of the indicators was an outcome indicator -reduction
of the malnutrition of children under 7 years old - was so broad in terms of the scope of poverty
reduction that it proved very difficult to be measured not only because there was no baseline data
but also because the correlation between the activities of the project and the achievement of that
indicator was questionable. During the MTR, it was agreed to modify this indicator. However, the
change was not formally reflected in the Grant Agreement.

2.1.11. Institutional Arrangements. The project's institutional arrangements were innovative
because they included rural indigenous communities as key actors in the implementation of the
project. At the same time, they were complex because the project required the coordination of
wide range of actors ranging from regional indigenous networks, government entities, local
organizations, communities, and two international banks. The risk posed by the challenge of
coordinating a large number of institutional actors was underestimated during project preparation.
In addition, anchoring the project on the premise that building the capacity of indigenous peoples
was the appropriate approach for achieving biodiversity conservation, required cooperation with
effective institutions at regional and national levels.

2.1.12. Executing agency capacity. The institutional assessment found ACICAFOC, the main
project executing agency, needed capacity building in the areas of fiduciary, management and
monitoring and evaluation to be able to effectively execute the project. To mitigate this potential
risk to project sustainability, extensive capacity building was incorporated into the project design.
Eventually the agency emerged as a strong and robust regional entity, setting up satellite offices,
securing funds from several international donors, and executing a range of biodiversity
conservation activities.

2.1.13. Adequacy of government commitment. Following the agreements of the 1992 Earth
Summit, the Central American countries were committed to preparing their national biodiversity
strategies as well as undertaking joint actions to conserve the MBC. The project was developed in



                                                 9
direct response to these regional commitments and therefore there was strong government support
for the initiative throughout the life of the project.

2.1.14. PAD presentation. The PAD includes the IADB components too, including the GEF
funding of US$5 million for those components. The GEO is an over-arching one, which
considers outcomes from the IADB implemented components too. Nowhere is the dependence
between the IADB and Bank implemented components highlighted. At various places in the
PAD, there is reference to the linkages between the proposed GEF operation and a range of other
projects under implementation and their implications for GEO achievement. Annex 15 of the
PAD lists out 12 such projects but does not build the links or how these were going to be
monitored. In fact, the project cost for this operation is shown as US$48.9 million with US$37
million coming in from other complementary projects.

2.1.15. Assessment of Risks: The appraisal identified important potential risks to project
progress and sustainability and developed mitigation measures that were integrated within Project
design. The risk identified as most significant was the low capacity of the executing agency. The
identified mitigating measures of capacity building and technical assistance for ACICAFOC were
appropriate and successfully implemented, demonstrated by the strength of ACICAFOC's current
operations across Central America. However, the risks inherent in a project design that included
seven participating countries, working with communities in remote rural areas, general lack of
institutional capacity in the countries, the difficulty of making a discernible impact on
biodiversity indicators through one project of a modest size, and the challenge of coordinating
oversight by two international organizations, were underestimated during project preparation.
The 2008 QALP as well as the earlier 2006 QSA, emphasized that several key risks were
underestimated, notably, relating to: (a) the co-implementation of the project by the World Bank
and the IDB; (b) the wide geographic dispersion; and (c) beneficiary communities' lack of
experience working with international donors. The underestimation of these risks meant resulted
in insufficient mitigating measures getting incorporated into project design.

2.2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
 
Implementation

2.2.1. The project became effective in 2005 after reaching all effectiveness conditions.
Disbursements were low for the first two years of implementation because of the low financial
management capacity of the execution agency. Given that the initiative was regional and
involved the participation of several agencies at different levels, project implementation proved to
be challenging for the various agencies involved for the first few years. Key aspects of project
design that affected implementation are discussed below.



2.2.2. Weak executing agency at project commencement: At the start of implementation,
ACICAFOC had no prior experience working with international Banks and therefore was not
fully familiar with either World Bank or IADB norms, procedures, and policies (safeguards and
fiduciary). Although this weakness was eventually successfully overcome through training and
capacity building of ACICAFOC, the first two years of implementation were lost. Today, the
organization is a well-known agency managing several initiatives in the Central American region.
By the closing date of the Project, ACICAFOC had opened, in addition to the headquarters in
Costa Rica, two additional in Nicaragua and in Honduras. The organization has made strategic
alliances with regional organizations in South America and is co-implementing a South-South
initiative in Benin, Africa.

2.2.3. Oversight at regional and community level: Project supervision took place at the
regional level, sub-regional or eco-regions and local levels. At regional level the Project Council,
composed by the Board of Directors (integrated by ACICAFOC and CICA representatives) for

                                                10
the Project and CCAD oversight the Project. At Sub-regional or Eco-regions and local levels, the
LOs contributed to supervise and monitor project activities through the identification, design and
implementation of the IEM plans and sub-projects to the disbursements and procurement
activities. This participation proved to be immensely useful to maintaining the project continuity
even when the implementing agency lost momentum during the interim years.

2.2.4. Difficulties in Institutional Coordination (IADB and WBG as co-implementing
agencies for the GEF-Funds): Implementation was split between the World Bank and the IADB
to build the capacity of the two implementing agencies through "learning by doing." These co-
implementing arrangements brought about two kinds of problems. First, even though the project
had been designed with the assumption that the World Bank and IADB had similar procedures, in
practice their rules, norms, and procedures were not fully aligned. Therefore, ACICAFOC often
needed to adhere to two sets of procedures. Second, the World Bank and the IADB faced
difficulties coordinating with each another in the execution of the project components. At the
design phase it was agreed that IADB would execute components 1 and 2, and the World Bank
components 3 and 4, with distinct grant agreements with each agency. However, since the project
components were not designed to be stand-alone sets of activities, and intended to build upon one
another sequentially, this required close coordination in the implementation of their respective
components, which proved extremely challenging.

2.2.5. Geographic dispersion: While the project was explicitly designed to cover
geographically dispersed areas, the fact that it spanned seven countries, and within those
countries, targeted some of the most remote and impoverished indigenous communities in the
region created huge challenges in implementation. The project relied almost entirely on the
locally-based LOs for monitoring and reviewing project performance, and this was a huge
limiting factor in assessing project performance.

2.2.6. Low capacity at the community level: The project's key strength was its participatory
nature, and therefore consisted of a core component to develop and implement participatory
project monitoring and evaluation, including community development of indicators and
community level monitoring of progress. This was essential to build indigenous communities'
trust in such development processes and to make sure that their priorities were fairly represented.
Yet, given the extreme challenges of engaging dispersed communities with low levels of human
capital, and no prior exposure to formal project procedures, including monitoring and evaluation,
it proved extremely difficult to actually realize the goals of the project with respect to
participatory monitoring.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. Component 4 of the Project, "Participatory Project Monitoring and Evaluation" was
dedicated to both monitoring the project's progress as well as building the capacities of the
executing agency, their organizational partners, and participating communities to participate in
such monitoring and to understand the results. This component was successful in building
capacity in ACICAFOC to create and manage a project M&E system. However, the broad nature
of the GEO as discussed above, as well as delays in building baseline data and contracting an
M&E specialist for ACICAFOC, affected the establishment of a robust M&E system. These
issues were noted by the 2008 QALP review and the MTR. Following changes in IADB team
leadership, the transfer of team leadership from a biodiversity and forestry specialist to a social
specialist, the World Bank incorporated a biodiversity expert into the Bank team in 2008. Prior to
that time, given the Bank's responsibility for the income generating and project
management/monitoring evaluation components, this expertise was not seen as central to the
project activities. Adding such an expert to the Bank team bolstered the M&E efforts.

2.3.2. The baseline studies (including monitoring forest cover, ecosystem fragmentation, and
presence of bird species), were completed in 2008 and based on these, an M&E system was
prepared. This system utilized social and bio-diversity indicators, and was designed to furnish


                                                11
targeted monitoring reports. With the incorporation of a biodiversity specialist on the Bank
supervision team after the 2008 MTR, the team began using the GEF4 tracking tool to monitor
project impact on biodiversity conservation. These tools have been useful for capturing some
impacts. Given ACICAFOC and its organizational partners' new M&E capacity, as well as the
fledging capacity in indigenous communities, there is potential for more consistent community
involvement in future project monitoring. Moreover, the baseline data collected in 2008, while
too late to be of use for the project, has the potential to be utilized for ongoing biodiversity
monitoring with the involvement of indigenous peoples in the process.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1. The Project triggered OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04
(Natural Habitats), OP 4.36, GP 4.36 (Forestry); OPN 11.03 (Cultural Property)4 and OD 4.20
(Indigenous Peoples).

2.4.2. Environmental Assessment and Natural Habitats. The Project was classified as
Category B. An Environmental Analysis was done and an Environmental Management
Framework (EMF) prepared. No adverse impacts were identified during project preparation. The
EMF was prepared to serve as an operational instrument to ensure appropriate environmental and
social management during project execution. The project supported community organizations in
setting a policy framework, planning environmentally sustainable development. The EMF
provided the required screening to support subprojects for sustainable production and marketing
of traditional products. The Project was in compliance with OP 4.0, BP 4.04, GP 4.04 and
OP4.36, GP 4.36.

2.4.3. Cultural Property. This policy was triggered because the project was to be
implemented in areas comprising cultural heritage sites. No physical or cultural property was
adversely affected during project implementation. Sub-projects have respected cultural sites,
strengthened and incorporated traditional knowledge and customary law promoting community
participation and biodiversity protection in land planning. The project was in compliance with
OPN 11.03.

2.4.4. Indigenous Peoples. The Project was an indigenous peoples' community development
project. It was prepared and implemented taking into consideration indigenous peoples' views and
perceptions gathered through extensive consultations. The indigenous peoples constituted more
than 90 percent of the project beneficiaries. Therefore, the project itself was considered an
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (World Bank OD 4.20). The core of the project was to
promote indigenous peoples community participation and a common vision in conservation
protection and land planning based on indigenous peoples' traditions. The project was in
compliance with OD 4.20.

2.4.5. Involuntary Resettlement. During project preparation it was determined that the project
did not trigger the IR policy as it would not involve any taking of land or any restriction of access
to legally designed parks and protected areas. There is no evidence that the project resulted in
any involuntary displacement or restriction of access. Therefore, the project rightly did not trigger
OP 4.12.

2.4.6. Financial Management. Slow start-up was a problem for most of the activities, which
was expected due to the complex institutional arrangements, and the executing agency and
participating communities' minimal direct donor-financing experience. The project complied with
fiduciary requirements and all recommendations resulting from the Bank's audit reviews. The
funds were fully disbursed by project closing.

                                                            
4
    There is a new policy OP 4.11 Management of Cultural Property.



                                                               12
2.4.7. Procurement. ACICAFOC initially experienced difficulties implementing the required
procurement procedures. This resulted mainly because of (a) the organization's inexperience
working with the procedures of international banks; (b) having to simultaneously adhere to the
WBG and IADB's different procurement policies and requirements; and most significantly (c) the
difficulties of implementing such procurement procedures with low capacity rural and indigenous
communities living in remote, rural sites. Nonetheless, ACICAFOC with guidance from the Bank
was instrumental in making key operational adjustments to overcome these obstacles. The
community participatory procurement method adopted, which disbursed funds to the LOs against
proven results instead of relying on receipts for individual expenditures, was far more compatible
with the circumstances in beneficiary communities. As a result procurement was rated
Satisfactory throughout most of the life of the project. Executing agency staff participated in
several training sessions which increased their knowledge and understanding of Bank's
procurement procedures.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase.

2.5.1. Sustainability. ACICAFOC and CICA as a strategic partner have been working on
developing a sustainability plan that will be completed after the IADB project closes on March
12, 2011. The plan consists of a program to consolidate the community participation model using
funds from other donors. To achieve this, ACICAFOC has already opened offices in Nicaragua
and Honduras. The sustainability plan also includes finalizing agreements with international
NGOs and community-based organizations.

2.5.2. During the life of the Project, ACICAFOC successfully obtained about US$11 million in
leveraged funds from other international agencies5 to continue working to realize the project's
underlying objectives. Additionally, the organization is now implementing a JSDF operation of
US$ 1.9 million, and a KfW-grant of US$ 6.5 million (ACICAFOC and CICA are participating in
this initiative) to support strengthening the cocoa network and the community natural resources
management in the MBC, respectively.

2.5.3. It is expected that the baseline data prepared by the project would contribute to future
efforts to conserve biodiversity and to foster community-based resource management6 . The use
of this information to continue monitoring biodiversity and to include indigenous peoples in this
process is one of the most important project achievements. It is expected that the new skills in
territorial planning and land use management will help the region to be in a better position to
raise funds from donors as they work to continue these activities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
     Rating: Medium

3.1.1. The Project Development Objective was, and continues to remain, highly relevant for
the region. The protection of the MBC remains a priority objective for Central American
countries, and for many there is an explicit emphasis on doing so, while concurrently preserving
indigenous peoples' lands and sacred sites. MBC conservation is critical for mitigating threats
resulting from development and climate change. Project objectives continue to be at the top the of
the world-wide policy agenda. Commitments agreed to at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit
and the recent Nagoya Summit on Biodiversity (October 18-29 2010) reinforce biodiversity
conservation as a top priority for Central America. Country Partnership Strategies for all the

                                                            
5
  Some of these agencies are KfW, JSDF, IICA, UNDP and GTZ. Additional funds have been used to continue
biodiversity protection activities and implementation of land use plans.
6
  According to the GEF-4 Tracking Tool, the Project at completion managed to gather data about the avifauna
communities, forest cover and fragmentation status. Furthermore, the Project created a directory of indigenous
communities and organizations.

                                                               13
countries reflect international agreements on biodiversity conservation and their commitments to
poverty alleviation and to fostering inclusion of the most vulnerable populations, although not all
the countries explicitly mention indigenous peoples. Given that the issue was, and continues to
be, promoted as a regional priority, rather than on a country by country basis, it continues to be
relevant for support at the regional level. However, it is important that the substance of the
objective at the project level be kept less ambitious than biodiversity conservation, and reflects
the more achievable intermediate outcomes stemming from capacity building, knowledge
assimilation and sharing, and actual IEM plan preparation and implementation at the community
level.

3.2. Achievement of Global Environmental Objective
     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Sub-GEO 1: Strengthening the capacity, knowledge and networking of indigenous peoples to
protect and manage their natural and cultural resources.

3.2.1.   The project outcomes in terms of capacity building covered four broad thematic areas:

3.2.1.1. Building capacity for indigenous peoples to increase their knowledge and competence
         in biodiversity conservation. The project reached more than the targeted number of 100
         indigenous communities and organizations, promoting the participation of more than 350
         communities in the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, providing
         capacity building to over 4,000 indigenous peoples and 357 organizations. The range of
         formats - traditional trainings, experiential exchanges and study tours - offered a
         spectrum of learning environments and provided learning opportunities that had not
         previously been available to these communities. The communities and institutions were
         considerably strengthened in their knowledge relating to systematize traditional
         knowledge into IEM systems which was used to prepare land use plans.

3.2.1.2. Building capacity to enable communities to prepare land use plans. There were sessions
         in territorial mapping, categorization of territory according to land use (residential, forest,
         agriculture), and the use of indigenous consuetudinary norms and procedures for
         organizing territory under a traditional legal framework. Some 379 communities
         prepared 23 (plans (10 PGCT and 13 PIDCOS IP-based) IEM land use plans based on
         their strengthened capacity. The quality of the knowledge assimilated by the
         communities is demonstrated by the high quality of the IEM plans prepared by them.

3.2.1.3. Building capacity for income-generating sub-projects. Assistance was provided 472
         communities and 69 community-based organizations to support the introduction and
         implementation of the productive/conservation compatible sub-projects. The areas of
         learning included design and execution of community-based projects; biodiversity
         conservation plans and environmental services. Based on this knowledge, the
         communities generated over 90 proposals for sub-projects of which 69 were approved.
         Proposals were screened by LOs and the implementing agency for approval and
         implementation.

3.2.1.4. Capacity building to promoting indigenous cultural values and sustainable land use
         practices. The project financed applied social and biological research so as to adapt
         indigenous peoples' 'traditional' knowledge to biodiversity conservation practices. For
         example, with the direct participation of the indigenous communities, the project invested
         in assembling the main principles of the indigenous consuetudinary law so that it could
         be utilized for the conservation and sustainable use of land (by-laws).

Sub-GEO 2: Preparing and implementing culturally appropriate and integrated land use/
management plans based on traditional IP knowledge.


                                                  14
3.2.2. The project pursued biodiversity conservation through community-based resource
management practices which directly involved indigenous organizations and communities. Two
types of land use plans were prepared under the project using the knowledge and learning
assimilated from capacity building initiatives under component 1:

3.2.2.1. Community Plans for Territorial Management (PCGT). These are territorial/community
         conservation plans aimed at strengthening the capacity for traditional management of
         ecosystems of indigenous communities. Ten plans prepared under the project were
         designed in a participatory manner and executed in all countries comprising a total of
         about 200,000 hectares, benefitting 130 communities and 8,170 households.

3.2.2.2. Integrated Community Development Plans (PIDCO). These are cultural land use plans
         that used mapping, inventories of existing biodiversity resources, delimitation of
         conservation areas, and the preparation of community by-laws to regulate the cultural use
         of the land. The project through participatory approaches prepared a total of 13 plans
         across the region covering 162,809.85 hectares, benefitting 15 territories, and over 300
         communities.

3.2.3. These plans, and the processes for developing them, have offered several benefits to the
indigenous communities and the environment:

      (a) The development plans combine local indigenous practices with modern conservation
          methodologies, utilizing cultural appropriate practices to help communities identify,
          document, and support regulation of local ecosystems. These plans therefore offer greater
          potential for successful sustainable natural resource management;

      (b) Through the identification of vulnerable areas offering potential for action, the plans have
          contributed to the conservation of threatened areas rich in biodiversity resources;

      (c) In the process of creating such plans through a participatory process, communities
          utilized the knowledge obtained through the capacity building initiatives under
          component 1, and "learned by doing" the steps involved in the preparation of such IP
          knowledge adapted IEM land use plans; and

      (d) The plans provided a concrete model that could potentially guide future processes for
          land use planning at the national level in participating countries.

3.2.4. The compatibility of the plans with indigenous traditional practices, the demonstrable
conservation results, and the capacity built "by doing" have contributed significantly to the
likelihood that such conservation-supporting activities would outlive the project period. For
example, following the training in land use plan preparation, the Bribri community of Cost Rica
prepared a strategic plan and currently the community has assigned 300 hectares of forest for
protection. In Panama, following development of land use plans, the Emberá community Arimae
in the Darien and the Kuna community in Pintupo (Panamá), have protected 5,000 hectares and
900 hectares respectively.

3.2.5. Following the preparation of the land use plans, about 163,000 hectares have been
conserved under a community conservation regime, and 207,000 hectares under sustainable
cultural use across the region. The sheer scale of the IP knowledge-based IEM land use plans
(close to 400,000 hectares) is likely to have a significant impact on biodiversity conservation.

3.2.6. The GEF-4 Tracking Tool7 , which is one of the most relied upon tools to ascertain
contribution of interventions to biodiversity conservation worldwide, was introduced towards the

    The Tracking Tool measures progress in biodiversity protection.


                                                           15
end of the project in 2008. It has been the main mechanism that the project has used to measure
the "mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation." The GEF-4 Tracking Tool has gathered
information about forest cover in Central American countries, mostly related to the regions where
conservation activities have been initiated. This information, obtained by evaluating about 10
million hectares of land, with a forest cover of about 6 million hectares, provides some indication
about the species movement and conservation of biodiversity. It is clear that there has been an
enhancement in biodiversity richness in the area, including the area covered by the project. Due
to a range of factors influencing biodiversity, while it is difficult to attribute any biodiversity
improvement directly to the project interventions, it is plausible that the project made
contributions to the areas' conservation.

Sub-GEO 3: Providing income generation opportunities compatible with conservation and
sustainable natural resource management.

3.2.7. The land use plans contributed to the identification of conservation compatible income-
generating subprojects to indigenous communities and developing networks for marketing
products, including environmental services. The subprojects were highly innovative, and
developed in collaboration with local communities. In all, 69 subprojects were implemented in
the following three categories:

    (a) 42 sub-projects have supported productive enterprises and building the required
        commercial and managerial capacities. The majority of the organizations were more
        socio-ethnic than economic oriented. The Project contributed to build their
        entrepreneurial and managerial capacities and now most of them are engaged in income
        generating activities.

    (b) 12 subprojects have strengthened institutional and organizational capacity of community-
        based organizations to engage in conservation compatible productive initiatives.
        Organizations have been trained in project management including finance and accounting
        systems and on the preparation of business plans; and

    (c) 15 subprojects have directly supported the conservation of community-based natural
        resources. These organizations have piloted biodiversity conservation practices including
        water management, agro forestry, organic production and techniques to prevent land
        degradation.


3.2.8. A study was carried out in relation to the 42 productive subprojects (which constitutes
almost 65% of the number of subprojects supported by the project) to assess their outcomes. The
study covered seven subprojects in the areas of timber processing, coffee, cocoa, community eco-
tourism, and handicrafts in five countries. It highlighted that assisted enterprises:

    (a) ended up with professional marketing of products and distribution of high quality
        products to retail stores (timber processing in Guatemala);

    (b) leveraged additional financial resources from other donors, and even provided credit to
        community members expanding access to financial services (timber processing in
        Nicaragua);
    (c) prepared manuals to guide high quality subproject preparation tom seek funding from
        donors (coffee in El Salvador);

    (d) participated in international exchanges to improve the quality of their produce and offer
        credit to their members (cocoa in Costa Rica);

    (e) developed high quality tourist services (community tourism in Costa Rica); and


                                                16
    (f) recuperated traditional sewing patterns and disseminated latest communication
        technology among the members (handicrafts in Belize).

3.2.9. Additionally, all of the productive subprojects were operational and had relatively high
internal rates of return (10-28%) on short time frames (3-8 years), indicating the robustness of the
subprojects. Coffee subproject in El Salvador was the only outlier with a 5% IRR (over an 8 year
period).

3.2.10. The project also supported strengthening of networks. ACICAFOC promoted cacao over
50 cooperatives and local organizations members of the cacao network, and over 10 community
tourism community-based organizations preparing sustainable tourism plans. CICA, using the
umbrella concepts of the indigenous economy and good living, was able to strengthen its
networks focused on tourism (27 organizations), production of handicrafts (27 organizations), and
traditional nature-based products (26 organizations). This initiative has built important network
capabilities such as marketing and strategic partnerships for conservation-compatible products,
which have enabled participants to adopt strategies for revenue-generating products which
optimally use natural resources.

3.2.11. A key example of such assistance is the development of a regional cacao network. The
idea was to build the capacity of small-scale cocoa producers of both genders in areas such as:
quality improvement through training in cultivation and post-harvest management; provision of
simple on-farm fermentation and drying systems; improvements to central warehousing and
drying facilities; promotion of agro-forestry and other ecologically sound practices; crop and
family income diversification; and expanded marketing channels. The project has helped to
strengthen and formalize this network by combining the benefits of organic agriculture as a
mechanism to prevent further land degradation, while at the same time promoting the
combination of tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment. Most of the
cooperatives are currently implementing projects to improve the quality of the cacao. Only in
Nicaragua over 30 cooperatives and community based organizations are producing organic cacao
and exporting to European markets.

3.2.12. The project has also supported the development of an analysis of information relating to
environmental services supply in participating communities and the potential of communities to
receive these services at the local and regional levels. The information that has been gathered is
particularly important in promoting development in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor as a
means to both recover traditional practices and promote appropriate land use. This knowledge
has enabled participating organizations to negotiate with local government agencies as a means to
access such services. For example, in Costa Rica the Bribris and Cabecar, indigenous peoples
have traded CO2 capturing programs with FONAFIFO, a local environmental institution
promoting environmental services payment in Costa Rica, to generate revenues.

3.3. Efficiency

3.3.1. Efficiency is assessed by: (a) comparing the GEF incremental benefits expected at
appraisal with the project's achievements; and (b) assessing the rates of return on the productive
subprojects supported by the project.

3.3.2. GEF Incremental Benefits: The GEF project's contribution to the baseline scenario was
expected to be in the form of dissemination and knowledge exchange events in conservation and
sustainable natural resource management, support to conservation activities in indigenous
communities, financing of subprojects that could be perceived as best practices and replicated
across the region, technical assistance to improve institutional capacity to engage in
environmental marketing, and developing M&E capacity (let us be ensure that we have all the
points from the Annex 4 of PAD). The project has generated these expected benefits:



                                                17
3.3.3. Dissemination and knowledge exchange: The project sponsored 79 events to exchanges
experiences about community production, community mapping, cultural use of land and
sustainable uses, preparation of management plans and eco / ethno tourism in which 2,108
indigenous peoples participated. The project also sponsored 328 capacity building activities and
90 study visits in which more than 4,900 indigenous peoples and peasants from across the region
participated. There has been a huge dissemination of information to communities relating to
sustainable land use and management.

3.3.4. Support conservation activities: The project assisted indigenous communities with the
preparation of 23 community plans that identified conservation areas and promoted the use of
traditional management. As part of the preparation of these community plans, 36 training events
were conducted to strengthen local capacities for sustainable cultural land use. Training of
sustainable development and natural resource conservation was also provided at the level of each
subproject.

3.3.5. Subprojects and environmental marketing: The project financed 69 subprojects that
incorporated a community-based natural resource management approach; the lessons learned
from this experience have been systematized and are being shared across the region. The project
supported 121 communities in determining their regional offer of carbon credit and assisted in the
marketing efforts.

3.3.6. Monitoring and evaluation: The project has contributed to more effective management
by developing the organizational and technical capacity of 307 communities to conduct
evaluation of project impacts.

3.3.7. Financial Sustainability of Subprojects: The project supported 69 sub-projects which
were compatible with the overall objective of better natural resource management, a majority of
them income-generating. A study of seven such income-generating sub-projects focused on
timber-processing, handicrafts, coffee, cocoa, and community tourism shows that these are
lucrative and robust with IRRs ranging between 10-28% over 3-8 years of projected sub-project
life. The only outlier was the coffee subproject in El Salvador which indicated a 5% IRR over an
eight year sub-project period. Many assisted enterprises have successfully leveraged additional
resources from other international donors to finance their activities.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1. The GEO continues to be relevant in the context of the Central American countries, as
much at the regional level as at the country level.

3.4.2. The three key sub-GEOs were achieved in varying degrees of satisfaction - sub-GEO 1
(Moderately Satisfactory); sub-GEO 2 (Moderately Satisfactory); and sub-GEO3 (Moderately
Satisfactory). The project contributed to regional and country-level efforts to achieve more
effective biodiversity conservation and complemented local efforts by communities and
international development agencies. While promoting the sustainable use of natural resources, the
project helped to strengthen and introduce environmentally sustainable and culturally appropriate
economic opportunities to rural and indigenous populations. The project also built substantial
capacity among local communities to promote biodiversity conservation, and to incorporate
biodiversity considerations into their local development plans. Furthermore, as a result of the
training provided to executing agency ACICAFOC, the region now has an organization that
represents indigenous communities, and has indigenous staff that has the required capacity to
competently implement development and biodiversity initiatives.

3.4.3. Additionally, all of the GEF incremental benefits were realized, although not all evenly,
and all sub-projects were fully operational, with productive sub-projects having robust internal
rates of return.

3.4.4.   On balance, therefore, the overall outcome has been rated "Moderately Satisfactory".

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 
     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1. Poverty Alleviation. The project was not designed as a direct poverty reduction initiative.
However, by building communities' skills and capacity, investing in land conservation, and
piloting the execution of sustainable biodiversity income-generating subprojects, the project
contributed to poverty alleviation. The project investment in environmentally sustainable and
culturally appropriate productive subprojects and the integration of indigenous households into
existing market value chains creates new possibilities for income generation and therefore
economic empowerment for these communities. In addition, the conservation of communal lands
through the biodiversity conservation activities could potentially contribute to improving family
nutrition and food security.

3.5.2. Social Development. The project was predominantly a biodiversity conservation project
but was intended to be hugely participatory and relied on the capacity built in the communities
through a range of interventions - exchanges, meetings, visits, among others. It focused on areas
for conservation which are vulnerable and generally inhabited by poor and vulnerable sections of
the population, including indigenous peoples. About 90 percent of the beneficiaries were
indigenous peoples, while the rest were rural and vulnerable inhabitants. Given its strong capacity
building focus, the project did leave behind communities with tremendous knowledge and
learning to undertake similar initiatives on their own.

3.5.3. Gender. This aspect in the PAD and in project execution was limited to an analysis of
the general situation of women in indigenous communities in Central America. No indicator was
linked to gender nor was it explicitly considered. Nonetheless, field visits revealed the
involvement of women in income-generating activities, such as in using medicinal plants,
preparing jams from wild fruits, and honey. Women groups were also supported in making
handicrafts and sewing clothing. Clearly, all this had a positive impact on women groups, and in
their economic and social development despite the fact that this was neither explicitly mentioned
in the PAD nor expected as an outcome of the project intervention.

                                                19
    (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.4. The project's capacity building activities substantially improved the executing agency's
managerial capacity and knowledge of safeguards and fiduciary norms and procedures. In 2010,
ACICAFOC opened additional offices in Nicaragua and Honduras, complementing its
headquarters in Costa Rica. The project provided ACICAFOC with significant visibility in the
region and strengthened the organization's strategic links with CCAD. ACICAFOC has already
commenced managing a JSDF-World Bank Project in Nicaragua and has strengthened its links
and partnerships with regional Cacao y Ethno-Tourism networks. The institutional strengthening
provided by the project in terms of strategic and business development plans, institutional
assessments and training in different areas has increased the managerial capacities of the
participating organizations, including CICA. This is a substantial impact which provides the
region with an organizational resource with sufficient capacity to undertake similar biodiversity
and conservation initiatives on their own or with financial assistance from other international
donors.

    (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

3.5.5. The project has leveraged funds for new initiatives at different levels. Not only
ACICAFOC and CICA are now more capable to design and implement projects, but the liaison
and local organizations have also developed similar skills. The project has facilitated
ACICAFOC, CICA and their supported networks and organizations executing subprojects, to
obtain new funding, up to US$10.5 million, to undertake similar initiatives with assistance from
international donor community to consolidate the gains of the project, and scale up its activities.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1. Beneficiary Assessment, Surveys, and Studies. ACICAFOC and CICA as a strategic
partner conducted several studies during the last four months of the project, based on beneficiary
surveys, key stakeholder interviews, and focus group discussions. The results of these studies
formed the basis of the overall project impact assessment. The survey, studies, and workshop
highlighted the following:

    (a) The project had positive effects on biodiversity conservation and on the territorial and
        land use management (June 2010);

    (b) The LOs were highlighted as appropriate entities to carry out local level supervision of
        project activities at community level (Beneficiary Survey of June 2010);

    (c) The inclusion of indigenous peoples' perspectives and traditional knowledge in land
        planning and community-based natural resources management produces more sustainable
        results for biodiversity conservation because of its integrated nature and inclusion of local
        realities (Beneficiary Survey of June 2010);

    (d) Subprojects were sustainable (with positive IRRs), and indeed many enterprises had been
        able to secure additional funds to leverage the project assistance (Study on Sub-project
        Performance of June, 2010);

    (e) The highly participatory project approach and the direct involvement of indigenous
        peoples had a huge positive impact on biodiversity conservation initiative (Stakeholders
        Workshop of July 7-8, 2010).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: High



                                                20
4.1.1. It is expected that the communities and beneficiaries would be able to maintain the
capacity built with the plans and subprojects. However, the poverty levels that prevail in
indigenous communities and the need for immediate income could lead to an abandonment of
sustainable practices to prevent land degradation, in the process compromising the GEO
achievement.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Assessment of Bank Performance
 
     (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1. Project design and preparation involved an intensive and extensive consultation process
with indigenous peoples and rural communities, regional indigenous organizations, and
government entities. In addition, the Bank carried out a range of background studies covering
environmental, institutional, social and legal issues. Preparation was indeed very comprehensive.
However, the project design was flawed in some ways: an overly broad, ambitious, inconsistent
(across PAD) and non-measurable GEO, poorly prepared PAD which mixed up Bank and IADB
projects and also included 12 other projects without linking their contribution to the project
outcome, and underestimation of project risks created a situation in which it was unlikely, from
the outset, that the project could successfully achieve its objective. Furthermore, the challenges of
coordination between two international implementing agencies, especially when the respective
components that were funded and overseen by them were inter-dependent and sequential,
complicated project coordination and implementation. Overall, the quality at entry is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

5.1.2. The QSA-7 had rated the project quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory; and the
QALP-1 (2008) also rated the quality and appropriateness of project design as Moderately
Satisfactory.

    (b) Quality of Supervision
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3. Supervision throughout implementation was mixed. The team supervised the project at
least twice a year, and there were supervision missions dedicated exclusively to financial
management and procurement. Some supervision missions were carried jointly with IADB
representatives. The Bank team recognized the need to, and did, provide support to building
ACICAFOC's capacity, particularly in procurement and financial management. It also provided
prompt assistance to modify the procurement procedures which facilitated expeditious
implementation of project activities in remote indigenous communities. However, even in the
context of the many positive attributes of Bank supervision, there were certain aspects that were
not addressed in as much depth as they should have been, and the ISRs did not sufficiently report
the challenges the project faced. Additionally, there was no "formal revision" of the GEO to
retrofit the project's design flaws as recommended by QALP-1 had advised. A restructuring of
the GEO even at a late stage in the project period could have resulted in a better assessment of
project performance at the ICR stage.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4. In summary, given the uneven performance both for quality at entry and supervision, a
Moderately Satisfactory rating for overall Bank performance seems appropriate.

5.2. Executing Agency
     Rating: Satisfactory


                                                 21
    (a) ACICAFOC Performance

5.2.1. ACICAFOC accepted the challenge of executing this project even though it was assessed
as having weak capacity during project preparation. However, the organization has provided
evidence of professional commitment, and a capacity to learn rapidly from project preparation
and implementation experience. It is gratifying to note that the significant institutional risk
associated with ACICAFOC did not materialize during implementation, and its success as an
implementing agency is one of the positive highlights of the project. The organization has
significantly advanced its institutional capacity, and its Board of Directors has used their
experience with the project to establish their presence in the Region. ACICAFOC is now being
sought by several international donors to be the implementing agency for programs they are
funding in the Region.

    (b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

5.2.2. Despite the limitation in terms of well-trained human resources and previous experience
in working with international development banks and their procedures, ACICAFOC was able to
successfully implement the project to completion. The quality of its staff and the inclusion of
indigenous professionals were positive factors that enhanced their capacity and credibility. The
Project Coordinating Unit was initially conceived to be a small unit, but grew in response to the
unforeseen challenges during the execution of the project. The eventual incorporation of an
experienced project unit who was familiar with Bank's procedures and participatory processes
contributed to increasing the project's pace of execution. The participation of the LOs in the
supervision process contributed to the successful decentralization of the activities in the field,
helping ACICAFOC and CICA to build an operational network that was effective in isolated and
remote areas. Towards the end of the project, it commissioned some studies and beneficiary
workshops and surveys which generated information on the performance of the project. Thus,
ACICAFOC clearly responded with dedication and professionalism to implement such an
innovative, complex and challenging project.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1. Utilizing a social approach to conservation, with community capacity building as an
entry point, can be effective both for improving biodiversity protection and for promoting
sustainable livelihoods of rural indigenous populations who depend directly on their natural
environment. The project demonstrated that positive role trained communities can play in
biodiversity conservation. Through this bottom-up approach that expanded local capacity and
promoted community empowerment, the project achieved important biodiversity results.
Individual participating communities and regional indigenous networks drove project
implementation processes through participatory mechanisms that promoted co-responsibility.

6.1.2. When the World Bank co-manages a project with another multilateral agency,
particularly when working with low-capacity community-based partners, it is as important
to focus on streamlining institutional procedures as it is to ensure that responsibilities are
shared according to each agency's comparative advantage. The project has shown that
significant coordination challenges can arise when two international agencies co-manage a
project. While the project appropriately considered each agency's thematic strength when sharing
the project management responsibilities, it needed to equally plan for harmonizing administrative
and fiduciary procedures, particularly since it affected the executing agency which faced
significant compliance difficulties.

6.1.3. In a regional project, it is important to create mechanisms to maintain the
engagement of key political actors so that they preserve their commitment to the project
and reinforce the link between the project objectives the relevant regional agenda. The
implementing agency's Board of Directors and the Project Council provided important means to
connect government actors with the project, and sustain their engagement and commitment.

                                               22
CCAD and other regional bodies served as representatives and from within these entities they
provided important project oversight as well as assured the project's ongoing relevance in the
context of evolving policy.

6.1.4. Utilizing a community-based management approach helped link individual
countries' environmental and indigenous political agendas, which in turn has the potential
to make both more effective and efficient. The project contributed to engaging governments on
the Community-based Resource Management Approach. Across Central America there was a
strong governmental emphasis on and investment in biodiversity conservation and the importance
of the participation of rural and indigenous peoples to protect biodiversity resources. Some
countries had more elaborate environmental agendas and programs while others had more
sophisticated programs to protect indigenous peoples' cultures and their rights. Nonetheless, prior
to the project there was not a single country that had amalgamated both agendas. By utilizing
Community-based Resource Management Approach which linked the two agendas, the projected
functioned as a vehicle to open new avenues for thematic discussions and operations.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
 
   (a) Borrower/implementing agencies
       ACICAFOC sent an official letter on November 20, 2010 acknowledging receipt and
       expressing their agreement with the ICR.

    (b) Cofinanciers-IADB And CCAD
        The CCAD was in agreement with the ICR and only had minor editorial comments,
        which are reflected in the final document.

Component 2: Promotion of Sustainable Cultural Land Use and Traditional Ecosystem
Management.

The project succeeded in supporting the development of plans for culturally appropriate and
environmentally sustainable land use. The additional capacity building activities were undertaken
to support the operationalization and sustainability of these plans. Many of the capacity building
activities started through this component are ongoing, supported through resources raised in
addition to this operation. Examples include trainings for sustainable cultural land use,
sustainable development and cultural conservation, and mitigation of social, cultural and
environmental vulnerabilities.

Component 3. Development of Culturally Appropriate Products, Markets, and Services for
Environmental Sustainability, in Indigenous Communities.

The main focus of this component was to support productive, income generating activities that
could provide indigenous communities with alternative means for earning critical income that
could supplant activities that degrade the environment. Products that were appropriate for the
participating communities were identified and 69 productive sub-projects were supported through
this component. Based on proposals submitted by communities, subprojects to develop bio-
conservation compatible productive activities were supported with small grants (up to $20,000)
and implemented by community organizations. More than US$ 1.3 million were funneled to
community organizations throughout the region, to invest in new infrastructure, equipment, get
training and improve their marketing skills. By implementing these initiatives, the organizations
increased their capacity to generate income and make a rational use of their natural resources at
the same time. As a result, family incomes were increased and additional positive externalities
were generated: a) active labor markets with more opportunities for people of all ages, genders,
and education levels; b) training by doing in information technologies and other skills; and c)

sense of belonging to a group and the opportunity to move upwardly. In parallel, through this
component it was possible to establish community networks for the commercialization of
traditional products, environmental services, eco-ethnic tourism, and the sale of artisanal and
natural products.

Component 4. Participatory Project Monitoring and Evaluation.

This component supported the design and implementation of a Participatory Monitoring and
Evaluation System to track project-influenced changes in ecosystems and targeted species. This
component also included requisite trainings to prepare the executing agency and community
representatives in how to participate in such a system. Training and participation were most
successful at the project-level, in terms of capacity building for ACICAFOC and CICA. The late
gathering of baseline information and the wide scope of the project when compared to the small
project investment made it difficult to capture biodiversity gains, but capacity was instilled in the
regional indigenous organizations that would be pertinent for future projects of this nature.
Engagement at the community level was more limited, related to the complexity of the
monitoring system. At the same time, the project was responsible for introducing the concept of
M&E and participatory processes in such activities to many indigenous communities for the first
time. Table 3 presents relevant outputs.

ANNEX 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

An analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic efficiency of the Project by measuring the
financial profitability and sustainability of the subprojects. The Project established a financing
window to channel resources to community subprojects. These subprojects were expected not
only to increase income but also to build capacity among communities to absorb financial
resources and manage investment projects. For this reason, the analysis considered economic,
financial, social, and environmental aspects to evaluate a sample of seven subprojects. The
sample included two timber subprojects in Guatemala and Nicaragua, two agro-forestry
subprojects in El Salvador and Costa Rica, two community tourism subprojects in Costa Rica,
and a handicraft subproject in Belize. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of these
subprojects. Since an economic and financial analysis was not done at appraisal, there are no
baseline values to compare these estimates.

Methodology. The evaluation included multiple instruments to capture the wide range of
economic, financial, social, and environmental effects that the subprojects were expected to
foster. A cash flow analysis provided the estimates for the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal
Rate of Return (IRR). A balance sheet analysis provided the estimates for total asset turnover,
return on assets (ROA), and Z-Scoring to measure the likelihood of bankruptcy. A global score
sheet for each subproject was then computed by combining these parameters with other financial,
marketing, technical, social, administrative, and environmental indicators. A consultant applied
these evaluation instruments during field visits to each of the subprojects between February and
May 2010.

Results. Timber subprojects are financially sound and score the highest in the global index. Agro-
forestry and community tourism subprojects are still financially sound but their performance is
mixed. In agro-forestry, the coffee subproject seems sounder when observing the financial ratios,
but the cacao subproject has a higher NPV and IRR. In community tourism, both subprojects
have similar financial ratios, but then their IRRs diverge by 18 percentage points. The clothing
and handicrafts subproject is the least financially sound and has the lowest global score.

The analysis indicates that the subprojects contribute to efficiency gains. Except for the clothing
and handicraft subproject, the subprojects' total asset turnover ratios indicate an ability to
generate sufficient sales to cover the assets financed by the grant. The subprojects also show
profitability: all of them have positive NPVs and IRRs. In particular, timber subprojects have
ROAs higher than one which confirms that their operations are profitable Timber subprojects also
the less likely to be at risk of bankruptcy. In contrast, the clothing and handicraft subproject does
not produce enough revenue to cover its assets and has a high likelihood of bankruptcy.

The profitability of subprojects is positively correlated with more benefits to their members. In
the timber subprojects, members receive salaries that are 1.4 to 1.5 times the average salary in
their communities. In agro-forestry and community tourism subprojects the salary premium is
between 1.2 and 1.3 times. In the clothing and handicraft subproject the premium is only 1.1
times.

The global score sheet also reveals a positive correlation between marketing, technical, financial,
and administrative scores. Social indicators do not seem to be correlated with any of the business-
related categories, and environmental indicators are negatively correlated with all the other sets of
indicators. In particular, environmental performance is the most negatively correlated with
technical aspects of the subprojects. This result highlights the tension that still exists between
economic development initiatives and conservations efforts.

Conclusion. For most of the subprojects in the sample, there is indication of efficiency in the use
of grant funds. Timber subprojects seem to have the highest efficiency whereas the clothing and
handicraft subproject has the lowest. Another measure of efficiency that is more challenging to
quantify is the ability of these enterprises to leverage more resources to continue their businesses.
Some enterprises managed to find additional donors to fund their projects or at least to develop
manuals that would facilitate future donations. Some enterprises also mentioned that they would
be willing to obtain credit to finance additional investments. This willingness to continue
supporting these enterprises shows the demonstrative effect that the Project had on the
communities themselves and other donors. Considering the heterogeneity in results, a
representative sample would be required to derive more general conclusions about the efficiency
of the Project with respect to subprojects.

ANNEX 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

During the life of the project ACICAFOC and their partner CICA conducted several studies and
surveys to assess and beneficiaries' perception of Project implementation. The latest evaluation and
beneficiary surveys were carried out in 2009 and mid-2010. To prepare the ICR the bank also
organized a two day workshop in June 2010. All the studies conducted concluded that the Project
was a very "bottom-up" and innovative operation that was prepared since the outset taking into
consideration the perceptions and opinions of the key stakeholders ­ indigenous peoples and rural
communities-. Beneficiaries have emphasized the importance that the Project posed in involving
grass-roots organizations and making them key actors. There is also a generalized opinion that the
Project had complex institutional arrangements since it was involving regional, national and local
community-based organizations, non-government organizations, government entities and two Banks.
For the communities and the liaison organizations was extremely challenging helping in the design,
execution and monitoring of the Project. Some these organizations were in better conditions ­ due to
previous operational experiences- to face the challenge. However, all of them claim to have benefitted
from the Project in areas such as: capacity building; project design and management, negotiation
skills, networking efforts and biodiversity conservation efforts (Gaston 2009-2010). All participating
community-based organizations considered that one of the greatest value-added efforts of the Project
has been the community empowerment, capacity building and the possibility to learn how to negotiate
with other donors to obtain further financial and technical assistance support (survey 2009).

Beneficiaries considered that the preparation of the Plans have contributed to the rescue of their
culture and empowerment of the communities in areas such as the use of modern territorial planning
and the rescue of traditional culture and customary law while promoting at community level
sustainable practices to conserve biodiversity. The Plans have been assessed as a great tool that has
great deal of possibilities to remain in the communities once the Project finish and that could be
improved over time (Jaime Echeverria 2010).

Complementarily, the Sub projects provided the communities with financial and technical assistance
support to engage income generating activities oriented to build the entrepreneurial capacity, project
management and improve their economic and social well-being. Most of the subprojects have been
highly satisfactory (Gaston 2010). Beneficiaries have been able to build their organizational capacity
not only to manage the Project, but also to use it as entering point to leverage additional funds with
other donors. Some of the beneficiaries have been very successful at engaging highly competitive
productive activities such as exporting cacao and pioneering sustainable eco-tourism in indigenous
communities (Jaime Echeverria 2010).

During the two-day workshop participants highlighted the complexity of the institutional
arrangements at all levels and the difficulties that involved to all of the actors to implement and to
supervise the Project. Beneficiaries also highlighted the importance of the participatory and bottom
up approach applied during the design and implementation. Beneficiaries acknowledge the
complications and difficulties that this approach embraces but congratulate both Banks for have
accepted the challenge. The capacity building impact that the Project had in both ACIACFOC and
CICA was also discussed as one of the most important value-added of the Project. Both regional
organizations managed to build their institutional and human resource capacity along with their
reputation across the region and in Latin America.

ANNEX 7: Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) Program was launched by the Central American
governments recognizing the importance of preserving the gene pool by making an intelligent use
of the natural resources of the region. In 1995 the Heads of State of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama instructed the Central American Commission on
Environment and Development (CCAD) to ensure the implementation of the Program to establish
connections of protected areas located between the South Mexico and northern Colombia. The
MBC gives great importance to combining work in national protected areas with conservation of
biodiversity in community-owned land. In Central America, these lands contain a high percentage
of the remaining forests and are usually in the hands of indigenous communities, which have a
strong moral and ethical basis for the conservation and protection of biodiversity. Indigenous
peoples and rural communities are very interested in programs aimed at environmental and
biodiversity conservation and community development that follow strict economic and social
criteria based on respect and a harmonious relationship with nature.

In this context, the Project aimed to "achieve more effective biodiversity conservation in the seven
Central America participating countries by strengthening the capacity of indigenous communities to
protect and manage their natural and cultural resources, and by recuperating and promoting their
cultural values and sustainable traditional land use practices, thereby helping to: (a) prevent further
land degradation that threatens environmental services, livelihoods, and economic well-being; and
(b) conserve the region's high, though increasingly threatened, biodiversity resources".

The program covered ten eco-regions located in seven countries and was to be implemented in five
years with a US$ 9 million Global Environment Facility (GEF) Grant. The Inter American
Development Bank (IDB) joined forces with the World Bank as implementing agencies of the GEF,
while ACICAFOC, acted as executing agency, and CICA as a strategic partner. Liaison
Organizations (LOs) were identified at the local level, which in turn were the link with the
Community Organizations (Cos).

The Project was aimed at indigenous and peasant communities located in the geographical scope of
the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), and supported different activities consistent with
biodiversity conservation and income generation. These included the development of community
land use plans, productive and natural resources management subprojects, and strengthening of
networks. The Project generated knowledge and capacity building in the local communities and
organizations involved in thematic areas such as Project management, monitoring and evaluation,
natural resources management, development of proposals, accountability, transparency, and Project
design, among others.

This Project involved working along with very different countries, cultures and thematic areas; a
variety of "languages" and incentive structures. Yet the executing agency managed to strike the
right balance between the interests of the different parties. During the initial stages, there was a
great effort put into the clarification of concepts, ideas and planning the way forward. Furthermore,
there was lack of clarity and agreement about the roles and responsibilities of the different parties
involved. All of this led to discontent about Project execution, which ended with the replacement
of the Project's PCU's staff. Despite these changes the commitment and dedication to the Project
by all parties involved, including the banks, the Board of Directors, CICA, ACICAFOC, CCAD
and the Project staff, the Project development objectives were achieved.

The implementation of 69 sub-Projects, consisting of US$ 20,000 grants made to local
organizations, had a great effect in community organizations that reportedly were not subject to
government's support and sometimes even development aid (credit, financing or technical
assistance). These organizations often have no assets to use as collateral, or any ability to borrow,

                                             43
              or the skills necessary to apply for aid. The Project provided the opportunity to acquire those skills.
              From the point of view of these organizations, the grants received had a high yield, because
              financial resources were a constraint, limiting the ability to invest in machines, tourism
              infrastructure, or get training for their staff. Under these circumstances even a modest amount of
              money can generate benefits and help solve pressing problems. Moreover, the preparation of 23
              community plans is having a positive impact on biodiversity conservation in the region, while at the
              same time strengthening different aspects of the indigenous culture.

              The Project supported the development of two very useful tools: CICA's Balu-Wala8 13 for the
              construction of its Comprehensive Community Development Plans (PIDCOs) and ACICAFOC's
              Sustainable Livelihoods approach for its Community Land Management Plans (PCGTs). As
              mentioned by an indigenous leader in Bocas del Toro "...in many of these communities the local
              culture was undervalued, and was lost in favor of a Western model of development." The
              development of these plans and the methodology helped to reassess of this culture by younger
              people who now feel more proud of their heritage.

              The Project also supported CICA and ACICAFOC to strengthen their networks, each with its own
              approach. ACICAFOC sought to increase revenues and promoted cacao, community tourism and
              environmental services networks. CICA, using the umbrella concepts of the indigenous economy
              and good living, was able to make its networks stronger. These included tourism (27 organizations),
              production of handicrafts (27 organizations) and traditional products of nature (26 organizations).
              All activities have increased important capabilities in areas such as marketing, strategic
              partnerships, marketing of environmentally friendly products and tourism. These networks have
              enabled participants to adopt strategies to optimize the use of natural resources.

              The Project considered capacity building as a crosscutting theme that existed in virtually all levels
              of the PMIIE's operation. Components 1 and 2 aimed at institutional strengthening and capacity
              building, however, all program activities have had an impact, and improved the capacity of
              communities to participate in a more efficient conservation of biodiversity. Local and regional
              transfer of skills, experience and expertise has been promoted. Beneficiaries are not only at
              community level but at all levels; the staff of implementing and executing agencies has improved
              their capabilities for working with indigenous communities. At the local level there was
              improvement in basic skills such as preparing proposals and managing subprojects, and high value-
              added skills, such as how to manage a Project with development aid. Both CICA and ACICAFOC
              currently have regional capacity building strategies as a result of the Project.

              All of the Project's actions helped to reduce poverty in indigenous communities and to develop
              skills for the conservation of biodiversity. The objectives included in the Grant Agreement for the
              Project have been satisfactorily achieved. Considering the grant amount, the scope and the
              complexity of the design, and the experimental nature of this initiative, the Project was able to show
              major achievements.

              The Project not only achieved its objectives but also produced a series of additional positive
              externalities and leveraged fresh resources. This includes linking with other donor organizations,
              developing capacities to create proposals and increasing the profile and influence of these
              organizations at national and regional levels.
