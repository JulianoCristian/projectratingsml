The\n            components are : 1) Cultural and institutional\n            strengthening, and capacity building of participating\n            communities, which consists of a) generation and\n            strengthening of the organizational, technical and\n            administrative capacities of indigenous communities\n            regarding the application of their cultural values to the\n            management of their natural resources; b) standardization\n            and criteria formation for traditional ecosystem management\n            of indigenous communities, including a certification process\n            for them to engage in effective ecosystem management, and;\n            c) strengthening empowerment capacities of community\n            organizations for traditional ecosystem management. 2)\n            Promotion of sustainable cultural land use and traditional\n            ecosystem management entails the development of a\n            progressive series of community conservation, and\n            sustainable cultural land use plans that together can form a\n            network of land use areas, to yield greater collective\n            conservation impacts, actually focused on actual planning\n            and management of conservation areas. 3) Development of\n            culturally appropriate products, markets, and services for\n            environmental sustainability in indigenous communities will\n            channel grant resources to develop financial mechanisms at\n            the community level. Specifically, it will finance a\n            progressive series of community biodiversity conservation,\n            and sustainable use subprojects, compatible with the land\n            use plans. Grant activities will focus on income-generating\n            opportunities in four categories: a) traditional products;\n            b) environmental services; c) eco/ethnotourism; and, d)\n            traditional ecosystem management models. 4) Participatory\n            project monitoring and evaluation will support training and\n            capacity building on monitoring and evaluation of project\n            impacts, and also progress in conservation and sustainable\n            use of biological diversity. It will finance scientifically\n            sound monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity, to follow\n            project implementation and biodiversity changes over time."}, "docdt": "2004-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
