Management in Indigenous Communities (GEF) Project for\n            Central America were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to global environment outcome was\n            high, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) involvement of communities and\n            beneficiaries at all stages of the project; 2) fostering\n            information sharing among indigenous groups is essential to\n            promote improved conservation practices; 3) income\n            generating activities are an effective mechanism to promote\n            sustainable biodiversity conservation and ecosystem\n            management. The first two lessons were incorporated in the\n            project preparation and design stage through highly\n            participatory processes.
