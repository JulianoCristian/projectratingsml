The project has been classified as\n            Category B in compliance with the Bank's environmental\n            assessment policy, particularly regarding productive,\n            community subproject implementation. It is worth mentioning,\n            this is not expected to cause major environmental\n            degradation, however, given some subproject sites are\n            located within highly sensitive environmental, and social\n            areas, an environmental management framework is thus\n            required. Subprojects shall undergo an environmental\n            screening to determine whether it falls under high,\n            moderate, low, or, with no environmental risk. Those\n            subprojects classified within a high to moderate risk, will\n            require an environmental assessment, and management plan;\n            moderate to low risk (generally located within buffer zones,\n            identified as important biological and social ecosystems),\n            will require an environmental report; while, those with no\n            environmental impact will only be subject to relevant\n            technical environmental specifications. Subprojects in, and\n            around protected areas, or within critical natural habitats,\n            will undergo environmental mitigation, such as soil\n            protection, and specific land uses. Reforestation projects\n            will require management plans to ensure its sustainability.\n            If indigenous populations are to be affected, an indigenous\n            peoples plan based on consultations, and community\n            participation will be developed. Particular attention will\n            be given to archaeological or cultural sites, to be\n            protected as possible. The report provides recommendations,\n            and mitigation measures against potential, major adverse\n            impacts, such as: petroleum exploration works, roads\n            construction, livestock expansion and production,\n            pastoralism, agricultural development, and possible timber extraction."}, "docdt": "2004-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
