through sound\n            management of soil and water resources and minimization of\n            adverse effects on natural ecosystems.  Biodiversity is not\n            expected to suffer any significant degradation since the\n            project would not finance any irrigation and drainage\n            activity within areas defined for protection and\n            preservation under natural conditions.  In the development\n            and operation and maintenance of the irrigation sub-sector,\n            a number of standard environmental issues have been\n            identified, such as: physical degradation of soil, water\n            contamination from agrochemicals under intensified\n            agriculure; wasteful use of water; deteriorating quality of\n            irrigation water; sedimentation of reservoirs; and damage to\n            biodiversity.  Through environmental assessment, steps will\n            be taken within the project to address such issues in: 1)\n            the identification of options to expand agricultural output;\n            2) initial irrigation and drainage sub-projects'\n            selection; 3) feasibility analysis; and 4) construction and\n            monitoring and evaluation of the irrigation and drainage\n            operational phase."}, "docdt": "1994-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
