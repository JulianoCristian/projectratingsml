main objective of the project is to\n            develop and implement a soil and water management strategy.\n            The latter would target irrigation development as a way to\n            increase, diversity, and sustain agricultural output and\n            exports. The first component, natural resource management,\n            comprises: (i) pilot development schemes in micro-catchment\n            areas of the Santa Lucia River Basin; (ii) demonstration\n            farms in selected agro-ecological areas suffering soil\n            degradation and erosion problems; (iii) a geographical\n            information system to provide the groundwork for improved\n            land use classification and management; (iv) applied\n            research and technology transfer activities focussed on\n            modern techniques of soil and water management; (v) special\n            studies; (vi) strengthening of policy planning, evaluation,\n            and monitoring capacity at the level; and (vii) technical\n            assistance for forestry development. The second component,\n            irrigation development, comprises: (i) the rehabilitation\n            and modernization of existing public irrigation and drainage\n            (I&D) schemes; (ii) construction of new medium-size\n            collective irrigation and drainage schemes for the benefit\n            of user groups; (iii) construction of selected small farmer\n            irrigation infrastructure; (iv) water harvesting pilot\n            program at the farm level to help develop an optimal surface\n            water use strategy; and (v) technical assistance for\n            feasibility studies of irrigation investment projects, and\n            for production, processing, and marketing of non-traditional\n            export products."}, "docdt": "1993-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
