Project for\n            Congo, Democratic Republic of were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the innovative nature of the project, with\n            a limited number of key conditions designed to speed up\n            sector reforms, building entirely on existing dialogue and\n            ongoing bank financed sector operations, allowed the project\n            to disburse 63 percent of funds in four months. Usefulness\n            of relying on existing structures to implement an emergency\n            project. Possibility of targeting funds from payment of the\n            government's utility bills. However, the approach does\n            not allow attribution of utilization of the funds by the two\n            companies and future operations should weigh the objective\n            of crisis response against a more clear focus on\n            demonstrated impacts on the ground. The system of\n            reimbursement of teacher salaries allows verification that\n            funds go towards reimbursing the government for services\n            actually delivered by teachers. Need for close technical and\n            fiduciary support to this type of emergency project to\n            assure full respect of compliance with fiduciary needs."}, "docdt": "2011-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
