     DRC EMERGENCY PROJECT TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE
                      FINANCIAL CRISIS

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director (AFCC2) to
introduce changes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Emergency Project to
Mitigate the Impact of the Financial Crisis (P115642) as requested by the Ministry of
Finance in its letter dated May 14, 2010, and any accompanying amendments to the
project's Financing Agreement.

2.       According to Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement dated March 2, 2009, the
objective of the project is to help mitigate the immediate and severe impact of the global
financial crisis on DRC's economy by providing short term transitional support to fund
critical imports and maintain targeted essential social services.

3.     The Project consists of the following components:

       Component 1: Essential imports of critical goods and commodities. This
       component would finance imports by the private sector of goods and commodities
       detailed on a positive list and including food products, construction materials,
       telecommunication equipment, and petroleum and fuel products.

       Component 2: Primary and secondary school teachers' salaries. This component
       would finance primary and secondary education teachers' salaries for the month
       of November 2008. It will contribute to ensuring continued provision of education
       services throughout the country.

       Component 3: Financing State water and electricity bills. This component would
       help cover part of the public utility bills. This would prevent the crisis from
       aggravating the financial position of the national water utility (REGIDESO) and
       of the national electricity utility (SNEL) and causing services to deteriorate, thus
       jeopardizing on-going recovery efforts. The component would also finance
       Operating Costs and consultant services to carry out project management,
       monitoring and evaluation, procurement and audits.

4.      The Grant was approved on February 26, 2009 for an amount of US$100 million
and became effective on March 20, 2009. The main purpose was to address some of the
near-term impacts of the financial crisis and sustain economic activities until the
government's policy responses could take effect and medium-term donor support could

                                            1
be fully identified. It would ensure that economic activities relying on imports can
continue uninterrupted and protect the functioning of essential social and utility services.
The closing date, which was originally scheduled for March 1, 2010, has been extended
for five months to ensure that remaining funds are fully utilized.



PROJECT STATUS
5.      Since its effectiveness, the ratings of both the Implementation Progress and
Project Development Objective have been consistently satisfactory. As of June 15, 2010,
95 percent of the Grant has been disbursed. The Project has already met its objective,
significantly contributing to mitigate the immediate and severe impact of the global
financial crisis on DRC's economy by providing short term transitional support to fund
critical imports and maintain targeted essential services. The level of international
reserves increased from about an equivalent of 1.5 weeks of imports (or US$78 million)
in December 2008 to about 8.4 equivalent weeks of imports (or US$1,073 million) in
February 2010.

6.      For Component 1 (Eligible imports) 98 percent of the allocated amount has been
disbursed. For Component 2 (Payment of Teachers Salaries), 70 percent of the allocated
amount was disbursed shortly after effectiveness though a portion had to be refunded to
the Bank in February 2010 (refer to para 7 below). For Component 3 (State water and
electricity bills, including project management costs) about 91 percent of the amount has
been disbursed. Under this Component 3, the Project financed the State's water and
electricity bills for the first six months of 2009, as initially planned.

7.      The project has been closely supervised during its implementation. In twelve
months, four supervision missions have been carried out. During the last supervision
mission of February 2010, the Bank team reviewed the final audit of component 2
(teachers' salaries) which revealed that US$4.5 million of expenditures had to be
qualified as ineligible expenditures due to non-compliance with the exact terms in the
Financing Agreement. According to the audit report, the amount of ineligible
expenditures were primarily attributed to the portion of salaries paid to "replacement
teachers" who were not on the public payroll ("enseignants non mechanisés") while IDA
only agreed to reimburse salaries of teachers on the official payroll. It should be noted
that the practice of paying replacement teachers with salaries of teachers who have left
for various reasons (retirement, death and resignation) is permitted by the DRC
government. The audit report did not indicate that these ineligible expenditures resulted
from mis-procurement, fraud or corruption. The ineligible amount was subsequently
reimbursed by the Government and allocated to the Category from which it was initially
disbursed. In view of the above, Component 2 is deemed completed with an undisbursed
amount of SDR 2.6 million (the equivalent of the US$4.5 million) available.

8.     The project closing date was also extended from March 1 to August 31, 2010 to
allow the completion of all project activities to be financed under the Grant. These
include (i) collecting necessary documentation to justify expenditure under Component 1,
                                            2
(ii) conducting studies on the impact of Component 3 (Payment of state water and
electricity bills) on the budgets of REGIDESO and SNEL, and (iii) conducting technical
and financial audits of the project.

9.     Project ratings

       (i)     Implementation progress is rated satisfactory and the project has achieved
               its objectives. All three PDO indicators (i) Shortages of key commodities
               over the next 3 months, (ii) Number of months teachers receive timely
               payments, (iii) Payment of state water and electricity bills for REGIDESO
               (National Water Utility) and SNEL (National Electricity Utility) have
               been met.

       (ii)    Project Management, Procurement, Counterpart funding and Monitoring
               and Evaluation ratings are "satisfactory".

       (iii)   No safeguard policies were triggered under the project.

       (iv)    Financial Management is rated "moderately satisfactory". This is due to
               the findings of the audit of Component 2 (teachers' salaries).

       (v)     The recipient has complied with legal covenants and there are no
               outstanding audits.


PROPOSED CHANGES
10.     The proposed change is recommitting the reimbursed amount of SDR 2.6 million
(the equivalent of the US$4.5 million) under Component 2 for use under Component 1, as
detailed in Annex 1.

11.     The Implementing Agency's action plan to ensure that the funds can be absorbed
and fully utilized by the project closing date will simply involve financing imports of
essential goods and commodities under Component 1 of the project. Details of the
reallocation can be found in the attached Annex.
