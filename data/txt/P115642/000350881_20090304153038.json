project paper provides a grant to\n            the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to finance an\n            emergency recovery support to address some of the near-term\n            impacts of the current financial crisis and sustain economic\n            activities until the government's policy responses can\n            take effect and medium-term donor support can be fully\n            identified. The Emergency Project to Mitigate the Impact of\n            the Financial Crisis (EPMIFC) will finance the short-term\n            costs associated with: (i) the import of essential goods and\n            commodities, (ii) the salaries of teachers in the primary\n            and secondary education sector, and (iii) the State water\n            and electricity bills. It would assure that economic\n            activities relying on imports can continue uninterrupted and\n            protect the functioning of essential social and utility\n            services. In line with the Bank's rapid response policy\n            on emergencies and crisis, this grant would support measures\n            to mitigate or avert the impact of the financial crisis on\n            the country's economic activities, and help preserve\n            essential services as well as human, institutional, and\n            social capital."}, "docdt": "2009-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
