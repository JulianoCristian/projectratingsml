The main\n            purpose was to address some of the near-term impacts of the\n            financial crisis and sustain economic activities until the\n            government's policy responses could take effect and\n            medium-term donor support could be fully identified. It will\n            ensure that economic activities relying on imports can\n            continue uninterrupted and protect the functioning of\n            essential social and utility services. The closing date,\n            which was originally scheduled for March 1, 2010, has been\n            extended for five months to ensure that remaining funds are\n            fully utilized."}, "docdt": "2010-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
