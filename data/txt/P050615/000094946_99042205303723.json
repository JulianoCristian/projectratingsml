   efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of public services.\n            This project, phase one of a comprehensive reform program\n            consisting of sequenced events to be achieved over an\n            eleven-year period, uses the Adaptable Program Lending (APL)\n            instrument. The project aims to a) re-define the role and\n            functions of the state; b) design appropriate institutions\n            and systems to implement this role; and c) rationalize the\n            existing structure and systems to meet the new design. The\n            project has three different components: The first component\n            reforms subvented agencies to make the public sector\n            cost-effective and to reduce the financial burden on\n            government budget by critically reviewing the mandates of\n            mandated agencies--closing down those without a clear\n            mandate, and restructuring those with a viable mandate. The\n            second component restructures the central\n            government--reviewing mandates and responsibilities,\n            removing duplications and overlaps, developing new roles and\n            missions, and realigning functions in line with the\n            decentralization policy. The third component specifically\n            targets systemic constraints in the public sector: it\n            implements a human resource management system, a performance\n            system, an incentive system, and a management information\n            system as well as introduces private sector input and\n            standards on government operations."}, "docdt": "1999-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
