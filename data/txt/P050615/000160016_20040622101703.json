PROJECT,TF033661-GHANA - FINANCE", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project ratings are as follows; Project\n            outcome is unsatisfactory, sustainability is unlikely,\n            Institutional development impact is modest, Bank performance\n            is unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance is\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned included the following: 1) A\n            high level of ownership and commitment is critical for\n            public sector reform. Public sector projects are different\n            as reform/change is the heart of the project. It is not\n            possible to successfully implement a public sector reform\n            project without complete ownership of and commitment to the\n            program within government.  2) Credible evidence of\n            political commitment to the difficult aspects of the reform\n            should be available at the time of appraisal. In the case of\n            a change in government, continuation of the project (in this\n            case, extension) should be subject to similar indications of\n            commitment. 3) For difficult public sector reform projects,\n            it might be a good idea to keep the project life within the\n            life of the government. In any event, starting\n            implementation such a short time before elections (about a\n            year in this case) is not prudent. 4) It most cases it might\n            be too much to expect sustained commitment to reform over an\n            eleven year period. Although, in the circumstances, the\n            choice of the APL instrument mitigated this risk it might\n            have been more prudent to test commitment with a 2-3 year\n            pilot. 5) The implementing and coordinating agency needs to\n            have suitable authority. 6) Keep the project focused. The\n            scope of the project should be limited to components that\n            are inter-related and within which there is a synergy. 7)\n            Linkages between components of a reform and the sequencing\n            of those reforms need to be recognized at design and\n            implementation stage. 8) Appropriate monitoring and\n            evaluation mechanisms are required to monitor the impact of\n            the reforms. 9) For consultancy-intensive projects the\n            supply side is of critical importance."}, "docdt": "2004-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
