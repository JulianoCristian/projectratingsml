utilization\n            of productive capacity in the irrigated agriculture\n            subsector from which Sudan derives the bulk of its foreign\n            exchange earnings; (b) encourage macro-economic and\n            agriculture sector policy and institutional reforms; and (c)\n            provide financing for technical assistance to help implement\n            the program. The main risks involved are existing procedures\n            and institutional constraints that tend to impede effective\n            project execution in agriculture by preventing timely\n            procurement and delivery of urgently needed inputs. The\n            project would help mitigate these difficulties through\n            institutional and policy reforms and through provision of\n            technical assistance for tendering and procurement."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
