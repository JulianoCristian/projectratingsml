1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PADI/SR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

 1.1.1 Abundant natural and human resources enabled Iraq to attain the status of a middle-
income country in the 1970s. Since that time, successive wars and a state-dominated
economic system have stifled growth and' development and debilitated basic
infrastructure and social services. International trade sanctions imposed in 1991 took a
toll on the economy. At the time of appraisal of the project, Iraq's human development
indicators were among the lowest in the region despite the country's rich resource
endowment. In addition to a complicated political transition, Iraq needed to rebuild
social cohesion and implement an economic transition from a centrally planned economy
to a diversified market economy. It was particularly important to mitigate the temporary
adverse effects of the political and economic transition on the poor and vulnerable.

1.1.2 A Needs Assessment covering fourteen sectors carried out in 2003 by the World
Bank and United Nations Development Group (UNDG) estimated that Iraq required
about US$36.0 billion for reconstruction over four years. At an International Donors'
Conference for Iraq in Madrid on October 23-24, 2003, donors expressed support for the
Needs Assessment and pledged about US$32.0 billion for the four-year period covered
by the Needs Assessment. Donors also asked the World Bank and UNDG to set up an
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) to ensure swift, flexible, and
coordinated donor financing for priority investments consistent with the Needs
Assessment. IRFFI comprised two trust funds-a World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) and
a UNDG Trust Fund.

 1.1.3 Once considered one of the best in the region, the Iraqi health system had suffered
the consequences of three major wars, inappropriate policies, poor management and the
absence of adequate resource allocation. The health system's physical infrastructure was
suffering from severe deterioration due to neglect over time and consequences from the'
war and looting, whereby most of the health infrastructure was in poor condition and was
critically lacking essential equipment. Also, the Ministry of Health (MOH) capacity to
formulate and implement policies, and manage the provision of basic services was very
weak. Substantial investments were urgently needed to build up a sufficient capacity at
the central, Governorate, and district levels.

1.1 4 According to the 2003 UNICEFIWHO Health and Nutrition Watching Brief, Iraq
had the region's second-highest infant mortality (83/1,000 live births in 2002) and under-
five mortality rates (117/1,000 in 2001), a stark reversal from the improvements in the
late 1970s and early 1980s. During the 1990s, maternal mortality grew close to three-
fold (it was estimated to be 300 per 100,000 live births), with an estimated 30% of
women giving birth without a qualified health worker in attendance.           '




                                            1
1.1.5 In a meeting in July 2004· between the senior staff of the MOH and the donor
community (World Bank, UN agencies, and some bilateral agencies), the following
twelve priority areas were identified by the Ministry: (i) pharmaceuticals, vaccines and
medical equipment; (ii) emergency medical services; (iii) essential infrastructure
rehabilitation; (iv) health information system; (v) communicable disease control and
surveillance; (vi) communication equipment (hardware); (vii) capacity building and
human resources development; (viii) communication and health promotion strategy for
the health sector; (ix) health management; (x) primary health care; (xi) food safety; and
(xii) donor coordination. Given the situation in the health sector, the Minister of Health
requested assistance from the World Bank in addressing the most urgent rehabilitation
needs to strengthen the Iraqi health system and increase its capacity to alleviate the
currently soaring infant.and maternal mortality rates. Areas of priority would include: (a)
hospital rehabilitation, particularly Emergency Services capabilities and provision of
essential emergency equipment and pharmaceuticals; and (b) capacity-building and
training ofMOH staff.

1.1.6 In January 2004, the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors discussed an
Interim Strategy Note of the World Bank Group for Iraq and authorized the Bank to act
as administrator of the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund. The strategy focused on: (i)
building Iraqi capacity which was urgently needed for the reconstruction program; (ii)
preparing and implementing emergency operations to generate employment and restore
essential infrastructure and services; and (iii) laying the foundation for the medium-term
program, through studies and policy advice. The strategy relied on the World Bank Iraq
Trust Fund (ITF) to finance projects, and on Bank budget for the economic and sector
work and policy advice needed. A~cording to the Technical Annex on the Project, in
addition to· rehabilitating much-needed health facilities, the Emergency Health
Rehabilitation Project (EHRP) would be used to establish a model for planning,
procurement and financial management within the health sector. It would also allow for
the development of a stan.dardized approach to rehabilitation of health facilities and
would constitUte the most effective way for the MOH to acquire the capacity it needs to
manage longer-term reconstruction and rehabilitation activities. The amount of the ITF
financing fot. the EHRP was modest, compared· to the substantial amounts to be provided
by other inte~ational donors to finance some of the other priorities of the health sector
identified by the MOH. .

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

1.2.1 The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve access to quality
emergency services in seleCted health facilities to serve the urgent needs of the Iraqi
population. The wording of the PDO· in the Trust Fund Grant Agreement and the
Technical Annex was the same.

1.2.2 The Technical .Annex and the Project Grant Agreement listed the same Key
Performance Indicators (KPI), as follows:




                                            2
 Rehabilitation ofpriority emergency services in 12 hospitals
     a. Number of emergency units rehabilitated.
     b. Basic emergency equipment packages procured for the facilities rehabilita~.
 Provision ofessential emergency drugs
     c. Basic emergency pharmaceutical packages procured and distributed.
 Capacity-building and training ofMOB staff
     d. Number of training activities conducted on emergency medical services (EMS)
        for facility EMS staff.
     e. Number of staff trained in management of EMS.
     f. Number ofMOH staff trained in health planning, management and procurement.

 Project management
     g. Project management team inside the MOH with the capacity to prepare, issue,
        monitor and manage project activities.

 1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
 and reasons/justification                                              .

 1.3.1 The PDO was not -revised.

. 1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
  (original and revised, briefly describe the ''primary target group" identified in the PAD
  and as captured in the P DO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
  to benefit from the project)

1.4.1 According to the Technical Annex, the benefits of the project were expected to be
substantial, as the Project would address urgent needs in the health sector in an
environment of devastated infrastructure, deteriorating quality, and escalating
requirements. It was estimated that approximately 14.5 million persons living in the
surrounding areas of the rehabilitated facilities would have access to high quality
emergency medical services that otherwise would not have been adequately delivered. .

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 The Project comprised four components, to be implemented over a period of up to
24 months. It was fully funded as a Grant under the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF),
operating under OP 8.50, Emergency Recovery Assistance. Annex 2 provides detailed
information on these four components, which are briefly described below:

Component 1,' Rehabilitation of Priority Emergency Services (estimated total cost
US$19.5 million). This component would support the repair, rehabilitation and equipping
activities of hospital emergency facilities to restore fully functional emergency services
in 12 carefully selected hospitals in 9 Governorates of Iraq. These activities were
identified and prioritized using explicit criteria of need, feasibility and affordability.


                                            3
Component 2: Provision of Essential Emergency Drugs (estimated total cost US$3.2
million). This component would support the procurement and distribution of a 3 to 6
month supply of up to 37 essential emergency drugs to be used at the 12 emergency
facilities rehabilitated under Component 1.

Component 3: Capacity Building and Training (estimated total cost US$1.6 million).
This component would support capacity-building and training activities in Emergency
Medical Services for the 12 selected sites. These activities would include: (i) technical
training of emergency 5-person teams from each selected site to improve the quality of
emergency services; (ii) training in management of emergency services; and (iii) the
development of a comprehensive national plan for strengthening emergency health care
services. Additionally, the Project would support training to build the general capacity of
MOH in health planning and management at both the central and Governorate levels.

Component 4: Project Management (estimated total cost US$O.7 million). The objective
of this component was to ensure effective administration and coordination of the project
activities. The Project Management Team (PMT) would comprise 11 staff, five of whom
would be local consultants hired under the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

1.7.1 There were changes in the number of hospital emergency units to be rehabilitated
with the ITF Grant and in funding allocations. With respect to civil works, the original
12 construction packages became 13 packages with the addition of the rehabilitation of a
drug warehouse in Baghdad that was completed in 2007. On the other hand, three civil
works contracts totaling US$4.15 million were canceled. In 2006, the civil works contract
for the Yarmouk Teaching Hospital (US$1.93 million) was canceled when the
Government decided to use its own funds to construct a new emergency unit with a
capacity of 75 beds. Although the designs for both hospitals had been completed, the
civil works contracts for the Al Ramadi General Hospital (US$I.03 million) and Baquba
General Hospital (US$I.19 million) were postponed indefinitely in 2006-2007, and then
canceled in April 2007 because of the deterioration in the security situation "in the
governorates of Diyala and Anbar. Also, the Suleimaniyah-Jumhuri General Hospital
was dropped by the Project in May 2006 when it was converted into a military hospital,
but in September 2006, it was replaced by the Suleimaniyah Maternity Hospital. The
US$4.15 million allocated for the three canceled contacts were used to cover cost
increases due to inflation for the remaining contracts and the cost of the Suleimaniyah
Maternity Hospital (US$3.2 million) which was substantially higher than the appraisal
estimate for the Suleimaniyah-Jumhuri General hospital (US$0.95 million). "However, as
a result of these changes, the total amount spent on civil works contracts was 2.24% less



                                            4
than the appraisal estimate for that category. It should be noted that all 12 selected
hospital emergency units (including the ones that were not rehabilitated with the proceeds
of the ITF Grant) plus the Suleimaniyah Maternity Hospital received the basic emergency
equipment packages (medical equipment and medical furniture) and pharmaceuticals, and
their doctors and nurses were trained under component 3 of the Project.

1.7.2 Expenditures for goods and consultant services were about the same as the appraisal
estimates. There were savings in training (due in part to the fact that Saudi Arabia
funded entirely the cost of training 47 physicians in hospital-based emergency physicians
training at the King Abdul Aziz Medical Center). On the other hand, the allocation for
operating costs was substantially increased because the' original allocation was
insufficient to cover all the expenses incurred by the PMT, including travel to Amman;
also, the project period was a little more than five years instead of two years. Overall,
there was a surplus/saving ofUS$I.16 million that was canceled on September 10,2010.
As a result of these changes, there were four reallocations of Grant proceeds: on July 11,
2006; June 21, 2007; June 22, 2009 and February 18,2010.

1.7.3 The table below shows that for the main item~ namely civil works and goods, the
actual expenditures were very close to the appraisal estimates:

1.7.3 Overall, the PDO remained relevant, particularly in the deteriorating security
context which increased the need for emergency hospital services. Hence, while there
were adjustments in funding, the project scope remained the same and it was determined
that there was no need to revise the PDO. However, the February 18,2010 reallocation
was processed as a level II restructuring in accordance with the guidelines for Investment
Lending Reform.

1.7.4 The closing date of the Trust Fund Grant was extended twice (on July 11, 2006 and
June 21, 2007). In both cases, the justification for the extensions referred to the need to
provide sufficient time to complete the civil works at the hospital sites, procure the
necessary equipment and pharmaceuticals for these sites, and carry out the training


                                            5
activities. During the period 2005 to 2007, the deteriorating security conditions. and
MOH leadership vacuum led to considerable delays in project implementation.
Ultimately, despite all the difficulties arising from the security problems, the PMTIMOH
managed to continue with the implementation of the Project. Therefore, the decision was
taken to stay the course and extend the closing date of the Project. The timing of these
extensions was also influenced by the closing dates of the World Bank ITF. On July 11,
2006, the closing date of the Project was initially extended from December 31, 2006 to
September 30, 2007. A longer extension would have been more appropriate, but at that
time, the World Bank ITF closing date was December 31,2007. In June 2007, the World
Bank ITF closing date was extended once more to December 31, 2010. At that time, the
closing date of the Project was extended a second time to February 28,2010.

1.7.5 The Trust Fund Grant Agreement was amended twice during the project life:

   a) Because there was a lack of responsive bidders for pharmaceutical procurement,
       the MOH decided to procure drugs through the World Health Organization
       (WHO). On September 16, 2006 the Grant Agreement was amended to include a
       provision for the procurement of drugs from UN Agencies in accordance with the
       provisions of paragraphs 3.1 and 3.9 of the Procurement Guidelines.
   b) On March 16, 2007, the Grant Agreement was amended to change the deadline
       for audit report submission from four months to six months after the end of the
       relevant fiscal year. A six-month deadline for submission of an audit report is
     . standard.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons 0/ earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy o/participatory processes,.as applicable)

Soundness of the background analysis

2.1.1 This project was designed to address 5 of the 12 priority areas articulated by the
MOH in 2004. Taking into account the priority areas identified by the MOH and the
donor community, the Project would meet several of the urgent needs listed by the MOH
in response to the post-conflict situation. The Project would address the following five
areas: (i) pharmaceuticals and medical equipment; (ii) emergency medical services; (iii)
essential infrastructure rehabilitation; (iv) capacity building and human resources
development; and (v) health management.

2.1.2 This Project was prepared in accordance with Emergency Recovery Assistance
Procedures (Operational Policy 8.50). 1 The focus on outputs was most appropriate, given

1 OP   8.50 was replaced in March 2007 by OP 8.00 on "Rapid Responses to Crises and Emergencies."



                                                   6
the emergency nature of the operation and the short time-line. Conditions in the country
were difficult; the Project addressed the most urgent needs to improve health services,
and the main concern was to obtain concrete results and to obtain them quickly. In some
respects, a reference to outcomes (or, at least, intermediate outcomes) would have been
preferable. However, given the security and other risks, the Bank was prudent to limit the
commitments to output results because so much else was outside of the scope of
influence of the Bank and the MOH.

2.1.3 The detailed information included in the Technical Annex shows that considerable
work had gone into the preparation of the Project. Project preparation took into account
lessons from the Bank's recent experience in post-conflict countries, such as the
importance of designing a simple project that can be quickly and visibly implemented
and of including capacity building for the implementing institutions and entities in order
to improve their ability to implement current and consecutive programs.

Assessment ofproject design

2.1.4 The Project was commendably simple and relatively unambitious in scope in
response to the difficult conditions in the country at the time of appraisal, as appropriate
under the prevailing security conditions and client capacity. On the other hand, the
implementation period of 24 months was too ambitious and unrealistic. Even in a much
less challenging environment, a limited rehabilitation in 12 sites would not reasonably be
expected to be completed within 24 months.

2.1.5 The absence of quantitative targets for some KPIs, as well as the fact that
arrangements for monitoring and evaluation were not described in the Technical Annex,2
were weak points of the project design. The linkage between the PDO (referring to
"access" and "quality") and the KPIs (based exclusively on "outputs") was relatively
weak, especially in the absence of quantitative targets for some KPIs. For this type of
emergency project in a fragile state, it would have been better if the PD~ had been based
on outputs only.

Government commitment

2.1.6 The Project responded to a request from the Government's health sector leadership
at the time and was envisioned as entry to broader discussions on health strategy. The
sector leadership was committed to the PDO, and at the time, the MOH had a number of
competent and motivated staffwho participated in project preparation.




2   The Bank Task Team had to use a template for the Technical Annex which did not include a section for M&E.




                                                          7
Assessment ofrisks

2.1.7 In designing the Project, the Bank was fully aware of the high security and fiduciary
risks and took reasonable actions to mitigate these risks. According to the Technical
Annex, the political and security environment in Iraq was very unstable and uncertain,
and posed obvious risks to the Project. The identified risks included administration
changes in MOH - jeopardizing current commitment to project design and inputs - and
deterioration of security conditions, making access by contractors to sites and supervision
difficult. To mitigate these risks, the Project had a simple design, and procurement and
disbursement arrangements were developed to make implementation as straightforward
as possible. The security situation posed the most significant risk for the rehabilitation of
the emergency services sites in the 12 selected hospitals. Mitigation measures included
the use of local contractors and local Bank staff for supervision. There were also
significant fiduciary risks to the Project. These risks would be mitigated through the
selection of qualified staff in the PMT, as well as through the use of procurement and
financial management consultants to support the day-to-day implementation of the
Project. In view of the possible difficulties of making payments to contractors and
suppliers, all payments above US$1 0,000 would be made through direct payments by the
Bank. Should security conditions prevent access by Bank staff, supervision would be
undertaken by independent consultants and Fiduciary Monitoring Agents (FMA) on
behalf of the Bank. Financial management, procurement and overall project risks were
appropriately rated as high in a detailed and candid section of the Technical Annex.
Security conditions turned out to,be much worse than expected originally, but generally
the mitigation measures proposed would have appeared adequate at the design stage.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)

2.2.1 The grant provided from the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) was approved in
October 2004 and signed in December 2004 at a time of guarded optimism regarding
post-war rehabilitation. However, within six months of approval, security conditions in
the country deteriorated dramatically and remained extremely fragile for more than two
years. The MOH, which was relatively weak at the start of the Project, became virtually
non-functioning. During most of the 2005-2007 period, the PMT was largely unable to
communicate with the MOH. Even the Bank was unable to obtain responses to multiple
communications during this prolonged period, for understandable reasons, since MOH
staff lived in great danger. That danger would have been greatly enhanced by contact
with Bank staff. The Bank Task Team and the PMT displayed great courage and
dedication during this period, with PMT members literally risking their lives (in 2006, the
Deputy Minister of Health was kidnapped and has never been seen again). Conditions
started to improve towards the end of 2007 with a change in the leadership of the MOH,
and the Project began to be implemented in earnest.




                                             8
2.2.2 The following factors affected project implementation:

    a) Terrorism and the critical security situation in the country had a major impact on
        all aspects of life. Ownership/commitment greatly diminished due to the
        deterioration of security conditions in many parts of the country, which made it
        difficult for MOH staff and contractors to move about in the country and carry out
        their assignments.
    b) The volatile political situation during the transitional stage in establishing the new
        Iraqi Government, and the intense political struggle and instability within the
        MOH. The continued sectarian conflict had a major impact on the MOH.
        Between 2003 and 2006, Iraq went through four different governments, with
        frequent changes in Minister and Deputy Ministers as well as administrative
        changes at the MOH.
    c) Limited communication between the central and regional levels of the MOH
    d) The presence of coalition forces and the politicization of the Bank image,
        identified as allied with the U.S. forces.
    e) The lack of capacity within the MOH to manage the project implementation. The
       MOH possessed technical capacity, although relatively weak, at the outset of the
       project, but this virtually disappeared for two years because of the security
       situation and the loss of staff.
    f) Staffing of the PMT has been unstable. In addition, because of their limited
       experience in project management and Bank procedures; PMT staff needed a lot
       of training. Support to the PMT by senior MOH officials and technical staff has
       been erratic, in particular during the period 2005 - mid-2007.
    g) MOH and PMT lack of familiarity with Bank procedures and guidelines.
       However, the Project benefited from an excellent Master Implementation Manual
       (MIM) developed by the Bank to be used by Iraqi Ministries for all ITF-financed
       projects, and a specific Project Implementation Manual (PIM) for this Project.
   h) Delays in the recruitment of consultants, particularly for design and supervision
       services for facility rehabilitation.
   i) The weak capacity of the private sector due to years of isolation, wars and the
       security environment.
   j) Major procurement delays, particularly for pharmaceuticals.
   k) Recruitment of an international procurement advisor. Cooperation between the
       advisor and the PMT produced better results in procurement and in monitoring
       and reporting.
   I) Cash flow problems, since no special/designated account could be established.
   m) Inability of the Bank Task Team to visit the country and of the PMT to visit the
       project sites. However, this shortcoming was offset somewhat by the work of the
       FMA.

2.2.3 During implementation, the Bank fiduciary staff working on the ground in Iraq, the
PMT staff, and the FMA faced very dangerous situations such as: death threats,


                                             9
kidnappings. the constant potential for random hann. or to be uncovered as being
associated with an international organization; yet. most still worked with incredible
dedication.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&Edesign

2.3.1 At appraisal. the quality of the results framework to achieve the PD~ was rather
low. Although the focus on outputs made sense given the short-time line and the nature
of the operation. the linkage between the PD~ (referring to "access" and "quality") and
the Key Performance Indicators - KPIs (based on "outputs") was weak. For the
rehabilitation of priority emergency services. the target was set at 12 hospitals; the
targets for capacity-building and training of MOH staff were not quantified. The
arrangements for monitoring and evaluation were not described in the Technical Annex.
Although the PMT did not include a specific M&E Specialist. the M&E functions were to
be carried out by the PMT Technical Coordinator.

M&E implementation

2.3.2 During implementation. the Bank Task Team helped the MOHIPMT Team to
monitor the implementation of the project components through the preparation of detailed
output monitoring tables for each emergency unit. This is important for a project focused
on outputs. The Technical Coordinator left the PMT in early 2006. and subsequently. the
Bank recommended that the MOH contract an M&E Specialist for the Project. but this
did not occur. Also. on many occasions. the Bank drew the attention of senior MOH
officials to the need to track the project achievements more closely in terms of
improvements in access and quality of services, in particular during the mid-2007 period.

M&E utilization

2.33 Monitoring tables were prepared and used by the PMT to monitor the
implementation of project components.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA)

2.4.1 .When the ITF was created in 2003. the ITF donors required that the Bank, as
Administrator of the ITF, engage a Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA). The main
purpose. of the FMA was to help the Bank monitor physical delivery/progress, and the
recipients' compliance with financial management and procurement procedures. As part
of this function, the FMA provided on-the-job training to the PMTs. The TORs of the
FMA (January 2010) hired under the ITF to assist the Bank in monitoring the ITF-
financed projects under World Bank management are in Annex 11.



                                            10
 2.4.2 The FMA is a Baghdad-based management consultant finn that deploys about two
 dozen Iraqi professionals (mainly engineers and accountants) recruited from the private
 sector with experience in procurement and financial management and accounting. The
 FMA visited all EHRP sites throughout Iraq every month and carried out physical
 verification with digital photographs of ongoing works and goods supplied and the
 production of a fact sheet for each contract, alerting the Bank to deficiencies in quality
 and implementation. The Bank Task Team for EHRP kept close communication with the
 FMA during implementation, and invited the FMA to participate in all supervision
 missions. The perfonnance of the FMA, including the quality of the personnel, has
 improved over t i m e . '                                                         .

2.4.3 The work of the FMA has been very beneficial to the Project. The cost of the FMA
fluctUated over the years, in the USS200,000-USS250,OOO range, per project per year.
This is a substantial amount, which had to be spent since there was no alternative worth
considering. The FMA perfonnance demonstrates that, in contexts where the Bank
cannot carry out nonnal supervision missions, the Bank can mitigate risks for its program
by employing a Monitoring Agent to monitor physical implementation of projects and
verify that funds are spent for the purpose intended and in accordance with Bank rules;
the detailed TORs should also encourage quality professional advice on technical issues
and follow-up until these issues are resolved, rather than simpl~ mechanical reporting.

Procurement

2.4.4 As mentioned above, the Bank employed a FMA to assist in monitoring
procurement transactions, including conducting physical checks of all civil works and all
deliveries of goods. This 100 percent check done on behalf of the Bank is a very
interesting feature of the Project; usually, under the best of circumstances, the Bank is
able to check only 15 percent or so of the outputs. The Bank prior-reviewed over 90% of
all procurement under the Project, and the remaining contracts were reviewed by the
FMA. MOH did not recruit an international finn to assist in procurement as originally
planned because of its high cost in such a highly insecure environment; instead, during
implementation, MOH recruited an international procurement adviser who, over time,
helped produce better results in procurement and also helped in resolving procurement
issues with suppliers.

2.4.5 An Independent Procurement Review (IPR) carried out in 2009 did not find any
cases of misprocurement, but it identified a few shortcomings, for example, in bid
evaluation reports, completion and delivery periods, changes in the substance of bids, and
record keeping and filing. The review also commented that the minimum qualifying
criteria prescribed in the bidding documents for works were not adequate to ensure that
the lowest evaluated and substantially responsive bidder who meets the post qualification
test has the required capacity to complete the works in a timely and efficient manner.
The Bank staff clarified that, in order to encourage the participation of the private sector
which had been weakened by years of isolation, instability and insecurity, the Bank had
decided to lower the qualification criteria to allow more competition. This was reflected



                                            11
in the SBDs (small works) included in the MIM3 developed by the Bank for the use of
Iraqi Ministries for all ITF-financed projects.

2.4.6 There have been significant gaps between the physical completion of civil works
and the physical delivery of goods, and payments to contractors/suppliers. This was due
in part to the security problems, as well as inadequate contract management by the
PMTIMOH. It contributed to the slow disbursement under the Project and was raised by
the Bank as an issue requiring urgent attention by the PMT and the MOR. In mid 2009,
somewhat late in the project cycle, the PMT added two more staff for contract
management.

2.4.7 Due to a lack of responsive bidders for pharmaceutical procurement, the MOH in
March 2007 turned to the World Health Organization (WHO) to procure about US$2
million worth of drugs. However, there were problems with WHO procurement, and
only 7 (valued at US$189,0 13) of the originally planned 38 items were finally procured
and delivered by WHO. In the meantime, the MOH procurement process managed to
meet the emergency pharmaceutical needs, and the MOH· confirmed that it would not
require further procurement of pharmaceuticals under the Grant. WHO was asked to
refund (to the Bank) the amount that was not utilized under the WHO-MOH agreement
but that was already paid by the Bank for the items that should have been procured by
WHO. There were significant delays in WHO response, but on September 15, 2009
US$660,626 were refunded to the Bank, and the special commitment issued by the Bank
in favor of WHO was canceled on November 30, 2009.

Financial management and disbursements'

2.4.8 According to the Technical Annex, disbursements would be made primarily through
direct payment by the Bank to the contractors, suppliers and consultants. Once
authorized by the MOH, payments above the threshold of US$1 0,000 would be made by
the World Bank directly into the account of the contractor, supplier or consultant in a
commercial bank capable of receiving funds transferred from the international banking
system. There would be no special/designated account. Payments for the project
management component and payments below the threshold of US$10,000 would
normally be made by the MOHlRecipient from its own resources. These payments made
from the MOHlRecipient's own resources would be reimbursed, on a periodic basis, by
the Bank to the MOH upon presentation of proof of payment and a signed withdrawal
application.

2.4.9 Financial management (FM) risk mitigation measures described in the Technical
Annex were put into place. There were no major changes to FM during project
implementation. The absence of a special/designated account was a considerable
hindrance for the PMTIMOH during the whole project, because the proposed
reimbursement arrangements mentioned above did not work. Since all payments above

3 Volume 3 of the MIM - SBDs - Bid Data Sheet - 3.2a & 3.2c refer to the minimum required annual volume of
construction work and to the list of essential equipment to be made available for the contract, respectively.




                                                    12
    US$10,000 were direct payments by the Bank, the amounts to be deposited in the
    special/designated account would have been sma1l4 (to cover some expenditure for
    capacity building and project management) and the risks would have been limited.

    2.4.10 The disbursement rate lagged significantly during the project life. The main
    reasons for the disbursement lag include: (i) slow physical implementation; (ii) lack of
    capacity within the PMTIMOH for contract management; (iii) lack of familiarity of
    contractors with internationally accepted business practices, especially the monthly
    submission of invoices and full documentation of invoices; and (iv) payment delays to
    contractors due to the weak Iraqi banking system (for example, the PMT had problems
    with getting accurate contractors' bank account addresses).

    2.4.11 The PMTIMOH staffing for financial management was adequate. The FM team
    consisted of a Financial Officer (FO), an internal auditor and two accountants; the team
    worked on a full time basis on two ITF-financed Projects (Emergency Health
    Rehabilitation and Emergency Disabilities).         The performance of the financial
    management team improved during project implementation, and the team did a relatively
    good job overall. The project FO was the first, among other projects' financial officers,
    to deal with the problem of delay of receipt of payments in Iraqi Dinars (lQD). Due to
    the prevailing inefficient banking system in Iraq and the lack of SWIFTS, payments
    denominated in IQD used to be transferred through many banks in Jordan and Iraq until
    they reached the project or the beneficiary. The FO took the initiative of establishing
    contacts at each of these banks and, literally, moving the payments from one bank to
    another until reaching the project bank account. There was no problem with payments
    made in US Dollars.

2.4.12 The Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) that was hired by the Bank for fiduciary
purposes was effective. FMA staff visited the PMTIMOH two to three times per month
on average to: (i) review the PMT's FMRs and reconcile the PMT records to the Bank
records; (ii) monitor unclaimed expenditures; (iii) verify disbursement plan updates; and
(iv) provide on-the-job training in FM matters. The FMA included the PMT-prepared
FMRs in their quarterly reports, as well as the adjusted FMRs (with their review
comments and recommendations for the PMT FMRs). FMRs were usually submitted in a
timely manner. The FMA also conducted, on a sample basis, pre-screening and post-
review of withdrawal applications for direct payments and reimbursements.

2.4.13 During the project period, there have been issues related to weaknesses in the
internal control system of the PMT, budgeting, flows of funds, excessive payment to a
contractor, failure of the PMT to reconcile regularly the EHRP records with the Bank
client connection, and delays in payments reaching the beneficiary accounts due to
weaknesses of the banking system. Most of these problems were progressively resolved
thanks to the high commitment and pro-activity of the PMT and FO and the
implementation support provided by the Bank Task Team and the FMA.

2.4.14 Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) were satisfactory and were submitted in a
timely mi:UUler. Audit reports have usually been submitted late to the Bank, but have
been unqualified except for 2008. The 2008 audit report was qualified due to identified
ineligible expenditures; it had a number of shortcomings (missing elements, instances of
inconsistency, inaccurate amounts, as well as incomplete disclosures in the notes to the
financial statements) so that the report had to be revised and resubmitted. In its
management letter, the auditor made recommendations in order to avoid such cases of
ineligible expenditures and other problems in the future. As requested by the Bank, in
January 2010 the PMT submitted an action plan to remedy the weaknesses identified by
the external auditor. The next EHRP audit report will cover the period from January 1,
2009 up to the closing date (February 28, 2010) plus a 4-month grace period and is be .
due by August 31, 2010. At the time of this writing, the audit report has not yet been
received.

Safeguards

2.4.15 The project was appropriately classified as B. The Technical Annex had a number
of interesting sections and documents on safeguards, including: (i) Environmental and
Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF); (ii) Codes of Practice for
Prevention and Mitigation of Environmental Impacts; and (iii) Safeguards Procedures for
Inclusion in the Technical Specifications of Contracts. The ESSAF was devised and
approved by Bank management in March 2004 to provide practical procedures. of
environmental assessment and control to be included in the ITF-financed projects carried
out in a "post-conflict" country situation, similar to the frameworks prepared for post-
conflict reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Kosovo.

2.4.16 According to the Technical Annex, impacts would be those associated mainly
with: (i) rehabilitation works (e.g., safety, dust, noise, waste material, traffic); (ii)
provision of sanitary services, water supply and waste management; and (iii) maintenance
of facilities. Because of the emergency conditions, the requirement to carry out a limited
Environmental Analysis as part of project preparation would be waived but, for sub-
projects with adverse environmental impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis would be
done during project implementation but before sub-project approval. The Environmental
and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) outlined the standards to be
applied during implementation. The Bank would recruit another Monitoring Agent to
monitor environmental and social safeguards for ITF-financed projects, but this did not
happen6. Initially, the Bank tried to combine the ESSAF monitoring task with the TORs
for the FMA, but this combination proved unfeasible. An attempt to recruit an
environmental consulting firm also failed because the proposals that were received were
not found responsive. At about the same time (April 2005), an independent review of the
Bank project portfolio concluded that ''the project counterpart teams and contractors
cannot possibly abide by all the provisions outlined in the ESSAF" and "the Bank should

adopt more honest and realistic measures that can be implemented in the current
environment". One of the main reasons for this conclusion was that, in fact, the "current
environment" was one of an "in-conflict" country rather than a "post-conflict" country,
making full application of the ESSAF unrealistic. In April 2006, the Bank approved a
revision of the ESSAF to ensure minimum due diligence in managing potential
environmental and social risks in IDA- and ITF-financed operations in Iraq. Under the
revised ESSAF, Environmental Assessments will be carried out for category "A" projects
only; for category "B" projects, environmental mitigation measures will be included, as
appropriate, in the technical specifications to be attached to the civil works, goods and
services contracts.

2.4.17 During project implementation, attention to safeguards by the Bank and MOH was
minimal, perhaps because of the limited involvement of safeguards specialists: the MOH
safeguards specialist left after six months and was not replaced; and for most of the
project period there was no Bank safeguards specialist assigned to the Project. For
several years, the rating for Safeguards in the ISRs was "Satisfactory" despite the fact
that the safeguards arrangements were not implemented. PMTIMOH claimed that they
systematically monitored environmental issues in their routine assessments of the civil
works contracts under the project. On several occasions, Bank supervision missions
discussed with PMTIMOH the need for regular monitoring of the civil works
rehabilitation sites to ensure that the environmental safeguards (especially with respect to
the safe collection and disposal of infectious medical waste) were being followed by the
site consultants and contractors and by the MOH. Government appointed the Ministry of
Environment to check that environmental requirements were being complied with at the
sites. Also, towards the end of 2009, the PMT designated two of its staff to act as
Environmental Safeguards Focal Points, to follow up at the project sites with the
consultants and contractors to ensure that they were adhering to their obligations
regarding the environmental safeguards. Checklist forms for the hospital sub-projects
were finally completed and submitted to the Bank in early 2010.

2.5 Post-completion OperationlNext Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phaseIJollow-up operation, if applicable)

2.5.1 The delivery of health services by the MOH is a continuous operation independent
of the duration of any project, so that there is not really a need for explicit transition
arrangements.

2.5.2 The recurrent costs of the hospital emergency facilities will be met from the MOH
operational budget, and do not constitute a sustainability problem. Most of the trained
medical staff are back on site and available. Availability of drugs is also not likely to be
an issue; during project implementation, the MOH indicated that it had sufficient
resources to finance drug procurement and no longer required the Project's support for
the procurement of emergency pharmaceuticals. Recent visits to a number of hospitals
confirmed that drugs procured by the MOH are available.



                                            15
2.5.3 The Capacity-Building and Training Component was aimed at building capacity,
inter alia, for subsequent health projects. During the difficult 2005-2007 period, no
meaningful dialogue on health has taken place but, with the progress made by the EHRP
and the EDP, there should now be better prospects for a fruitful relationship between the
MOH and the Bank.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.0 The ICR Template and Guidelines which have to be followed are not appropriate for
a project in an in-conflict country. The ICR format. does not lend itself to effectively
telling any complex story of project implementation, including the specific pressures and
constraints of a conflict-affected situation and a discussion of whether or not the project
was worth doing given the risks to the Bank and Government Teams. In assessing the
project outcome as well as the performance of the Recipient and the Bank, the format
does not facilitate giving adequate weight to the limitations imposed by the insecurity and
the volatile political situation. There is a need for a modified version of the ICR format
that would be more suitable for emergency projects (OP8.00 Operations) in countries that
are in-conflict.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

3.1.1 The objectives, design and implementation of the Project were and remain highly
relevant to Iraq's priorities to rebuild its essential infrastructure and services. The
difficult situation in many areas of Iraq pointed to the need for more effective emergency
services, and this need continues to exist at present. The objectives are also consistent
with the Interim Strategy Notes (lSN) for Iraq. The third ISN, which is dated February
19, 2009, covers the period FY lO-FY 11 , and envisages three thematic areas of
engagement, the first theme being continuing support to ongoing reconstruction and
socio-economic recovery efforts. That theme responds to the goals of the International
Compact with Iraq (ICI) which are related to Iraq's reconstruction and recovery efforts.
Activities under this theme will support Government policies and public investments that
will help restore and modernize Iraq's physical and human capital. The Bank program
will be decided through Annual Business Planning (ABP) exercises to support reforms
and/or sectors for which "champions" have been identified, and when there is a
commitment to engage with the Bank Group to achieve concrete results on the ground.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

3.2.1 In this emergency project to be implemented quickly in a difficult country context
of post-conflict, or even in-conflict, the focus on outputs was the right approach. In the
PD~ wording, the terms ''to improve access to quality emergency services in selected




                                            16
health facilities" meant ensuring the availability of rehabilitated health facilities with
equipment in place and operational, pharmaceuticals delivered, and the trained
emergency room staffing provided. The KPIs based on outputs are thus proxy indicators
for "access to quality emergency services". This is in line with Iraq's priorities to rebuild
its essential infrastructure and services, and with the ISN approach.

3.2.2 Annex 2 provides detailed information on all outputs. The Project's achievements
have been substantial for the most important part of the Project, namely the rehabilitation
and equipment of priority emergency services.

    a) The target of 12 has been met, and even exce.eded for Component 1 on the
       rehabilitation and equipment of hospital priority emergency services. This is the
       most important project component, which accounts for over 80 percent of project
       costs. The ITF Grant financed the civil works rehabilitation of only nine units.
       However, basic emergency equipment packages were procured, delivered and
       installed for 13 emergency facilities: the 12 units that had been selected originally
       (including the ones that were not rehabilitated using the ITF Grant) and the
       Suleimaniyah Maternity Hospital that was added in 2006.
    b) Thirty generic pharmaceuticals were procured and distributed, compared to the 37
       that were planned and listed in the Technical Annex. Drugs were made available
       to 13 emergency facilities. There were adequate supplies of drugs available in the
       hospitals visited after project completion.
    c) Doctors and nurses of the 13 emergency facilities benefitted from the training
       provided under Component 3 of the Project. The training activities are
       swnmarized below. As there were no quantitative targets set for training, it is not
       possible to determine whether satisfactory achievements were met in quantitative
       terms. However, a significant number of staff were trained in relevant areas, and
       many have been retained in their positions.
     • In three separate training activities, 47 physicians and 59 nurses and paramedics
         were trained on emergency medical services (EMS). Of the 47 physicians
         trained, 43 have been retained by the facilities, and of the 59 nurses trained, 52
         have been retained by the facilities (most of the non retained physicians and
         nurses are still in their jobs as emergency health care providers but in other, non
         targeted facilities).
     • Twenty two physicians were trained in EMS management. Six physicians are
         still in the job; the others have either left, or do not have the responsibility of
        managing Emergency Services.
     • Four MOH staff were trained on health sector reform and sustainable financing,
        and 16 PMTIMOH staff were trained on procurement and financial
        management; hence capacity in project management has been built in the
        Ministry.
3.2.3 The rehabilitation of all the selected hospital emergency units has been completed,
the medical equipment and furniture have been delivered and installed, and the
pharmaceuticals have been delivered and consumed. All the completed emergency room
facilities have been handed over to the MOH. After the completion of the Project, the
PMT and the FMA, with some participation by the Baghdad-based Bank team, visited


                                            17
 seven rehabilitated hospitals7 to assess how the emergency units (EUs) of these hospitals
 are functioning. The PMT and the FMA were able to obtain some information for five
 EUs only: Al Kindi TH, Kirkuk GH, Al Hussien GH, Al Kharkh, and Sulimanyah
 Maternity. The visits confirmed that those EUs are functioning, with an adequate supply
 of drugs and trained staff, and equipment in good condition. The major complaint from
 the hospital staff is that in some cases, the design could have been improved to allow for
 a better use of the space for efficient flow of patients8. However, in general, the hospital
 managers and EU staff acknowledged that the Project improved the response to
 emergencies, particularly in areas of the Baghdad and Kerbala governorates where most
 of the violence and emergency cases occurred. The table below shows the increases in the'
 numbers of patients for the five EUs.

  (3) For 5 months only (from May 1 to September 30,2010) corresponding to about 31,700 on an annual
  basis.

3.2.4 In the implementation of the training component, MOHIPMT emphasized the need
for the staff that has been trained to continue to work in the hospitals that have been
rehabilitated and equipped in order to transmit their knowledge to others working in the
same facilities or fields. In one of the hospitals (Yarmouk in Baghdad), the newly trained
emergency physicians are training their colleagues in new approaches and techniques.
Building on the newly acquired knowledge and skills of those physicians who have
received training abroad, MOH intends to move ahead with the Training of Trainers
(TOT) approach within Iraq, beginning with the project-related hospitals.

3.2.5 In addition to supporting the expansion of the EU capacity in the selected sites and
improving the quality of emergency services more generally, the Project built the
technical and management capacity of the MOH. The PMT staff training played an
active role in building their capacities and expertise and contributed to tangible
improvements in project implementation. Through attendance at training courses, on-the-

7 Some hospitals ceuld not be visited because of security and accessibility issues. The hospitals visited were: AI· Kindi
Teaching Hospital, AI Karkh General Hospital (both in Baghdad), Rizgari Teaching Hospital (ErbiJ governorate-KRG),
Kirkuk General Hospital, AI Hussien General Hospital (Karbela governorate) and Sulimanyah Maternity Hospital
(Sulimanyah governorate) and Samara General Hospital (Salahuddin governorate).
8 Some hospital managers and EUs mentioned that it would have been better if the EU and hospital engineers had been
consulted during the design stage about the specific needs and requirements of the facilities.




                                                          18
    job training and interaction with Bank and FMA staff, PMT capacity has been
    considerably strengthened.

    3.3 Efficiency
    (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
    least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate ofReturn)

    3.3.1 During preparation and appraisal, limited attention was given to financial and
    economic aspects, given the emergency nature of the operation and taking into account
    the country context. The Project was prepared as part of the interim strategy of the
    World Bank in addressing the pressing needs of the sector and according to the
    emergency recovery assistance procedures (OP 8.50). The lack of reliable statistics, the
    limited economic information, and the speed with which the Project was prepared have
    prevented more detailed analysis, a familiar constraint in such operations. However, the
    benefits of the Project's investment were expected to be substantial compared to its costs,
    as it addressed urgent needs in an environment of devastated infrastructure, deteriorating
    quality, and escalating needs.

    3.3.2 No economic evaluation of the Project has been carried out upon its completion,
    and none is planned. This is an area where Iraqi expertise is not strong, so that if such an
    evaluation were to be carried out, it would have to be done by an external specialist; this
    is not possible for the time being because of the continuing security situation.

3.3.3 As noted in the Recipient's ICR (Annex 7), the majority of the goods were procured
under International Competitive Bidding (lCB). There were an acceptable number of
bidders for each contract, and the ICB method enabled the PMT to attract better firms,
qualities and prices. Unfortunately, the ICR mission could not obtain information on the
efficiency9 of the health facility rehabilitations financed by the ITF Grant. In the
circumstances, although there is no reason to believe that Iraq did not also get good value
for money for the facility rehabilitation, the rating for efficiency is: "Not rated".

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement ofPDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1 After the collapse of the regime in 2003, Iraq was at the early stage of emerging
from a prolonged period of wars, United Nations sanctions, military occupation,
transitional government, and instability and uncertainty. The country faced an extremely
difficult security environment which had major impacts on all aspects of life, including
the implementation of reconstruction and development projects. The Bank fiduciary staff
working on the ground in Iraq, the PMT staff, and the FMA faced unbelievable
situations, much worse than what was expected at the time of project design. In addition,
years of isolation and instability led to weak implementing capacity by the Government
(including weak capacity to make decisions) and the private sector. Thus, the Iraq context

9   For example, comparisons with the costs of similar rehabilitations carried out under other projects.




                                                             19
is a unique situation that needs to be acknowledged and considered in any evaluation of
the Project. The performance of both the Bank Task Team and PMT staff has been truly
remarkable; they have worked under conditions of great danger and stress.

3.4.2 The Project's objectives, design and implementation were and remained highly
relevant to current country priorities and the ISN. The outputs for the most important
part of the Project (the rehabilitation and equipment of hospital priority emergency
services) have been substantial. The investment improved the quality of the emergencies
services in the selected facilities, which are already treating an increasing number of
patients. The capacity built in such a low capacity context was also a great achievement.
ThC? information on outcomes is good, but unfortunately it is limited. Although many
physicians, nurses and paramedics have been trained, it is difficult to assess the
achievement for training because there were no defined quantitative targets. In view of
this slight shortcoming, the overall project outcome is rated "Moderately Satisfactory."

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The context in which this emergency project wllS designed did not lend itself to an
elaborate consideration of social issues. Project interventions targeted the whole
population around the selected hospitals and ensured access to quality emergency
services for this population.

3.5.2 Throughout the Project, the Bank monitored closely the security situation and
intensity of violence. Two hospitals were removed from the Project because of the
security situation. One further hospital was removed when it was converted into a
military hospital, but it was replaced by a maternity hospital. The project intervention in
that maternity hospital enhanced the quality of Emergency Obstetric Health, benefiting
women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

3.5.3 .The reconstruction effort may not have led to the establishment of a sustainable
model for planning, procurement and financial management, as was envisaged at
appraisal. However, it did allow for the development of a standardized approach to the
rehabilitation of health facilities and proved to be an effective way for the MOH to
acquire the capacity it needs to manage longer-term reconstruction/rehabilitation
activities. The Bank was the only development partner that worked through Iraqi
institutions, which did help to build institutional capacity and was appreciated by Iraqi
officials.




                                           20
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

 3.5.4 Although this may not have been entirely "unintended", the Project's successful
completion has paved the way for the Bank's future dialogue with the Iraqi authorities on
health. Albeit as a short term response to an emergency, the Project has an added value
beyond the project "outputs". It has a demonstration effect, proving the reliability of
partnership with client; it provides the foundation for a subsequent engagement on a
longer term basis.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional/or Core ICR, required/or ILl, details in annexes)

Not applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outeome
Rating: Substantial

4.1 The survey of project sites showed that the emergency rooms are operational and
treating patients; they are adequately staffed with trained personnel, the equipment is
working, and operating budgets and pharmaceuticals are available. Based only on these
considerations, the risk to development outcome could be assessed as "low". However,
the situation in Iraq remains fragile, and' there is a risk of collapse for lack of security.
The ICR rates the overall risk to development outcome - i.e., the risk that development
outcomes will not be maintained - as "Significant".

s. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

S.l Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank strategy in Iraq was to ensure Iraqi ownership and strengthen institutional
capacity by financing operations that are implemented by Iraqi Ministries and other
recipient entities. As noted earlier, for this project, the Bank did a good job on focusing
on outputs and assessing risks (although the security situation turned out to be much
worse than expected at the design stage). The Project addressed the most urgent needs to
improve health services, and the main concern was to obtain concrete results and to
obtain them quickly.

5.1.2 The design of the Project was simple and its scope was manageable. A Quality
Assessment of L~nding Portfolio (QALP-l) carried out in late 2008, with the final report
issued on January 7, 2009, rated the quality of design as "Moderately Satisfactory". The
Project was well prepared for an emergency project. The Technical Annex was


                                            21
comprehensive: it included the list of emergency facilities to be rehabilitated and detailed
lists of medical equipment, furniture and drugs to be purchased and delivered, as well as
information on procurement and financial management arrangements, the prevention and
mitigation of environmental impacts, a project implementation schedule and a results-
based supervision plan. The Project benefited from an excellent Master Implementation
Manual (MIM) developed by the Bank to be used by Iraqi Ministries for all ITF-financed
projects, and a specific Project Implementation Manual (PIM) for the Project. However,
the implementation period (24 months) was too ambitious and unrealistic, the
arrangements for monitoring and evaluation were not detailed and the linkage between
the PD~ (referring to "access" and "quality") and the Key Performance Indicators - KPIs
(based on "outputs") was weak.

5.1.3 The ICR rates the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry as "Moderately
Satisfactory" .

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4 The Bank Task Team for this project has worked under difficult conditions with
great stress. Its ability to respond to implementation problems was constrained by the
security conditions on the ground which prohibited on-site supervision, and the team had
to operate from Amman, with the PMT and MOH staff traveling to Amman. Also, Bank
efforts were not productive when the MOH was nearly paralyzed for more than two
years.

5.1.5 The main strengths of Bank supervision were the following:

   a) To substitute for the lack of on-site supervision, the task team made good use of
      the FMA, which was working on all ITF-financed projects, by maintaining close
      communication with the FMA personnel during implementation and inviting them
      to participate in all supervision missions. In addition to its primary function of
      helping the Bank conduct its fiduciary oversight, the FMA provided technical
      assistance to the Project.
   b) Overall, the Bank task team paid good attention to financial management and
      procurement aspects of the project, with extensive coverage in the aide memoires
      and ISRs. (i) The level of Bank attention to financial management was
      noteworthy. Constant attention to training off site of project financial
      management staff ensured progress was made, even if there were times when
      results were slow in reporting and audit submission. The Bank's follow up
      through the FMA on control procedures, fixed asset verification, and SOE
      payment verification under the US$10,000 level has been essential in risk
      mitigation. (ii) Adequate attention was also given to procurement. The Bank
      provided regular off-site training to PMT staff in procurement procedures and
      contract management. After the failed attempts to recruit an international
      procurement firm for PMT, the task team succeeded in getting agreement of



                                            22
       MOHIPMT to recruit an international procurement advisor with considerable
       expertise. The Bank's procurement staff was able to support and monitor
       procurement. One case of fraud and corruption was well handled by the task team
       (sent to INT and followed up with the PMT); the Bank task team also followed up
       on a few cases of complaints. Following delays in the procurement of
       pharmaceuticals through WHO, the task team took appropriate actions to solve
       the issue by realigning the procurement arrangements through the use of shopping
       and direct contracting of the items in question.
    c) Through the preparation of detailed outputs monitoring tables for each emergency
       unit, during implementation the Bank Task Team helped the MOHIPMT Team to .
       monitor the implementation of the project components. This is important for a
       project focused on outputs.
5.1.6 The shortcomings of Bank supervision were the following:

    a) Less than satisfactory performance on oversight of safeguards - environment
       issues (See Section on Safeguards).
    b) Limited focus on sustainability. A greater focus on sustainability did not happen
       because of the Government situation ( throughout the escalation of violence
       period)
    c) On many occasions, the Bank drew the attention of senior MOH officials to the
       need to track the project achievements in terms of improvement of access and
       quality of services. However, efforts to find out how the hospital emergency units
       were functioning were limited during the life of the Project, and a survey had to
       be undertaken after the project's closing date.
5.1.7 The Barik constantly monitored the security situation and intensity of violence.
Within the limitations imposed by existing constraints, the task team was alert to the
weaknesses in governance. Management gave high priority to this project, and invested a
great deal of time in assisting the task team. The budget was appropriately large for this
difficult project (US$253,000 for lending and US$888,000 for the five years of
supervision) and was put to good use. There has been excellent continuity in staffing
with the appropriate skills mix, with the original task team leader remaining involved in
the Project. In aide memoires and ISRs, the candor, degree of detail, and meticulous
reporting of project progress or lack thereof were of high quality. However, the ratings
for DO and IP were somewhat generous for 2006 and 2007 (they should have been
"Unsatisfactory") and, in the absence of evidence, the rating for Safeguards
(environment) should have been "Unsatisfactory" or, at best ''Not Rated". The Quality
Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-l) carried out in late 2008 rated the quality of
Bank supervision as "Moderately Satisfactory", and the panel commended the Bank Staff
Team for its overall performance under extremely difficult circumstances.

5.1.8 Based on the above strengths and shortcomings, the Quality of Bank Supervision is
rated "Moderately Satisfactory".

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory .


                                           23
5.1. 9 The overall Bank performance in supporting the MOH's priorities is rated as
"Moderately Satisfactory", given the same rating for both quality at entry and
supervision.

5.2 Borrower I Recipient Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 To assess the Government performance, one needs to distinguish between three
different periods in the project life; (i) the preparation/appraisal stage and the project
launch; (ii) the 2005 to end of 2007 period; and (iii) the period from end of 2007 to
project closing.

5.2.2 During preparation and appraisal and the project launch, with respect to the
ownership and commitment of the Government, the Project was a high priority for the
MOH leadership. Although relatively weak, MOH did possess a reasonable level of
technical capflcity at the outset of the project and was able to make a meaningful
contribution to project preparation. It was a time when one could be optimistic about the
Iraq post-war rehabilitation.

5.2.3 Soon after approval, MOH was engulfed and engaged in the sectarian conflict and
barely functioned for a prolonged period (2005 to end of 2007). The initial capacity in
MOH virtually disappeared, and the Ministry was nearly paralyzed for a period of more
than two years. The MOH leadership was seriously affected by the political context, and
this resulted in periodic gaps in leadership at the Minister and Deputy Minister level.
Even when present, they were often unable or unwilling to provide the leadership
required for project implementation. Little was accomplished during those years. The
priority given earlier to the Project by MOH leadership declined substantially in the
politically fluid context and extreme security conditions. During that period, the PMT, as
well as the Bank, were unable to communicate with the MOH.

5.2.4 Starting in late 2007, with the appointment of new leadership in the MOH, the
Project began to implement more smoothly, due to the increased attention of the Ministry
leadership (both the Minister and the Deputy Minister for Donor Affairs) and the stability
and growing effectiveness of the PMT which had gained experience in project
management. However, MOH's effectiveness at resolving issues in a timely manner
remained weak throughout the project period.

5.2.5 The positive role of the PMT (which was a requirement for ITF-financed projects)
is an important feature of the Project. The PMT staff were employed and paid by MOH
at regular salary levels, thereby avoiding the disadvantages of project units which would
erode civil service institutional capacity over the medium and long term. When security
conditions in the country deteriorated dramatically, the PMT staff displayed great




                                           24
courage and dedication, literally. risking their lives to carry out their duties (in 2006, the
Deputy Minister of Health was kidnapped and has never been seen again). .

5.2.6 With Bank support, the MOHIPMT Team was able to monitor the implementation
of the project components on the basis of detailed outputs monitoring tables for each
emergency unit. On the other hand, going beyond the focus on outputs, the MOHlPMT
efforts were limited dUring the project life to track the project achievements with respect
to access and quality of services.

5.2.7 Because of the instability within the MOH during the 2005-2007 periods and the
lack of security in the country, it took more than five years (and not two, as planned) to
complete the project. But, in the end, the project was satisfactorily completed despite all
the problems and difficulties. The Quality of Implementation by the BorrowerlRecipient
is rated "Moderately Satisfactory."

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.8 The implementing agency was the MOH. Since the MOH is part of the
Government, the assessment ofits performance is included in 5.2 (a) above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower I Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.9 Because of the very fragile political and security context, the Government
performed poorly in the early years of the Project. With the stability in the MOH
leadership and the increased capacity of the PMT in project management, the situation
improved significantly in the last two years. On balance, the Overall BorrowerlRecipient
Performance is rated "Moderately Satisfactory."

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and ofwide general application)

(1) A review should be carried out by the Bank as to whether, in evaluating emergency
projects (OP8.00 Operations) implemented in countries that are in-conflict, a different or
modified version of the ICR format should be developed that would be more suitable.

(2) It is important for the Bank to "stay the course" with ongoing projects in the face of
difficult circumstances, as these instruments are a critical means for building country
knowledge and leveraging future policy dialogue.

(3) The Bank should always assume low institutional capacity and high. turnover in a
conflict, post-conflict, fragile situation.

(4) In fragile states, the design of e.mergency projects in conflict-affected situations
should be very simple, manageable in scope and suitable to context, with a primary focus



                                            25
on outputs. In line with the focus on outputs, the PDO should also be based on outputs
only. Safeguard requirements should be simplified and the necessary resources should be
applied to satisfy them.

(5) The Bank should support the counterparts in establishing M&E systems and
methodology in the context of project design, to ensure effective oversight of their
programs. In situations where the project management team is relatively inexperienced,
Bank support for monitoring outputs may be very valuable to project management.

(6) In contexts where normal supervision missions are not possible, the Bank can mitigate
risks for its program by recruiting a monitoring agent to help in monitoring physical
implementation of projects and verifying that funds are spent for the purpose intended
and in accordance with Bank rules; the detailed TORs should also encourage quality
professional advice on technical issues and follow-up until these issues are resolved,
rather than simple mechanical reporting.

(7) The Bank Task Team should keep close communication with the monitoring agent
during implementation, and invite the monitoring agent to participate in all supervision
missions. This has been good practice for building the capacity of the PMT.

(8) A Master Implementation Manual (MIM) and a Project Implementation Manual
(PIM) that provide a clear definition of implementation procedures are important
elements for successful projects.

(9) In fragile states where the capacity to implement projects is weak, it is important to
assess accurately the capacity of the staff responsible for project implementation in
various disciplines in order to plan for a whole gamut of capacity-building activities:

    •   Build in advisory support early in the project.
    •   Design and conduct workshops in the initial stages of implementation to deal with
        procurement, not only procedures and guidelines but also contract packaging and
        contract management.
    •   Have frequent intensive implementation support missions with lots of hands on
        training built in, and also provide implementation support through frequent
        workshops, video and audio conferences, and e-mail communications.
   •    Provide periodic training opportunities for project management staff in
        management and IT skills and in Bank policies and procedures (procurement, FM
        and environmental safeguards).

(10) The delays encountered in attempting to utilize a UN agency for pharmaceutical
procurement are not unique to this operation. The use of such UN procurement systems,
which are often promoted as the best approach for emergencies, should be contingent
upon a satisfactory assessment of the capacity of the UN agency to deliver on time. Such
assessment should be carried out early in the project life.



                                           26
(11) Lessons related to financial management include the following: (i) disbursement
mechanisms used by the Bank must be appropriate and efficient (a special/designated
account is essential to facilitate the implementation of an investment project); (ii) having
disbursements made directly in US Dollars was successful; and (iii) using the payment
monitoring sheet helped the PMT in monitoring payment transactions for direct
payments, submitted by contractors, suppliers, consultants, until the amounts are credited
into beneficiaries' bank account as well as identifying any potential bottlenecks.

(12) In order to implement projects with due diligence and efficiency, the project
management team must have the right mix of expertise and the authority to make
decisions to ensure satisfactory outcomes.

(a) GranteelImplementing agencies

Regarding quality at entry, the statement in the Recipient's ICR (Annex 7) that "the
design of the project at the time of preparation and appraisal was not complete does not
seem to take into account the fact that this was an "emergency" project.

Comments on "Government financing":

(1) According to the Technical Annex, the percentage of financing by the ITF was 100
   . percent for all categories in the allocation of the Grant proceeds. The estimated
     Government contribution of US$I.925 million included. US$I.8 million for
     temporary emergency units to be used while existing units were being rehabilitated
    (component I), and US$0.125 million for project management (component 4).
    Actually, the Government made available temporary emergency units, as required. It
    was essentially an in-kind contribution, with very small cash payments.
(2) According to the PMTIMOH, during project implementation the Government spent
    about US$700,000 for the salaries ofPMT staff.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Rehabilitation of Priority Emergency Services (actual cost: US$20.56
million, or 96% of the appraisal estimate of US$21.434 million)

1.1 According to the Technical Annex, the Project would support the repair,
rehabilitation and equipping activities of hospital emergency facilities to restore fully
functional emergency services in 12 carefully selected hospitals in 9 Governorates of
Iraq. These activities were identified and prioritized using explicit criteria of need,
feasibility and affordability listed in the Technical Annex. Repairs and rehabilitation
would focus on the priority structural, electrical, mechanical and heating/air conditioning
systems for: (a) emergency room reception and administrative counter; (b) triage areas;
(c) diagnostic services rooms; (d) patient examination areas; (e) patient wards; (f}minor
surgery operating theater; (g) doctors' and nurses' offices and rest areas; (h) nurses'
station; (i) emergency drug dispensary; and (j) other support areas (sterilization room,
kitchen, restrooms, storage, janitorial space). The Project would also provide the selected
facilities with their most urgent needs in diagnostic and therapeutic equipment for
emergency services, including specific emergency room equipment. Examples of such
equipment that were selected and listed in the Technical Annex (about 20 items ranging
from US$360 to US$45,000 had been identified) are: diagnostic equipment, emergency
resuscitation equipment, and emergency life support equipment.

1.2 The Project provided financing for the rehabilitation activities, the technical
assistance for design and supervision of the sites, and emergency medical equipment and
furniture.

 1.3 Responsibility for the implementation of this component rested with the MOHIPMT
in coordination with the health authorities at the Directorate and hospital levels. Within
MOH, the Emergency Medicine Department of the Directorate of Specialized Medical
Services was responsible for the rehabilitation activities and the delivery of the medical
equipment. The PMT coordinated with this department to ensure that the activities were
carried out according to the project implementation plan. To accelerate the start-up
process, PMT/MOH hired different consulting firms to prepare the architectural designs
for the hospital emergency units. These firms were managed by the MOH Governorate
level engineer, in coordination with the hospital management. MOH arranged for the use
of temporary substitute sites for the emergency facilities that were being rehabilitated so
that the emergency services were not compromised by the project activities during the
rehabilitation phase.

Design and Supervision Services (actual cost: US$ 1.303 million. or 98% of the appraisal
estimate of US$I.328 million).

1.4 Design and supervision services were procured from local consultants for 9 of the 13
construction packages (including the drug warehouse). No consultancy was needed for
Yarmouk Teaching Hospital as the MOH decided to undertake larger scale rehabilitation
at Yarmouk with its own funds. However, the Emergency Unit of Yarmouk received
medical equipment and training for its staff under the project. Only design services were


                                           29
completed for the two cancelled project sites (Ramadi and Baquba), and the supervision
component of these contracts was cancelled. Design services for Al Karkh G.H were
completed by a second firm, because the original contract was terminated for lack of
performance. The final cost of design and supervision services was US$I.303 million.

Construction (actual cost: US$12.624 million. or 98% of the awraisal estimate of
US$12.915 million)

1.5 The original 12 construction packages became 13 with the addition of the Drug
Warehouse. Three contracts were subsequently cancelled. Al Ramadi G.H. (US$1.03
million) and Baquba G.H. (US$1.19 million) were canceled because of the deterioration
in the security situation in the governorates of Diyala and Anbar, and the Yarmouk T. H.
(US$1.93 million) was canceled when Government decided to use its own funds. The
US$4.15 million allocated for these three packages were made available to cover cost
overrun for the remaining 10 contracts (including the Drug Warehouse). One hospital
(Suleimaniyah-Jumhuri GH) was dropped when it was converted into a military hospital,
but it was replaced by the Suleimaniyah Maternity Hospital.

1.6 The following 10 contracts have been completed (figures in parentheses are adjusted
final contract values including variation orders):

•   Al Imam Ali G. H - BaghdadlRisafa (US$1.390 million)
•   Al Sadder O. H. - Amara/Missan (US$0.657 million)
•   Samarra G. H. - Salaheddin (US$1.326 million)
•   Al Hussein O. H. - Karbala (US$1.136 million)
•   Kirkuk G. H. - Kirkuk (US$I.053 million)
•   Al Kindy T. H. - Baghdad (US$I.385 million)
•   Risgari G. H. - Erbil (US$0.960 million)
•   Al Karkh G. H. - BaghdadlKarkh (US$I.436 million)
•   Suleimaniyah Maternity Hospital (US$3.201 million)
•   The Drug Warehouse - Baghdad (US$0.079 million)

Medical and Laboratory Eguipment for 13 Hospitals (actual cost: US$5.758 million, or
143% of the appraisal estimate ofUS$4.024 million)

1.7 Forty two generic items of medical and laboratory equipment (891 units) were
purchased; 17 generic items were for 12 sites and 25 generic items were for one site
(Suleimaniyah Maternity Hospital). Items purchased included cardio respiratory
emergency resuscitation kits, lab auto analyzers, ventilators, nebulizers, mobile X-Rays
radiographic units, ultra sound scanners, and anesthetic neonatal care equipment. All
items were purchased, delivered, installed and tested, and end-users were trained. The
total cost of the medical and laboratory equipment was US$5.758 million, distributed as
follows (by method of procurement): US$3.538 million under ICB, US$0.034 million
under shopping and US$2.186 million under direct contracting.

Medical and Non-Medical Furniture (actual cost: US$0.875 million or 71% of the
appraisal estimate ofUS$1.238 million)

1.8 Eleven generic items of medical furniture (821 units) were purchased for 9 sites and 9
generic items (97 units) were purchased for one sit~ (Suleimaniyah Maternity Hospital).
In addition, 8 generic items of medical appliances (28 units) were purchased for one site
(Sufeimaniyah Maternity Hospital). Items purchased included hospital beds, bedside
lockers, patient trolleys, pharmaceuticals cupboards and oxygen regulators. The total
cost of the medical and non-medical furniture and appliances was US$0.875 million,
distributed as follows (by method of procurement): US$0.613 million under ICB,
US$0.134 million under shopping and US$0.128 under direct contracting.

Recapitulation for Component 1: Rehabilitation of Priority Emergency Services

1.9 Civil works activities are completed, the medical equipment and furniture have been
delivered and installed, and end-users have been trained. All the completed emergency
room (ER) facilities have been handed over to the MOH.

Component 2: Provision of Essential Emergency Drugs (actual cost: US$1.656
million, or 57% of the appraisal estimate ofUS$2.911 million)

2.1 According to the Technical Annex, the Project included the procurement and
distribution of a 3 to 6 month supply of up to 37 essential emergency drugs to be used at
the 12 emergency facilities rehabilitated under Component 1. Categories of essential
emergency drugs included the following: (i) general anesthetics; (ii) preoperative


                                           31
 medication and sedatives; (iii) anti-infective drugs; (iv) cardiovascular drugs; and (v) oral
 and parenteral solutions. Procurement and distribution directly to the selected hospitals
 would be the responsibility of the MOH. The drug lists and quantities had already been
 prepared and included in the Technical Annex. The pharmaceuticals would be procured
 through one tender for 1,411,840 units of 36 essential emergency drugs, using ICB
 procedures, except for one direct contract for the procurement of 427 units of alteplase
 injection as there is only one manufacturer in the world. Technical assistance would also
 be provided to assist the MOH to develop an improved drug supply chain for the country.

2.2 The implementation of this component was quite a challenge. PMT tried twice to
procure the 36 essential emergency drugs under a single ICB tender with several lots but
there were no responsive bidders for all the lots, so that the MOH had to make other
arrangements for pharmaceutical procurement, including repackaging the ICB
procurement, and procurement through the World Health Organization (WHO) and
through shopping and direct contracting. In March 2007, MOH entered into an
agreement with WHO to procure about U8$2.1 million worth of drugs, and consequently
a special commitment was issued by the Bank in favor of WHO and part of the funds
were transferred to WHO. Of the 38 items that WHO had agreed to supply by December
2007, for reasons that are not clear, WHO was able to procure and deliver only 7 items lO
costing U8$189,014. WHO reimbursed the unused funds after a long delay and the
8pecial Commitment was canceled. Additional contracts had to be arranged due to the
urgent need for life-saving drugs in emergency units.

2.3 In the end, the actual procurement was for 30 generic pharmaceuticals only, as
follows:
    a) 18 generic items (IV fluids and injectables) procured under International
       Competitive Bidding -- ICB (U8$1.248 million);
    b) 2 generic items (injectables) were procured under shopping (8H) method
       (U8$0.168 million);
    c) 3 generic items (injectables) were procured under direct contract (DC) method
       (U8$0.051 million); and
    d) 7 generic items were procured by WHO (U8$0.189 million).
2.4 All pharmaceuticals procured under the project have been delivered to the drug
warehouse built in Baghdad using the project funds (see under Component 1) and
forwarded to the 13 hospital emergency units; the pharmaceuticals have been fully
dispensed. In 2009, MOH officials informed the Bank that the Government was now
able to supply the hospitals with the necessary drugs through the MOH procurement
process and, therefore, they will not require further procurement of pharmaceuticals
under the ITF Grant.




10 Actually, WHO procured 9 items, but two had to be returned because they did not comply with the required validity
period.




                                                         32
 Component 3: Capacity Building and Training (actual cost: US$0.602 million or 36%
 of the appraisal estimate ofUS$1.669 million)

3.1 According to the Technical Annex, the Project would support capacity-building and
training activities in Emergency Medical Services for the 12 selected sites. These
activities would include: (i) technical training of emergency 5-person teams from each
selected site to improve the quality of emergency services; (ii) training in management of
emergency services for the hospital directors, emergency chief doctors, head nurses and
central-level emergency services planners; and (iii) the development of a comprehensive
national plan for strengthening emergency health care services. Additionally, the Project
would support training to build the general capacity of MOH in health planning and
management at both the central and Governorate levels. A number of short-term training
programs would allow for the constitution of a core group of public health and health
management specialists. These trainings would involve MOH staff in these areas from
both central and Directorate levels. The project would also provide assistance to the
MOH in developing a sustainable plan for procurement and distribution of essential
emergency drugs.

3.2 Responsibility for the implementation of this component rested with PMTIMOH in
coordination with the Department of Emergency Medicine of the Directorate of
Specialized Medical Services. The PMT was responsible for ensuring the provision and
coordination of necessary inputs with the relevant departments.

3.3 Activities included emergency preparedness management and technical training of
MOH staff. The planned training included 3 programs:

        (1) Medical operation department managers training course for 22 physicians, in one
            batch in August 2006 (US$124,745 for tuition onlyll). The training was provided
            in Cairo by the University of Maryland. Six physicians are still in their jobs; the
            others have either left, or do not have the responsibility of managing Emergencies
            Services.

        (2) Hospital-based ER physicians training for 47 physicians from the 12 targeted
            hospitals, in one batch in February 2008 at the King Abdul Aziz Medical Center
            (KAMC) in Saudi Arabia. The provider KAMC had been selected following the
            Bank guidelines, and the estimated cost was more than US$200,000. However,
            the training was funded entirely by Saudi Arabia. Of the 47 physicians that were
            trained, 43 have been retained by the facilities.

       (3) Hospital ER team training for 59 nurses and paramedics from the 12 targeted
           hospitals, in two batches in March and May 2008 (US$ 233,160 for tuition only).
           The training took place in Beirut, and the provider was the American University
           in Beirut Medical Center (AUB-MC). Of the 59 participants, 52 have been
           retained by the facilities.

II   For the whole project period, travel and subsistence expenses for all the training amounted to US$442,628.




                                                            33
3.4. In addition, four participants (2 physicians - one of them was a PMT member - and 2
pharmacists) attended a Flagship Course on health sector reform and sustainable
financing at the World Bank Institute (WBI) in Washington in October 2009 (US$12,000
for tuition only).

3.5 In the implementation of the component, MOHIPMT emphasized the need for the
staffs that have been trained to continue to work in the hospitals that have been
rehabilitated and/or equipped in order to transmit their knowledge to others working in
the same facilities and fields. Actually, in one of the hospitals (Yarmouk in Baghdad) the
newly trained emergency physicians are training their colleagues in new approaches and
techniques. MOR intends to do more by implementing a "Training of Trainers" (TOT)
program, building on the newly acquired knowledge and skills of those physicians who
have received training abroad. A TOT training program for 12 people was to take place
in Saudi Arabia, but it was canceled because of problems with visas, and PMTIMOH
could not make alternative arrangements before the closing of the project. MOH still
intends to move ahead with the TOT approach within Iraq.

3.6 In summary, most of the originally planned training activities have been completed.
Despite the difficulties due to the country situation, the implementation of that·
component is satisfactory. However,PMTIMOH could have done more to monitor the
impact of the training courses and the whereabouts of the individuals trained.

Component 4: Project Management (actual cost: US$0.995 million, or 109% of the
appraisal estimate ofUS$0.911 million)

4.1 Accor4ing to the Technical Annex, the objective of this component was to ensure
effective administration and coordination of the project activities. The Project
Management Team (PMT) would comprise 11 staff, five of whom would be local
consultants hired under the Project. PMT would include: (i) a Project Director to manage
and coordinate the implementation of the Project, including liaising with the World Bank
and the MOH Departments implementing project components; (ii) a Deputy Project
Director to be responsible for day-to-day management of the Project; (iii) a Technical
Coordinator to ensure that the technical aspects of the project are being implemented; (iv)
a Procurement Officer, assisted by three specialists (civil works, equipment/drugs, and
consultant services) to supervise tendering, purchasing and delivery of works, goods and
services; (v) a Financial Officer, assisted by an accountant, to maintain project financial
records; and (vi) an Administrative Secretary and a Junior Secretary. The PMT would
act as both the coordinating unit for technical implementation of the components, and the
"business office" for the project. Some selected MOH staff had received training in the
areas of procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, and in project
management; this training would be continued periodically under the project. There was
a Master Implementation Manual (MIM) for the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF), and a Project
Implementation Manual (PIM) was being prepared in conjunction with the relevant
technical staff in the MOH central and Governorate offices.




                                            34
4.2 In terms of staffing of the PMT, the component was implemented as planned. The
MIM and· the PIM which were well prepared and turned out ;to be very useful. On the
other hand, the absences of a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) person and of clear lines
of responsibility for environmental aspects were problems during implementation. It
should be noted that, late in 2005, the PMT became responsible for coordinating the
implementation of two projects financed by the ITF: the Emergency Health
Rehabilitation Project (EHRP) and the Emergency Disabilities Projec~ (EDP).

4.3 The PMT suffered from instability during the early years of the Project, but
fortunately the situation improved. Actually, the PMT has been stable for the past two
years, and its staff has gained considerable experience in project management. Some of
the problems areas are highlighted below.

4.4 Procurement. In the early years of the project, the PMTI MOH encountered some
difficulties in dealing with procurement due to lack of familiarity with the international
business community and the Bank's procurement guidelines. During the project period,
16 PMTIMOH staff attended a three-week training course in procurement (for civil
works, equipment and drugs) and financial management at the ILO center in Turin
(US$26,813 for tuition only). This training, together with.the full use of the skills and
guidance of the International Procurement Advisor (Consultant), contributed to a
noticeable improvement in PMT's performance.

4.5 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The Bank had to remind the PMTIMOH of the
importance of monitoring the key performance indicators of the project. Somewhat late
in the project cycle, it was agreed that a national consultant would be hired to collect data
on the project activities per site, and that these data would be reflected in the monitoring
tables. Site visits to the facilities would focus on the implemented activities per project
component, including the percentage of utilization of equipment packages, the usefulness
of the training, the number of patients before and after rehabilitation, etc. Unfortunately,
the recruitment of the consultant could not take place.

4.6 Contract management. The PMTIMOH could have done a better job of managing
contracts, many of which involved issues that needed to be assessed and resolved. The
Bank urged the PMT to follow each of the contracts closely, with frequent visits to the
relevant sites, and more rigorous contract management, with quick resolution of issues
that might arise.

4.7 The component financed: (i) minor refurbishment of the PMT offices agreed between
the MOH and the Bank; (ii) adequate office equipment and supplies; (iii) technical
assistance and training for PMT staff in project management, procurement and financial
management; (iv) annual external audit of the project; and (v) operating costs for the
PMT, including vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance, communications
costs, banking fees, transportation costs, meeting expenses, advertisement fees,and
representation.

 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
 (including assumptions in the analysis)

 3.1 The Project was prepared as part of the interim strategy of the World Bank in
 addressing the pressing needs of the sector and according to the emergency recovery
 assistance procedures (OP 8.50). The lack of reliable statistics, the limited economic
 information, and the speed with which the project was prepared have prevented more
 detailed analysis, a familiar constraint in such operations. However, the benefits of the
 project's investment were expected to be substantial compared to its costs, as it addressed
 urgent needs in an environment of devastated infrastructure, deteriorating quality, and
 escalating needs.

 3.2 The persons living in the surrounding perimeters of the selected facilities now have
 access to high quality emergency medical services that otherwise would not have been
 adequately delivered. However, no economic evaluation of the Project has been carried
 out upon its completion, and none is planned. This is an area where Iraqi expertise is not
 strong, so that if such an evaluation were to be done, it would have to be carried out by
 Bank staff; this is not possible for the time being because of the security situation.

3.3 As noted in the Recipient's ICR (Annex 7), the majority of the goods were procured
under International Competitive Bidding (ICB). There were an acceptable number of
bidders for each contract, and the ICB method enabled the PMT to attract better firms,
qualities and prices. Unfortunately, the ICR mission could not obtain information on the
efficiency 12 of the health facility rehabilitations financed by the ITF Grant. In the
circumstances, although there is no reason to believe that Iraq did not also get good value
for money for the facility rehabilitation, the rating for efficiency is: "Not Rated".

Executive Summary

This report is prepared by Project Management Team PMT/ MOH, to reflect an overview
of project implementation experience focusing on the points of strength and weakness
confronted by the PMTIMOH throughout implementing the project and the impact of
factors Ilffected the progress.

After the recent war Iraq has been confronted. with institutional insufficiencies and infra
structure failure, especially in the health sector leading to a deteriorated level in health
care and emergency facilities performance and capacities, therefore MOH identified the
factors contributing in health status deterioration: poor investment in the health sector,
poorly maintained health infrastructure, inappropriate management of the health sector,
and unhealthy lifestyles and behaviors.




                                            41
In July 2004 a meeting had been held between MOH senior staff and the donor
community (World Bank, UN agencies, and some bilateral), and this meeting yielded
fmdings and priorities, the Emergency medical services, pharmaceuticals, and essential
infrastructure rehabilitation, medical equipment, and capacity building and human
resources development.

Given the situation in the health sector, the Minister of Health has approached the World
Bank to request assistance in addressing the most urgent rehabilitation needs of the
aforementioned priorities.

Based on the meetings mentioned above, Grant Agreement with amount of $25 million
was allocated to MOHlIraq under the Iraqi Trust Fund for an Emergency Health
Rehabilitation Project on Nov.30th , 2004.

This report is to demonstrate the activities which actually had been executed under each
component of the project.

Introduction

As the Emergency Health Rehabilitation Project comes closer to its completion and
closing date, this report is prepared to demonstrate the points experienced throughout
implementing the project.

Th~ design of this project was intended to provide key elements needed to administer
emergency cases and capacity building necessary for this action by targeted personnel
capacity development and compensate the insufficiency in essential equipments,
appliances, bed capacity and life saving pharmaceuticals, in accordance to global criteria
that suit and take into consideration the hard situation and challenges Iraq encounters.

Furthermore, this project has taken an active role in strengthening practical aspects and
familiarity with international work and World Bank guidelines, in addition to direct
connection with global institutes and firms by its assorted contextures and expertise
which actively enriched PMT's experience in order to transmit this knowledge to MOH.

In addition to providing opportunities to the private sector to take its role in reviving and
reconstructing the infrastructure of health sector to achieve merger with the
governmental.

Purpose .wad objectives

The main purpose for ~e emergency health rehabilitation project was to address the most
urgent rehabilitation needs in order to strengthen the Iraqi health system and increase its
capacity to provide more effective and successful health service and to alleviate the
public suffer caused by the lag in health sector efficiency, thus enhancing the
infrastructure and well-performing health care.




                                            42
The project was proposed to address the most urgent needs of the health sector stemming
from years of neglect, the subsequent conflicts and dramatic increases in violence in areas
especially after 2003.

In addition, the project aimed to establish a concrete model for planning, procurement
and financial management within the health sector, as well as development of a
standardized approach to rehabilitation of health facilities and to constitute most effective
pattern for MOH of Iraq to acquire the capacity its essential needs to manage longer-term
reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.

As of the area of priorities would include:

    1. Hospital rehabilitation, particularly emergency· services capabilities and provision
       of essential emergency equipment and pharmaceuticals.
    2. Capacity building and training ofMOH staff.

Project components

The Project comprised four components, being fully funded as a Grant under the World
Bank Iraq Trust Fund; the four components are described below:

Component 1: Rehabilitation of Priority Emergency Services

The Project supported the repair, rehabilitation and equipping activities of hospital
emergency facilities to restore fully functional emergency services in 9 carefully selected
in Iraq. These activities have been identified and prioritized using explicit criteria of
need, feasibility and affordability. Repairs and rehabilitation will focus on the priority
structural, electrical, mechanical and heating/air conditioning systems for: (a) emergency
room reception and administrative counter; (b) triage areas; (c) diagnostic services
rooms; (d) patient examination areas; (e) patient wards; (f) minor surgery operating
theatre; (g) doctors' and nurses' offices and rest areas; (h) nurses' station; (i) emergency
drug dispensary; and (j) other support areas (sterilization room, kitchen, reS1rooms,
storage, janitorial space).

The Project also provided the selected facilities with their most urgent needs in diagnostic
and therapeutic equipment for emergency services, including specific emergency room
equipment. Examples of such equipment selected are: diagnostic equipment, emergency
resuscitation equipment, and emergency life support equipment.

The first phase of the reconstruction effort has concentrated on establishment of a .
sustainable model for planning, procurement and financial management. Also allowed for
the development of a standardized approach to the rehabilitation of health facilities and
constitute the most effective way for the MOH to acquire the capacity it needs to manage
longer-term reconstruction/rehabilitation activities. In addition, the Project provided
financing for the rehabilitation activities, emergency medical equipment and technical
assistance for design and supervision of the sites.



                                              43
The number of center allover the country has encountered some factors lead to the
reduction and delay in the overall project progress; represented in:

    a. Deterioration insecurity situation in some governorates (Diyala and Anbar)
       caused cancelling these two sites.
    b. Utilization and occupation of Sulaimaniya Jumhury Hospital by the military
       caused replacing the planned work site with SUlaimaniya maternity hospital.
    c. Yarmuk hospital was also cancelled due to being included in MOH's plan to be
       provided with medical equipments and conducting training to its staff.
    d. 26% increase in quantities of goods procured for MOH under the project due to
       the urgent need in ERs.
Component 2: Provision of Essential Emergency Drugs

The Project supported the procurement and distribution of a 3 to 6 month supply of up to
58 essential emergency drugs to be used at the 12 emergency facilities. Categories of
essential emergency drugs included the following: (i) general anesthetics; (ii)
preoperative medication and sedatives; (iii) anti-infective drugs; (iv) cardiovascular
drugs; and (v) oral and parental solutions. This component was supported through the
provision of pharmaceuticals.

A number of the items under this component were procured, but there was some
hindrance in WHO performance to provide all items agreed to through its agreement
with MOH, but WHO failed to fulfill its obligations toward this agreement leading both
parties to agree upon partial procurement of the previously agreed items and cancelling
the others consequently.

Additional contracts were arranged due to the urgent need for life-saving drugs in
emergency units, some of them were implemented under shopping and others were under
direct contract, in order to cover this need as much as could.

Component 3: Capacity Building and Training

 The Project supported capacity-building and training activities in Emergency Medical
 Services for the 12 selected sites. These activities included: (i) technical training of
emergency 5-person teams from each selected site to improve the quality of emergency
services; (ii) training in management of emergency services for the hospital directors,
emergency chief doctors, head nurses and central-level emergency services planners; and
(iii) the development of a comprehensive national plan for strengthening emergency
health care services. Additionally, support training to build the general capacity of MOH
in health planning and· management at both the central and Governorate levels. A
number of short-term training programs has allowed for the constitution of a core group
of public health and health management specialists. The project also provided assistance
to the MOH in developing a sustainable plan for procurement and distribution of essential
emergency drugs. This component meant to be supported through the provision of
technical assistance and training activities.



                                          44
Component 4: Project Management

The objective of this component is to ensure effective administration and coordination of
the project activities. The Project Management Team (PMT) comprises staff of local
consultants hired under the Project and MOH staff. PMT staff includes: a Project
Director to manage and coordinate the implementation of the Project; a Deputy Project
Director to be responsible for day-to-day management of the project; a Technical
Coordinator to ensure that the technical aspects of the project are being implemented; a
Procurement Officer, assi~ted by three staff, to supervise tendering, purchasing and
delivery of works, goods and services; a Financial Officer, assisted by an accountant, to
maintain project financial records; an Administrative Secretary, and a Junior Secretary to
support the needs of the office. Drivers for the project vehicles and a messenger also
been hired to support the project.

The component financed: (i) minor refurbishment of the PMT offices agreed between the
MOH and the Bank; (ii) adequate office equipment and supplies, and project vehicles;
(iii) technical assistance and training for PMT staff in project management, procurement
and financial management; (iv) annual external audit of the project; and (v) operating
costs for the PMT, including vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance,
communications costs, banking fees, transportation costs, meeting expenses,
advertisement fees, representation, and office security arrangements.

Financing of the project

The World Bank as a donor and by the grant of $25 million which was expected to be
disbursed under the scheduled time line provided its strategy in Iraq to ensure Iraqi
ownership and strengthen institutional capacity by financing operations that are
implemented by Iraqi Ministries and other recipient entities. And its implementation to be
performed and facilitated by trained project management team (PMT) in addition to
ensure compliance with fiduciary and other safeguards. PMT would be employed and
paid by the implementing agency at regular salary levels, thereby avoiding the
disadvantages of stand-alone Project Implementation agency Units, which would erode
civil service institutional capacity over the medium and long term.

The project was intended to finance specialized technical support in procurement,
financial management, and other areas as needed. In addition, to ensure that the project
funds are used for the purpose intended and help carry out project supervision, the Bank
to employ two independent firms as fiduciary and safeguard monitoring agents.

As a further compensating control, disbursements will be made primarily through direct
payment by the Bank to the contractors, consultants, and vendors. Once authorized by the
MOH, direct payments will be made by the World Bank directly into the account of the
contractor, consultant, or vendor in a commercial bank capable of receiving funds
transferred from the international banking system.




                                           45
the Bank and by the fund allocated to Iraqi Ministry of Health provided the opportunity
for the Health Sector to improve the health care in the field of emergency units to support
the activity of alleviating the public suffer that affected the health care over decades.

Quality at entry

   1. The design of the project at the time of preparation and appraisal was not
      complete, as regarded to the lack of familiarity with the Bank guidelines as well
      as weak knowledge in regard to WB methodology, and;
   2. There was no sufficient readiness on the part of the Ministry to implement the
      project due to the hard circumstances at that time in Iraq, but upon the relative
      security stability during 2007, the MOH (represented by Minister of Health,
      Deputy Minister for reconstruction and donors affairs, director general of projects
      directorate & engineering services, and director general of medical operations
      directorate) provided its complete support and backup to the PMT, in order to
      expedite the implementation to meet the project objectives.

Project implementation experience described by components

Component 1:

Design and supervision

Throughout implementation several points have been marked, as follows:

   1. It's been noticed that some requirements and notes nominated by beneficiaries
      reveal exaggeration and luxury being incompatible with PDOs if project
      considered as urgent case (emergency project), imposing several components and
      finishing points causing some distraction to implementation.
   2. Overall security situation, caused in delay and affection to implementation.
   3. Lack of consultant and contractors' familiarity with Bank's guidelines.
   4. The sites under rehabilitation have been chosen carefully to provide services as
      good as possible.
   S. There was some lag in consultants' performance during preparing VOs and final
      measurements, which demands more familiarity with Bank's guidelines on the
      side of the consultant.
   6. It was obvious that in the stage of bidding the offer of the contractor takes higher
      priority, discarding the most important aspects such as; similar assignments and
      staff, then to take the bid price as second level priority in awarding criteria for
      NCB bidders.




                                            46
Goods

Medical equipments: Majority of the goods were procured under (international
competitive bidding) ICB method which enabled PMT to attract better firms, qualities
and prices, with acceptable number of Bidders for each contract. And the selected
specifications were in need for further study,' taking· into consideration some points such
as; systems to be closed or open, in addition to consumables prices, being confronted
with delays throughout implementation caused by:

   a. Lack ofPMTI equipments specialist's familiarity with Bank's guidelines.

   b. Lack of familiarity on the side of some suppliers:
   c. MOH guidelines of goods delivery, hand-over, inspection reports and acceptance
      minutes and committee related aspects.
Component 2:

Essential emergency drugs for 12 hospitals

This component has encountered several critical stages, lack of familiarity with Bank's
guidelines for some contractors caused failure or delays, in addition to inaccurate
implementation for some items' supply even subsequent delays caused cancelling some
items accordingly, as elaborated below:

   1. 58 life-saving pharmaceuticals had been initially agreed to be procured under this
      component, the actual procurement was only for 30 generic pharmaceuticals.

   2. The procured items were categorized into 10 packages under the following:

        a. 18 items procured under International competitive bidding (ICB);

           -   9 generic items (IV fluids).

           -   5 generic items (injectables).

           -   3 generic items (injectables).

           -   1 generic item (injectable).

        b. 2 generic items (injectables) were procured under shopping method.

      c. 3 generic items (injectables) were procured under direct contract method.
      d. WHO agreement: 38 items were intended to be procured under this agreement
         by WHO, in April 2007. Out of these items; only 7 generic items had been
         procured and distributed, and 2 generic items had been procured but recalled
         (due to its incompliance with the required shelf-life).
           WHO had only procured 7 and apologized for the rest 31 items.


                                              47
       e. Meanwhile, MOR          resumed supplement of non-procured           life-saving
          pharmaceuticals.


Component 3:

Training

Hospital based physicians and paramedics

It was needed to emphasize on trained staff to work on the profession trained on and to
work in the hospitals under rehabilitation, in order to transmit their knowledge to others
whom work in the same facility and field.                  .

The planned training included 3 programs (medical operation department managers
training course for 22 physicians in one batch, hospital based ER physicians training for
47 physicians in one batch, and hospital ER based paramedics training for 60 paramedics
in two batches). The trainees of the last two programs were from the 12 targeted
hospitals.

 In addition; 4 participants, 2 physicians (one of them was a PMT member), 2
pharmacists attended Flagship course (health sector reform and sustainable financing) at
World Bank Institute (WBI).

PMT capacity building

It was obvious that PMT training played an active role in building their capacities and
expertise reflecting tangible acceleration in project implementation pattern.

Component 4:

At early stage of the project the PMTI MOR encountered some difficulties in dealing
with Bank's' guidelines due to lack of familiarity with the international business
community and procurement guidelines, a number of PMT members had attended
training courses at different international institutes including ILO, WBI, and ARADO.
Leading to a noticeable enhancement in PMT's performance and the capability to utilize
the knowledge obtained through the training which reflected in expediting project
implementation per components, and overcome the obstacles hindering the overall
progress, in addition to transmit the experience to MOR staff through a PMT core,
yielding a more acquainted staffs with the standards of consistent project planning and
implementation.                                        .

Financier (World Bank) performance

The World Bank, as the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF) administrator, has supervised ITF-funded
operations in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. While staff


                                           48
traveling to Iraq was restricted or hard; in regard to the current country circUmstances,
supervision of recipient-executed operations been carried out through consultants and the
monitoring agents. And in every ITF-funded operation it was required to include a result-
based supervision plan that reflects reality on the ground.

The Bank required a financial statement audit of the ITF to be performed by the Bank's
external auditors on an annual basis. The costs of such an audit, including the internal
costs of the Bank with respect to the audit, were charged to the ITF. The Bank provided
each donor with a copy of the auditor's report. Furthermore, the Bank maintained close
consultation and coordination with the donors. And it provided each donor to the ITF
with semi-annual reports on its quarterly ex-post evaluation of the activities undertaken
by the monitoring agent. Within six months of completion of the activities or of full
disbursement of the contributions, whichever comes later, the Bank provided its close
support to the PMT by maintaining continuous follow up for each step and level in
implementing the project, provided a practical context for the PMT based on international
experience of managing projects and works, effectively elevating the level of PMT in
administering project components and aspects and ensuring wide-spectrum knowledge to
backup its performance.

Factors affecting implementation and outcomes

 1. There were several factors affected the implementation were out of the control of the
    Iraqi government represented by:
    a. Iraq experienced severe unstable security in years 2005 - 2007 accompanied with
        unstable MOH / PMT staff for many reasons mostly related to the security
        issues, which was the main reason behind the cancellation of civil works in two
        sites (Baquba, Ramadi) ,and awarding civil works of other sites to the local
        contractors in spite of their limited experience and non familiarity with the
        international business community guidelines, unstable security delayed the
        delivery, installation of equipment and dispensing of pharmaceuticals, PMT
        faced a lot of difficulties and challenges in implementing the training courses
        e.g. ( visa, air transportation ) noting that all the training activities implemented
        outside Iraq, and inability of many trainees to join the training or retained in their
        sites after training for the same reason. Overall; unstable security situation has
        prevented WB task team presence in Baghdadi Iraq.
    b. Transitional stage in establishing the new Iraqi government, and;

Some factors within the control of the government;
   Lack of familiarity with Bank's guidelines yielded some disagreements with some
   ministries and directorates, due to the conflict with Iraqi government's guidelines,
   such as; refusal to allocate pieces of areas and delays in some governmental
   procedures.

2. Some factors within the control ofMOH;
   a. Instability in the framework of MOH.
   b. Instability in the framework of PMT, and;



                                            49
    Factors within the control of PMT;
    a. Noticeable payment delay related to the lagging of contractors to submit their
       payments linvoice periodically based on contract accomplishments, a part from
       contractor's non familiarity with international banking guidelines and
       procedures. To minimize this factor, PMT provided continuous site training to
       the contractors and consultants concerning correct methods for payments
       claiming, and avoiding further delay.
    b. Insufficiency in some hired local consultants' expertise which needed reiterative
       training to elevate their level of experience to meet the required qualification.
    c. Impact due to role of consultants and construction industry in the project
       implementation.
Despite the aforementioned, no financial or administrative corruption has been noticed
throughout the project implementation, and no complaints raised in this regard by the
contractors, fiduciary or the Bank.

Lessons learned

By implementing two projects supervised and supported by the World Bank and the
international procurement advisor, it would be easier to diagnose more specific points
that should lead to a successful implementation for a project:

    1. Necessity of complete client involvement during the preparation/design of the
        project for Bank appraisal, represented by constant members.
   2. Applicability of the World Bank's procurement procedures and guidelines have
        led the PMT to manage the project activities smoothly and motivated MOH to
       adopt similar methods in the procurement of goods and civil works which reflects
       the usefulness of familiarity with those guidelines in the international business
       community.
   3. Selection of staff under special criteria of administrational, technical, and
       professional characteristics, consolidated with authoritative level in order to
       expedite implementation and facilitating decisions making to insure satisfying
       outcomes.
   4. Outside I Inside PMT and Focal points capacity building in the fields of ( civil
       works, pharmaceutical procurement, financial and administrative, project and
       health sector management) were very useful and was one of the Factors that
       enhanced the project implementation smoothly without influential technical
       obstacles.
   5. Providing essential requirements (such as; location of work, services, means of
       transportation and communication, and capacity building) to the staff.
   6. The periodic supervision missions with the WB task team were very useful for the
       project reviewing, progress evaluation, solving major obstacles and presented
       sustainable assistance to the PMT, a part from daily E-mails, correspondences and
       continuous advisory role of Bank's task team.
   7. The necessity of time-scheduled implementation for each item in project
       components based on consistent time schedule.


                                          50
8. In case of Force Majeure (see factors affecting implementation and outcomes),
   amendments and addendums for the project time and framework should be
   preceded by precise calculation for periods needed and the impact expected.

Annex 10. The Master Implementation Manual (MIM) and the Project
Implementation Manual (PIM)

The implementation of the EHRP was facilitated by the existence of two manuals: a
Master Implementation Manual (MIM) and a Project Implementation Manual (PIM).

MIM

Designed as a Master Implementation Manual, the MIM was the basis for project specific
implementation manuals, such as the PIM, which will regulate and guide project
activities funded by the ITF and, subsequently, IDA, in accordance with World Bank
guidelines for financial management and procurement.

The MIM aims to:

    •   introduce good practice;
    •   provide uniform policies and procedures for projects;
    •   encourage transparency, probity and accountability;
    •   facilitate optimum efficiency, effectiveness and value for money; and
    •   ensure compliance with the World Bank guidelines and with the law.

It is organized into three volumes to be of use to different audiences within an
implementing agency: line management, project manager, the project management team,
and staff (principally financial management and procurement staff) within the agency
providing services to the project management team.

The MIM deals with: (i) project set-up and organization; and (ii) procurement and
financial management in some detail, including step by step guidance and standard
bidding documents, model forms and general conditions of contracts.

PIM

The Project Implementation Manual (hereafter referred to as the PIM) is designed to help
the Project Management Team (PMT) to carry out the objectives of the Emergency
Health Rehabilitation Project (EHRP). The PIM is designed as a guide to the
implementation of the project activities, in particular in the areas of implementation
planning, procurement, disbursement and financial reporting. In addition, the Iraq Master
Implementation Manual (MIM) is designed to provide guidance on procedures and
documentation. However, the most relevant parts of the MIM with respect to this project
have been inserted in the PIM for convenience.

The PIM comprises the following parts:

        •   1. Introduction.
        •   2. The Project.



                                           54
      -.    3. Project Management.
        •   4. Implementation Details by Component.
       •    5. Procurement.
       •    6. General Guidance Annexes.
       •    7. Overview of Procurement Procedures in the Master Implementation
            Manual.
       •    8. Master Files and Other Relevant Documents & Tools.

The PIM is meant to be a "living" document. During the implementation of the EHRP, it
will be useful to update the information in the PIM to adapt to the project as it moves
forward, clarifying and improving the procedures described in the document. Changes
should be made after consultation with and review by the World Bank, as the
administrator of the Iraq Trust Fund, which is providing the grant financing for the
project.

This project is the first in the health sector to be financed from the World Bank Iraq Trust
Fund (WBITF) within the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI).
The Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation (MOPDC) is the Government's
designated donor coordination agency for Iraq's reconstruction program.

(January 2010) - Procurement and Financial Management Services


I.     INTRODUCTION

1.      In 2003, the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) was
established to help donors channel their resources and coordinate their support for
reconstruction and capacity building development activities in Iraq within its priority
program. IRFFI comprises two trust funds: (i) the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund (ITF)
administered by the World Bank; and (ii) the UN Development Group Iraq Trust Fund
administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The World Bank
and the UN administer these trust funds in accordance with the policies of their own
organization. Close coordination between the two trust funds is to be achieved through a
common governance structure, including through a joint IRFFI Donor Committee and
Executive Committee. The Donor Committee oversees the activities of IRFFI as a whole
and endorses its overall strategic priorities. The Executive Committee is chaired by the
Chairperson .of the Iraqi Strategic Review Board (ISRB) and is comprised of the IRFFI
Donor Committee Chairperson, and representatives of the United Nations and the World
Bank. T?e Executive Committee is responsible for day-to-day management of IRFFI.

II.    BACKGROUND

2.      The ITF is a multi-donor trust fund; as such, all funds are commingled in one
account. The ITF is financed by contributions from the following donors: Australia,
Canada, European Community, Finland, Iceland, India, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Kuwait, Netherlands, Norway, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and
United States, as well as investment income earned. The ITF finances grants for
rehabilitation/reconstruction and capacity building technical assistance projects. While
the terms of the ITF allow both public and private bodies to be grant recipients, all of the
current recipients are Iraqi governmental agencies, including ministries and the
Mayoralty of Baghdad.

3.     The ITF has financed 21 grants valued at US$507 million, exceeding donor
contributions by US$13 million and committing 103% of donor deposits to projects. Of
the 21 grants, 18 are active projects valued at US$447 million; three projects, valued at
US$60 million, are completed.

4.      The vast majority ofITF projects are implemented by Iraqi agencies (15 out of the
18 active projects, amounting to US$434 million) to help the Government of Iraq (GOI)
develop effective institutions to ensure country ownership. ITF projects aim to help the
GOI strengthen its institutional capacity to deliver services, utilize its resources in an
efficient and transparent manner, and implement key reforms. ITF grants finance
textbooks, schools, pharmaceuticals and health clinics, improved social safety nets, water
supply and sanitation, irrigation and drainage, electricity, environmental management,
private sector development, and banking and public finance management reform efforts.
The ITF also finances technical assistance to help strengthen Iraqi institutions develop


                                            56
baseline poverty data, and improve social safety net targeting mechanisms. More
information about the ITF-financed projects under implementation and in the pipeline can
be found on the website www.irffi.org. Additio.nal projects may be approved depending
on the availability of ITF funds.

5.       To ensure country ownership and that the ITF finances Iraq's development
priorities, the potential recipient submits a proposed project to the Iraqi Strategic Review
Board (ISRB). The ISRB is chaired by the Ministry of Planning and Development
Cooperation (MoPDC), and is responsible to review all externally financed projects to
ensure they are consistent with Iraq's priority program, filling a gap, and not overlapping
with other programs. The World Bank appraises and jointly negotiates the project with
the recipient and, subsequently, signs a grant agreement with the recipient, which details
the scope and conditions for the use and disbursement of funds. The recipient entity
implements the project.

6.      The World Bank supervises ITF-funded projects in accordance with the World
Bank's policies and procedures. Projects financed by the ITF are subject to the same
internal controls to ensure that funds are properly used for the purposes intended and that
the objectives of each project are achieved. Since the difficult security situation prevents
World Bank and ministry staff from freely traveling throughout Iraq to visit project sites,
the World Bank employs special measures to mitigate risks for its program in Iraq. One
of these measures is the engagement of a Fiduciary Monitoring Agent (FMA) to help the
World Bank supervise projects implemented by Iraqi agencies.

 7.     Typically, the recipient agency establishes a Project Management Team (PM1) to
be responsible for day-to-day project implementation, which must be carried out in
accordance with the operational procedures specified in the Grant Agreement. For each
project, the Recipient must: (i) establish and maintain adequate procurement and financial
management arrangements, including the systems for planning, organization and
procedures, record keeping. accounting for funds. managing disbursements. and contract
management that are documented in the Master Implementation. Manual (MIM); and (ii)
appoint competent procurement and financial management personnel to operate the
systems. The Recipient is expected to develop institutional capacity project
implementation. based on World Bank operational policies and procedures. PMTs
should understand that the World Bank procurement procedures are, in fact, a set of
procedures and tools of internationally accepted public procurement methods, and are not
specifically devised for World Bank financed procurement alone--other multilateral
development banks, such as the Islamic Development Bank, use them as well, adapted to
their specific requirements.

8.      In general; two categories of expenditures are eligible for financing under ITF
grants, including: (i) investment and capital expenditures, including incremental recurrent
costs related to the supported investment and capital expenditures; and (ii) technical
assistance and training programs for Iraq's public and private entities to strengthen the

engaged Etiman Management Consulting Services (EMCS) as the FMA for the ITF. The
FMA verifies the physical implementation of projects and monitors compliance with
fiduciary policies, including financial management and procurement procedures. The
initial contract covered the period of December 2005 through end-December 2007, which
was the initial termination date of the ITF.

assignment was extended for the period of January 1,2008 to December 31, 2010, which
was the revised termination date of the ITF. The contract was renewabl~ annually subject
to: (i) satisfactory performance on the basis of annual evaluation in the eleventh month of
the year; (ii) submission of satisfactory updated technical and financial proposals for the
FMA services for the next calendar year; (iii) the ITF remaining in place; and (iv) the
continuation of ITF project implementation. (The ITF has since been extended for a
second time, and the termination date is now December 31, 2013.)

10.     The revised IRFFI Terms of Reference, which were endorsed at the IRFFI Donor
Committee Meeting on October 29, 2007, and a sample Financing Agreement between
the World Bank and the Recipient are provided separately for reference and guidance in
the performance of the FMA assignment.

 11.    Following negotiations with the FMA in November 2009, the duration of the
 FMA assignment has been extended for the period January 1 through December 31,
.2010, subject to continuation of the ITF funding during this period.

                 management requirements under each project implemented by an Iraqi
                 agency;

         (ii)    To support institutional capacity building initiatives of the World Bank to
                 strengthen the fiduciary capabilities of implementing agencies;

                 audits; and

        (iv)     To report on the status of project implementation and compliance with
                 procurement and financial management procedure to the World Bank.

 IV.    SCOPE OF SERVICES

                              A.      Financial Management

13.     The FMA will have the following dual roles in financial management:



                                             58
           (i) The first role is towards the World Bank: through verifying and
               validating the projects' financial management arrangements and internal
               controls to ensure that they comply with the World Bank's requirements
               as agreed the implementing entities.

           (ii) The second role is towards the Recipients and the projects financed by
              the ITF through providing technical assistance/advisory services related
              to the projects' financial management arrangements and the generation of
              periodic and reliable financial reports.

14.   Specifically, the responsibilities will be as follows:

          (iii)Follow-up with implementing agencies to ensure that the preparation of
               project budgets/disbursement plans are linked to the procurement plans
               and the projects' closing dates.

          (iv)Follow-up with the implementing agencies to monitor individual project
              accounts and generate timely and reliable reports including the Financial
              Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and Interim Un-audited Financial Reports
              (IFRs) that reconcile with their records. Any un-reconciled items should
              be followed up by the FMA to ensure clearance by the PMTs before
              submitting the FMRsIIFRs to the Bank

          (v) Provide fiduciary technical assistance, advisory support, and on-the-job
              training to the implementing agencies on project financial management to
              enable them to manage individual project accounts and generate the
              FMRslIFRs. On-the-job training will be guided by a regular updated
              training schedule agreed among the FMA, the implementing agencies and
              the Bank.

          (vi)Perform on site random verification of the projects' assets purchased
              through ITF funds, and report on the findings. A fixed asset register,
              listings goods purchased under the project, should be maintained by
              every implementing agency.

          (vii)      Familiarize the PMTs with the Bank auditing requirements and
              support them in performing the auditor's selection process. Follow up
              with the PMTs on the submission of acceptable auditing reports and the
              implementation of the auditor's recommendations on the identified
              weaknesses in internal controls as per the management letters.

               for reimbursement, replenishments and direct payment transactions, using
               the World Bank Loan Department pre-screening checklist. Pre-screening
               will conducted on a sample basis using a risk based approach, to ensure
              compliance, accuracy and completeness of the information. Report on




                                           59
                the pre-screening in the periodic reports prepared for the World Bank and
                PMT.

         (ix) Post-review and follow-up on withdrawal applications for direct
              payments, reimbursements, and replenishments on sample basis using a
              risk based approach, to ensure that the associated internal controls had
              been properly applied and that they are in compliance, and that
              withdrawal applications are accurate and complete.

             (x) Advise the World Bank about any modification, addition or deletion
                 relating to the accounting and financial laws applicable to public sector or
                 state owned enterprises during the assignment.

             (xi)Review the projects' bank reconciliation statements, including the
                 Designated Account, and follow up with the PMTs on any outstanding
                 items (e.g. uncleared checks, for which a payment would appear in the
                 PMTs records but not yet in the World Bank statement).

             (xii)       On a sample basis, monitor payment transactions for direct
                  payments, submitted by contractors, suppliers, consultants until the
                  amounts are credited into beneficiaries' bank accounts, using the PMT's
                  monitoring sheets. (PMTs monitor each payment step against their
                  service standards, from initiating the request to carrying out the technical
                  review, financial management review, obtaining the authorization, and
                  preparing and signing withdrawal application.) Report any excessive
                  delays to the World Bank without waiting for the monthly/quarterly
                  reporting cycle.

      Reporting

             (xiii)      In addition to reporting on compliance with procedures, identifying
                  issues and making recommendations, the FMA should report on the
                  specific actions taken by the PMT to follow up on FMA and/or World
                  Bank team recommendations to resolve previously-identified issues.

             (xiv)     Information included in the reports should be checked with the
                 PMT Financial Officer for accuracy before sending it to the Bank.
                 However, if this delays the FMA report cycle, the FMA should arrange to
                 meet with the PMT to review the final report after they have been sent to
                 the World Bank and PMT.
