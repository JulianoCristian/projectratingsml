Some lessons learned included: a\n            review should be carried out by the Bank as to whether, in\n            evaluating emergency projects implemented in countries that\n            are in-conflict, a different or modified version of the\n            Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) format should be\n            developed that will be more suitable. It is important for\n            the Bank to 'stay the course' with ongoing\n            projects in the face of difficult circumstances, as these\n            instruments are a critical means for building country\n            knowledge and leveraging future policy dialogue. The Bank\n            should always assume low institutional capacity and high\n            turnover in a conflict, post-conflict, fragile situation. In\n            fragile states, the design of emergency projects in\n            conflict-affected situations should be very simple,\n            manageable in scope and suitable to context, with a primary\n            focus on outputs. In line with the focus on outputs, the\n            project development objective (PDO) should also be based on\n            outputs only. Safeguard requirements should be simplified\n            and the necessary resources should be applied to satisfy\n            them. The Bank should support the counterparts in\n            establishing monitoring and evolution (M&E) systems and\n            methodology in the context of project design, to ensure\n            effective oversight of their programs. In situations where\n            the project management team is relatively inexperienced,\n            Bank support for monitoring outputs may be very valuable to\n            project management. A Master Implementation Manual (MIM) and\n            a Project Implementation Manual (PIM) that provide a clear\n            definition of implementation procedures are important\n            elements for successful projects."}, "docdt": "2010-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
