"abstracts": {"cdata!": "This Environmental and Social Screening\n            and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) provides general policies,\n            guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be\n            integrated into the implementation of the initial phase of\n            Bank-supported emergency reconstruction operations in Iraq.\n            This Framework has been developed to ensure compliance with\n            the Bank's safeguard policies, under the current\n            conditions in Iraq. The objective of the ESSAF is to ensure\n            that activities under the proposed reconstruction operations\n            will address the following issues: protect human health;\n            prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood; minimize\n            environmental degradation as a result of either individual\n            subprojects, or their cumulative effects; minimize impacts\n            on cultural property; and, enhance positive environmental\n            and social outcomes. Project design, and subproject\n            selection will aim at maintaining regional balance, and\n            equity among ethnic religious groups, considering variations\n            in population density. Employment opportunities within the\n            projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the\n            basis of professional competence, irrespective of gender, or\n            ethnic or religious group. In all projects which require\n            consultations with local communities, or beneficiaries,\n            consultations will be conducted to elicit the views of the\n            male, and female population. The safeguard screening and\n            mitigation process will include: a list of negative impacts\n            rendering a proposed subproject ineligible for support; a\n            proposed checklist of likely environment and social impacts\n            to be filled out for each subproject or group of\n            subprojects; guidelines for land and asset acquisition,\n            entitlements and compensation; procedures for the protection\n            of cultural property, including the chance discovery of\n            archaeological artifacts, unrecorded graveyards and burial\n            sites; relevant elements of the codes of practice for the\n            prevention, and mitigation of potential environmental\n            impacts; and, a sample of Environmental Safeguards\n            procedures for inclusion in the Technical Specifications of\n            Contracts. Checklists for subproject approval, and the\n            process format are included. Some of the mitigation measures\n            are addressed as follows: prioritize leak detection and\n            repair of pipe networks, to minimize water contamination,\n            and conduct chemical and bacteriological testing of water\n            quality from adjacent comparable sources, prior to\n            installation of new sources, and a redesign should be\n            conducted to prevent contamination if sources are found\n            contaminated. Followed by subsequent monitoring. Night-soil\n            latrines, or septic tanks should be sealed, with outflows\n            drainage flows located at least 10m from water sources, or\n            be connected to a working drain. Community participation and\n            organization should be ensured for effective planning, and\n            management of infrastructure, while downstream water users\n            (e.g. water supply, irrigation, livestock watering) should\n            be included in planning of water storage reservoirs.\n            Procedures regarding archaeological finds should be\n            coordinated with the appropriate agencies."}, "docdt": "2004-10-01T16:29:03Z"}
