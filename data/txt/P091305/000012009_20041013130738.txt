           EMERGENCY HEALTH REHABILITATION PROJECT                              E1026
                                                 IRAQ

      ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK


I.     Objectives

1.       The Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) provides general
policies, guidelines, codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of the
initial phase of World Bank-supported emergency reconstruction operations in Iraq. This Framework has
been developed to ensure compliance with the World Bank’s safeguard policies under the current
conditions in Iraq. The objective of the ESSAF is to ensure that activities under the proposed
reconstruction operations will address the following issues:

           Protect human health;
           Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;
           Minimize environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or their
           cumulative effects;
           Minimize impacts on cultural property; and
           Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes.


II.    General Principles

2.      Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed relief and reconstruction operations and the
related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in
managing potential environmental and social risks, the ESSAF is based on the following principles:

       The proposed operations will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of which may not
       be known at appraisal. To ensure effective application of the World Bank’s safeguard policies,
       the ESSAF provides guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation for the
       selection and design of subprojects and the planning of mitigation measures;

       Environmental category ‘A’ subprojects are not expected in the first year’s subprojects. If any do
       occur, EAs for specific subprojects will be prepared during implementation, instead of before
       appraisal. Corrective measures in the form of an Environmental Management Plan will be built
       into either the emergency project or a future lending operation. The above is in accordance with
       paragraph 13 of OP 4.01 and paragraph 5 of BP 4.01;

       No resettlement issues are expected in any of the FY04 operations for the first year’s subprojects.
       If any do occur, Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), and/or Resettlement Policy Frameworks for
       specific subprojects will be prepared. However, these RAPs can be prepared during
       implementation, provided a waiver on the submission of RAPs prior to appraisal is given by the
       MD. The waiver would also specify a timetable for the preparation of the RAPs, in accordance
       with the requirements of OP 4.12, during implementation;
                                                   -2-


        The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will finance feasibility and detailed design
        studies for these subsequent investments, which will include environmental assessments and
        social studies as required by World Bank safeguard policies;

        Project design and subproject selection will aim at maintaining regional balance and equity
        among ethnic religious groups, considering variations in population density. Employment
        opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis of
        professional competence, irrespective of gender or ethnic or religious group. In all projects which
        require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, consultations will be conducted to
        elicit the views of the male and female population; and

        Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs of these
        operations. This ESSAF will be disclosed in the sector ministries and other public places in Iraq
        and in the World Bank InfoShop.


III.    Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF)

3.       This ESSAF has been developed specifically for these proposed operations to ensure due
diligence, to avoid causing harm or exacerbating social tensions, and to ensure consistent treatment of
social and environmental issues by all donors and the Governing Council of Iraq. The purpose of this
Framework is also to assist the Project Implementing Agencies in screening all the subprojects for their
likely social and environmental impacts, identifying documentation and preparation requirements and
prioritizing the investments.

4.       P 4.01 Environmental Assessment. Most of the proposed subprojects are likely to focus on the
repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction and upgrading (where necessary) of damaged buildings, roads,
railways, bridges and infrastructure of critical importance. This would include power generation and
distribution, agricultural infrastructure, irrigation and drainage networks, and rehabilitation of primary
and secondary schools. Support will also be provided for mitigation measures related to the
rehabilitation/restoration of the Mesopotamian Marshes and Shatt El Arab. The work in these areas will
be done under OP 4.01 and it is not anticipated that OP 4.04 on natural habitats will be triggered.

5.       Considering the nature and magnitude of potential environmental impacts from relatively limited
scale and magnitude of reconstruction works, the proposed operations are likely to be classified as
category ‘B’. The requirement to carry out an Environmental Analysis as part of project preparation can
be waived but, for subprojects with potential adverse impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis will be
done during project implementation. At the same time, prior to appraisal the implementing agency will
agree to apply the following minimum standards during implementation: inclusion of standard
environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the repair and reconstruction bid documents of all subprojects;
review and oversight of any major reconstruction works by specialists; implementation of
environmentally and socially sound options for disposal of debris; and provisions for adequate budget and
satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring effective implementation.

6.       OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The need for involuntary resettlement or land acquisition in
specific subproject areas will only be known during project implementation, when site-specific plans are
available. Therefore subprojects will be screened for applicability of the resettlement policy and any
subprojects involving involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will only be approved after preparation
of a resettlement plan acceptable to the Bank. Several issues will increase the complexity of land
acquisition - the lack of reliable land record systems, and the inability of people loosing land to either
document ownership or be physically present to make their claims for eligibility. The safeguards
                                                    -3-


framework will therefore include procedures for identifying eligible project-affected people, calculating
and delivering compensation, and mechanisms for land dispute grievance redress.

7.       Although land disputes between private parties and refugees from war, or natural disasters are not
covered by OP 4.12, the policy does cover those displaced by the project’s activities. Even for those not
covered by the policy, and to ensure effective poverty reduction, it is good practice for the borrower to
undertake a social assessment and implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse social impacts,
particularly on poor and vulnerable groups. Well documented consultation mechanisms will be required
to establish eligibility for compensation. Absent refugees who later claim compensation will require clear
legal remedies to resolve or adjudicate disputes.

8.      OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples. Ethnicity is only one of many factors determining vulnerability in
the present Iraqi context. Local circumstances vary too greatly to make generalizations. However, initial
discussions with anthropologists and sociologists familiar with the country found that the presence of the
five defining characteristics normally used (OD 4.20 paragraph 5) are inconclusive in Iraqi’s context,
where the ethnic group concept is analytically problematic. According to social scientists familiar with
ground realities in Iraq, selecting a sub-section of the society for special attention in accordance with the
requirements of OD 4.20 (e.g., separate plans for different groups) would be counterproductive and could
even end up escalating the conflict within and between communities.

9.      In light of the above situation, a potential vulnerability assessment of all affected groups is
planned to ensure effective consultations and culturally appropriate benefits for each group, instead of
focusing only on groups defined as “indigenous peoples”. As part of this analysis, subproject preparation
will assess the vulnerability of different ethnic groups in particular project contexts (in terms of potential
exclusion from project benefits, negative project impacts, and the need for specific culturally compatible
mechanisms for participation), and will incorporate adequate measures to address such vulnerability in
project design. While some specific cases may justify stand-alone Indigenous Peoples Development Plans
(IPDP) such as in the case of the people in the Mesopotamian Marshlands, these cases can only be
determined after social analysis of potential vulnerability and careful judgment as required by the OD
4.20.

10.      OPN 11.03 Cultural Property. The FY04 operations may pose limited risks of damaging
cultural property, assuming that they will not include large-scale excavations, movement of earth or
demolition. Nevertheless, projects and subprojects will be reviewed for their potential impact on cultural
property and clear procedures will be required for identification, protection of cultural property from
theft, and treatment of discovered artifacts, and will be included in standard bidding documents. While
not damaging cultural property, subproject preparation may later identify and include assistance for
preservation of historic or archeological sites. If these opportunities occur, cultural property management
plans would be prepared for those subprojects.

11.     OP 4.37 Safety of Dams. There are about 50 dams over 15 meters high, which will trigger the
policy if included in the operations. However, because of local site conditions, even restoring smaller,
earthen dams and linked irrigation infrastructure (partly abandoned, damaged or destroyed by civil unrest
and war) will require application of standard engineering safety codes, inspection and evaluation of their
safety status, and preparation and implementation of operation and maintenance procedures. Decisions
on dam safety requirements will be made with the concurrence of the Bank.

12.     OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways. The two major rivers in Iraq, the Tigris and
Euphrates, are shared with neighboring countries. However, no water sharing agreements exist between
Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq. Components affecting waters in riparian neighbors will trigger the policy
and project components will be screened to identify riparian issues and to ensure adequate notification, as
                                                  -4-


required under the policy. Decisions on actions and requirements will be made with the concurrence of
the Bank.


IV.     Safeguard Screening and Mitigation

13.     The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be consistent
with the following guidelines, codes of practice and requirements. The Coalition Provisional Authority
(CPA) will confirm that areas to be accessed during reconstruction and rehabilitation activities have been
de-mined. The safeguard screening and mitigation process will include:

            A list of negative characteristics rendering a proposed subproject ineligible for support,
            Attachment 1;
            A proposed checklist of likely environment and social impacts to be filled out for each
            subproject or group of subprojects, Attachment 2;
            Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation, Attachment 3;
            Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery of
            archaeological artifacts, unrecorded graveyards and burial sites, Attachment 4;
            Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the prevention and mitigation of potential
            environmental impacts, Attachment 5; and
            A sample Environmental Safeguards procedures for Inclusion in the Technical Specifications
            of Contracts, Attachment 6.

V.      Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation

14.     A number of Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed operations,
including the Ministries of Environment, Transport, Housing and Construction, Electricity, Water
Resources, Municipalities and Public Works, and the mayoralty of Baghdad. Each Ministry will be
responsible for applying the safeguard screening and mitigation requirements to its own subprojects.
Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal Point (SFP) will be identified with responsibility for overseeing
the implementation of the Framework.


VI.     Capacity-Building and Monitoring of Safeguard Framework Implementation

15.     As part of the capacity-building to be provided for implementation of the proposed operations,
the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also receive training in
ESSAF’s application.

16.     To assist in this capacity-building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the
ESSAF’s application, the World Bank and subsequently the Governing Council of Iraq (GCI) will
contract specialist services for environmental and social safeguards. During supervision of these
operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the ESSAF, and recommend additional
strengthening, if required.


VII.    Consultation and Disclosure
                                                       -5-


17.     This ESSAF will be shared with the CPA, with the concerned nongovernmental organizations and
development partners of Iraq’s reconstruction. It will be disclosed in Arabic and English by the Ministry
of Planning and Development Cooperation on behalf of the GCI in Baghdad, Basrah, and Mosul, and it
will also be made available at the World Bank’s InfoShop. Relevant subproject specific safeguard
documents/mitigation plans prepared subsequently will also be disclosed.

18.     The proposed operations will support a number of feasibility and detailed design studies for
future infrastructure investments for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to consultation and
disclosure will apply. In particular, for environmental Category A and B investments1 proposed for future
operations, the implementing agency will consult project-affected groups and local nongovernmental
organizations on the project's environmental and social aspects, and will take their views into account.
The implementing agency will initiate these consultations as early as possible, and for meaningful
consultations, will provide relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and
language(s) that are understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted.

19.     For Category A projects, the implementing agency will consult these groups at least twice: (a)
shortly after the environmental screening and prior to finalization of the terms of reference for the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA); and (b) once a draft EIA report is prepared. For the initial
consultation, the implementing agency will provide a summary of the proposed project's objectives,
description, and potential impacts. For both Category A and B projects, the implementing agency will
provide these groups with a summary of the EIA report’s conclusions. In addition, the implementing
agency will make the draft reports publicly available to project-affected groups and local
nongovernmental organizations.

             Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation


I.      Objectives

1.       Resettlement and land acquisition will be kept to a minimum, and will be carried out in
accordance with these guidelines. Subproject proposals that would require demolishing houses or
acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize or avoid their impacts through
alternative alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights of way should be
carefully reviewed. No land or asset acquisition may take place outside of these guidelines. A format for
a Land Acquisition Assessment Data Sheet is attached as Attachment 3(i).

2.      These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate negatively affected persons to
ensure that they will be assisted to improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or
production capacity to pre-project levels regardless of their land tenure status.


II.     Categorization

3.     Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project, Project Affected People
(PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects will be categorized as follows:

        (a) Projects that will affect more than 200 PAPs due to land acquisition and/or physical
            relocation and where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced. If the RAP
            cannot be prepared prior to project appraisal, a waiver can be provided by the World Bank
            Managing Director (MD) in consultation with the Resettlement Committee. In such cases,
            the TT should agree with the Borrower on a timetable for preparation of the RAP.

        (b) Projects that will affect less than 200 persons require the following documentation: (i) a
            land acquisition assessment, (ii) the minutes or record of consultations which assess
            the compensation claimed and agreement reached, and (iii) a record of the receipt of
            the compensation, or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below).

        (c) Projects that are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant adverse
            social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and improved livelihoods
            are expected from such interventions.


III.    Eligibility

4.       PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly affected by the project due to
acquisition of the land owned or used by them. PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are:

        (a) those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structures/buildings, including
            recognized customary and traditional rights;

        (b) those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct rights rooted in
            customary law; and
                                                     - 13 -


        (c) those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall within (a) and
            (b) above, are eligible to resettlement assistance to restore their livelihood.


IV.     Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation

5.      PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:

        (a) Voluntary contributions. Individuals may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets
            provided the persons making such contributions do so willingly and are informed that they
            have the right to refuse such contributions; and

        (b) Contributions against compensation. A contributor/asset loser considered "affected" will be
            eligible for compensation and other necessary assistance.

6.       Voluntary contribution should be clearly documented to confirm the voluntary nature of the
transition. The documentation should specify that the land is free of any squatters, encroachers or other
claims. A format is shown in Attachment 3(i), which includes a Schedule for assessing any compensation
claimed and the agreement reached.


V.      Compensation Principles

7.    The project implementation agencies will ensure timely provision of the following means of
compensation to affected peoples:

        (a) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other productive assets with
            the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at a replacement
            cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost assets will be
            made according to the following principles:

            (i)    replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent productive
                   assets;
            (ii)   materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished;
            (iii) replacement of damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value;
            (iv)   other acceptable in-kind compensation;
            (v)    in case of cash compensation, the delivery of compensation should be made in public,
                   i.e., at the Community Meeting; and
            (vi)   in case of physical relocation, provision of civic infrastructure at the resettlement sites.

        (b) Project affected peoples losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets
            rendering the remainder economically non-viable will have the options of compensation for
            the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset,
            according to the principles in (a) i-iv above.


VI.     Consultation Process

8.      The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets located in
a proposed subproject area are consulted. Community meetings will be held in each affected district and
                                                    - 14 -


village to inform the local population of their rights to compensation and options available in accordance
with these Guidelines. The Minutes of the community meetings shall reflect the discussions held,
agreements reached, and include details of the agreement, based on the format provided in Attachment
3(ii).

9.      The implementing agency shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected people and confirm in
discussions with each of them, their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached, and
any eventual complaint. Copies will be recorded in the posted project documentation and be available for
inspection during supervision.

Subproject Approval

10.    In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing
agency shall:

        (a) not approve the subproject unless satisfactory compensation has been agreed between the
            affected person and the local community; and
        (b) not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory manner to
            the affected persons.

Complaints and Grievances

11.     Initially, all complaints should be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local
community/village/district level. If this fails, complaints and grievances on these Guidelines,
implementation of the agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged
irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the affected peoples or their representative
at the municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted to the relevant
implementing agency for consideration.

Verification

12.      The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence of
compensation made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising engineers, who will
maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when they undertake reviews and
post-project assessment. This process shall be specified in all relevant project documents, including
details of the relevant authority for complaints at the municipal/district or implementing agency level.

                                    Protection of Cultural Property


1.       Cultural property include monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of significance points of
view, and are defined as sites and structures having archaeological, historical, architectural, or religious
significance, and natural sites with cultural values. This includes cemeteries, graveyards and graves.

2.       The initial phase of the proposed emergency reconstruction operations pose limited risks of
damaging cultural property since subprojects will largely consist of small investments in community
infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures, and minor public
works. Further, the list of negative subproject attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible for
support (Attachment 1), includes any activity that would adversely impact cultural property.
Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection from theft, and treatment of
discovered artifacts should be followed and included in standard bidding documents as provided in
Attachment 6.

Chance Find Procedures

3.      Chance find procedures will be used as follows:

        (a) Stop the construction activities in the area of the chance find;
        (b) Delineate the discovered site or area;
        (c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of removable
            antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local
            authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over;
        (d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and
            the Ministry of Culture immediately (within 24 hours or less);
        (e) Responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture would be in charge of protecting
            and preserving the site before deciding on subsequent appropriate procedures. This would
            require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the archeologists of the
            Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The significance and importance of the findings should
            be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural heritage; those include the
            aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values;
        (f) Decisions on how to handle the finding shall be taken by the responsible authorities and the
            Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when finding an
            irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation,
            restoration and salvage;
        (g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall be
            communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and
        (h) Construction work could resume only after permission is given from the responsible local
            authorities and the Ministry of Culture concerning safeguard of the heritage.

4.      These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when
applicable, and as proposed in section 1.5 of Attachment 6. During project supervision, the Site Engineer
shall monitor the above regulations relating to the treatment of any chance find encountered are observed.

5.      Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness of the project’s cultural
property mitigation, management, and activities, as appropriate.

                                    • Appropriate location, apron and drainage around tubewells and
                                      dug wells to prevent formation of stagnant pools.
                                    • Provision of cover and hand-pump to prevent contamination of
                                      dug wells.
                                    • Where pit latrines are used they should be located more than
                                      10m from any water source. The base should be sealed and
                                      separated by at least 2m of sand or loamy soil from the
                                      groundwater table.
                                    • Where nightsoil latrines or septic tanks are built they should be
                                      sealed. Outflows should drain either to a soak away located at
                                      least 10m from any water source or be connected to a working
                                      drain.


Depletion of water source:
• over-exploitation of aquifers.    • Urban interventions and abstraction limits to be planned in the
                                      context of groundwater investigations.
• hazard of land subsidence.
                                    • Local water use planning (community and technical
                                      consultation).

V.      Earthworks

21.     Earthworks shall be properly controlled, especially during the rainy season.

22.     The Contractor shall maintain stable cut and fill slopes at all times and cause the least possible
disturbance to areas outside the prescribed limits of the work.

23.     The Contractor shall complete cut and fill operations to final cross-sections at any one location as
soon as possible and preferably in one continuous operation to avoid partially completed earthworks,
especially during the rainy season.

24.      In order to protect any cut or fill slopes from erosion, in accordance with the drawings, cut off
drains and toe-drains shall be provided at the top and bottom of slopes and be planted with grass or other
plant cover. Cut off drains should be provided above high cuts to minimize water runoff and slope
erosion.

25.     Any excavated cut or unsuitable material shall be disposed of in designated tipping areas as
agreed to by the Engineer.

26.     Tips should not be located where they can cause future slides, interfere with agricultural land or
any other properties, or cause soil from the dump to be washed into any watercourse. Drains may need to
be dug within and around the tips, as directed by the Engineer.


VI.     Historical and Archeological Sites

27.    If the Contractor discovers archeological sites, historical sites, remains and objects, including
graveyards and/or individual graves during excavation or construction, the Contractor shall:

        (b) Delineate the discovered site or area.
        (c) Secure the site to prevent any damage or loss of removable objects. In cases of removable
            antiquities or sensitive remains, a night guard shall be present until the responsible local
            authorities and the Ministry of Culture take over.
        (d) Notify the supervisory Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and
            the Ministry of Culture immediately (less than 24 hours).
        (e) Contact the responsible local authorities and the Ministry of Culture who would be in charge
            of protecting and preserving the site before deciding on the proper procedures to be carried
            out. This would require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the
            archeologists of the Ministry of Culture (within 72 hours). The significance and importance
            of the findings should be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural
            heritage, including the aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values.
        (f) Ensure that decisions on how to handle the finding be taken by the responsible authorities and
            the Ministry of Culture. This could include changes in the layout (such as when the finding is
            an irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation,
            restoration and salvage.
        (g) Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall be
            communicated in writing by the Ministry of Culture; and
