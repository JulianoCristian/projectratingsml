        effects resulting from the implementation of the Greater\n            Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project, and proposed\n            mitigating measures, are addressed in this

Supplemental Credit, as\n            follows. Construction will generate air pollution, oil and\n            fuel leakage, spoil, and construction debris: aboveground\n            storage tanks, and drums will be stored on low permeably\n            bases to contain oil spills; excavated spoil will be stored\n            at selected sites, and should be covered to minimize dust\n            emissions. Impacts on flora, and fauna may endanger\n            ecological interest areas: to control soil erosion,\n            construction sites will be stabilized by reseeding grass\n            areas, while areas along coastal stream banks should be\n            avoided, to stabilize soils, and provide wildlife habitats;\n            hunting will be strictly forbidden. Civil works,\n            particularly in urban areas, will disturb traffic: safety\n            measures will be adopted, and traffic shall be rerouted as\n            necessary, in the vicinity of construction areas, in\n            accordance with international practices, enforced by local\n            regulations. Cultural, and archaeological heritage sites\n            shall be avoided, based on a preliminary survey, to be\n            conducted by the archaeology, and antiquities institutes,\n            while works should be monitored if unexpected archaeological\n            sites are discovered."}, "docdt": "2001-06-30T00:26:05Z"}
