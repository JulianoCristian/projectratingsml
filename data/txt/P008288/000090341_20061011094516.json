Lessons learned from the\n            project: Assumptions used in projecting future performance\n            need to be as realistic as possible, and to take due\n            consideration of prevailing political, economic, and social\n            risks. Development outcomes of investment projects can be\n            enhanced when done in parallel with a strong overall policy\n            dialogue. Technical Assistance for implementation of reform\n            components should be packaged separately from consultancy\n            services for investment operations. Technical Assistance\n            alone cannot bring about reforms unless it is combined with\n            strong political support and the commitment of all\n            stakeholders, including utility management. The objectives\n            and design of project sub-components should be consistent\n            with the resources allocated to them. The focus on\n            monitoring and evaluation during project\n            implementation/supervision needs to be improved."}, "docdt": "2006-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
