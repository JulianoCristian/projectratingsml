objectives of the Greater\n            Baku Water Supply Rehabilitation Project are to: 1) make\n            emergency short term improvements in the water supply system\n            to restore the water supply to Baku, in particular to the\n            poorer elements of the population; 2) improve the water\n            supply system as a whole; and 3) provide the basis for\n            longer term planning and recovery. The project will comprise\n            five major components: 1) water demand management to\n            conserve water at the household level through a program of\n            consumer awareness initiatives, through repairs to in-home\n            plumbing, valves, taps and other fittings, and by\n            rationalizing water use through meter installations and the\n            implementation of a progressive water tariff; 2) operations\n            and maintenance improvements to increase the amount of water\n            available from the distribution system through a program of\n            leak detection and repair, workshop and equipment\n            acquisition, and at least a one year inventory of selected\n            replacement valves and pipes; 3) supply improvements to\n            improve the quantity and quality of water from the treatment\n            works and enhancing the reliability of the distribution\n            network ; 4) institutional capacity building to reorganize\n            the water utility into a joint stock company; consolidating\n            its offices; purchasing and installing new computers with\n            new software; and developing training programs; and 5)\n            preparation and implementation of a national policy\n            framework for the water sector and preparing a regional\n            master plan."}, "docdt": "1995-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
