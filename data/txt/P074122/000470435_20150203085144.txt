Moldova's health status markedly declined between 1990 and 2000. Life expectancy at birth is
one of the lowest in Europe (68 years in 2003). Maternal and infant mortality rates have been
relatively stable over the last 10 years but are still 3 to 5 times higher than the EU averages. In
the late 1990s, the incidence of TB increased dramatically, especially in prisons. From the mid-
1990's onward, HIV/AIDS prevalence increased by more than 25 times among the 15-49 age
group, reaching 0.90 percent in 2003. Service-wise, the country was trying to maintain extensive
facilities inherited from Soviet times on a meager budget. Resources were skewed toward large
hospitals, which represented 70 percent of health spending.




The Health Investment Fund Project aimed to upgrade emergency and primary health care,
downsize and consolidate excessive capacity, and develop institutional capacity and policies.
The project also established the Health Investment Fund to sponsor change by demonstrating
improvements in access, quality, and efficiency of health care services at all levels of the
system. The AIDS Control Project aimed to provide strategic planning and institutional capacity
building for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STI) control; scale up prevention
interventions for HIV/AIDS/STIs and STI management; and improve treatment, care, and support
for people living with AIDS through managing opportunistic infections and palliative care, home
and community-based care and support, and highly-active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).




Collaboration between the Moldovan government, NGOs, and supporting donors has
contributed to stabilizing life expectancy, a decrease in maternal and infant mortality, and
70 percent decrease in mortality due to AIDS. Health sector reforms created a new
minimum benefits package and improved rural access to health care.


Highlights:
- Maternal mortality has decreased to 18.6 per 100 thousand live births in 2005 (32 percent
decrease)
- Infant mortality has decreased to 12 per 1000 live birth in 2005 (35 percent decrease)
- Implementation of health sector reforms, with changing health sector financing to social health
insurance, optimizing health sector infrastructure, and defining a minimum package of health
services offered by the Government free of charge: the benefit package has been available from
2004, and was gradually expanded during 2005-06
- All general practitioners were provided with portable kits; 84 percent of rural health centers
were provided basic medical equipment; all district hospitals were provided emergency and
operating theatre medical equipment; 75 ambulance cars were provided
- 22 percent of health centers (99 of total 431) were renovated (roofing, heating system, water
supply, sewage)
- Training provided to 750 primary care doctors and 1500 nurses, as well as 300 health care
managers
- Full coverage of pregnant women with screening for HIV, pregnant women diagnosed with HIV
are covered with prophylactic treatment with anti-retroviral therapy and free milk formula for
replacement feeding
- Decrease of transmission of HIV infection from mother to child by 76 percent from 6.7 percent
to 1.6 percent in 2005
- Decrease of AIDS mortality due to availability of HAART treatment from 100 percent in 2002 to
29.7 percent in 2005
- Syphilis has decreased from 94.8 per 100 000 in 2002 to 69.5 in 2005




- The First Health Sector and HIV/AIDS Control Strategy, developed with assistance from IDA,
the Dutch Government and other donors, helped the government set evidence-based policy
directions and provide a framework for coordinating donor assistance in the sector.
- IDA contributed US$10 million for the Health Investment Fund Project (total cost US$22.6
million) and US$5.5 million for a separate AIDS Control Project.
- Both projects are supporting the achievement of objectives set by the government of Moldova,
and building on experience of health sector reforms and successful HIV control strategies
throughout the Europe and Central Asia region.
- The health project reinforced other IDA interventions dealing with imbalances in public
expenditures and over capacity.




The initial IDA credit allowed the country to raise additional grant funding to prepare a strategy
which became the basis for the implementation of the National AIDS Program, co-financed by
IDA, the Global Fund to Fight Aids Tuberculosis and Malaria, Sweden, and other sources.
Technical assistance was provided jointly with other donor and technical agencies such as the
World Health Organization (WHO).




The government of Moldova is finalizing a new Health Sector Development Strategy 2007-2017,
continuing on the reform path chosen during the Health Investment Fund project. The state
budget contribution is expected to cover approximately 31 percent of total HIV program costs in
2008-2010.
