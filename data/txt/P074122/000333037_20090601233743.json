the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            governmental leadership/ownership is crucial to the\n            achievement of success in large scale national programs and\n            to ensuring that all available resources both internal and\n            external are maximized. The establishment of well structured\n            and unified coordination mechanisms, particularly where many\n            agencies and sectors are involved is crucial to for\n            successful implementation. Involvement of ministries and\n            sectors other than health is crucial in the successful\n            implementation of activities targeted towards diverse\n            populations e.g. harm reduction and Anti Retroviral (ARV)\n            treatment in the penitentiary system. It is important that\n            treatment services begin to be decentralized so as to\n            decrease the potentially negative impact of travel by\n            patients to centralized treatment location may have on\n            treatment adherence. Continuity in Bank team members working\n            on projects is critical particularly during early project\n            implementation when it is critical to get the project\n            started effectively. It is important that plans for\n            sustaining efforts started under projects are outlined from\n            as early as project preparation, particularly when\n            investments are made in areas that are costly. Planning for\n            maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure is one\n            critical area that is often overlooked."}, "docdt": "2009-04-21T00:00:00Z"}
