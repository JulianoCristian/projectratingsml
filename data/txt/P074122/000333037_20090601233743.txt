                                    F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project development objective was to improve Moldova's health status and assist the country to
achieve its health related Millennium Development Goals (MDG) through reducing mortality, morbidity
and transmission of HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Specifically, the project
was to support Moldova's National Program for Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS/STIs (NPAS)
through:

(i)   scaling up HIV/AIDS/STIs prevention programs targeted at vulnerable and highly vulnerable
      groups (young people, IDUS, CSWs, MSM, etc);
(ii)  strengthening treatment, care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and
(iii) strengthening Moldova's institutional capacity to better respond to HIV/AIDS/STIs in a multi-
      sectoral approach.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

The transition period in Moldova during the 1990s saw a severe deterioration of the economy, with a
significant drop in public expenditures and a marked increase in poverty. The end of that decade saw
signs of economic recovery with a growing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and levelling off of poverty
levels. Despite this, Moldova remained Europe's poorest country with a per capita Gross National Product
(GNP) of US$390 in 2001, representing only a third of its pre-transition level. The country was also left
with a high debt level and 55 per cent of its population living on less than US$2 per day.

Public expenditures on health decreased by over 75 percent between 1990 and 1999, with central budget
health allocations at only US$10 per capita in 2000, and private expenditures on health averaging the
same amount. This significantly affected the poor's ability to access health services, resulting in poor
households utilizing primary health care services 40 percent less than the non-poor population. The
emphasis on curative hospital services, with more than 70 percent of public funds being spent on tertiary
care, meant that minimal amounts were spent on primary care and public health services. This combined
with poorly paid staff, use of outdated practice methods and lack of evidence-based care protocols,
resulted in the provision of poor quality health services.

Not surprisingly, Moldova experienced a drastic decline in the health status of its population for much of
the 1990s. Life expectancy dropped from 68.64 years in 1990 to 67.75 years in 2000 with adult mortality
rates exceeding pre-transition levels. Infant mortality rates (IMR) and maternal mortality ratio (MMR)
also rose during the early years of the transition. Despite subsequent gains in infant and maternal
mortality beginning in the mid-1990s, the country's health indicators were still worse off compared to
countries with similar levels of GDP. Additionally, there was a dramatic increase in the incidence of
Tuberculosis (TB), particularly among the prison population which rose to more than 300 new cases per
year. During the same time, HIV/AIDS prevalence escalated sharply. HIV prevalence which was at
negligible levels (<0.001 percent) prior to the mid-1990's, increased to 0.2 percent among adults aged 15
to 49 years by the end of 2001.The main transmission mode was Injecting Drug Use (IDU), which
accounted for 82 percent of all reported cases at the time. Commercial sex work, trafficking of women
and an unprecedented increase in the incidence of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), particularly
syphilis, also contributed to the rise in HIV infections. Syphilis infections grew from 7.1 to 200.1 per
100,000 in 1989 and 1999 respectively. Epidemiological projections in the year 2000 indicated that in the
absence of effective interventions, HIV/AIDS prevalence would reach 1.9 percent by the year 2011.

Given these challenges, the Government of Moldova in 2001, developed and adopted the second National
Program for the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS/TB and STIs (2001-2005). Additionally, the
Government's Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) for 2002-2004
identified the prevention of poverty through disabling disease as a key priority area. The Moldova AIDS
Control Project was, therefore, a crucial part in the achievement of overall national strategic objectives.
Although the project was expected to be approved in Fiscal Year (FY) 2004, and was therefore, not
included in the Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) dated May 24, 2002 (covering the
period 2002-2003), it was consistent with the 1999 CAS that identified the need to reverse declining
health indicators and the improvement of human development as a key development priority for Moldova.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the Moldova AIDS Control Project was to "improve Moldova's health status and assist
the country to achieve its health related Millennium Development Goals (MDG) through reducing
mortality, morbidity, and transmission of HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
Tuberculosis (TB)".

The project's specific objectives were to support Moldova's National Program for Prevention and Control
of HIV/AIDS/STI (NPAS) through:

(a)     Scaling up HIV/AIDS/STI prevention programs targeted at vulnerable and highly vulnerable
        groups (young people, IDUS, CSWs, MSM, etc);
(b)     Strengthening treatment, care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and
(c)     Strengthening Moldova's institutional capacity to better respond to HIV/AIDS/STIs in a multi-
        sectoral approach.

Achievement of the PDO was to be measured by the following key indicators as presented in the
supplemental Letter to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).

Outcome (PDO) Indicators

(a)     Reduction of HIV incidence among young adults (15-24 age group);
(b)     25 percent reduction in the growth rate of HIV prevalence among identified intravenous drug
        users (IDU);
(c)     25 percent reduction in syphilis sero-prevalence rate; and
(d)     90 percent reduction in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) (relative to the baseline
        transmission rate per cohort of sero-positive pregnant women);

Intermediate Outcome (IO) Indicators

(a)     Increase in the percentage of young people aged 15 to 24 who both correctly identify ways of
        preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV
        transmission;
(b)     100 percent pregnant women with HIV have access to MTCT interventions;
(c)     60 percent of identified IDU are covered by harm reduction programs;
(d)     60 percent of identified commercial sex workers (CSW) covered by peer education, condom and
        STIs referral;
(e)     60 percent of prisons are covered by a prison health program including HIV/AIDS and STIs
        services;
(f)     Increased number of health facilities offering HIV/AIDS services;
(g)     Number of health professionals trained in HIV/AIDS/STIs;
(h)     Implementation of second generation surveillance system for HIV/AIDS and STIs;
(i)     Strengthened laboratory capacity for HIV/AIDS and STIs; and
(j)     Grant funds disbursed.

1.3     Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

In April 2006 at Mid-Term Review (MTR), some refinements were made to the Results Framework, to
allow more meaningful monitoring of project results. PDO indicators 1 and 4 and intermediate outcome


                                                     2

(IO) indicators number 4 and 10 were modified as presented in Table 1 below. Given the reality of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic patterns in Moldova, the original goal of reducing HIV incidence was changed to
that of stabilising the occurrence of new HIV infections. The target for PDO indicator 1 was previously
undefined and was modified to be more specific. PDO number 4 required revision since the original goal
to reduce MTCT by 90 percent had already been achieved by the project's mid-point. Furthermore
baseline rates of MTCT were unknown during the project's preparation due to a lack of data. Therefore a
transmission rate similar to countries with no interventions to prevent MTCT was assumed i.e.
approximately 30 percent. The modification at MTR, therefore better reflected the existing knowledge on
MTCT trends in Moldova. IO number 4 was modified due to the difficulty in determining a denominator
for the population of Commercial Sex Workers. The new target set for this indicator was same as that for
the GFATM. Similarly, IO number 10 was revised to be more specific, so that it ensured "disbursement
of at least 10 percent of project funds on NGO activities in HIV/AIDS/STI". It was also decided to
disaggregate the indicator data for Moldova and Transnistria and report on these separately due to the
differences in the epidemic trends between the two geographic areas. The reasons for these differences
will be further expounded on in the report.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

The projects' beneficiaries were the entire Moldovan population, with the poorest expected to benefit the
most, since they most often have the highest burden of disease. Project activities were expected to
decrease the burden of HIV/AIDS and STIs in the general population and minimize the related social and
economic costs. This would also decrease the burden on the nation's health system.

Due to the nature of the epidemic, specific priority beneficiaries were to include IDUs, CSWs, young
people, incarcerated persons, patients with STIs and an estimated 5,500 people living with HIV/AIDS and
their families. PLWHA were to benefit from harm reduction, better management for Opportunistic
Infections (OI), palliative care and support and also increased life expectancy and quality of life as a
result of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART).

1.5     Original Components

Project structure: The Moldova AIDS Control Project was part of the overall support provided by
various donors to Moldova's National Program for Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS/STI (NPAS)
and the National Program for TB Control (NPTC). The National Programs were to be supported by IDA
(through the project), USAID, and the GFATM. The financing of the National Program was structured as
follows: a US$5.5 million grant from IDA towards HIV/AIDS activities; a US$4 million grant from
USAID for Tuberculosis Control; a US$11.7 million grant from the GFATM for HIV/AIDS and TB; and
US$0.23 million from the Government. It should be noted that co-financing for the Moldova AIDS
Control Project was provided only by the Government, with the other partners co-financing the overall
National Programs and not the IDA project.

The Moldova AIDS Control Project had four components with a total cost of US$5.73 million.

Component I. Strategic Planning and Institutional Capacity Building for HIV/AIDS and STIs
Control (US$1.53 million total baseline costs). This component aimed to support the following:

·       Policy development: This was to finance activities to enhance Moldova's policy making and
        planning capacity, including support to the Country Coordination Mechanism (CCM) and the
        National HIV/AIDS Program in reviewing HIV/AIDS and STI related legislation and regulations
        and proposing improvements. Selected operation research to provide the evidence base for better
        policies was also to be supported under this component.
·       Surveillance and monitoring and evaluation: Support was to be provided for the implementation
        of a second-generation surveillance system to monitor both HIV infection and risk behaviours
        (particularly among IDUs and other highly vulnerable groups) in order to understand the
        epidemic trends. This included conducting periodic Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Behaviour
        (KAPB) surveys and the introduction of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the
        National HIV/AIDS and STIs Program.
·       Strengthening laboratory capacity for HIV/AIDS and STIs: Activities to be financed included
        laboratory equipment, test kits and training to improve the country's laboratory capacity to enable
        handling of the anticipated increase in HIV/AIDS and STI related testing.
·       Training: This was to finance the training of health care workers in Voluntary Counselling and
        Testing (VCT), Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT), treatment and care of
        HIV/AIDS including HAART protocols and management of STIs. Capacity building for Non-
        governmental organisations (NGOs) in outreach, counselling, peer education and home-based
        care and support was also supported under this.

Component II. Scaling Up prevention Interventions for HIV/AIDS/STIs and STI management
(US$2.06 million total baseline costs). This component included three main areas as follows:

·       Targeted interventions for vulnerable and highly vulnerable groups, mainly young people, IDUs,
        CSWs, Men Having Sex with Men (MSM), prisoners, military and STI clinic attendees.
        Activities under this component aimed to conduct participatory mapping exercises to identify
        these groups of people, including their distribution and informal networks. Targeted prevention
        activities such as peer education, VCT and condoms were to be provided. Improving the quality
        of and access to STI services including provision of client friendly and free services particularly
        to youth and highly vulnerable groups, as well as supporting needle exchange programs,
        counselling and methadone treatment to IDUs were also a core aspect of this component. These
        services were to be provided by 18 NGO sub-projects managed by the Moldova branch of the
        Soros Foundation/Open Society Institute.


                                                     4

·       Mother to Child Transmission interventions: This was aimed at the dissemination of the MTCT
        protocol, support of universal VCT at antenatal clinics and the provision of short course
        Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and infant feeding options to HIV positive pregnant women.
·       Other preventive interventions: Interventions to be supported were national and community level
        Information, Education, Communication (IEC) and awareness campaigns, VCT services and
        social marketing with young people identified as a key target group. Advocacy activities
        involving PLWHA as well as a safe blood initiative to ensure safe blood supplies were also
        supported under this component.

Component III. Treatment, care and support for PLWHA (US$1.36 million total baseline costs).
This component had three areas of focus as outlined below:

·       Management of opportunistic infections (OI) and palliative care: This was to finance the
        dissemination of clinical protocols for the management and care of OIs, including TB, and health
        worker training in implementing these protocols as well as making available a package of basic
        drugs for OI management in clinics for AIDS patients.
·       Provision of HAART: This was to include the provision of free HAART for a small number of
        PLWHA. Funding from the Global Fund against AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), was to be
        used to scale up treatment provision to cover all PLWHA in the country.
·       Home and community-based care and support for PLWHA: This was to include small grants and
        training to NGOs for the provision of home and community based care for PLWHA. It would
        also support the establishment of a social support network for PLWHA.

Component IV. Project Management and Evaluation (US$0.13 million total baseline costs). This
component was to finance and support project management and monitoring and evaluation activities by
the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). Specifically, it included the financing of additional staff with
expertise in HIV/AIDS, STIs, procurement and financial management to complement the already existing
PCU of the Moldova Health Insurance Fund (HIF) project. The PCU was to be responsible for
coordinating the project M&E activities including the baseline, follow-up studies, mid-term review and a
final impact evaluation study.

1.6     Revised Components

The components were not revised during implementation.

1.7     Other significant changes

The project co-financed the Council of Europe Bank (CEB)'s 7.6 million Euro Blood Safety Project
which was approved in 2005. The project provided US$874,079 towards this project, with an additional
US$700,000 funding received from the Moldovan Government. These funds were used to finance the
procurement of laboratory and other equipment for the National Blood Transfusion Centre and for three
regional transfusion centres. Exchange rate fluctuations led to savings in the amount of $640,000 from the
project funds. These and other savings from efficient procurement were allocated for the procurement of
the above mentioned equipment. Savings were also used for the scale up of prevention activities targeted
towards highly vulnerable groups (out of school youth, the unemployed and institutionalized population)
that occurred in 2006 in response to changes in the HIV/AIDS epidemic trends.




                                                     5

In addition, the Loan Agreement was amended as follows:

        Amendment dated August 7, 2006 to increase flexibility in budget management through the
        consolidation of the original six disbursement categories into one disbursement category
        under Schedule 1. The amendment also allowed for the contracting of UN agencies thereby
        increasing the project's flexibility in implementing activities in response to the changing
        nature of the epidemic.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Preparatory analytic work: An extensive analysis of the country and sector needs was carried out in
2000-2001, with a specific focus on the HIV/AIDS situation including epidemiologic projections and
simulations, as well as the challenges to and the sustainability of project activities. A Tuberculosis and
HIV/AIDS Social Assessment was carried out in 2001 and included surveys of a sample of IDUs, patients
at the AIDS Centre, formerly trafficked women and TB patients. This provided contextual information on
the project's target population that was important for the planning of the various activities. Relevant and
practical risk mitigation measures were also identified. The team drew on the Bank's knowledge and
experience in undertaking cross-sectoral work as well as on policy and technical lessons learned in
staging HIV/AIDS responses globally.

Project preparation:      The project was prepared in just over a year, with much of the important
preparatory work occurring between the second half of 2002 and May 2003. Project preparation was
financed in part by the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant from the Government of
Japan approved in December 2002, in the amount of US$370,000. This mostly financed technical
assistance in the following areas: (i) preparation of the TB activities including surveillance system design,
TB laboratory assessment, and design of a TB program; (ii) HIV/AIDS and STIs preparatory work
including review of the legal framework; design of a behavioural surveillance system; laboratory
assessment and holding of stakeholder workshops; and (iii) some Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
operating expenses including hiring of a Project Management Specialist to assist the PCU in developing
management, implementation arrangements and project costing.

This project was a collaborative multi-sectoral effort starting from the design phase. It was overseen by a
group of committees that made up the Country Coordination Mechanism (CCM) with an overall
responsibility for coordinating the implementation of Moldova's NPAS and NPTC. The CCM was
composed of representatives of the TB National Committee, HIV/AIDS and STI Inter-ministerial
Committee and the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS and STIs and was chaired by the Vice Prime
Minister. The Bank team worked closely with UNAIDS, WHO, other UN agencies and The Soros
Foundation/Open Society Institute, in the design and structure of project activities. Project activities were
originally planned to be implemented only in Moldova excluding the autonomous region of Transnistria.

Project design: The project design was very much in line with the development objectives and national
needs, as it was initiated at a time when HIV/AIDS had become an increasing threat to Moldova's
population. The project built on experience gained in implementing some HIV/AIDS activities that had
been initiated under the Moldova HIF Project and through work previously done by NGOs through the
Soros Foundation/Open Society Institute. Furthermore, the Bank team designed the technical aspects of
the project based on globally agreed and proven cost effective interventions such as harm reduction, VCT
and PMTCT. Moldova was one of the first Commonwealth of Independent States countries to initiate a
comprehensive Harm Reduction program targeting IDUs starting in 1997 and it had been recognised as
one of the best programs in the region. However, limited infrastructure and capacity had prevented the

                                                       6

expansion of the program. The project therefore contributed to the scaling up of these harm reduction
activities that had already proven successful. The decision to use a single Project Coordinating Unit
(PCU) to coordinate the IDA and GFATM funded project activities was a positive one. The Ministry of
Health, through the same PCU was also responsible for implementing the Bank's first health operation-
Health Investment Fund Project (HIF) and coordination of HIV/AIDS activities funded by the GFATM
and SIDA.

Lessons reflected in project design: As this was the first HIV/AIDS project in Moldova, the Bank team
drew on important lessons learned from other Bank financed HIV/AID and, STI operations. Two critical
lessons were the importance of early and aggressive prevention interventions targeted towards vulnerable
and highly vulnerable groups in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS and a high level of Government
commitment ensured success of HIV/AIDS programs. Other lessons included: (i) the need to involve
other relevant sectors in the HIV/AIDS response; (ii) inclusion of non-public partners, civic leaders,
patients and their families and high risk groups in implementation of activities; (iii) simultaneous control
of STIs and TB were crucial for the success of HIV/AIDS programs; (iv) presence of a reliable
procurement system for drugs, equipment and other essential supplies; and (v) the importance of a good
surveillance, monitoring and evaluation system for an effective diseases control program.

Overall Quality at Entry: No formal Quality at Entry Review (QER) was done during the project
preparation phase. Despite this, the ex-post review at the ICR stage demonstrates a satisfactory Quality at
Entry for a number of reasons. At the time of the project preparation, the Bank had gained several years
of experience working in Moldova's health sector, through the implementation of the HIF Project. This
provided a good knowledge base and understanding of the working environment, the social and political
issues and also provided the opportunity to establish partnerships with the various agencies involved in
HIV/AIDS activities in Moldova which was crucial for the success of the National AIDS Program
activities.

2.2      Implementation

As mentioned above, this was the second Bank financed health project in Moldova, which together with
the GFATM and USAID provided the bulk of the finances supporting the country's NPAS and NPTC.
The project activities were managed by the Ministry of Health through the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) and implemented by the Republican AIDS Centre, the Republican Dermato-Venereal Dispensary
(DVRD), the National Blood Transfusion Centre and NGOs through the Soros Foundation/Open Society
of Moldova. The CCM with the support of the CCM Secretariat took the lead role in coordinating and
implementing Moldova's multi-sectoral response to the epidemics.               It oversaw the effective
implementation of the NPAS and NPTC by coordinating donor financing for HIV/AIDS/STIs and TB
which ensured a harmonized approach to addressing the epidemics. The CCM was initially chaired by the
Vice-Prime Minister and then later by the Minister of Health starting in 2005. The CCM is comprised of
two levels: the National Council consisting of 22 representatives from various ministries including
Education, Justice and Social Protection, representatives of NGOs and PLWHA and donor, bilateral and
multilateral agencies: the World Bank, WHO, UNAIDS and UNFPA. The lower level is composed of
expert technical working groups on HIV/AIDS, TB and communication, with representatives from
governmental, NGO and civil society organisations. The working groups subsequently also included
members from Transnistria. These implementation arrangements allowed the World Bank and its partner
agencies (GFATM, USAID, and the UN family) to support specific activities and parts of the National
TB/HIV/AIDS & STI Program in a coordinated manner. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed
by the CCM, the Bank and other partners before project effectiveness, which laid out the funding sources
for the NPAS and NPTC as well as the scope of work for each of the donors including the Bank. Grant
effectiveness was, however, slightly delayed due to the need to amend the Grant Agreement to reflect the
GFATM's decision not to be a signatory of the MOU. The CCM was instead designated the signatory,

                                                     7

given that it was the agency responsible for the GFATM funds. This synchronization of activities
prevented duplication of efforts and ensured that all available resources were utilised in as judicious a
manner as possible. The Bank and its other partners therefore, adopted more of a programmatic than a
project approach to the challenge posed by the epidemic.

Project implementation experienced some challenges at the beginning. As mentioned, the CCM had the
responsibility of overseeing the activities of the NPAS and NPTC. The CCM was, however, only
established in March 2002 and as such had little working experience in managing HIV/AIDS activities
and in coordinating multiple donors and stakeholders by the time of the project start in 2003. A number of
measures were taken to correct this. Firstly, the First Deputy Health Minister was given the responsibility
of supervising the Moldova TB/AIDS Program in 2004, while the World Bank chaired the UN Theme
Group on AIDS. This gave the Bank an opportunity to play a more active role in coordinating activities
with donors and also in calling for meetings of the Thematic Group. In addition, UNAIDS and UNICEF
committed to assist the Government and civil society in unifying and strengthening leadership and
coordination of the program. Of importance too was the establishment of the CCM Secretariat in 2004,
comprising three staff members. The Secretariat became responsible for organizing quarterly CCM
meetings, monthly Working Group meetings (where technical matters were discussed and implementation
of activities was coordinated), coordinating activities between the MOH, Ministry of Justice (MOJ),
Ministry of Education (MOE), NGOs, UN agencies and other stakeholders and for dissemination of
relevant information on progress of activities to the CCM members

The second issue faced during the early stages of the project, was the problem of communication and
coordination among the various partners. This was mostly related to uncertainty over which donor agency
should lead the overall international agency response to the HIV/AIDS activities. However, this was
subsequently resolved as the CCM's functioning and coordination abilities became stronger. In addition
to this, Moldova had no experience in dealing with such an epidemic. However the technical strength of
the MOH team made it possible for them to learn by doing, and this minimized the potential risk the
inexperience would otherwise have posed to the project. This was further aided by the support from the
various partner agencies working in HIV/AIDS as well as the high level of Government commitment.
Frequent changes in leadership of the Bank Task Team as well as at the Ministry of Health occurred
during the implementation period, with three ministerial changes and four TTL's in the five years.
Fortunately, these changes in the project team and at the Ministry did not negatively affect project
implementation or the Government's commitment to the project or to intervening in the HIV/AIDS and
TB problem that faced the country.

Project implementation otherwise proceeded smoothly. It should be noted that the successful
implementation of key project activities such as harm reduction for IDUs and expansion of HIV/AIDS
activities within the penitentiary system depended a great deal on (i) the support provided by the Bank's
partners, particularly the UN agencies and the Soros Foundation in the form of continuous policy dialogue
and advocacy, and (ii) the capacity previously built in the NGOs responsible for providing a significant
proportion of services to IDUs and other vulnerable groups. By Mid-Term Review (April 4-12, 2006), the
project had successfully scaled up harm reduction programs among IDUs, prevention programs for high
risk groups and scaled up access to ARV and STI treatment. The project had also succeeded in reducing
MTCT from a rate of 20 percent in 2002 to 1.3 percent in 2006. However, the main mode of transmission
of HIV had also started changing from IDU to heterosexual transmission, which if left unchecked posed a
risk to the achievement of the project objectives. It was, therefore, decided to scale up activities to target
other vulnerable groups such as out-of-school and institutionalized youth and the unemployed. Additional
funds from project savings were allocated to support NGOs working with these groups and to mount
public education campaigns.



                                                      8

A related concern at MTR was the increasing incidence of HIV/AIDS in Moldova (albeit at a lower rate
than other countries in the region) and particularly in Transnistria. As mentioned, project activities were
initially not planned for Transnistria. Despite this, Transnistrian PLWHA still benefited from the project,
as they travelled to Chisinau to receive HAART. At the project's start, Transnistrian legislation did not
permit needle exchange programs or substitution therapy. This situation later changed, with some harm
reduction activities started in 2005. An ARV treatment centre was subsequently also started in 2007, in
the Transnistrian capital Tiraspol with the support of Medicins Sans Frontiers. Given this time lag and the
difference in the scale of HIV/AIDS activities, which affected outcomes, a recommendation was made to
disaggregate the outcome indicators for Moldova and Transnistria. This was done in order to enhance
monitoring of project results and to guide decisions on scaling up of interventions. The need for
increasing the flexibility of managing the project budget was also identified during the MTR. Up to that
point, the grant agreement had six disbursement categories and UN agencies were not eligible as
procurement agents under the terms of the grant agreement. The grant legal agreement was, therefore,
amended on August 7, 2006 consolidating the disbursement categories into one and to allow contracting
of UN agencies for services.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: Progress in project implementation and achievement of outcomes was to be monitored by a total
of 14 indicators outlined in the Grant Agreement Supplemental Letter, dated July 11, 2003 and the PAD
Results Framework. These included four outcome indicators, and 10 intermediate outcome indicators.
The indicators were by and large reasonable both in terms of the scope and number, measurable and
provided adequate evidence of the progress towards achieving the project objective. At MTR, two
indicators were modified to be more realistic. However, several other improvements could have been
made: (i) the second outcome indicator on HIV prevalence among IDUs, while an appropriate long term
goal for the overall National HIV/AIDS Program, should have been scaled back together with the first
indicator (at MTR) to reflect more realistic targets for the project itself. HIV prevalence would have
required a period longer than the five years of the Bank operation to reverse the direction of observed
baseline levels; (ii) the indicator measuring increase in facilities offering HIV/AIDS services could have
been made more specific to include for instance a specific number of facilities by geographic location or
by areas with a high number of PLWHA; and (iii) regrettably, the Results Framework did not specifically,
(nor was it amended during implementation) include indicators to measure the third specific project
objective on strengthening policy development and planning capacity in the country- a critical part of the
institutional capacity building.

Implementation: As discussed in Section 1.3, during the MTR the Bank team did revise the PDO
indicator number 1 on HIV incidence among young adults to be more specific and to reflect the observed
epidemic trends. PDO indicator number 4 was also revised to reflect the successes achieved with
preventing MTCT as well as the updated state of knowledge on the rates of MTCT in Moldova. Changes
were also made to the target for intermediate outcome indicator 6 so that it measured an "increase in the
number of CSW covered by peer education, condom and STI referral". This was mainly due to the
difficulty in identifying CSWs and estimating the exact number of CSWs working in Moldova.
Intermediate indicator #10 was also revised to more specifically ensure that "at least 10 percent of project
funds were disbursed for NGO activities in HIV/AIDS/STIS. Additionally, after the MTR data reporting
on the project indicators was both combined as well as disaggregated by geographic area; i.e. Moldova
versus Transnistria. HIV/AIDS interventions in Transnistria started two years after those in Moldova
hence the significantly higher incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS and STIs observed in Transnistria.

The Moldovan Government in 2003 endorsed the concept of a "Comprehensive National Monitoring and
Evaluation System" that came out of the preparatory work done for the project. This was an important
step as it led to the establishment of a unified M&E reporting system for all the major internationally

                                                      9

supported HIV/AIDS initiatives in the country. In line with the UNAIDS Three Ones principle, a multi-
stakeholder technical M&E Working Group coordinated by the MOH was established within the
framework of the CCM. A decision of this working group led to the establishment of a specialized M&E
unit at the National Centre of Health Management (NCHM). This unit is staffed by six full time
employees, including public health and IT specialists and medical doctors. Since 2004 the unit has been
responsible for the establishment, strengthening and coordination of the M&E system for HIV/AIDS,
STIs, TB, illicit drugs and family planning. With the support of the Bank project and GFATM, a new
software system (SYMETA) for HIV/AIDS, STI and TB case and treatment reporting was developed.
The requisite hardware including a server, 150 computers, were procured and installed in medical
institutions in all districts in Moldova and specialised Republican institutions as well as in some rayons in
Transnistria.

A second generation surveillance system was also initiated and established in the country with the support
of the project. As a result, periodic Knowledge Attitudes and Practice (KAP) and Behavioural
Surveillance Studies (BSS) have been conducted. For instance, in 2006-2007, the M&E Unit was
involved in the development of a Behavioural and HIV Sentinel Surveillance Study among IDUs, CSWs,
MSM, truck drives and prisoners. The M&E Unit also fielded a similar behavioural survey among young
people, KAP studies among the general population and youth, and standardized key survey questions to
generate core HIV indicators.

Utilization: Very limited data on the magnitude, geographic location and progression of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic existed prior to the start of the project. Also, due to the lack of a second generation HIV/AIDS
surveillance system little was known about the knowledge, attitudes and risk behaviours of vulnerable and
highly vulnerable groups. The project, therefore, contributed significantly to the development of the
national monitoring and evaluation system for HIV/AIDS, TB and STIs. The M&E Unit regularly collects
aggregates and analyses data, produces reports and provides feedback to the stakeholders. It also prepared
Moldova's 2008 Report to UNGASS, which contains up to date information on the state of the epidemic
and responses in the country. Data on the majority of the project monitoring indicators was provided to
the PCU by the specialized M&E unit at the NCHM. Given that the M&E system was not established
solely for the Bank operation, there is a very high likelihood of its future sustainability, since it is the
main source of data on epidemiologic trends in HIV/AIDS, TB and STIs. Additionally, the Government's
continued commitment to addressing these health problems should ensure the continued strengthening of
the system.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Full safeguard and fiduciary compliance were observed during the implementation of the project. Overall
performance with respect to procurement and financial management was considered satisfactory.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Since the Moldova AIDS Control Project financed activities under the NPAS and NPTC, the Government
has taken steps to ensure the sustainability of the overall program. The State budget allocation for
HIV/AIDS activities has steadily increased over the last several years and currently covers 33 percent of
all HIV/AIDS activities. However, given the rapid scale up of HAART which is provided free of charge
to PLWHA, there is the recognition that a sustainable financing mechanism has to be found. The
Government of Moldova applied for US$23 million from Round 8 of the GFATM, and received
preliminary approval of the Grant in October 2008. These funds if granted will be applied towards
alleviating the impact of HIV/AIDS among PLWHA and for strengthening the management and control
of Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Moldova for 2009-2014. Furthermore, it is
anticipated that the National Health Insurance Fund may eventually cover more HIV/AIDS related

services. HIV/AIDS prevention and other activities continue to be supported until 2010 by the Round 6
funds from the GFATM. The World Bank will also continue to support activities for strengthening the
management of Hepatitis B &C in Moldova. This will be through a US$1.3 million Japanese Social
Development Fund (JSDF) grant to be administered through an NGO; the Centre for Health Policy and
Study, which was also involved in the AIDS Control Project. The European Commission (EC) and
USAID will also provide support to the Government in this area. Both Hepatitis B&C are closely linked
with HIV/AIDS, through sharing a common infection route. Furthermore, the clinical effects of hepatitis
are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among HIV infected people.1 In 2006, 8 percent of
Moldovan patients on HAART were co-infected with Hepatitis B and 30 percent with Hepatitis C.2
Given the Bank's continuing support to Moldova's health sector, the Bank will continue to remain
engaged in the area of HIV/AIDS through policy and technical dialogue with the Government and other
partners especially with regard to the financing issues. This is especially important given the large
investments that have been made into infrastructure and laboratory equipment that will require funds for
maintenance to ensure sustained functioning.

3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives, design and implementation of the project were, and still remain, highly relevant and
consistent with the Moldovan Government's commitment to preventing the further spread of HIV/AIDS
as outlined in the NPAS for 2001-2005 and 2006-2010. The project was, and still remains very much in
line with the Bank's country and sectoral assistance strategies, as well as overall global efforts and best
practices aimed at addressing the problem of HIV/AIDS and STIs. The project was designed to support
specific areas of the NPAS in collaboration with local and international partners including the GFATM
and USAID. This structure facilitated effective project implementation, inter-agency collaboration and
allowed optimal use of the available resources in addressing the country's key challenges related to
HIV/AIDS and STIs.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the project development objectives required a strong joint effort from multiple sectors
in the country. Data on the four main outcome indicators suggests that the overall goal of reducing
transmission and mortality of HIV/AIDS and other STIs was to a large extent achieved as shown below in
Table 2. As described in Section 1.3 above, one of the original indicators to measure the PDO was the
reduction of HIV incidence among young people. If achievement of the PDO were to be measured against
this original indicator, then it would not have been attained. However, this indicator was changed in 2006
(as shown in Table 2) to better align it with the reality of the epidemic patterns. As such, although HIV
incidence increased, the rate of increase was maintained at a stable level in Moldova. Given that,
Transnistria was not covered by project activities, HIV incidence there is more than 4 times greater than
in Moldova. This suggests that in the absence of the project and other interventions, a similar or worse
situation would have been observed in Moldova. Importantly, the other four main PDO indicators were
achieved. Specifically, the MTCT reduction is a very significant accomplishment.

     Table 2. Achievement of PDO Indicators
                             PDO Indicator                                                Achievements
     1) To stabilise HIV incidence at 26.5 per 100,000 among young Moldova: HIV incidence remained stable at 14.63 per
     adults (15-24 years age group)                                100,000 in 2007(achieved).
                                                                   Transnistria: HIV incidence 78.6 per 100,000 at project end
                                                                   from 35.43 per 100,000 in 2004.


     2) 25 percent reduction in the growth rate of HIV prevalence  Moldova: Prevalence decreased from 16.0 per 100,000 in
     among identified intravenous drug users (IDU)                 2002 to 8.63 per 100,000 in 2007 (highly achieved).
                                                                   Transnistria: Decreased from 75 per 100,000 in 2004 to
                                                                   50.77 per 100,000 (substantially achieved)
     3) 25 percent reduction in syphilis sero-prevalence rate      Moldova: 94.8 per 100,000 in 2002 to 74.2 per 100,000 in
                                                                   2007- a 21.73% decrease(substantially achieved)
                                                                   Transnistria: N/A

     4) Maintain mother-to-child transmission at under 3% of       Moldova (including Transnistria): Decreased from 20% in
     cohort (MTCT)                                                 2002 to 1.67% in 2007 (highly achieved)


     5) Reduce AIDS Mortality (not original indicator)             Moldova: AIDS Mortality decreased from 17% in 2003 to 7%
                                                                   in 2007 (highly achieved)



Also the expansion of HIV/AIDS/STI treatment availability resulted in universal coverage of PLWHA
with ARV treatment. By the end of the project, approximately 585 PLWHA were on ARV treatment
nationwide, representing about 12 percent of all PLWHA. Furthermore, improvements in the management
of OIs have been made, with an increasing number of PLWHA treated over the last 5 years. Because of
this, survival rates of PLWHA have improved over the last several years, with HIV/AIDS related
mortality decreasing from 17 percent in 2003 to 7 percent in 2007.

A discussion of the project's outcomes against the three specific PDO's is as follows:

PDO 1:        Scaling up HIV/AIDS/STI prevention programs targeted at vulnerable and highly
vulnerable groups (young people, IDUs, CSWs, MSM, etc) (Rating: Satisfactory)

The project successfully reached this development objective. The intermediate outcome indicators
measuring the achievement of this PDO for the target population groups are presented below. Activities
carried out in support of this PDO are presented in Annex 2.

·        IO 1: Increase in the percentage of young people aged 15 to 24 who both correctly identify ways
         of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV
         transmission (achieved)
·        IO 3: 60 percent of identified IDUs are covered by harm reduction programs (achieved-target
         surpassed)
·        IO 4: 60 percent of identified commercial sex workers are covered by peer education and STI
         referral (achieved)
·        IO 5: 60 percent of prisons are covered by a prison health program including HIV/AIDS and STIs
         services (achieved)




                                                                 12

Vulnerable and Highly Vulnerable Groups

IDUs and Prisoners: Harm Reduction programs as well as other preventive activities for IDUs were
scaled up dramatically under the project. This happened through activities run by both Governmental
Organisations and to a large extent by NGOs. During the project, the Soros Foundation managed up to 19
NGO sub-projects targeted towards IDUs. However, this was later decreased and by the end of the project
14 Harm Reduction projects were being implemented. The package of services provided through these
projects included peer education, needle exchange, condom distribution, information and education,
counselling and referral to health services. The number of IDUs covered by harm reduction activities
increased from 1,044 in 2003 to 12,194 by the end of the project. The project's target of covering 60
percent of IDUs with harm reduction programs was far surpassed, as the project covered more IDUs than
the 11,160 officially registered.

All of Moldova's prisons were fully covered with HIV/AIDS/STIs prevention activities including
provision of IEC materials, VCT and condom distribution. However, it was feasible to run harm reduction
activities in only six out of the 17 penitentiary institutions3. Needle exchange programs through 19 needle
exchange points were run in the prisons and covered approximately 900 inmates. Methadone substitution
was also provided through the Republican Narcological Dispensary and the Department of Penitentiary
Institutions. A 25 percent decrease in HIV prevalence during the project's time-span may not have been a
realistic target. Increased availability of HIV testing services would result in better case detection which
combined with provision of HAART to PLWHA would lead to an initial increase in prevalence. However,
the project's focused interventions for IDUs and other vulnerable groups was a sound public health
approach, which more than likely had a significant impact in controlling and preventing the further spread
of the HIV epidemic within the IDU population and to the general population.

CSW's: Commercial Sex Workers were covered by prevention programs that included peer education,
VCT, information provision, condom distribution and treatment and referral to HIV and STI treatment
services. These programs were run separately and in combination with IDU programs by NGOs managed
by the Soros Foundation. Approximately 957 CSWs were covered through these programs.

Other vulnerable groups (MSM, truck drivers, youth, and migrants): Services were provided to
MSM through one NGO program that ran for the duration of the project. 760 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender people benefited from this program. Several projects were also started in 2005 to implement
HIV/AIDS/STI prevention activities for truck drivers, migrant workers, street children and unemployed
youth and other vulnerable groups. These included peer education, IEC activities, counselling, service
referrals and condom distribution. A total of 7,868 truck drivers were served by these projects over a two
year period. Similar prevention activities were implemented by 6 projects targeting street children and
unemployed youth (6,897 beneficiaries in total). Of note too is the expansion of the Youth Friendly
Health Services, through the establishment of 9 Youth Friendly Health Centres across Moldova. These
were subsequently integrated into the country's network of primary care facilities and funded by the state.
Basic health services, including VCT, counselling, STI treatment and mental and reproductive care were
provided at the Centres. The combination of youth targeted prevention activities resulted in a noticeable
increase in knowledge levels on HIV/AIDS. Information and counselling activities were also provided for
migrant workers at cross border points, airports, and train and bus stations in both Moldova and
Transnistria. Approximately, 8,500 migrants were covered through these activities.




3 Nine out of Moldova's 17 prisons cannot offer harm reduction for the following reasons: 1 is a juvenile facility, 1 is a prison
hospital with rapid patient turnover, 2 are closed, and 5 are short stay holding prisons with high turnover.



                                                                 13

PDO 2: Strengthening treatment, care and support for PLWHA (Highly Satisfactory)
The following are the IO indicators measuring the achievement of this objective:

·        IO 2: 100 percent of pregnant women with HIV have access to MTCT interventions (major
         achievement)
·        IO 6: Increased number of health facilities offering HIV/AIDS services (major achievement)

Outcomes achieved under this PDO include: training of health providers in PMTCT and VCT, universal
access of pregnant women to VCT services, provision of prophylactic ARV treatment to HIV positive
pregnant women and their children and provision of milk formula for replacement feeding for newborns
of HIV positive women. These interventions resulted in the project's biggest achievement; that of the
reduction of the MTCT rate from 20 percent in 2002 to less than 2 percent by 2006. The rate was
subsequently maintained below 2 percent. The women continue to be provided with ARV treatment even
after giving birth.

Moldova was the first country in the ECA region where antiretroviral treatment was made accessible to
all eligible patients with HIV infection. This is very significant as it is almost a unique situation for a
lower income country to have achieved the universal access treatment goals. The national protocol of
antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS patients was updated according to WHO guidelines. Effective
coordination between the Government and international partners, the National AIDS Program ensured a
systematic supply of high quality ARV drugs. The procurement of generic drugs substantially decreased
the cost of treatment for one patient per year and enabled the program to put on treatment about four
times more patients than initially planned. ARV treatment is currently provided free of charge with no
wait-listing (includes prison inmates and Transnistria). In Moldova, treatment is provided through the
DVRD in Chisinau and the Pruncul Prison Hospital, since 2003. Treatment facilities became available in
Transnistria with the support of Medicins Sans Frontier starting in 2007, and by the end of the project
there were 3 additional facilities. Prior to the project, only 6 people were on ARV treatment. During the
project's lifetime a total of 724 adults including 26 children started treatment, and as of the ICR mission
in October 2008, 585 people were on ARV treatment. The provision of ARV treatment will not only
decrease mortality among AIDS patients, but will also slow the progression to full blown AIDS if ARV
treatment is started early enough.

PDO 3: Strengthening Moldova's institutional capacity to better respond to HIV/AIDS/STIs in a
multi-sectoral approach (Rating: Satisfactory)

The IO indicators measuring the achievement of this PDO are as follows:

IO 7: Number of health professionals trained in HIV/AIDS/STIs (achieved)
IO 8: Implementation of second generation surveillance system for HIV/AIDS and STIs (achieved)
IO 9: Strengthened laboratory capacity for HIV/AIDS and STIs (achieved)
IO 10: At least 10 percent of project HIV/AIDS funding disbursed for NGOs activities in HIV/AIDS/STIs
(highly achieved)

The indicators above were all achieved and additional information on the specific achievements in
strengthening the country's response to HIV/AIDS is provided in Annex 2. It is evident that building the
capacity of Moldovan institutions at both the policy and planning as well as service delivery levels was an
important aim of this project, which was successfully achieved. Although a corresponding indicator for
strategic planning was not originally specified, the ICR author deemed it necessary to assess this aspect
against the following indictor: Strengthening functions of the CCM. The achievements under this are
discussed below.


                                                      14

CCM: One of the most critical factors of success achieved within the National AIDS Program was the
functional CCM which played a leading role in coordinating and implementing the country's
multisectoral response to the epidemic. This achievment was partly because of the contribution by the
IDA Grant, but also the effective agreements between major stakeholder where the World Bank also
played an essential role. The project supported the establishment of the CCM Secretariat which provided
critical support to and coordination of the CCM and its various Working Groups. The Working Groups
contributed to the development of HIV/AIDS/STI/TB related policy directions, which were presented to
the National Council. This in turn contributed to the revision, passing and updating of several laws,
regulations and normative frameoworks related to HIV/AIDS during the project's implementation period
(comprehensive list provided in Annex 2). Improvement of HIV diagnostic laboratory capacities was also
achieved, through the procurement of microscopes and other equipment, ELISA, CD4/CD8 and Western
blot testing kits.

Institutional Capacity: Several training programs for health care workers were held covering the
following aspects: VCT, MTCT, HAART treatment protocols and care of PLWHA. NGO capacity
building was also supported through training on home based care and support, peer education and
outreach provided by the Soros Foundation. A network of 28 NGOs implementing harm reduction
projects-the Harm Reduction Network was established in order to develop the institutional capacity and
sustainability of organizations working in this area. The project further supported crucial subcomponents
of institutional capacities such as supporting the extension of network of Clearing House, set up of the
Comprehensive National Monitoring and Evaluation System with strong HIV epidemiological
surveillance and programmatic monitoring, and training of staff. The establishment of an effective
National Monitoring and Evaluation System enabled the regular compilation and analysis of main project
indicators. Approximately 33 percent of HIV/AIDS funding went towards activities carried out by NGOs
in HIV/AIDS and STIs. A total of 33 NGO sub-projects for harm reduction, prevention, care and support
were managed by the Soros Foundation. Finally, the capacity built in the PCU in terms of procurement,
financial management as well as the technical knowledge of managing an HIV/AIDS project is a great
asset. The PCU was not only responsible for simultaneously managing the Bank financed project but now
continues to be the implementing agency for the GFATM grants, and the Council of the European Bank's
Blood Safety Project.

Summary of Outcomes: The project achieved its development objectives in a highly satisfactory way as
evidenced by the achievement of the targets outlined in results framework's outcome indicators. The
stellar success of certain aspects of the project such as reduction of MTCT, universal ARV treatment
access, and the contribution towards the establishment of effective inter-agency and inter-sectoral
collaboration in the implementation not only of this project but of the country's entire National
HIV/AIDS/STI and TB programs is a remarkable achievement. Additionally, the project was by and large
well coordinated by the PCU and maintained a satisfactory status from start to finish with no period in
which it was considered an at risk project. Finally the project is the first of four HIV/AIDS projects in the
ECA region and is one of the two projects which have been successfully implemented. As such, it offers
valuable lessons to other countries and to the Bank's future operations in this area.

3.3      Efficiency

Since the project was supporting the overall National TB/AIDS Program in conjunction with the
Government and other partners, importantly the Global Fund, it is difficult to attribute observed benefits
to the project alone. However, given the vast global evidence on the cost-effectiveness of targeted




                                                     15

interventions (e.g. PMTCT and harm reduction) for vulnerable groups4,5,6 this project was clearly highly
cost-effective, particularly given the relatively small investment amount provided by IDA.
In order to quantify the efficiency of the project, an economic and financial analysis was carried out (see
Annex 3 for details). The cost-benefit analysis methodology was used to allow comparability with the
findings in the original PAD. Based on this cost-benefit analysis, prevention interventions prevent HIV
infections, which results in quantifiable benefits of averted productivity losses and savings on hospital
care and treatment of HIV/AIDS related complications. The net present value (NPV) of the project is
estimated to be US$ 40 million (based on a 10 percent discount rate), and the internal rate of return (IRR)
is 199 percent. The realized outcomes show a significant impact of the project since the NPV and IRR are
higher than originally estimated for the intervention (US$ 29 million and 140 percent).

It was further estimated that without the project, Moldova would have a total of 79,000 new HIV cases
between the years 2004 to 2008. The project's main benefit, therefore, would be the reduction of new
HIV cases by approximately 20,000 and the subsequent prevention of deaths and costs of treating those
patients. Starting in 2003, access to ARV treatment was significantly scaled up under the Bank financed
project and GFATM, with treatment expanded from 6 people prior to the project to 585 people including
26 children as of October 2008. By the end of the project, the number of PLWHA in Moldova was
approximately 4,500. In addition, the AIDS deaths growth rate declined between 2004 and 2007 in
contrast to initial projections of AIDS deaths in the without-intervention scenario. AIDS deaths declined
from 17 deaths in 2003 to 7 in 2007. The cumulative deaths averted due to the treatment intervention
between 2003 and 2008 are estimated to be 1,850.

On the basis of these achievements, efficiency is rated as Highly Satisfactory.

3.4       Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The project was timely, with highly relevant PDO's which were overall achieved in a satisfactory manner.
The project succeeded in scaling up HIV/AIDS and STI prevention programs, increased access to
HAART and contributed significantly to strengthening Moldova's policy and strategic responses to the
epidemic. Given this and the high cost-effectiveness of the project, the overall project outcome is rated as
Satisfactory.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

One of the project's intended long-term impacts was to minimise vulnerable peoples' and families risk of
falling into poverty by mitigating the negative socioeconomic consequences associated with HIV/AIDS
and STIs. The project has to a large extent probably contributed to alleviating the impacts of HIV/AIDS
as evidenced by feedback from PLWHA who are receiving HAART and as a result are able to live
relatively health lives and contribute to their families and the wider community.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

Strengthening of country capacity to effectively address the problem of HIV/AIDS and STIs was a critical
part of this project. Capacity development occurred at multiple levels beginning with the national policy
making level down to the level of service delivery. The establishment of the CCM Secretariat was
supported and the necessary resources provided that enabled it to function effectively. This included
furnishing, equipping and hiring of two consultants - a communications advisor and consultant were hired
with the support of the project.      Several important pieces of legislation and regulations related to
HIV/AIDS were developed and passed during the life of the project. Training of laboratory workers along
with the provision of equipment was a significant part of efforts to improve the laboratory networks'
capacity to handle an increased HIV/AIDS and STI testing load. A total of 336 health care workers from
various specialities were also trained in HAART treatment protocols, VCT, syndromic management of
STIs, PMTCT, and treatment and care of PLWHA. An additional 63 specialist health workers were
trained in methods of ensuring patient adherence to ARV treatment. The Soros Foundation played an
instrumental role in building the capacity of NGOs, and was contracted to manage 27 NGO sub-projects
for harm reduction activities and 6 for community based care and support for PLWHA. The Foundation
provided training on outreach, counselling, peer education and home based care and support.

N/A

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

The overall risk to development outcome is rated as low. The prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs, and the
provision of treatment and care to PLWHA remain high on the Government's priority list. The project in
conjunction with the inputs from the Government and other partners has laid a strong technical foundation
for the continued strengthening of activities under the NPAS and NPTC. There have been significant
improvements in the strategy formulation and coordinating role of the MOH through the CCM, and much
needed treatment and services have been initiated and scaled up. Although there is a significant amount of
technical and financial support from international partners, and the Government's own funding for
HIV/AIDS has increased, the challenge of continued increasing state funding over time for the National
TB/AIDS Program remains. The CCM for the National TB/AIDS Program has proven to be technically
strong and has thus far coordinated the various stakeholders and program activities well. Continued
commitments and resource investment by the Government as well as all stakeholders will be crucial to

                                                      17

ensuring that the established system continues to function well in order for the country's strategic
objectives to be met.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory because: (i) the project responded
to a priority concern and the Government's identified need to control HIV/AIDS and STIS; (ii) the project
was consistent with the Bank's CAS and served to contribute to its' objective of reversing the decline in
health indicators in Moldova; (iii) the design of the project with its programmatic and collaborative
approach to implementation and addressing the HIV/AIDS and STI problem; (iv) the soundness of the
technical design and the application of the best practice of the time in addressing HIV/AIDS and STIs;
and finally (v) the thorough epidemiologic and economic analysis upon which the project was based.
Although a few areas of the results framework could have been more effective, the monitoring
arrangements were overall adequate and enabled clear tracking of progress towards achievement of the
PDO.

(b)      Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Quality of supervision is rated as satisfactory. A team of Bank specialists supervised implementation of
project activities regularly, with supervision missions including site visits occurring twice a year at a
minimum. During the course of implementation and at mid-term review issues, and potential risks to
achievement of the PDO were identified and adequate measures taken to address these, including the
revision of some aspects of the results framework and amendment of the Grant Legal Agreement. Project
documentation was also clear and easy to follow. The Bank Task Team Leader changed four times during
the course of the project implementation. However, the preparation phase and initial two years of project
implementation were supervised by one Task Team Leader (TTL), and the following two and a half by
the second TTL. The other two TTL's were responsible for shorter supervision periods. The Bank team

6.      Lessons Learned

General:

·       Governmental leadership/ownership is crucial to the achievement of success in large scale
        national programs and to ensuring that all available resources both internal and external are
        maximised.
 ·      Coordination, management and functional M&E system: The establishment of well structured
        and unified coordination mechanisms, particularly where many agencies and sectors are involved
        is crucial to for successful implementation.
·       Cross-sectoral approach: Involvement of ministries and sectors other than health is crucial in
        the successful implementation of activities targeted towards diverse populations e.g. harm
        reduction and ARV treatment in the penitentiary system.

Project Specific

·      Reliable epidemiological estimates data: The epidemiological estimates related to size of target
       groups (IDUs, CSW, MSM and migrants) need to be periodically updated to enable efficient
       planning of services and evaluation of coverage and change in disease prevalence.
·      Centralization of services: It is important that treatment services begin to be decentralized so as
       to decrease the potentially negative impact of travel by patients to centralized treatment location
       may have on treatment adherence.
·      Changes in the Project management: Continuity in Bank team members working on projects is
       critical particularly during early project implementation when it is critical to get the project
       started effectively.
·      Sustainability: It is important that plans for sustaining efforts started under projects are outlined
       from as early as project preparation, particularly when investments are made in areas that are
       costly. Planning for maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure is one critical area that
       is often overlooked.

Introduction: Moldova has a concentrated low prevalence AIDS epidemic. Although the country's HIV
incidence has been increasing over the last several years, the annual rate of increase has been stable.
Much of the increase in incidence is due to the relatively high number of new infections in Transnistria (a
22.7 percent increase compared to 15.1 percent increase in Moldova). At the end of 2002, the number of
newly reported HIV cases was 198, while in 2007 it was 731. At the start of the project, IDUs and CSWs
were the groups most affected by HIV/AIDS; however this has recently began to change due to the
increasing heterosexual transmission of the disease. The Moldova AIDS Control Project contributed
US$5.5 million to prevention, treatment and strengthening national capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS.

HIV/AIDS affects economic activity in several ways. It leads to decreased productivity, increased
absenteeism of the economic work force and increased turn-over with its associated costs (Haacker, 2004).
Moreover, HIV/AIDS depletes the stock of human capital as skilled workers die prematurely. Social
capital is also eroded especially due to the stigma associated with the disease (Gaffeo, 2003). Furthermore,
increased out-of-pocket expenditures on health care for PLWHA can lead to reduced household savings.

The Economic Impact of HIV Prevention and Treatment in the Moldova AIDS Control Project:
The original total cost of the project was supposed to be US$5.73 with US$5.5 million through an IDA
grant from the World Bank and US$0.23 million through borrower contributions. Of the total US$6.15
million project costs, 28 percent (US$1.72 million) and 22 percent (US$1.33 million) was allocated for
prevention and treatment costs respectively. Additional funds from the GFATM were also used to
support preventive and treatment activities.      The prevention efforts included peer education, VCT,
condoms and referrals to other HIV/AIDS/STI services, and IEC and awareness campaigns. These were
targeted to most at risk groups (IDUs, CSWs, the prison population, the unemployed and youth) as well
as the general population. For comparison purposes with the analysis done in the PAD, the cost benefit
methodology will be used. The original project benefits included reduced hospital stays, lives saved, new
cases and deaths averted, disability avoided, and savings in health costs. A summary of original costs and
benefits is presented in Table 2. The project would have had a net present value (NPV), after investment
and recurrent costs, of US$29.3 million and US$ 2.7 million over ten and five years respectively. This
would produce an internal rate of return (IRR) of 140 percent and 86 percent respectively (with 10
percent discount rate).

This note revises the original cost benefit analysis to determine whether the project achieved its objective
in terms of NPV and IRR by using similar assumptions but with actual HIV indicators over the 2003 and
2008 period. The effectiveness of the project will be made in terms of contribution to the entire national
program effect as opposed to the attribution due to the simultaneous implementation of HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment activities by other donors in Moldova during the project period. Therefore, a
without-intervention scenario and with-intervention scenario will be constructed to assess the
effectiveness of the project.

To maintain consistency with the original cost-benefit analysis, this analysis updates only the parameters
on the original assumptions which could have been affected by the project between 2003 and 2008. Table
3 shows the number of new AIDS cases and AIDS deaths for the without-intervention scenario. In 2008
there were more than 12,000 IDU beneficiaries, with the HIV prevalence among this group at 21 percent.
Similarly a total of 957 CSWs benefited from the project activities, with the estimated HIV prevalence
among them at 11 percent in 2007. The assumptions are:

·       Total IDU beneficiaries over 5 years: 12,194
·       % prevalence among IDU: 21 percent
·       Cases with HIV among IDU: 3,049
·       No. Of needle exchange per day: 1.5
·       Total sex workers to benefit (5 years): 957
·       Prevalence among sex workers: 11 percent
·       No. of potential transmitters: 253
·       HIV+ mothers treated in vertical transmission project: 28
·       Average value of a year of life saved: US$447
·       Discount rate of 10 percent
·       Population growth rate is 0.05 percent irrespective of the impact of AIDS and TB mortality that
        the project might occur
·       Time horizon: 5 years and 10 years.

Based on these changes and the previous assumptions made during the project preparation as presented in
the PAD, the number of new AIDS cases and AIDS deaths would have reached 4,144 and 2,637
respectively in 2008 in the absence of any intervention.

With the intervention, the project had by 2008, contributed to preventing 1,056 AIDS new cases through
the provision of treatment and support to the most high-risk groups and the general population (Table 4).
In total, compared to the without-intervention scenario, the project contributed to averting 7,969 cases of
AIDS between 2003 and 2012, and 2,413 cases between 2003 and 2008. The cumulative deaths averted
due to the intervention between 2003 and 2008 are estimated to be 1,850. This is significantly higher than
originally projected.

Component 1. Strategic Planning & Institutional Capacity Building for HIV/AIDS and STIs
control

Policy

In line with the UN-`Three Ones' principle, the project has been overseen by the Country Coordination
Mechanism (CCM), which has the overall responsibility for coordination of the Moldova TB/AIDS
Programme implementation. The CCM was established in March 2002 to act as the project Steering
Committee and to apply for funding to implement the proposed programme. The CCM was chaired by the
Vice Prime-Minister and by the Minister of Health later on, and included a merged TB National
Committee and the HIV/AIDS inter-ministerial Committee, the UN-Theme Group on HIV/AIDS, and
NGOs. The CCM is assisted by a Secretariat that organizes meetings and disseminates relevant
information on the progress of activities to its members. The CCM is responsible for periodic briefing to
the Prime Minister and the Cabinet on project activities. In 2005 the CCM was adjusted to reflect the need
to involve an increased number of actors. The Minister of Health became the Chair of the CCM (The
Country Coordination Mechanism of the National HIV/AIDS/STI Prophylaxis and Control and TB
Control and Prophylaxis Programmes was approved through the Government Decision nr. 825, from the
3rd of August 2005) (Annex 1). The CCM plays a leading role in coordinating and implementing the
country's multisectoral response to the epidemics since its establishment in 2002 and currently counts 22
members: nine from governmental constituency, five ­ nongovernmental sector, including people living
with HIV, eight ­ donor, multilateral and bilateral development agencies. The CCM aims to contribute to
the effective implementation of the National Program for Prevention of HIV/AIDS and the National
Program on TB Control, acting as a nexus point for coordinating and overseeing donor financing in
support of the national commitment and priorities to fight HIV/AIDS/STIs and TB. CCM has assumed
oversight responsibilities for programs funded by the World Bank, the Global Fund, USAID, Swedish
governments, and UN agencies ensuring harmonized approach towards achieving the national program
goals and Moldova's health-related MDGs. The CCM Secretariat facilities have been equipped and
furnished and CCM Secretariat staff (three persons) has been supported by the program. For the
dissemination and exchange of information among stakeholders involved in program implementation, a
CCM Web-site has been developed and the CCM News Letter has been continuously printed (25 numbers
of CCM News Letters produced by CCM secretariat ­ 15 monthly and 10 quarterly bulletins).

M&E Studies. The program has mapped the HIV/AIDS vulnerable groups, procured and delivered to the
National AIDS Centre and the National Centre of Health Management of MoH Geographic Information
System software. This was addressed in order to present the cartography of infection spread in Moldova,
the place and the prevention activities. The program has supported the elaboration of a National HIV
Surveillance Plan. As a result the AIDS Policy framework has been reviewed and improvements
suggested and guidance on AIDS surveillance has been offered. The activity has been coordinated with
the National AIDS Centre and UNAIDS who have prepared a compilation of existing AIDS legislation,
and with the international consultant working on the concept of the AIDS and TB surveillance system.
The rapid expansion of HAART has changed the role of the serological surveillance. It has also the role
of linking therapy to those who need it. An international expert has been contracted by the program to
assist the country in preparing its plans for serological surveillance. This resulted in a clearer definition of
the objectives of serological surveillance and in optimizing its methods, inputs and outputs. In the
context of increasing TB/HIV coinfection, the Evaluation of DOTS implementation in Republic of
Moldova has been carried by a national expert contracted by the program.

Clearing Houses. The extending of the Clearing Houses Network to peripheral level has been
implemented by the program based on UNICEF concept. The approach to this activity has been changed

                                                      35

and the Clearing Houses (CH) has been established within the Network of 11 Youth Friendly Health
Centers (instead of initially planned Centres for Preventive Medicine) based on cost efficiency and
accessibility reasons. It has been assumed that one will be more willing to visit an YFHC than the Center
of Preventive Medicine. At the same time the visitors of each service (CH or YFHC) could benefit from a
more complex range of services. The 11 Youth Friendly Health Centers have been equipped with
supplementary IT equipment and furniture for the Clearing Houses and the operators have been trained in
computer use.

Surveillance and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

The M&E inception plan, resulting from a consultancy supported by the program in 2003, has endorsed
the concept of a Comprehensive National Monitoring and Evaluation System instead of separate systems
addressing the monitoring need of each major initiative. By the decision of the Working Group on
Monitoring and Evaluation coordinated by the Ministry of Health, a specialized M&E unit was created at
the National Centre of Health Management (NCHM). The National M&E System has been established
based on the mentioned above M&E plan and following the UN-"Three Ones" principal. Since 2004 The
M&E Unit of NCHM is responsible for the establishment, strengthening and coordination of the M&E
System for HIV/AIDS/STI, and Tuberculoses. The program has supported the procurement of equipment,
its maintenance as well as continuous supply of stationery required for the efficient functioning of the
M&E Unit of NCHM. The program supported the implementation of SYMETA - a unified information
system for M&E of the TB, AIDS, and STI Programmes through procurement of IT equipment for
medical institutions from all administrative territories and specialised republican institutions. During Mid
Term Review the necessity of developing the soft for AIDS component of SYMETA has been raised and
requested budget reallocated from savings. The soft has been elaborated and the implementation started in
2008 with data input at the level of AIDS Center. Shortly after, the implementation of SIME AIDS has
been postponed for the second half of year 2008 due to the necessary adjustments of the software
according to the new legislation (related to the confidentiality of data). IT personnel for maintenance of
SYMETA in AIDS Center and Republican Dermato-Venereal Dispensary have been supported. The
program initiated and supported the establishment of the second-generation surveillance in the country.
As part of the second-generation surveillance periodic KAP and BSS studies have been conducted during
lifetime of the program. Two KAP surveys between young people (15-24 years old groups) have been
conducted in 2006 and 2008 aiming at assessing youth knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding
HIV/AIDS. Two HIV/AIDS Behavioural Surveillance and HIV Sentinel Surveillance Studies have been
performed in 2004 and 2007 covering IDUs, CSWs and inmates (in 2007 one additional group ­ MSM
has been covered). At the same time, the program co-financed the study of HIV/AIDS related knowledge,
attitudes and practices of Most at Risk Adolescents (IDUs and adolescents in detention) in the Republic of
Moldova, conducted by UNICEF in 2008.

The epidemiological surveillance of HIV infection has been supported through continuous supply of HIV
tests (basic and alternative) and consumables for ELISA screening for AIDS Center and AIDS
laboratories all over the country. There are 15 laboratories for HIV/AIDS diagnosis set up with sufficient
diagnosis supplies during program implementation. The total number of people completing the testing
and counseling process, including pregnant women is 1,212,484 (1,310,301 tests performed including
PCR tests). The program has managed the contribution of IDA Grant, as part of Government cofinancing,
to the for the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) project aimed at ensuring the Blood Security
in Moldova. Within the co-financing of the AIDS related activities under the Blood Security Programme,
laboratory equipment has been procured for the National Blood Transfusion Center and for 3 regional
Transfusion Centers in Balti, Cahul and Tiraspol. Other equipments (IT equipment, air conditioners,
electrical generators, windows for the laboratory facilities, etc.) have been procured in order to ensure
efficient functioning of blood transfusion laboratories.

Strengthening Laboratory Capacity for HIV/AIDS/STI and STI management:

The Laboratory Capacities for HIV/AIDS and STIs were strengthened. According to EuroHIV1,
compared to the year 2000 - in 2003 Moldova became the country that had the highest increase in the
annual number of tests in the region - 135 percent. Population access to HIV testing certainly increased
the number of known HIV infections and provided early access to antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected
individuals.
The program has increased the capacity of the AIDS services, Blood Transfusion services and the STI
services, at both national and regional levels, by supporting procurement of laboratory equipment,
training involved personnel and supplies of tests and consumables. The program ensured continuous
supply of:

· TPHA tests and Cardiolipin Antigen for MRS reaction for investigation of Syphilis and reactive
    agents for investigations of Chlamydia infection for Dermato-Venereal services (36 laboratories for
    Syphilis and 3 for Chlamydia);
· ELISA tests, tests for Hepatitis B and C, Treponema Pallidum test kits for Blood Transfusion Service
    to assure blood safety of transfusion. A total of 395,914 blood tests for HIV were carried by the blood
    transfusion service;
· Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) supplies and CD4/CD8 reagents for the Republican Dermato-
    Venereal Dispensary to assure follow up of patients,.

The treatment of patients infected with Syphilis has been ensured through continuous procurement of
Penicillin and Retarpen, which were distributed to Republican Dermato-Venereal Dispensary and
dermato-venereal departments throughout the territory, including for pregnant women and children born
from them. A total of 22,731 cases of Syphilis at STI patients have been treated during lifetime of
program. The program ensured systematic supply of condoms for primary prevention of HIV/AIDS and
STI, for general population and vulnerable groups. The distribution has been organized three of charge
through dermato-venereal departments of medical institutions in all administrative territories, Youth
Friendly Health Centers, NGO targeting vulnerable and highly vulnerable groups and within
Communication campaigns targeting youth.

Training

The trainings conducted for health providers in PMTCT, VCT, HAART, treatment and care for PLWHA
and the trainings conducted by Soros Foundation-Moldova (as NGO Facilitator) for service deliverers are
presented further through the components they are related to.

Component 2. Scaling up prevention interventions for HIV/AIDS/STIs and STI management

Targeted interventions for vulnerable and highly vulnerable groups:

The HIV/AIDS/STIs prevention programmes targeted at vulnerable and highly vulnerable groups - young
people, IDUs, CSWs, MSM, truck drivers, migrants unemployed youth, etc. have been scaled up
dramatically over the lifetime of the project. The Soros Foundation-Moldova has been contracted by the
program for the implementation of activities. Soros Foundation managed program activities to be carried
out by NGOs and public services (GOs) to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS among highly vulnerable and
vulnerable groups. There were two major categories of activities:

Targeted Interventions for Highly Vulnerable Groups (IDUs) ­ Harm reduction. IDUs have been
covered through 14 Harm Reduction projects by the end of Program implementation. There were 17

                                                      37

running projects at Mid-Term Review and at one point the maximum number of projects running
simultaneously was 19, implemented by both NGOs and GOs. The services provided through these
projects included peer education, needle exchange, condom distribution, information and education,
counseling and referral to health services. A total of 12,194 IDUs including from prison system ­ 24.39
percent of the estimated number (50,000 ­ WB estimation), data with Transnistria, and 109, 27 percent of
the registered IDUs (11,160), data with Transnistria, have been covered during program implementation
(figure 1).

A total of 8,411,984 syringes have been distributed to the beneficiaries.

                                                                          Figure 1.

The program has relied heavily on NGOs to enhance and complement the capacity of the state in areas
where its direct involvement is likely to be ineffectual, such as prevention interventions targeting
vulnerable and highly vulnerable groups.                                  This approach resulted in a successful and efficient
implementation of preventive interventions. The NGOs have shaped the epidemic (Figure 2).

All 17 Moldova's prisons have been fully covered with HIV/AIDS/STI prevention activities through IEC
materials and condom distribution. Six prisons (35.29 percent or 75 percent from eight feasible prisons to


                                                                             38

introduce HR) have run needle exchange programmes through 19 needle exchange points. The estimated
number of covered detainees is about 900 IDUs. Three substitution therapy projects have been
implemented, two of them in the civil sector, in Chisinau through the Republican Narcological
Dispensary and in Balti through the City Hospital, and one in prison through the Department of
Penitentiary Institutions covering 4 institutions (no. 18 Branesti, no. 15 Cricova, no. 16 Pruncul and no. 7
Rusca). Staff from the Narcology Services in Chisinau and Balti and prisons system has been trained on
treatment of drug use with methadone. A total of 367 IDUs, including 97 detainees, have started treatment
with methadone during lifetime of the project. One project providing psychological and social support to
beneficiaries of substitution treatment with methadone, through self-support groups based on 12 steps
program (Minnesota model), counseling on issues related to drugs and alcohol use, informational
materials, etc.

Targeted Interventions for Vulnerable Groups (CSWs, MSM, truck drivers, migrants, unemployed
youth, etc.). HIV/AIDS/STI prevention activities among sex workers and men having sex with men have
been implemented during the hole lifetime of the program through one project targeting MSM and a
varying number of projects targeting CSWs, including combine projects targeting IDUs and CSWs. These
prevention activities included peer education, information, counseling and referral to health services,
condom distribution and syringe exchange. A total of 957 commercial sex workers and 760 LGBT
benefited from assistance during program implementation.           Since 2005, HIV/AIDS/STI prevention
activities started to be implemented for truck drives, migrants, street children and unemployed youngsters
and other vulnerable groups.        These activities included peer education, information and education
activities, counseling, referrals, distribution of informational materials and condoms, against the approach
of each group of beneficiaries. A total of 7,868 truck drivers and have been covered during two years
through 2 projects. At the same time HIV/AIDS/STI activities have been implemented through 6 projects
to 6897 street children and unemployed youngsters.              Prevention activities targeted at migrants
(information and counseling, distribution of informational materials) have been implemented through 3
projects (including one in Transnistria). The number of beneficiaries covered with HIV/AIDS counseling
is about 8,500. The number of beneficiaries covered with information can only be estimated based on the
number of informational materials distributed in the field mainly through cross border points, airport,
train and bus stations in Moldova (including Transnistria) and Moldovan communities in two main target
countries of Moldovan migrants (Russia and Italy) etc. (about 1,200,000 IEC materials) at border crossing
points, bus and train stations, airport. A total of 2,945,007 condoms and have been distributed to IDUs,
CSWs, LGBT and other vulnerable groups.

Other activities implemented through the NGO Facilitator were procurement of harm reduction goods,
elaboration and printing of informational materials, strengthening NGOs and GOs capacities though a big
number of trainings (on project management, Harm Reduction principals, etc.), ensuring monitoring and
evaluation. Two Behavioral Survey and HIV Sentinel Surveillance have been conducted in 2004 and
2007 covering IDUs, CSWs and inmates. The survey conducted in 2007 covered also one additional
group ­ MSM. The implementation of a Unified Coding of Clients information system has been launched
in 2008. The system will connect the network of NGOs and GOs working with persons from vulnerable
and highly vulnerable group. Within that system every person will be identified by standard formula,
applied in the whole country. The Harm Reduction Network has been established and supported in order
to develop institutional capacity and sustainability of organizations implementing projects based on Harm
Reduction strategy. The network includes 28 NGOs implementing HIV/AIDS prevention activities. Two
Forums (one national and one regional) of NGO`s working in HIV/AIDS and TB control were organized.
Both Forums aimed at sharing experience and strengthening the role of third sector in the prevention and
control of HIV/AIDS/STI and Tuberculosis, identify strengths and weaknesses of NGOs working in the
field, exchanging experience between NGOs. The Regional Forum has been planed during the National
Forum and has included national NGO and NGOs from Central Asia and the Caucasus.

Activities for Youth at Risk. In cooperation with MoH and UNICEF, the program has supported the
extension of Youth Friendly Health Services by establishing 9 Youth Friendly Health Centers (YFHC),
based on the model earlier implemented by UNICEF, and by supporting them for a 18 months period
(May 2005 ­ December 2006) before their integration into the existing network of primary health care
istitutions. The extension of the Youth Friendly Health Service aimed at improving access to health
services for the young and marginalized by promoting healthy growth and development, as well as
addressing the major health threats, that young people face, especially in terms of HIV/AIDS/STIs. Over
the 18 months period the YFHCs distributed 171,947 condoms and 86,528 units of informational
materials.   A total of 24,247 young people have benefited from 46,150 services (basic medical
investigations; information and counselling on a large range of issues like general health, sexual &
reproductive health, VCT, mental health, VCT, substance abuse and referrals to specialized services, etc).
46,570 young people were trained in HIV/AIDS/STIs related issues in 2,415 trainings and a total of 976
young volunteers were trained in methods of peer education. Starting with year 2007 the Youth Friendly
Health Centers have been integrated into the local public health institution as functional subdivision of the
Family Doctors' Centers (ministerial decree no. 533 from December 25, 2006 regarding the organization
of Youth Friendly Health Centers' activities) and are supported by the medical institutions. The capacity
building of YFHCs' service providers have been ensured by UNICEF. The program has printed and
distributed the "National Concept of Youth Friendly Health Services" and the "Volunteer Guide in Youth
Friendly Health Services" developed by the Working Group (Ministry of Health) for the co-ordination of
youth friendly health services extension process. The UNFPA office in the Republic of Moldova has been
contracted by the Programme (with funds from GFATM) to provide HIV/STI-related peer based
education for young people.

MTCT interventions

Prevention of Mother to Child transmission has been insured by the program through training of health
providers in PMTCT and VCT, universal access of pregnant women to Voluntary Counseling and Testing
(VCT), prophylactic ARV treatment for HIV pregnant women and to their children, replacement feeding
milk formula for children born from HIV+ women, etc. The NGO "V.I.S." has been contracted by the
program to run the training courses on prevention of HIV/AIDS transmission from mother to child based
on updated PMTCT protocols, with participation of trainers from the State Medical and Pharmaceutical
University "N. Testemitanu" and experienced clinicians as facilitators. 400 health providers have been
trained on assistance according to PMTCT standards. In order to improve the access to and quality of pre-
and post- HIV test counselling in Moldova in accordance with WHO and UNAIDS recommendations, the
AIDS Foundation East-West has been contracted to strengthen in-country training capacity and improve
the skills of health professionals in Moldova in providing pre-and post-HIV test counselling services
within the health care system. A pool of 16 national trainers has been trained within two TOT on pre- and
post-HIV-test counseling and training methods. 9 co-training (with involvement of trained Moldovan
trainers) have been conducted in the regions covering 180 health professionals involved in pre-and post-
HIV-test counselling, such as family practitioners, infectionists, dermato-venerologists, narcologists and
others. A training manual on VCT has been adapted and developed, 20 copies printed and distributed to
national trainers. A Pre-and post-test counselling manual, developed by AFEW for ECA countries in line
with WHO recommendations and international best practices, was adapted to the local context published
in Romanian (600 copies) and Russian (200 copies) and distributed to final users.

The screening of pregnant women (twice during pregnancy) has been ensured through procurement of
ELISA equipment and continuous supply of HIV tests. A total of 395,722 tests to HIV have been
performed at pregnant women (245,942) and 338 new HIV cases have been diagnosed during program
implementation. During last two years of implementation HIV rapid tests for pregnant women have also
been supplied. The prophylactic ARV treatment (short course) for HIV pregnant women and their
children has been ensured through continuous supply of drugs. 285 HIV positive pregnant women

                                                    40

(including four women that have initiated prophylactic ARV in Transnistria within the Department of
Infectious Immunology of the Republican Tiraspol Hospital with the support of the Organization
"Doctors without Borders") and 281 children have been covered since the start of the programme. All
children born from HIV+ women have been provided with free replacement feeding milk formula (during
12 months) in order to prevent infection spread through breast alimentation from mother to child.

Other preventive interventions

Interventions for General Population. The AIDS Foundation East-West has been contracted for the
implementation of an HIV/AIDS mass-media education campaign (Dance4Life), targeting young people.
15 volunteers for the Dance4Life team have been trained during a five days training based on the TOT
principle for the Dance4Life campaign aimed at decreasing the spread of HIV among young people
through the dissemination of information about ways of HIV/AIDS transmission and promotion of safer
behaviors. One hundred Heart Connection Tours (HCT) have been implemented in schools of Chisinau
and in summer camps during project implementation. Within HCT the Dance4Life team used to present
information about HIV transmission, myths about HIV and AIDS, issues of solidarity with PLWHA. A
total of 3,176 young people have been reached during HCT and the most active 199 most active young
people from these schools have been registered as Agents of Change. Informational and promotional
materials have been elaborated and distributed during HIV prevention activities. Five social events have
been organized including one big Dance4Life concert for young people reaching about 1,300 people and
more than 800 school students. Twelve Act for Life activities were conducted, including HIV prevention
day organized in schools. All the activities and social events organized within this project aimed at
promoting Dance4Life project, providing youth with knowledge on HIV/AIDS, and giving young people
the opportunity to involve in fighting HIV/AIDS. Two AIDS Communication Campaigns addressing
sexual transmission and stigma has been earlier implemented by AFEW with SIDA Sweden financial
support. During the first three years of program implementation interventions were mainly focusing on
targeting IDUs. By the Mid Term (2005) the role of other groups and routes of transmission increased
significantly and the necessity of covering more sexually active young people and displaced populations
with preventive services has been highlighted.

Component 3. Treatment, care and support for PLWHA

Up to date, evidence based treatment; as well as care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWHA) have been made available in an unprecedented manner.

Provision of HAART

Moldova was the first country in the ECA region where HAART was made freely available to all patients
with HIV infection who needed it. Treatment is available for patients from all over the country, including
prisoners. With HAART, AIDS stopped being a fatal disease. The mortality from AIDS dropped
immediately after introduction of HAART. The absolute number of AIDS deaths per year sticks to the
same level as the previous years (figure 3). 28 AIDS deaths have been registered during year 2007.

The national protocol of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS patients has been updated according to
WHO guidelines and the program ensured systematic supply of ARV drugs of assured quality both with
funds from the World Bank and the Global Fund. The procurement of generic drugs decreased
substantially the cost of treatment for one patient per year and enabled the program to put on treatment
about four times more patients than initially planned. A total of 724 persons (606 in Moldova and 118 in
Transnistria) including 26 children (all of them in Moldova) from both civil and prison sector have started
ARV treatment during lifetime of the program. On June 30, 2008, the real number of patients under ARV
treatment is 570 (476 in Moldova and 94 in Transnistria) including 25 children (all in Moldova).
Following the recommendation of World Bank and Global Fund regarding the decentralization and
extension of the ARV to Balti and Transnistria region of Moldova, six teams, three people each (one
physician, one nurse, one social worker) have been trained in "Initiation of HAART" by the WHO/AIHA
Knowledge Hub in Kiev. From the six teams, two were from Chisinau (inpatient, and outpatient), three
from Transnistria (inpatient, outpatient and one for penitentiary system) and one from Balti (outpatient).
In Moldova the ARV treatment is provided by the Dermato-Venereal Dispensary (inpatient) for civilians
(including from Transnistria) and the Department of Penitentiary Institutions through Pruncul Prison
Hospital (inpatient) for detainees. In Transnistria the ARV treatment started to be provided in May 2007
with the support of the Organisation "Doctors without Borders". By the end of the program there were
two outpatient ARV treatment initiation sites in Tiraspol (covering civilians and detainees) and Ribnita,
and one inpatient site in Slobozia. From 2003 to May 2007 patients from Transnistria have started ARV
treatment in the Dermato-Venereal Dispensary (Chisinau).

At Mid-Term the main issue was that activities aimed at making ARV treatment available were not
matched by activities for ensuring adherence to treatment. Without adherence, in the future, one could
expect rapid development and spread of resistance to ARV, and diminishing results from HAART.

Strengthening Antiretroviral Treatment Adherence. The PAS Center has been contracted by the
program to implemented activities aiming at ensuring adherence to ART. Peer to peer counseling has
been provided for PLWHA on ARV treatment. 530 PLWHA have been primarily counseled during the
project and 1,784 repeated counseling sessions have been organized. About 48 percent of all people that
are on ARV treatment have been covered within these interventions. With the support of Republican
Dermato-Venereal Dispensary counseling and social support for patients on ARV treatment has been

provided by reimbursing travel costs of patients on ARV treatment (for patients from regions, including
from Transnistria) traveling to RDVD. A total of 1,378 patients' travel costs have been reimbursed
during the one year project. A TOT training on "Adherence to ARV treatment" has been conducted by
international specialist in order to create local capacities able to ensure high quality trainings for specialist
from the field of ARV treatment. The team of local trainers has also been involved in the development of
a training curriculum on "Adherence to ARV treatment" which has been published in Romanian
(including a CD with the complete Romanian and Russian versions of curricula).                  Based on this
curriculum and a multidisciplinary approach concept for different regions from Moldova, 63 local
specialists from all over the country (infectious disease physicians, medical assistants, psychologists, peer
to peer consultants, social workers, etc.) have been trained through four local trainings.              For the
organization of trainings, counseling sessions and any other activity aiming at increasing adherence to
ARV treatment a training room has been provided by Republican Dermato-Venereal Dispensary. The
facility has been renovated, furnished and equipped by the program.

Management of Opportunistic Infection (OI)

Along with specific antiretroviral treatment opportunistic infections were successfully managed in
PLWHA. The protocol of care for OI has been adjusted according to WHO guidelines and the program
has ensured continuous supply of drugs. A total of 1,820 cases of opportunistic infections at HIV/AIDS
patients have been treated during lifetime of program. A study visit has been organized for specialists
involved in ARV treatment and management of Opportunistic Inspections from both civil and prison
sectors to STI and Infectious Diseases of the NHS of England and Scotland to get familiar with the
organization of ARV service including treatment of OI. A training room has been equipped in RDVD in
order to ensure appropriate conditions for the organization of meeting, working sessions, trainings and
other events for the specialists involved in ARV treatment.

Home and Community-based care and support for PLWHA

The Soros Foundation-Moldova has been contracted by the program for the implementation of this
activity. Home and Community-based care and support for PLWA was supported in Chisinau, Balti,
Tiraspol and Comrat through six NGO-run projects offering home and community based care and support
to PLWA (the maximum number of NGOs supported to provide services to PLWHA was seven).
Assistance has been received by 1,575 PLWHA and members of their families. The program has
supported the integration of palliative care in treatment and care for AIDS patients, by providing to the
ARV Treatment Department of RDVD medical equipment, domestic electrical installation and furniture
for the wards.

PROGRESS MEASURED BY OUTCOME INDICATORS

Reduction of HIV incidence among young adults (15-24 age groups)

The overall incidence in this age group increased from six at baseline in 2002 - to 22.20 per 100.000 in
2007 (14.63 per 100.000 in Moldova without Transnistria, and 78.66 per 100.000 in Transnistria) (Figure
4). The increasing rate of the indicator was 9.8 percent in 2007 compared to 2006 in Moldova without
Transnistria, and 55.3 percent in Transnistria for same period. The dynamic of the indicator appears to
suggest that the project had an important role in stabilizing the transmission of HIV in Moldova without
Transnistria, while in the eastern regions of Moldova (Transnistria), which was only partially covered by
the project activities, the increase rate in substantially high.

The change of the predominant route of HIV transmission in Moldova since 2005 from IDUs
transmission to sexual transmission with spread to the general population mostly affecting young people,
made evident the fact that initial targets were unrealistic.

Reduction in the growth rate of HIV prevalence among identified intravenous drug users (IDU) by
25 percent

The HIV prevalence among identified intravenous drug users is almost at the same rate as at baseline,
16,0 per 1,000 tested at baseline in 2002 compared to 17.35 per 1,000 in 2007 (8.63 per 1,000 in Moldova
and 50.77 per 1,000 in Transnistria). However, timely initiation and scale up of harm reduction projects
for IDUs in Moldova without Transnistria has resulted in stabilization and reduction of prevalence of HIV
(16.0 per 1,000 tested in 2005, 12.10 per 1,000 tested in 2006 and 8.63 per 1.000 tested in 2007) in this
highly vulnerable group. In Transnistria where pragmatic interventions started to be endorsed in late
2005, the trend and the magnitude of HIV prevalence was different (92.0 per 1.000 tested in 2005, 60.74
per 1,000 tested in 2006 and 50.77 per 1,000 tested in 2007) (figure 5). There is a significant decreasing
trend of the HIV prevalence among identified intravenous drug users over the last years. Despite the fact
that the aggregated data for Republic of Moldova including Transnistria (32.1 per 1.000 tested in 2005,
22.21 per 1,000 tested in 2006 and 17.35 per 1,000 tested in 2007) continue to be very different from the
Moldova without Transnistria this trend is common for both Moldova and Transnistria.

The initial target of 25 percent reduction in the growth rate of HIV prevalence among identified
intravenous drug users (IDU) was unrealistic in such a short period of time.

Reduction in syphilis sero-prevalence rate by 25 percent

The incidence of syphilis was very receptive to the programmatic interventions. m Rapid scale up of
coverage with tests for diagnosis and antibiotics for treatment facilitated effective cure being delivered to
large groups of infected patients which reduced the transmission rate. The incidence dropped by 21.73
percent - from 98.8 per 100.000 at baseline to 74.2 per 100.000 in 2007 (data without Transnistria)
(Figure 6). At the same time in 2007 the decrease is smaller if compared to the last years (26.7 percent in
2005 and 30.2 percent in 2006) mostly due to the increasing number of migrants that return home from
abroad (specifically from Russian Federation and other CIS countries) infected.

Reduction by 90 percent of mother-to-child HIV transmission

PMTCT is a success story of the AIDS project and is an achievement with important impact on the
project's policy environment. In Moldova vertical transmission reached its maximum (100 percent)7 in
2003, before the introduction of ARV preventive therapy and substitution of breast-feeding. Early in 2004
the health practitioners were trained in management of cases for reduction of MTCT. Free ARVs and
milk formula were made available to the pregnant sero-positive women, which resulted in an important
decrease of transmission ­ to 13.6 percent (2004). In 2005 the decreasing trend continued toward 9.52
percent and went below the level of 2 percent (1.3 percent in 2006 and 1.67 percent in 2007) (figure 7).
The main issue in relation to MTCT is that the baseline level of transmission was unknown at the time
when the PAD was formulated and the assumption was that it is similar to the one in countries where
neither ARV prevention, nor substitution of breast milk are available ­ at around 30 percent. A 90 percent
reduction would have resulted in a level of 3 percent transmission per cohort which is slightly above the
maximal attainable rate of around 2 percent that is characteristic for countries of Western Europe and
North America where the whole range of interventions are available.

Increase in the percentage of young people aged 15-24 who both correctly identify ways of preventing the
sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission

The project was expected to produce an increase in the percentage of young people aged 15-24 who both
correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major
misconceptions about HIV transmission. A Knowledge Attitude and Practice study performed by




7 Data on actual MTCT rates were difficult to verify during initial project years. Hence decision taken at national level to record
the available data as reported (7 HIV+ infants delivered by 7 HIV+ women resulting in 100% MTCT rate).



                                                               46

UNICEF in 2003 was taken as baseline and compared to two KAP survey performed in 2006 and 2008
with the program support.

On the bases of the KAP Study performed by UNICEF in 2003, the data demonstrated that only 8,3
percent of respondents correctly answered at all (7) questions about ways of transmission and prevention
of HIV/AIDS and STI. At the same time 15,8 percent young people correctly answered at all (5) standard
questions (CORE indicator) about ways of transmission and misconception about HIV/AIDS. Both types
of survey (conducted by UNICEF and conducted by UCIMP) used similar approaches, and used the
UNAIDS CORE questionnaire, except that UNICEF study applied auto-administrated questionnaires in
educational institutions.  The KAPs conducted in 2006 and 2008 are fully comparable in term of
methodology and questionnaires. The data show that in the interval from 2003 to 2006 the percentage of
people who both correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject
major misconceptions about HIV transmission (who correctly answered at 4 from 5 standard questions of
CORE Indicator) increased from 15.8 percent to 26.0 percent. According to the Study done in 2008 there
was registered an increase in the level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS compared to 2006. The difference
between the values of integrated indicator of HIV/AIDS knowledge records an increase by 14.8 percent
(26.0 in 2006 and 40.8 in 2008).

100 percent pregnant women with HIV have access to MTCT interventions.

The output indicator ­ 100 percent access to PMTCT for the pregnant women with HIV was achieved at
the beginning of the project. However, the use of this service is not a function of supply, but of demand,
and the utilization was below 100 percent. In 2007, 92.3 percentof HIV+ pregnant women who delivered
received prophylactic ARVT (36 from 39) or 76.6 percent of diagnosed HIV+ pregnant women (36 from
47) (data without Transnistria).

                      PROGRESS MEASURED BY PROCESS INDICATORS

Increased coverage of HIV/AIDS/STIs interventions among vulnerable and highly vulnerable groups,
especially:

60 percent of identified IDU are covered by harm reduction programs

The coverage of IDU increased substantially the implementation of the program. From 2003 up to the end
of the program implementation the number of IDUs covered with Harm Reduction interventions
increased from 1,044 to 12,194 IDUs. This represents 109.27 percent coverage of the registered IDUs
(11,160) and 34.39 percent of the estimated IDUs (WB estimation ­ 50,000) (data with Transnistria). The
coverage of IDUs increased with 11.68 times during lifetime of the project.

60 percent of identified commercial sex workers (CSW) covered by peer education, condom and
STIs referral

During MTR the indicator's target has been modified as follow: increase the number of identified
commercial sex workers (CSW) covered by peer education, condom and STIs referral. The coverage of
CSW also increased from 307 in 2003 to 957 by the end of program implementation (data without
Transnistria). The covered CSWs refer to street CSWs.

60 percent of prisons are covered by a prison health programme including HIV/AIDS and STIs
services



                                                   47

By the end of program implementation 75.0 percent from feasible prisons (eight) to introduce HR or 35.3
percent of all prisons (6/17) have been covered by Harm Reduction Programs. At the same time 100
percent (17/17) have been fully covered with HIV/AIDS/STI prevention activities through IEC materials
and condom distribution.

Increased number of health facilities offering HIV/AIDS services

The ARV treatment is provided in Moldova by the Dermato-Venereal Dispensary (inpatient) for civilians
(since the end of 2003) and the Department of Penitentiary Institutions through Pruncul Prison Hospital
(inpatient) for detainees (since 2004). In May 2007 the ARV treatment started to be provided in
Transnistria with the support of the Organization "Doctors without Borders". By the end of the program
there were two outpatient ARV treatment initiation sites in Tiraspol (covering civilians and detainees) and
Ribnita, and one inpatient site in Slobozia. Note: The process indicators are presented with more details
through the description of program accomplishment (See Project accomplishments by components).

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV AFTER THE PROJECT

The initial assumptions for modeling the epidemic were that there is no net population growth, and that
the sexually active population is half of the total population of 4.2 million. The model assumed that there
was no migration (which has lead to an underestimation of the rate of increase in HIV) and that the base
estimate was of 12,400 HIV infections at the beginning of 2001. It predicted that in the absence of any
intervention, epidemic prevalence will increase from 600 per 100,000 adults in 2001 to 1900 per 100,000
by the beginning of 2011. The graph below (figure 8) illustrates the predicted prevalence for 2001 ­ 2010
and the registered prevalent cases in 2001 ­ 2008 (6 months).

During the lifetime of the program the HIV incidence continued to increase. During last years the annual
increasing rate has been stable (18.28 percent increase 2007/2006, 15.9 percent increase 2006/2005). In
Moldova without Transnistria the annual increasing rate was less significant than in Transnistria (15.08
increase in Moldova versus 22.69 percent increase in Transnistria in 2007/2006 and 15.48 percent
increase in Moldova versus 16.59 percent in Transnistria in 2006/2005). During 2007 a total of 731
persons were diagnosed HIV positive (from them 412 in Moldova and 319 in Transnistria). In the last 8
years there is a stable increase in the number of newly reported HIV cases (figure 9). Transnistria has a
high share of newly reported HIV cases (43.63 percent in 2007, 42.07 percent in 2006, 41.83 percent in
2005, 37.25 percent in 2004 and 32.28 percent in 2003) though it total population is much less than

Moldova without Transnistria. By the end of 2007 cumulatively there have been reported 4,131 new HIV
cases for both banks of Dniester River, of which about 33 percent have been registered in
2006-2007.

There is also an increase of the incidence of AIDS cases (figure 10). A total of 528 AIDS cases have
been registered by the end of year 2007 (214 AIDS cases were registered in 2007). At the same time, 155
AIDS deaths were reported by end of 2007 (28 from them in 2007).

Most of the HIV infections will have occurred among injecting drug users. In reality the share of
infections among IDUs began to decline in 2003, both due to stabilizing transmission among IDUs and to
the epidemic beginning to spread to the general population (figure 11). The IDUs represent 30.37 percent
of all infected during 2007, compared to 38.18 percent in 2006, 42.77 percent in 2005, 50.1 percent in
2004 and 55.0 percent in 2003. In Moldova, the number of IDUs among all new HIV infected during
2007 represents 22.82 percent compared to 40.12 percent in Transnistria (were interventions targeted at
IDUs started later and have been less intense).

The sexual transmission has increased significantly from 2001 in both relative terms and absolute
numbers (figure 12). There is a stable increasing trend of the rate of this route of transmission among
newly reported HIV cases. Since 2005, the sexual route of transmission has got the majority. It was the
route of transmission for 68.67 percent of HIV cases registered in 2007 (75.7 percent - Moldova and
59.56 percent - Transnistria). Among those, the rate of women reached 55.17 percent in 2007 (53.52
percent in Moldova and 57.89 percent in Transnistria).
