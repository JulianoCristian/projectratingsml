Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
finance 
the 
AIDS 
Component 
of 
the 
Moldova 
TB/AIDS 
Program, 
which 
aims 
at 
improving 
Moldova’s health 
status 
and 
assisting the 
country 
to 
achieve 
its 
health-related 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDG) 
through  reducing  mortality, 
morbidity 
and 
transmission 
of 
HIVIAIDS, 
and 
other sexually transmitted 
infections 
(STIs) 
and 
tuberculosis 
(TB). 
This 
program 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
pieces 
of 
the 
Government‘s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
in 
the 
health 
sector, 
as 
it 
will 
prevent 
further 
groups 
from 
falling 
into 
poverty 
due 
to 
disabling 
diseases. 
Specifically, 
IDA, 
the 
Global 
Fund 
to 
Fight 
AIDS, 
TB 
and 
Malaria 
(GFATM), 
and 
USAID 
would 
support 
Moldova’s 
National 
Program 
for 
Prevention and 
Control 
of 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
(NPAS) 
and 
the 
National 
Program 
for 
TB 
Control 
(NPTC) 
through: 
i) 
scaling 
up 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
prevention 
programs 
targeted  at 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups 
(young 
people, 
IDUS, 
CSWs, 
MSM, 
etc); 
ii) 
strengthening 
treatment,  care 
and 
support 
for 
Persons 
Living 
With 
HN/AIDS 
(PLWHA); 
iii) 
implementing 
DOTS 
strategy 
for 
TB 
control; 
and 
iv) 
strengthening 
Moldova’s institutional 
capacity 
to 
better respond 
to 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs and 
TB 
in 
a 
multi-sectoral 
approach. 
2. 
Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Within 
the 
timespan 
of 
the 
project 
cycle, 
it 
might 
not 
be 
possible 
to 
observe 
the 
improvement 
in 
some 
of 
the  outcome  indicators. 
Therefore, 
emphasis 
would 
be 
placed 
on 
input, 
process 
and 
output 
indicators 
for 
project 
monitoring 
and  outcome  indicators 
for 
baseline, 
mid-term 
and 
end-of-project 
evaluation. 
Outcome 
indicators 
Reduction 
of 
HIV 
incidence 
among 
young 
adults 
(1 
5-24 
age 
group); 
25 
percent 
reduction 
in 
the 
growth 
rate 
of 
HIV 
prevalence 
among 
injecting 
drug 
users 
(IDU); 
25 
percent 
reduction 
in 
syphilis 
sero-prevalence  rate; 
and 
90 
percent 
reduction 
in 
mother-to-child 
HIV 
transmission (relative 
to 
the baseline transmission 
rate per cohort 
of 
seropositive pregnant 
women). 
Output 
indicators 
Increase 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
young 
people 
aged 
15-24 
who both 
correctly 
identify 
ways 
of 
preventing 
the 
sexual 
transmission 
of 
HIV 
and 
who 
reject 
major 
misconceptions 
about 
HIV 
transmission; 
and 
100 percent pregnant 
women 
with 
HIV 
have 
access 
to mother-to-child 
transmission 
(MTCT) 
interventions. 
Process 
indicators 
Increased 
coverage 
of 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
interventions  among 
vulnerable and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups, 
especially: 
60 
percent 
of 
identified 
IDU 
are 
covered 
by 
harm 
reduction 
programs; 
Page  7
60 
percent 
of 
identified 
Commercial 
Sex 
Workers 
(CSW)

by 
a 
prison 
health program 
including 
HIV/AIDS 
and STIs 
services; 
and 
Increased 
number 
of 
health 
facilities 
offering 
HIV/AIDS 
services. 
Input 
indicators 
Number 
of 
health 
professional 
trained 
in 
HIV/AIDS/STIs; 
Implementation 
of 
second 
generation surveillance 
system 
for 
HIV/AIDS

disbursed. 
B. 
Strategic Context 
1. 
Sector-related 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) goal 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document number: 
18896-MD 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS discussion: 
May 
6, 
1999 
This 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
CAS. 
The 
CAS for 
Moldova 
of 
April 
1999 
identifies 
the 
need 
to 
reverse 
the decline 
in 
health indicators 
as 
one 
of 
the 
development 
priorities 
in 
Moldova. 
The 
Bank 
is 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the Government’s 
efforts 
to 
protect 
access 
by 
the 
poor to 
basic 
social 
services, 
including 
health. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
CAS 
highlights 
the 
role 
of 
strengthening 
human and 
institutional 
development 
in 
improving 
effectiveness 
of 
Bank 
assistance. 
It 
considers 
health 
sector 
reform to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
institutional 
reform, 
which 
will 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
long-run 
economic sustainability, 
growth 
and 
social 
well-being. 
Health 
sector 
reform 
is 
being 
supported 
under 
the 
Moldova 
Health 
Investment 
Fund 
Project, 
which 
is 
being 
satisfactorily 
implemented. 
By 
assisting 
the 
country 
to 
reduce 
the 
burden 
of 
disease caused 
by 
HIV/AIDS/STI, 
the 
proposed 
project 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
health 
status 
of 
Moldova’s 
people and mitigate 
the 
negative socioeconomic impacts 
of 
such 
conditions 
in 
the 
country. 
By 
targeting marginalised 
groups 
at 
high 
risk 
as 
well 
as 
the 
poor, 
the 
project 
would 
help 
improve 
health 
equity 
through 
improving 
access 
by 
the 
poor 
to HIV/AIDS/STI 
services. 
This 
project 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
delivered 
in 
FY04, 
and therefore was 
not 
included 
in 
the 
CAS 
Progress 
Report 
of 
May 
24, 
2002, 
which 
covers 2002-2003. 
However, 
as 
project 
preparation 
is 
well 
advanced, 
project 
processing 
is 
being 
advanced 
to 
this 
FY. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
After 
a 
decade 
of 
deteriorating 
economic 
performance, 
Moldova 
has 
shown the 
first 
signs 
of 
recovery 
with 
rising 
GDP 
growth 
and 
leveling 
off 
of 
poverty. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
remains  the 
poorest 
country 
in 
Europe, 
as 
well 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
heavily 
indebted 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
At 
USS390 
in 
2001, 
Moldova’s 
GNP 
per 
capita 
is 
only 
one-third 
of 
the 
pre-transition 
level. 
Poverty 
is 
still 
wide-spread 
with 
55 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
living 
on 
less 
than 
US$2 
per 
day. 
With 
a 
significant 
drop 
in 
GDP 
since 
independence, 
the 
focus 
of 
public 
policy 
has 
been 
more 
on 
restoration 
of 
growth 
rather  than 
on 
protection 
of 
human capital and 
the 
poor. 
Recovering 
health 
status, 
but 
most health 
indicators 
are 
still 
poor. 
The 
first 
years 
of 
the 
transition 
saw 
a 
serious 
deterioration 
in 
Moldova’s 
health 
status. 
Since 
the 
mid 
1990’s, 
Moldova 
has 
made progress 
in 
reversing 
the 
decline 
in 
health 
indicators, 
especially 
in 
life 
expectancy, 
infant 
and 
matemal mortality. 
Nevertheless, 
most 
of 
Moldova’s 
health 
indicators 
still 
lag 
behind 
those 
of 
other 
CIS 
-3- 
Page  8
countries 
or 
countries 
with 
the 
same 
level 
of 
per capita income. 
Adult 
mortality 
rates 
for both 
males 
and 
females 
still 
exceed the pre-transition 
levels. 
Reduced 
access 
for 
the 
poor. 
Private  spending 
is 
now 
estimated 
to 
equal 
or 
exceed 
public 
spending 
(around US$lO/capita). 
However, 
effective 
mechanisms 
to 
protect 
the 
poor 
are 
not 
in 
place 
and 
those 
who 
can 
not pay 
have 
reduced 
access 
to 
health 
care. 
Poor 
households 
are 
utilizing primary 
health 
care 
services 
40 
percent 
less 
often 
than the 
non-poor. 
Insufficient 
and 
inefficient 
use 
of 
public 
resources 
for 
health. 
Between  1990 and 
1999, 
public 
expenditure 
on 
health 
was 
reduced 
by 
more than 
75 
percent 
in 
real 
terms. 
In 
2000, 
the allocation 
for 
health 
from 
the 
central 
budget stood 
at 
only 
US$10 
per 
capita, 
while 
private 
expenditures 
on 
health 
averaged 
another 
US$lO. The 
health 
sector 
is 
heavily 
focused 
on 
curative in-patient 
care, 
which 
accounts 
for 
over 
70 
percent 
of 
public 
spending 
on 
health. 
This, 
coupled 
with 
the 
high 
operating 
and 
maintenance 
costs 
of 
an 
oversized 
hospital 
infrastructure 
(a 
heritage 
of 
the 
Soviet 
times), 
crowd 
out 
primary 
health 
care 
and 
public 
health 
services.  These issues 
are 
being 
addressed 
with 
Bank 
assistance 
under 
the 
Health 
Investment 
Fund 
(HIF) 
Project, 
which 
aims 
at 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
health  financing  and 
management, 
developing 
primary 
health 
care 
and 
emergency 
care, 
reducing 
excess 
capacity 
and 
strengthening 
the 
health 
sector 
institutional 
capacity. 
Significant  downsizing 
occurred 
under 
project 
preparation 
and 
implementation: 
the 
number 
of 
hospitals 
decreased 
from 
305 
to 
65. 
Modernization 
of 
primary 
health 
care 
is 
under 
way. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
the Association 
have 
recently 
agreed 
on 
the 
Chisinau 
Hospital 
Restructuring 
Plan, 
which 
will 
decrease 
the number 
of 
central and 
municipal 
hospitals 
in 
the 
capital 
city 
from 
27 
to 
12 
in 
the 
next 
10 
years

Issues 
in 
human 
resources. 
Low 
salaries 
have resulted 
in 
lack 
of 
motivation, 
low 
incentives, 
corrupt 
business 
practices 
and 
out-bound 
migration 
among 
health 
professionals. 
These 
affect the 
delivery 
of 
quality 
services 
and 
erode 
the 
public's 
confidence 
in 
the health 
sector. 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
The 
HIVIAIDS 
epidemic 
is 
escalating 
after 
a 
period 
of 
very 
low 
prevalence. 
As 
in 
other 
members 
of 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Independent 
States (CIS), 
HIV/AIDS 
was 
simmering 
in 
Moldova 
at 
a 
very 
low 
level 
(prevalence 
less 
than 
0.001 
percent) 
during 
the 
first 
ten 
years 
of 
the 
epidemic 
(1987-1996). 
However, 
from 
the 
mid-1990's 
onward, 
there 
has 
been 
a 
surge 
in 
HIV 
infections. 
HIV/AIDS 
prevalence 
has 
since increased 
by 
more than 25 times 
to 
reach 
0.2 
percent 
among 
adults 
of 
the 
15-49 
age 
group, 
ranking fourth 
in 
the CIS. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
2001, 
the 
number 
of 
PLWHA 
in 
the country 
was 
of 
5,500, 
according 
to  UNAIDS/WHO 
estimates. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
effective 
interventions, 
HIVIALDS 
prevalence 
may 
reach 
1.9 
percent 
by 
the 
beginning 
of 
20 
1 
1, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
1 
and 
Annex 
4: 
Epidemiological 
projections. 
Injecting 
drug 
use 
is 
currently 
the 
main 
mode 
of 
HIV 
transmission. 
Injecting 
drug 
use 
accounts 
for 
82 
percent 
of 
all 
reported 
cases. 
The population 
of 
injecting 
drug 
users 
(IDUs) 
is 
estimated 
at 
50,000 
and 
growing 
by 
30 
percent annually. 
Little 
is 
known 
about 
risk 
behaviors 
of 
this 
group, 
but 
sharing 
of 
needles 
is 
believed 
to 
be 
wide-spread. 
A 
relatively 
large 
number 
of 
HIV-infected 
IDUs 
are 
prisoners. 
According 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Justice, 
the prevalence 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
prisons 
is 
3,600 
per 
100,000, 
However,  transmission 
through 
unsafe sexual 
behaviors 
is 
also 
on 
the 
rise, 
especially among 
young 
people. 
Around 
14 
percent 
of 
the 
reported 
HIV/AIDS 
cases 
are 
due 
to 
sexual contact. 
Coupled 
with 
high 
levels 
of 
STIs 
(syphilis, 
gonorrhea, 
chlamidiasis 
and 
trichomoniasis), 
this 
presents 
a 
significant 
-4-

potential 
for 
change 
in 
the dynamics 
of 
HIV 
infection.

Year 
The 
level 
of 
STIs 
has 
reached 
an 
alarming level 
in 
Moldova. 
In 
the last 
decade, 
there 
was 
unprecedented 
growth 
in 
the number 
of 
syphilis 
cases, 
from 
7.1 
per 
100,000 
in 
1989 
to 
200.1 
per 
100,000 
in 
1999. 
Fifty-three 
percent 
of 
syphilis 
patients 
are 
in 
the 
18-29 
age 
group. 
The number 
of 
new 
cases 
of 
common 
STIs 
is 
estimated 
to be 
around 
239,000 
per 
year. 
This 
high 
level 
of 
STIs further 
facilitates 
infection 
by 
HIV. 
Furthermore,  STIs 
cases 
are severely underreported, 
as 
many 
patients 
and 
providers prefer 
to 
treat 
these 
diseases 
without reporting 
on 
them. 
Other 
risk 
factors 
exist 
for 
escalating 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs. 
Commercial 
sex 
work 
and 
trafficking 
of 
women 
is 
a 
critical 
issue. 
According 
to 
official 
statistics, there 
are 
approximately 
5,200 
CSW 
in 
the 
country, 
which 
is 
acknowledged 
to be 
underestimated. Elsewhere, 
women 
from 
Moldova 
are 
worhng 
in 
the 
commercial 
sex 
industry 
in 
Italy, 
Greece, 
Albania, 
Turkey, 
France, 
the 
former 
Yugoslavia, 
Romania and 
Russia. 
Migration 
is 
now 
a 
growing 
phenomenon 
with 
more 
than 
1 
million 
Moldavian 
citizens 
working 
overseas. 
There 
has 
been 
an 
increase 
in 
the number 
of 
abandoned 
children, 
many 
of 
whom live 
on 
the 
streets 
and 
are 
at 
high 
risk 
of 
sexual 
exploitation 
and 
drug 
addiction. 
Key 
challenges 
in 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
Drug 
trafficking and 
drug 
use, 
especially 
injecting 
drug 
use, 
and 
commercial 
sex 
work 
continue 
to 
increase; 
Young 
people 
are 
becoming 
engaged 
in 
drug 
injecting 
and 
sexual 
risk 
behavior 
in 
very 
high 
numbers, 
putting 
them 
at 
high 
and 
immediate 
risk 
of 
infection; 
Until 
recently, there 
was 
a 
low 
level 
of 
awareness 
among 
decision 
makers 
about 
HIV/AIDS/STIs and 
their potential impact 
on 
the 
society 
and 
economy; 
Stigma and 
discrimination 
against 
PLWHA 
still 
persisted, 
which 
is 
combined 
with 
a 
misconception 
-5- 
Page  10
that 
HIV/AIDS 
only 
hits 
“undesirable”  populations; 
There 
is 
a serious 
shortfall 
in 
public 
funding 
for HIV/AIDS/STIs 
activities. 
The 
total 
estimated 
cost 
for 
the 
national 
5-year 
program 
is 
over 
USSlO 
million, 
of 
which 
the Government 
can 
only 
contribute 
a 
limited 
part; 
A 
second-generation 
surveillance  system 
for 
HIV/AIDS is 
not 
yet 
in 
place, 
and 
very 
limited 
data 
exist about the 
magnitude, 
location, 
and 
progress 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
Little 
is 
known 
about 
knowledge, 
attitudes, 
and 
practices 
of 
the 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Second  generation 
surveillance 
systems 
monitor 
risk 
behaviors, 
using 
them 
to 
wam 
of, 
or 
explain, 
changes 
in 
levels 
of 
infection. 
In 
concentrated 
epidemics 
where 
HIV 
is 
over 
five 
percent 
in 
any sub-population 
at higher 
risk 
of 
infection 
(such 
as 
IDUs, 
CSWs, 
Men 
that 
have 
sex 
with 
men), 
surveillance 
systems 
monitor 
infection 
in 
those 
groups 
and 
pay 
particular 
attention 
to 
behavioral 
links 
between 
members 
of 
those 
groups 
and other vulnerable 
groups; 
and 
The 
infrastructure 
and 
capacity 
to 
provide 
HIV/AIDS/STIs-related 
services 
remain 
limited 
in 
all 
areas 
- 
prevention, 
treatment, 
care 
and 
support. 
The 
Moldova 
Harm 
Reduction 
Project 
targeting 
IDU 
has 
been 
recognized 
as 
one 
of 
the 
best 
in 
the region. 
However, 
its 
scope 
needs 
to 
be 
scaled 
up 
for 
larger 
impact. Other outreach 
programs 
targeting vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable groups such 
as 
young 
people, CSWs, 
prisoners 
and 
street 
children, 
are 
either 
inadequate 
or 
nonexistent. 
Moldova 
has 
a 
high 
burden 
of 
TB. 
The 
TB 
epidemic 
has seen 
constant 
growth 
over 
the last 
decade, 
due 
to 
worsening  economic 
and social conditions 
that 
increase 
susceptibility 
to 
disease 
and 
reduce 
access 
to 
care, 
and 
improper identification 
and 
treatment 
of 
TB 
patients 
as 
well 
as 
a shortage 
of 
effective anti-TB 
drugs. 
According to 
official 
data, 
TB 
incidence  increased 
by 
53 percent 
during 
the 
1990s, 
and 
this 
trend 
has 
accelerated 
even 
more 
in 
the last couple 
of 
years. 
From 
62 
per 
100,000 
in 
1999, 
TB 
incidence 
rose 
to 
82 
per 
100,000 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
the 
year 
2001. 
According 
to 
expert opinion, the 
actual  incidence 
is 
much 
higher, 
around  120 
cases 
per 
100,000 
in 
2001. 
This 
puts 
Moldova 
in 
the 
category 
of 
a 
country 
with 
a 
high 
burden 
of 
TB. 
The 
TB 
mortality 
rate 
has increased 
by 
almost 
4 
times 
between 1990 
and 
2001. 
At 
44 
percent, 
the 
case 
detection rate 
measured 
by 
smear 
microscopy 
remains 
low 
by 
WHO 
standards. 
Prisoners 
are 
the 
most 
important 
high-risk 
group 
with 
a 
TB 
incidence 
around 
6 
percent, 
or 
50 
times 
higher 
than 
the country 
average. 
In 
2001, 
15 
percent 
of 
new 
TB 
cases 
in 
Moldova 
was 
reported 
in 
this 
group. 
If 
interventions 
are 
not 
in 
place, 
the 
TB 
epidemic 
will 
worsen, 
especially 
when 
HIV/AIDS 
becomes 
generalized, 
as 
TB 
is 
the 
most 
common 
opportunistic 
infection 
of 
HIV/AIDS. 
Key 
challenges 
in 
TB 
control 
0 
Poverty and overcrowding 
in 
prisons 
fuel 
the 
epidemic, 
as 
undemourished, 
frequently infected 
prisoners transmit 
TB 
to 
other 
prisoners; 
TB 
control 
activities 
are 
seriously 
under-funded.  Resource 
allocation 
for 
the 
Moldova 
TB 
program 
only 
met 
15 
percent 
of 
its 
needs; 
According 
to an 
evaluation 
by 
WHO 
in 
May 
2000, 
the 
first 
National 
TB 
Control 
Program 
was 
fragmented 
and 
outdated  (new 
Program 
described  below). 
Its 
approach 
to 
TB 
management 
mostly 
relied 
on 
costly long-term 
in-patient 
treatment, 
which 
is 
still 
in 
place 
in 
many 
areas 
of 
the 
country. 
The 
majority 
of 
TB 
cases 
are 
detected 
by 
X-ray 
investigation, 
not 
by 
smear 
microscopy, 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
DOTS 
strategy; 
Critical 
shortages 
of 
drugs, 
non-standardized 
regimens 
and  incomplete 
treatment 
greatly 
compromised 
the  program’s  effectiveness  and 
increased 
the 
risk 
of 
multi-drug 
resistant 
TB 
(MDRTB); 
A 
standardized 
recording  and 
reporting 
system 
that 
allows 
assessment 
of 
individual 
patient 
treatment 
results, 
as 
well 
as 
overall 
coverage 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
TB 
program 
is 
not 
yet 
in 
place; 
The 
linkages between 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
TB 
programs 
remain 
weak; 
and 
-6- 
Page  11
The 
infrastructure 
and 
capacity 
to 
provide 
TB 
services 
is 
inadequate, 
especially 
in 
prison 
health 
facilities. 
Government 
Strategy 
From 
the 
programmatic 
perspective, 
the 
national 
response 
to 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
and 
TB 
in 
Moldova 
has 
not 
been 
adequate, 
to 
a large 
extent 
due 
to 
socioeconomic 
turmoil, 
a 
deteriorating health 
care 
system 
and 
the 
collapse 
of 
social 
safety 
nets 
brought 
on 
as 
the 
nation 
shifts 
to 
a 
market-driven 
economy. 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
these 
problems 
and 
has 
committed 
to 
intensifying 
the 
responses 
to 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
and 
TB. 
The 
Government 
of 
Moldova 
responded 
to 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
epidemic 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
first 
National 
Program 
on 
Prevention  and 
Control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and  STIs 
(1995-2001). 
The 
second 
National 
Program 
was 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government 
in 
June 
2001 
with 
the 
following priority 
strategies: 
Development 
of 
national 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
policy; 
Prevention 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
among 
IDUs; 
Prevention 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
among youth; 
Blood 
safety; 
Promotion 
of 
safe 
sex; 
Prevention 
of 
MTCT; 
Provision 
of 
care 
and 
support 
to 
PLWHA 
and 
their 
families;  and 
Strengthening 
of 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
surveillance. 
The 
Government 
supports 
a 
multisectoral 
approach 
to 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
in 
which 
there 
is 
active 
involvement 
and 
good 
coordination 
between 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Health, 
Education 
and 
Justice, 
NGOs, 
donors 
and 
other partners. 
An 
Inter-Departmental Committee 
has 
been established 
to provide 
high-level 
support 
for 
the 
national 
response. 
UNAIDS, 
Soros 
Foundation 
and, 
more 
recently, 
the 
Moldova 
HIF 
project 
with 
financing 
from 
the 
Dutch 
Government  and 
SIDN 
Sweden, 
have 
provided financial 
and 
technical 
support 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
initial 
prevention 
activities. 
In 
2001, 
the 
Government  adopted 
the 
DOTS 
strategy 
recommended 
by 
WHO 
with 
the 
development 
of 
a 
National 
Program 
of 
Tuberculosis 
Control 
for 
2001-2005 
with 
the 
goal 
to 
reduce 
the 
prevalence 
and 
mortality 
rate 
of 
TB 
by 
the 
year 2005 
through achieving 
(i) 
detection 
of 
70 
percent 
of 
smear-positive 
(infectious) 
patients, 
and 
(ii) 
85 
percent successful treatment 
of 
smear-positive 
TB 
cases. 
Priority 
strategies 
of 
the 
national 
program 
include: 
Standardization 
of 
TB 
case 
definition; 
Implementation 
of 
passive 
case 
detection 
by 
sputum 
smear 
microscopy 
among  symptomatic 
patients; 
Standardization 
of 
treatment 
regimens 
under 
DOTS; 
Establishment 
of 
a 
centralized 
system 
for 
uninterrupted 
supply 
of 
TB 
drugs; 
and 
Establishment 
of 
a 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system. 
TB 
detection and 
treatment, 
formerly 
a 
function 
of 
specialized 
pthisiopneumological 
services, 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
primary 
health 
care 
system. 
Since 
2001, 
the 
new 
strategies  have 
been 
implemented 
in 
three 
regions 
with 
financing 
from 
the 
Moldova 
HIF 
project (Dutch 
and SIDA/Sweden 
co-financing),  and 
with 
the 
support 
of 
WHO, 
which 
has 
been 
providing 
technical 
assistance, 
and the 
WHO/Stop 
TB 
Partnership/Global 
TB 
Drug 
Facility, 
which 
is 
providing 
TB 
drugs 
for 
at 
least 
three 
years 
(2002-2004). 
-7- 
Page  12
In 
2001, 
the Government 
requested 
financial and 
technical 
assistance 
from 
the 
Association 
to 
prepare 
a 
project 
to 
control 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs. 
In 
March 
2002, 
the Government 
established 
a 
Country 
Coordination 
Mechanism 
(GOM, 
NGOs 
and 
UN 
agencies) 
under 
the 
leadership 
of 
the 
Vice 
Prime-Minister, 
which 
has 
applied 
for, 
and been 
awarded, a 
US$ 
5.2 
million 
grant 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
TB 
control 
from 
the 
Global 
Fund 
against 
AIDS, 
TB 
and 
Malaria. 
USAID 
is 
considering 
awarding 
a 
grant 
of 
US$ 
4.0 
million 
over 
4 
years 
for 
control 
of 
TB. 
These 
grants 
would 
co-finance the 
Moldova 
TB/AIDS 
Program. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
The 
proposed 
project 
aims 
to 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
priority 
areas 
identified 
by 
the 
National 
Program 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
and  STIs 
and 
strengthen 
Moldova’s 
national 
capacity 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
epidemics. 
In 
that 
context, 
the projects 
will 
contribute 
to 
addressing 
the 
following 
sector 
issues: 
Identifying 
and 
targeting 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups 
with 
effective 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
interventions. 
The most efficient 
method to 
prevent 
the spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
in 
Moldova’s population 
is 
to 
reduce 
its 
transmission 
among 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
risk 
groups. 
Although 
there 
have been 
various 
efforts to 
target 
vulnerable  and 
highly 
vulnerable  groups 
in 
Moldova, 
the 
intensity 
and 
coverage 
of 
such 
initiatives 
are 
not 
adequate 
to 
ensure a 
significant 
impact 
on 
the epidemic. 
The 
project 
would 
help 
Moldova 
systematically 
map out 
such groups 
(especially 
IDUs, 
CSWs, 
MSMs, 
and 
out-of 
school 
youths), 
identify 
their  social 
networks, 
and 
design 
and 
implement 
effective  interventions 
for 
each 
of 
them. 
The 
project 
would 
put 
special 
emphasis 
on 
intervention 
strategies 
that 
are 
more 
likely 
to  yield 
behavior 
change; 
for 
example, 
peer  education, 
clean 
needle 
exchange, 
condom 
distribution, 
STIs 
management, 
and 
voluntary 
counseling 
and 
testing 
(VCT). 
A 
multi-sectoral 
approach 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs. 
To 
a 
large 
extent, 
HIV/AIDS 
is 
still 
perceived 
as 
a 
health problem 
in 
Moldova 
and 
thus 
the 
fight 
against 
the  epidemic 
is 
seen 
as 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
health 
sector. 
In 
fact, 
it 
is 
a 
complex 
societal 
issue 
requiring 
the 
participation 
of 
different  relevant 
sectors 
for 
an  effective 
response. 
The 
project 
would 
assist 
the 
Government 
in 
mobilizing 
key 
sectors 
and 
partners 
to 
confront 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
a 
focused  multi-sectoral 
approach. 
Relevant 
ministries 
(e.g. 
Justice, 
Education, 
Finance), 
and 
NGOs 
assisted 
by 
UN 
agencies 
and 
the 
Soros 
Foundation, 
have 
taken 
part 
in 
the  design 
of 
project 
activities, 
and 
will 
take 
part 
as 
well 
in 
implementation 
activities. 
Voluntary 
organizations 
would 
be involved 
in 
the implementation, 
as 
they 
are 
often 
more effective 
in 
reaching out 
to 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Providing 
HAART 
as 
well 
as 
other 
treatment, 
care 
and  support 
for 
PLWHA. 
It 
is 
important 
for 
highly 
active  anti-retroviral  therapy 
(HAART) 
to be 
implemented 
with 
the treatment 
of 
opportunistic  infections, 
and 
care 
and 
support 
for 
PLWHA, 
as 
such 
interventions  complement 
one 
another. 
Prevention 
and 
care 
are 
inextricable 
elements 
of 
an effective 
response 
- 
one 
without 
the 
other 
undermines 
the 
chances 
of 
success, 
but 
together 
they 
create 
a 
powerful 
synergy. 
This 
is 
evident 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
voluntary 
counselling and 
testing, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
prevention 
of 
mother-to 
child 
transmission. 
In 
an 
Eastern 
European 
context, 
where the 
HIV 
epidemic 
is 
new 
and 
still 
very 
much 
underground, 
access 
to 
care has 
particular 
importance 
in 
that 
will 
encourage 
and 
empower 
people 
living 
with 
HIV/AIDS 
to 
come 
forward 
as 
spokespersons 
of 
the 
epidemic 
and break 
the barriers 
of 
stigma, 
denial 
and 
discrimination.

Strengthening 
the 
linkages 
between 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
and 
TB 
programs, 
and 
incorporating 
these 
programs 
into 
primary 
health 
care. 
Given 
the 
fact 
that 
HIViAIDS 
and 
TB 
epidemics 
are 
closely 
related, 
the project 
would 
help 
strengthen 
the 
linkages 
between the 
two 
programs 
by 
(i) 
offering 
VCT 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
to 
TB 
patients, 
(ii) 
screening 
for 
TB 
among 
PLWHA, 
(iii) 
improving 
access 
to 
TB 
preventive therapy 
and 
TB 
treatment 
for 
HIV-positive 
patients 
with 
TB; 
and 
(iv) 
offering 
TB 
screening 
and 
DOTS 
in 
connection 
with 
needle exchange programmes. 
A 
prison health program 
integrating 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
TB 
interventions 
would 
be 
established 
to 
target prisoners, 
a 
population 
hard 
hit 
by 
both 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
TB 
epidemics. 
Incorporating 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs 
and 
TB 
services 
into 
primary 
health 
care 
is 
more 
efficient 
than costly 
in-patient 
care, 
and 
it 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
national 
strategies 
in 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs 
and 
TB, 
and 
with 
the 
health 
sector 
reform 
efforts 
that 
are 
underway. 
Improving 
the 
information 
base 
for 
better 
decision-making. 
The 
information 
base 
for 
policy 
makmg 
needs 
to 
be 
improved. 
Due 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
behavioral 
surveillance 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs, 
little 
is 
known 
about 
practices, 
especially 
those 
of 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups. 
Monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
for 
both 
HIVIAIDS 
and 
TB 
programs 
are 
weak. 
For 
this 
reason, 
the project 
would 
support: 
(i) 
implementing 
a 
second-generation 
surveillance 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
the 
M&E 
systems 
of 
the 
national 
programs 
for 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs 
and 
TB; 
(iii) 
upgrading 
the 
information 
system; 
and 
(iv) 
providing 
related technical 
assistance 
to 
meet 
capacity 
building 
needs 
in 
this 
important 
area. 
Reforming 
the 
health 
sector. 
The 
project 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
ongoing 
health 
sector 
reforms 
by 
updating protocols 
of 
care 
that require 
outpatient 
care, 
domiciliary 
activities 
and 
outreach 
activities 
that 
bring 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
from 
a 
strictly clinical 
approach 
to 
the 
public 
health and 
intersectoral 
arena. 
As 
for 
the STIs 
dispensaries,  these 
were 
already 
significantly downsized under 
the 
Moldova 
HLF 
Project. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
further 
contribute 
to 
streamline 
inpatient  STIs 
services 
and  expand  outpatient 
care. 
Furthermore, 
the  project 
is 
expected 
to  include  activities 
that 
contribute 
to 
the 
integration 
of 
TB, 
HIVIAIDS 
and 
STIs 
services. 
Developing 
civil 
society. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
civil 
society 
by 
having 
NGOs 
participating 
in 
project 
design 
and 
implementation.  Specifically,  the 
Soros 
FoundatiodOpen 
Society  Institute, 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
harm 
reduction  activities 
to 
prevent 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs, 
and 
would 
subcontract 
NGOs 
to 
provide 
these services 
at 
the 
community 
level 
to 
vulnerable and 
highly 
vulnerable 
young 
people. 
Reducing 
poverty. 
The 
Government 
has 
prepared the 
Economic 
Growth 
and Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper (EGPRSP) 
for 
2002-2004, 
which 
is 
under 
bank review now. 
This 
project 
is 
one 
of 
the 
key 
pieces 
of 
the 
Government's 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
in 
the health 
sector, 
as 
it 
will 
prevent 
further 
groups 
from 
falling into 
poverty 
due 
to 
disabling 
disease. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health's Sectoral 
Strategy 
for 
enhancing 
Moldova's 
health 
care 
capacity 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the Economic 
Growth 
and 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
identifies 
four 
core principles, 
two 
of 
which 
are 
directly 
addressed 
by 
this 
project: 
(i) 
universal 
accessibility 
to 
medical 
and social 
services, 
and 
(ii) 
social 
equity 
of 
health 
services 
rendered, 
including 
to 
socially 
vulnerable 
individuals and 
groups. 
HIV 
and 
AIDS 
strikes at the 
most 
socially 
and 
economically 
vulnerable 
groups. 
This 
project 
includes 
activities  aimed 
at 
prevention and 
treatment 
among the 
most 
vulnerable 
and 
high 
risk 
groups, 
and 
thus 
enhances 
accessibility and equity. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Sectoral  Strategy 
highlights 
other 
key 
priorities 
which 
the 
project 
addresses, 
including 
improving 
mother and 
child 
health. 
The 
project 
would 
help 
disseminating 
the 
MTCT 
protocol,  support 
universal 
VCT 
in 
pre-natal clinics, 
and 
providing 
HIV-positive 
pregnant 
women 
with 
short 
courses 
of 
ARV 
and 
infant 
feeding 
processes. 
Finally, 
the 
Strategy 
stresses 
the 
importance 
of 
cooperation 
with 
NGOs 
and 
other 
donors 
involved 
in 
socio-medical  protection. 
The 
project 
would 
be heavily 
involved 
in 
these

million) 
Policy. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
activities 
to 
enhance 
Moldova’s 
capacity 
in 
HIViAIDS 
and 
STIs 
policy making 
and 
planning. 
It 
would 
support 
the 
Country Coordination 
Mechanism (CCM) 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
National 
Program 
to review 
legislation 
and 
regulations 
related 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
and 
propose 
improvements. 
Selected 
operational 
research 
would 
be 
supported 
to 
provide 
the 
information 
base 
for 
better 
policies. 
Surveillance 
and 
Monitoring 
and  Evaluation 
(M&E) 
The 
project 
would 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
second-generation 
surveillance 
system 
that 
monitors 
both 
HIV 
infection 
and 
risk 
behaviors  (especially  among 
IDUs 
and  other 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups) 
to 
inform 
the 
trend 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
Periodic 
KAPB 
surveys 
would 
be 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
behavior 
surveillance. 
A 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
system 
for 
the 
National 
Program 
on 
HIViAIDS 
and 
STIs 
would 
be 
put 
in 
place 
with 
quantifiable 
indicators. 
Strengthening 
Laboratory 
Capacity for 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs. 
The 
project 
would 
support the 
improvement 
in 
Moldova’s 
laboratory 
capacity 
to 
handle 
an 
expected 
increase 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
basic 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs-related 
testing 
(e.g., 
VDRL, 
Elisa, 
Westem 
blot, 
CD4 
and 
CD8 
counts) 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
laboratory 
equipment, 
test 
kits 
and training. 
Training. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
training 
for 
health

workers 
(in 
VCT, 
syndromic 
management 
of 
STIs, 
MTCT, 
HAART 
protocol, 
treatment 
and 
care, 
etc). 
It 
would 
also support capacity 
building 
for  NGOs 
and 
provide 
them 
with 
training 
in 
outreach, 
counseling, 
peer 
education, 
and 
-

home-based 
care 
and support. 
B. 
Scaling 
up 
prevention interventions 
for 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
and 
STI 
management 
(US$2.29 
million) 
Targeted 
interventions 
for 
vulnerable 
and 
highly  vulnerable 
groups 
(young 
people, 
especially 
IDUs, 
CSWs, 
MSMs, 
prisoners, 
military 
and 
STIs 
clinic 
attendees). 
The 
project 
would 
first 
identify 
these 
groups, 
their 
distribution 
and 
informal 
networks through 
participatory 
mapping 
exercises. 
It 
would 
then 
target 
them 
with 
prevention 
interventions 
which 
include 
peer 
education, 
VCT, 
condoms 
and referrals 
to 
other 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
services. 
The 
project 
would 
strive 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
STI 
services, 
especially 
for 
youth 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups, 
by 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
STIs 
services, 
making 
them 
free and 
more client-friendly. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
IDUs, 
the 
project 
would 
also support 
provision 
of 
disposable 
needles, 
counseling  and 
methadone treatment. 
Incentives 
would 
be 
provided 
for 
peer 
educators 
and 
other 
service 
providers 
to 
encourage 
them 
in 
reaching vulnerable  and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups. 
The 
Moldova-based 
Soros 
FoundatiodOpen 
Society 
Institute 
would 
manage 
18 
NGO 
subprojects, 
including 
selection, appraisal 
and supervision 
of 
the 
subprojects. 
MTCT 
interventions. 
The 
project 
would 
help 
disseminate 
the 
MTCT 
protocol, 
support 
universal 
VCT 
at 
ante-natal 
clinics,  and 
provide HIV-positive 
pregnant 
women 
with 
short 
courses 
of 
ARV 
and 
infant 
feeding options. 
Other 
preventive interventions. 
The project 
would 
support 
IEC 
and 
awareness 
campaigns 
(at 
the 
national 
and 
community 
levels), 
VCT 
services 
and 
condom 
social 
marketing. 
A 
strong 
emphasis 
would 
be 
laid on 
IEC 
and 
awareness 
campaigns 
for 
youths. 
To 
increase 
the 
support 
base, 
the 
project 
would 
recruit 
strategic partners 
(media, 
celebrities, 
religious 
leaders, 
community 
and 
business 
leaders) 
and 
involve 
them 
in 
IEC 
and 
awareness 
campaigns. 
PLWHA 
would 
also 
be 
mobilized 
in 
advocacy 
activities 
to 
“humanize” 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
issue. 
A 
safe 
blood 
initiative 
would 
be 
supported 
to 
ensure 
a 
safe 
blood 
supply 
and 
rational 
use 
of 
blood. 
C. 
Treatment, 
care 
and support 
for 
PLWHA 
(US$ 
1.51 
million) 
Management 
of 
opportunistic infections 
(01) 
and 
palliative 
care. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
the 
dissemination 
of 
clinical 
protocols 
for 
01 
management 
(including 
TB) 
and 
care, 
training 
of 
health 
workers 
in 
implementing 
such 
protocols. 
It 
would 
also ensure the 
availability 
of 
a 
package 
of 
basic 
drugs 
for 
01 
management 
in 
clinics 
that  deal 
with 
AIDS 
patients. 
A 
possibility 
is 
to 
support 
a specialized 
HIV/AIDS 
clinic. 
Provision 
of 
HAART. 
HAART 
would 
be 
provided 
free 
of 
charge 
for 
PLWHA. 
The 
initiative 
would 
initially 
cover a 
limited 
number 
of 
patients and 
eventually be 
scaled 
up 
under 
additional 
funding 
from 
the 
GFATM 
to 
cover 
all 
PLWHA 
who 
meet 
the 
medical 
criteria 
for 
the 
therapy. 
Home 
and 
community-based 
care 
and 
support 
for 
PLWHA. 
This 
would 
be 
conducted 
in 
partnership 
with 
NGOs. 
Such 
organizations 
would 
be 
given 
grants 
and 
training 
to 
provide 
home 
and 
community-based 
care 
for 
PLWHA. 
A 
hospice 
or half-way 
facility for 
AIDS 
patients 
run 
by 
NGOs 
could 
be 
established. 
A 
social support 
network 
for 
PLWHA 
would 
be 
formed.

3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
proposed project 
would 
ultimately 
benefit 
4.2 
million 
people 
living 
in 
Moldova 
through: 
(i) 
decreasing 
the 
burden 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and STIs 
in 
the 
population; 
and 
(ii) 
reversing the 
associated human, 
social 
and 
economic 
costs. 
The 
poorest 
are 
expected 
to 
benefit most 
from 
the 
project 
as 
they 
often 
have 
the 
highest 
burden 
of 
hsease. 
The 
extra 
burden 
on 
the 
health 
system 
would 
also 
be 
reduced. 
Target  populations 
include: 
(i) 
HIV/AIDS 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups; 
(ii) 
STIs 
patients; 
and 
(iii) 
and 
PLWHA 
and their 
families. 
The 
estimated 
5,500 
PLWHA 
in 
Moldova would 
benefit 
from 
harm 
reduction, 
better 
01 
management, 
palliative 
care 
and 
support, 
and eventually 
from 
HAART, 
which 
would 
prolong and improve 
the 
quality 
of 
their 
lives. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
Country Coordination 
Mechanism. 
The 
project 
would be 
implemented over 
a 
five 
year 
period 
(2004-2008) 
by 
the 
Country 
Coordination Mechanism 
(CCM), 
which 
has 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
coordination 
of 
the 
Moldova 
TB/AIDS 
Program 
implementation. 
The 
CCM 
was established 
in 
March 
2002 
to 
act 
as 
the 
project 
Steering 
Committee 
and apply 
for 
funding 
to 
implement 
the 
proposed 
program. 
The 
CCM 
is 
chaired 
by 
the 
Vice 
Prime-Minister, 
and 
includes 
a 
merged 
TB 
National 
Committee 
and 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
and STIS 
Interministerial 
Committee,  the 
UN-Theme 
Group 
on 
HIVIAIDS 
and 
STIs, 
and 
NGOs. The 
CCM 
is 
assisted 
by 
a 
Secretariat 
that 
organizes 
regular 
meetings 
and 
disseminate 
meeting 
minutes 
by 
its 
members. 
The 
CCM 
is 
responsible 
for 
periodic 
briefing 
to 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
and 
the 
Cabinet 
on 
project 
activities.

Participation. 
Funding 
Agreements 
would 
be 
established 
with 
NGOs 
and other 
services 
implementing 
prevention 
activities 
with 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups 
and 
providing 
home 
and 
community-based 
care 
for 
PLWHA. 
A 
NGO 
Facilitator 
Agreement 
was 
established 
between 
the 
MOH 
and 
the 
Moldova-based 
Soros 
Foundationlopen 
Society 
Institute 
for 
management 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention activities 
with 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups. 
The 
Soros 
Foundation 
would 
manage about 
1 
8 
subprojects, 
including 
selection, appraisal 
and 
supervision 
of 
the subprojects. 
The 
MOH 
would 
manage 
NGO 
subprojects 
to provide 
home 
and 
community-based 
care 
for 
PLWHA. 
Project 
Management. 
The 
Government 
and 
other 
stakeholders  agreed 
that 
the 
Project 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
that 
has  been 
coordinating 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Moldova 
Health 
Investment 
Fund, 
will 
implement 
the 
AIDS 
Control 
Project, 
including 
managing 
most  grant 
funds 
awarded 
for 
control 
of 
TB 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
(GFATM, 
SIDA/Sweden). 
The 
CCM 
decided 
that 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
would 
manage 
school-based 
activities  (teachedstudents 
training 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs and 
production 
of 
textbooks) 
financed 
by 
the 
GFATM 
grant; 
and that the 
Soros 
Foundationlopen 
Society 
Institute 
would 
manage 
the 
harm 
reduction activities 
financed 
by 
the 
IDA 
and 
GFATM 
grants. 
The 
PCU 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
administration 
of 
the 
project, 
procurement, 
financial 
management 
and 
coordination 
with 
related implementing 
agencies 
within 
and 
outside 
the 
MOH 
for 
all 
other 
activities, 
as 
well 
as 
coordinating 
M&E 
efforts 
for 
the 
project. 
In 
addition to 
the 
existing 
staff, 
the 
PCU 
has 
hired 
a 
project 
manager, 
a procurement 
officer, and an 
accountant. 
Annual 
Work 
Planning 
and 
Programming. 
The 
project 
would 
be 
implemented 
following 
an 
annual 
work 
program 
that 
mirrors 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Government’s 
annual 
budget. 
Programming 
would 
be 
based 
on 
results obtained 
in 
the 
prior 
year’s 
work 
schedule, 
the 
further 
refinement 
of 
needs 
assessed 
in 
vulnerable and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups, 
and 
on 
lessons learned. 
Project 
Implementation Plan 
(PIP) 
and 
Project 
Operations 
Manual (POM). 
The 
PCU 
has 
prepared 
the 
PIP 
and 
the 
POM. 
The 
PIP 
contains  the 
detailed implementation 
plan 
and 
timeframe 
for 
each  action. 
The 
POM 
contains  a 
description 
of 
the 
project 
and 
its 
components, 
CCM 
and 
PCU 
organizational  structure  and 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
its 
staff, 
involved 
institutions 
and  organizations, 
procurement methods 
and 
financial 
arrangements. 
Both 
documents 
were 
reviewed 
during 
appraisal, 
and 
final 
drafts 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Association 
are 
a 
condition 
of 
Effectiveness. 
Procurement (Annex 
6). 
A 
Procurement 
Capacity 
Assessment 
was 
carried 
out 
during 
appraisal. 
The 
PCU 
has 
nearly 
two 
years 
of 
experience 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
Association  projects. 
The 
organizational structure 
is 
clear, 
and 
the 
monitoring 
and 
filing 
system 
is 
in 
place, 
although 
the 
PCU 
will 
need 
additional 
staff 
and 
training to 
manage 
the 
new 
project. 
Procurement 
for 
the 
new 
project 
would 
be 
-

Page  18
carried out 
by 
a 
full-time 
PCU 
procurement 
staff 
which 
is 
currently implementing 
the 
Moldova 
HIF 
Project, 
assisted 
by 
a 
new 
procurement 
specialist. 
It 
would 
be 
managed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
annual 
procurement  plans 
that 
correspond 
to 
the annual 
work 
program; 
it 
would 
be 
carried out 
by 
the 
PCU 
according 
to 
the 
Bank’s procurement 
rules, 
and 
supervised 
by 
the 
Bank, 
while 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
Program 
will 
be 
implemented according 
to 
the procurement 
rules 
of 
the 
other 
financing 
institutions 
and supervised 
directly 
by 
them 
or through their 
local 
agents. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
the 
necessary 
foreign technical 
assistance 
and training 
for 
the 
PCU. 
With 
the 
enhanced capacity,  the 
PCU 
will 
act 
as 
manager 
not only 
for 
the 
AIDS 
Control 
Project 
but 
also 
for 
the 
whole 
Program, 
as 
the 
successful 
implementation 
requires 
well-defined  coordination and 
cooperation  among 
the 
participating 
ministries, 
agencies 
and 
financing 
institutions. 
Financial 
Management 
(Annex 
6B). 
As 
mentioned 
before, 
the 
PCU 
is 
successfully 
implementing 
another 
Association-financed 
Project, 
the 
Health 
Investment 
Fund 
Project. 
The 
PCU 
is 
a 
legal 
entity, 
with 
its 
own 
statute established 
by 
Government  Decision, 
and 
reports 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
All 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement  procedures 
would 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
the relevant 
Association 
guidelines. 
The 
PCU 
would 
handle 
IDA 
Grant 
proceeds 
and 
make 
payments 
from 
the Special 
Account 
(SA), 
which 
would be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOEs, 
and 
direct 
payments 
from 
the 
Grant Account 
to 
the 
suppliers 
and 
consultants. 
The 
PCU 
would 
execute 
counterpart payments 
directly 
to 
suppliers 
and 
consultants 
from 
the Government 
contribution 
account 
opened 
at 
the Treasury. 
Monitoring and 
Evaluation. 
The 
PCU 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
carrying 
out periodic 
project 
M&E 
and 
submitting 
reports 
to 
the 
CCM, 
Association and 
donors, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
progress 
report. 
Although 
some 
indicators 
would 
be 
monitored 
by 
other technical entities 
(e.g. 
the 
epidemiological 
unit 
in 
charge 
of 
the surveillance 
system), 
it 
would 
be 
the 
duty 
of 
the 
PCU 
to 
collect 
all 
the 
indicators 
and report 
them 
to 
the 
funding 
agencies. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
1) 
A 
purely health 
sector 
approach. 
Different 
sectors 
such 
as 
justice,  education 
and 
NGOs, 
can 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs. 
Local 
communities 
and 
NGOs 
are 
often 
capable 
of 
understanding 
local 
cultural 
and 
social  contexts 
and 
are 
more 
effective 
in 
reaching 
out to 
vulnerable and 
highly 
vulnerable 
young 
people, 
and 
prisoners. 
Involving 
relevant 
sectors 
and partners 
can 
generate 
greater 
commitment, 
mobilize 
additional 
resources, 
improve 
the 
sustainability 
of 
interventions 
and 
their 
chance 
of 
success. 
For 
this 
reason, 
a 
purely 
health 
sector approach 
was 
rejected 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
multi-sectoral 
approach. 
In 
addition, 
this 
project 
complements  the 
Moldova  Health 
Investment 
Fund 
Project, 
which 
is 
implementing 
major 
health 
sector 
reforms 
such 
as 
shifting 
the balance 
from 
a 
hospital-centered 
system 
to 
a 
primary 
care-based 
system, 
and 
splitting 
the purchaser-provider 
functions. 
2) 
Exclusion 
of 
HAART. 
Reductions 
in 
ARV 
prices 
for Moldova 
were obtained 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Accelerated 
Access 
to 
the 
ARV 
Initiative. 
HAART 
will 
be 
introduced 
into 
the country 
with 
financing 
from 
the 
GFATM 
and 
IDA 
grants. 
It 
will 
help 
to 
prepare 
the 
health 
infrastructure 
(such 
as 
laboratories 
capacity 
and 
pharmacies), 
and 
train 
health 
workers 
for 
larger-scale 
HAART 
implementation 
in 
the 
future, 
if 
necessary. 
3) 
Credit 
vs. 
Grant 
Financing. 
Moldova 
is 
an 
IDA 
country.  However, 
financing this 
-14- 
Page  19
project 
through  a 
Credit 
was 
rejected, 
as 
poverty 
and 
the 
incidence and prevalence 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
Moldova, 
and 
the 
significant externalities 
of 
investments 
on 
HIVIAIDS, 
justify 
awarding 
and 
IDA 
grant 
to 
this 
Project. 
Sector Issue 
2. 
Major 
related 
projects financed 
by 
the 
Bank 
andlor 
other development 
agencies 
(completed, 
ongoing 
and 
planned). 
The 
Moldova 
Health 
Investment 
Fund 
Project 
has 
allocated 
hnding 
from 
the 
Dutch 
and 
SIDNSweden 
TFs 
to 
initiate 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
TB 
activities. 
The 
proposed 
project 
follows 
up 
on 
those 
initial 
activities,  and 
is 
expected 
to 
share 
the 
PCU 
with 
the 
Moldova 
HIF 
Project. 
The 
UNAIDS 
ED 
and 
regional 
directors 
of 
UNAIDS 
cosponsors 
(including 
the

have agreed 
to 
focus 
intensified 
UN

on 
five 
regional 
countries, 
and 
Moldova 
is 
one 
of 
them.

all 
UN

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
other countries. 
These 
include 
the 
following: 
The project 
takes 
into 
account lessons 
in 
HIV/AIDS 
and STIs that have 
proven 
successful 
in 
0 
Early, 
aggressive

is 
the 
- 
15- 
Page  20
most 
effective 
strategy 
to 
prevent the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS; 
High 
commitment to 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
control 
by 
different levels 
of 
the 
Government 
is 
a 
requirement 
for 
success; 
Selected 
relevant 
sectors 
(other 
than 
health) 
need 
to 
be involved 
in 
the 
response 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs; 
Non-public 
partners 
(NGOs), 
high-risk 
groups, 
patients 
and 
their families 
as 
well 
as 
civic 
leaders 
all 
have 
important 
roles 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
HIVIAIDS 
and STIs 
activities; 
There 
are 
strong  linkages 
between 
HN/AIDS, 
STIs 
and 
TB. 
STIs  management 
is 
one 
of 
the 
important 
strategies 
to 
prevent  the 
spread 
of 
AIDS. 
TB 
control 
can 
help 
reduce 
mortality 
among 
PLWHA. 
On 
the  other 
hand, 
prevention 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
can 
contribute 
to 
reducing 
the 
burden 
of 
disease 
caused 
by 
TB; 
A 
good 
procurement 
system 
to 
ensure 
a 
reliable 
supply 
of 
quality 
drugs, 
equipment 
and 
other 
supplies 
is 
essential 
to 
the 
success 
of 
a 
health 
project; 
Incentives 
(including 
social 
support) 
for 
patients and 
providers 
may 
be 
needed, 
especially 
in 
resource 
poor 
settings, 
but 
have 
to be 
designed 
with 
care, 
and 
tested 
to avoid 
perverse 
effects 
and 
plan for 
sustainability; 
and 
Good 
surveillance, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
is 
critical 
to 
a disease 
control 
program. 
Indications 
of 
recipient 
commitment 
and 
ownership 
Comprehensive social 
and 
institutional 
assessments 
for 
the 
national 
response 
to 
HIV/AIDS, 
STIs 
and 
TB 
have been 
conducted. 
Those 
assessments 
identified 
the 
critical 
areas 
where 
interventions 
are 
urgently 
needed 
to 
reverse 
the 
trends 
of 
the 
epidemics; 
The 
Government 
of 
Moldova 
has 
developed 
and 
adopted 
the 
National 
Programs 
on HNIAIDS, 
STIs 
and 
TB 
for 
2001-2005, 
which 
provide 
the 
blueprints 
for confronting 
the epidemics 
in 
the 
next 
five 
years. 
The 
Programs were 
approved 
by 
the highest 
level 
of 
the 
Government; 
The 
Government 
has 
estimated the cost 
for 
the 
above Programs 
and committed 
domestic 
resources 
to 
program 
activities. 
It 
has 
applied 
for 
external 
funding 
to 
cover 
the 
shortfalls, 
including 
for 
the 
IDA 
and 
GFATM 
Grants; 
The 
Government 
of 
Moldova 
has 
applied 
for, 
and 
been 
awarded, 
a 
grant 
from 
the 
Policy 
and 
Human 
Resources 
Development 
Fund 
(PHRD) 
to 
prepare 
this 
project; 
The 
Country Coordination 
Mechanism, 
including 
Government, 
UN 
agencies 
and 
NGOs, 
has 
been 
legally 
established, 
and 
has 
met 
in 
June 
2002 
to 
further 
agree 
on 
project 
strategies 
and roles 
of 
different 
members; 
and 
With 
support 
from 
the  Government, 
UN 
agencies, 
the 
Soros 
Foundationlopen 
Society  Institute, 
SIDNSweden 
and 
the 
Moldova 
Health 
Investment 
Fund 
Project, 
NGOs 
have 
been  successfully 
starting 
harm 
reduction activities 
in 
communities and 
prisons, 
which 
has 
laid 
the 
ground 
for 
scaling 
UP. 
Value added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
Cross-sector 
experience. 
The 
Association 
has 
vast experience 
in 
working 
across 
sectors, 
which 
is 
a 
comparative 
advantage 
in 
supporting 
a 
multi-sectoral 
response 
to 
HN/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
in 
Moldova. 
Cross-country  experience: 
The 
Association 
has 
financed 
HIV/AIDS 
activities 
in 
more 
than 
80 
countries. 
It 
is 
therefore 
in 
a 
good 
position 
to 
help 
Moldova 
benefit 
from 
intemational 
experience. 
Stakeholder coordination. 
Through

coordination, the 
Association 
would 
help 
strengthen 
and 
consolidate 
the  investments 
in 
HN/AIDS, 
STIs 
and 
TB 
made 
by 
donors  such 
as 
the 
GFATM, 
USAID, 
GDF, 
SIDNSweden, 
Soros 
Foundation, 
and 
UN 
agencies, 
under 
a 
common 
framework 
led 
by 
the 
Government. 
Internally, 
by 
its 
ability to 
work 
across 
sectors 
and 
partners, 
the 
Bank would 
facilitate 
the 
coordination between different 
ministries 
and NGOs, 
as 
well 
as 
various  levels 
of 
the

More 
than 
3,000 
AIDS 
deaths  are 
estimated 
to  be 
averted 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
project’s 
interventions, assuming reductions 
of 
at 
least 
25 
percent 
of 
IDU’s 
and 
sex 
workers’ 
AIDS 
infections, 
and 
90 
percent 
of 
the mother to 
child 
vertical 
transmission 
cases 
would 
be 
avoided. 
In 
total, 
the project’s 
investment 
is 
expected 
to 
avoid 
6,162 
cases 
of 
AIDS 
over 
a 
ten 
year period. 
The 
ratio 
of 
benefits 
to 
costs, 
considering the 
full 
cost 
of 
the project, 
would yield 
nearly 
US$5 
of 
benefits (direct 
and 
indirect) 
for 
each 
dollar 
invested. 
The 
project 
would 
yield 
a 
present 
value 
of 
net 
benefits, 
after investment 
and 
recurrent 
costs, 
of 
US$ 
29 
million 
over 
ten 
years 
and 
produce 
an 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
(IRR) 
of 
139 percent. 
Annex 
4 
presents the 
results 
of 
the project’s  economic 
analysis, 
based 
upon 
the 
costs 
and 
the 
measurable 
economic 
benefits  expected 
from 
the 
program’s  implementation. 
The 
project’s  economic 
analysis  analyzes 
the 
following 
aspects: 
(a) 
the  project’s 
overall 
economic 
evaluation 
including 
cost-benefit, 
cost-effectiveness 
and financial 
analysis; 
(b) 
sensitivity 
analysis 
to 
determine 
impact 
of 
project  risks 
on 
project 
outcomes; 
(c) 
sustainability 
analysis; 
and 
(d) 
rationale 
for  public 
sector 
involvement. 
The 
analysis 
is 
divided 
in 
two 
sections. 
The 
first 
section 
considers 
exclusively 
the 
IDA 
investment 
of 
US$ 
5.5 
million 
and 
the 
corresponding 
benefits, 
related 
to 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
component 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
this 
investment. 
The 
second 
section 
evaluates 
the 
fill 
impact 
of 
the 
TB 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
activities 
to be 
financed under 
the 
expanded 
program, 
including 
co-financing 
activities,  corresponding 
to 
a 
total 
of 
US$ 
15.6 
million. 
For 
the effects 
of 
this 
annex, 
the 
IDA 
investment 
is 
referred 
to 
as 
the Project and the 
expanded 
investment 
is 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
Program. 
The 
project’s  benefits 
are 
analyzed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
lives 
saved, 
cases 
averted, 
disability 
avoided 
or 
diminished, 
work 
absenteeism 
avoided, 
and health 
care 
costs  saved 
(e.g., 
from 
reductions 
in 
inpatient 
care 
of 
changing protocols 
for 
AIDS/STI 
patients). 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The 
project 
is 
sustainable. 
The 
activities 
would 
focus 
mostly 
on 
preventive 
measures, 
yielding 
minimal 
recurrent 
costs 
and significant 
returns. 
The 
treatment 
costs 
would 
be 
offset 
by 
the 
high 
benefits 
derived 
from 
the 
preventive activities 
plus 
the extension 
of 
life 
to 
people 
in 
their most 
productive 
years. 
The 
project 
would 
be 
sustainable 
under 
diverse 
scenarios 
of 
reductions 
in 
benefits and 
delayed 
project 
implementation. 
The 
principal 
risk 
would 
be 
associated 
with 
a 
failure 
to 
continue interventions after the 
project 
has 
finished, thereby 
lowering 
the probable 
success 
of 
controlling 
the 
epidemic. 
Nonetheless, based 
on 
the 
limited 
govemment health 
spending 
in 
the 
Moldavian 
health 
sector 
it 
is 
critical 
to 
assess 
the 
burden 
of 
recurrent 
expenditures 
on 
total 
public 
health 
spending 
generated 
by 
the 
proposed 
AIDS 
project. 
Upon 
project 
termination, 
the 
estimated recurrent 
costs 
will 
account 
for 
nearly 
US$400,000 
per 
year. 
This 
would 
account 
for 
less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
local 
health 
budget, 
once 
the 
5 
year 
investment 
period 
is 
finalized. 
Even 
if 
the 
recurrent 
costs 
were 
to 
be 
assumed 
by 
central 
government, 
the 
recurrent 
costs 
would 
account 
for only 
3 
percent 
of 
central  government 
health 
spending. 
Recurrent 
- 
17- 
Page  22
expenditures, 
as 
a 
share 
of 
the 
increases 
in 
total 
health 
budget, 
represents 
nearly 
5 
percent 
of 
this 
increase; 
with 
a 
real 
expenditure 
growth 
rate 
of 
more 
than 
10 
percent per 
annum, 
the 
health 
spending 
inertia 
should 
cover the project’s  incremental 
costs. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
burden 
of 
spending 
would 
be 
manageable 
for both 
the 
local 
and 
the 
state 
health 
authorities. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
The 
project 
would 
have 
a 
positive effect 
on 
financial 
flows. 
While 
the 
program and project 
do 
not 
consider 
revenues 
from 
cost 
recovery 
mechanisms, 
as 
all 
activities 
are 
provided 
free 
of 
charge, 
the 
project 
would 
contribute 
positively 
to 
tax 
revenues. 
The 
more than 
6,500 
lives that 
would 
be 
averted 
by 
the 
program 
would 
directly 
contribute 
to 
increased 
tax 
revenues 
for 
the  government. 
The 
target 
population 
is 
predominantly 
of 
working 
age 
and 
these 
workers 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
country’s 
tax 
base. 
The 
present 
value 
of 
tax 
contributions 
is 
estimated 
at 
an additional 
US$ 
5.8 
million, 
assuming 
a 
tax 
contribution 
of 
25 
percent 
and 
a 
per 
capita 
GDP 
of 
US$390 
per 
annum. 
3. 
Technical: 
Current 
best 
practices 
in 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
have 
been applied 
in 
project 
design. 
For 
the 
prevention 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs, 
the 
project 
focuses 
on 
proven 
cost-effective 
interventions 
such 
as 
harm 
reduction 
for 
IDU, 
peer education 
for 
behavior 
change, 
VCT, 
condom 
distribution, 
syndromic STIs 
management, 
prevention 
of 
MTCT, 
and 
blood 
safety 
as 
recommended 
by 
UNAIDS. 
However, 
during 
implementation, the 
following 
technical 
issues 
would 
need 
special 
attention 
in 
Moldova: 
0 
0 
0 
Focusing 
on 
vulnerable 
and 
highly  vulnerable 
groups. 
Reducing 
HIV 
transmission 
among 
vulnerable 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
young 
people 
is 
an 
efficient method 
to 
prevent infections. 
Implementing 
HAART. 
Important 
technical 
issues 
around 
HAART 
include 
monitoring 
the 
patients 
for 
adherence, 
treatment 
response 
and 
side-effects. 
Better 
reporting/surveillance 
systems 
to 
track 
the epidemics. 
Good 
epidemiological 
information 
is 
crucial 
for policy 
malung and 
planning. 
Both 
surveillance 
system 
for HIV/AIDS/STIs 
in 
Moldova 
need 
strengthening. 
Special 
attention 
would 
be 
paid 
to 
this 
area 
during 
project 
implementation. 
A 
multi-sectoral 
approach. 
To 
some 
extent, 
the 
response 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
is 
still 
confined 
within 
the 
health 
sector. 
Experience 
from 
other countries 
shows 
that 
by 
involving 
different 
sectors 
and 
partners 
in 
the 
society, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
generate 
greater 
commitment, 
mobilize 
additional 
resources 
and  improve 
the  sustainability 
of 
interventions 
and 
their 
chance 
for 
success. 
However, 
this 
multi-sectoral  approach 
should 
remain 
focused 
to 
make 
it 
administratively 
feasible 
and 
prevent 
resources 
from 
being 
stretched 
too 
thin.

4. 
Institutional: 
Based 
on 
the 
institutional 
assessment 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
that 
was 
carried 
out, 
the 
following 
institutional 
issues 
require 
special attention: 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
Capacity 
building 
for 
CCM 
and 
NPAS. 
The 
Country 
Coordination 
Mechanism 
(CCM) 
has 
been 
established, 
and 
has 
started 
activities, 
but 
it 
needs 
to 
be 
further 
developed 
and 
supported 
technically 
and 
financially 
with 
assistance 
of 
the 
proposed 
project. 
The 
status, 
authorities 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
NPAS 
coordinating 
unit 
need 
to be 
clearly 
defined. 
This 
should 
have the 
authority and capacity 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
activities 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
the 
NPAS.

4.2 
Project 
management: 
Project 
coordination. 
The 
Project Coordination 
Unit 
that 
has 
been 
implementing 
the 
Moldova 
HIF 
project 
will 
prepare 
and 
implement 
the 
AIDS 
project, 
including 
managing 
grant 
funds 
that have 
been 
already awarded 
for 
control 
of 
TB 
and 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
(GFATM, 
SIDNSweden) 
as 
well 
as 
funds 
the 
project 
might 
obtain 
in 
the 
future. 
The 
PCU 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
administration 
of 
the 
project, 
procurement, 
financial 
management 
and 
for 
liaison 
with 
implementing 
agencies 
within 
and outside the 
MOH 
for 
all 
other  activities, 
as 
well 
as 
coordinating 
M&E 
effort 
for 
the 
entire 
project. 
The 
Soros 
FoundatiodOpen 
Society 
Institute 
- 
Moldova would 
manage 
the 
harm 
reduction 
activities. 
The 
PCU 
has 
added 
to 
its 
team 
(i) 
a 
manager responsible 
for 
the 
AIDS 
project; 
(ii) 
a procurement 
officer; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
financial 
management specialist. 
The 
experience 
of 
the 
HIF 
PCU,  along 
with 
the 
additional 
staff 
that 
have 
been 
hired, and 
the 
support 
of 
the 
CCM 
should 
enable 
the 
PCU 
to 
satisfactorily 
carry out 
the 
additional activities 
of 
the Project. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
The 
Soros 
Foundation 
will 
act 
as 
the 
NGO 
Facilitator 
for 
the Project. 
In 
this 
capacity, 
for 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and 
services, Soros 
will 
adhere 
to 
provisions 
of 
Schedule 
3 
of 
the 
DGA, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
selection, 
appraisal and supervision 
of 
NGOs 
and 
Public 
Services, 
which 
will 
be carried 
out 
by 
methods acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
4.4 
Financial 
management issues: 
The 
project 
financial 
management arrangements 
satisfy 
the 
minimum 
Association 
requirements. 
The 
Recipient 
is 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
audit 
covenants 
of 
existing 
IDA-financed 
projects. 
The 
PCU’s 
previous 
and 
current 
project financial 
statements 
and 
auditing 
arrangements 
are 
satisfactory. 
The 
annual 
audited 
project 
financial 
statements 
would 
be 
provided to 
the 
Association 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
PCU 
has 
been 
operating 
satisfactorily 
the 
HIF 
project 
special account 
in 
a 
commercial bank 
acceptable 
to 
the Association, 
and 
the 
bank’s 
financial 
status 
and 
statements are 
reviewed 
on 
an ongoing 
basis 
by 
the 
Association. 
The 
latest 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
Moldova 
on 
April 
29, 
2003 
and 
will 
be 
discussed 
on 
May 
20,  2003. 
The 
previous 
CFAA 
as 
of 
September 
26, 
1995 was 
prepared at a 
time 
of 
considerable 
transition and 
therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
time 
that 
has 
since 
elapsed, 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
out-of-date. 
The 
I-PRSP 
of 
November 
15, 
2000, 
confirms 
that 
improvement 
is 
required 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the 
budget 
process 
and 
budget 
execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash 
and 
debt management. 
The 
PCU 
has 
adopted 
policies 
and procedures 
that 
operate 
in 
addition to 
those 
of 
the 
current 
public 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to 
minimize 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
risks. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Association 
conducted  a 
Country 
Portfolio 
Financial 
Management 
Review 
(CPFMR) 
of 
all 
Association-financed 
projects under implementation 
in 
Moldova 
and 
identified 
some 
common financial 
management 
issues. 
The 
Association 
has 
confirmed 
that 
all 
such 
issues 
have 
been 
appropriately 
addressed 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the  proposed project’s 
financial 
management arrangements.

Summarize 
key

issues 
relevant 
to

objectives, 
and specify the 
project's social

outcomes. 
October 
2001 
(Annex 
4) 
key 
social 
issues 
with 
regard 
to 
HIV/ALDS 
in 
Moldova 
include: 
Date 
of 
receipt 
of 
final 
draft: 
HIV/AIDS 
is 
a 
health and 
social 
problem. 
According 
to 
the 
social 
assessment 
concluded 
in 
0 
0

0 
poverty 
and 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
services; 
wide-spread 
injecting 
drug 
use 
among 
young 
people; 
migration, commercial 
sex 
and 
trafficking 
of 
women 
and 
children; 
stigma 
and 
discrimination 
against 
HIV/AIDS; 
and 
lack 
of 
human 
rights 
protection 
for 
PLWHA. 
By 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
addressing 
the 
above 
social 
issues, 
the 
project 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
in 
Moldova. 
It 
would 
have 
significant  social 
effects 
on 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups 
in 
the 
society, 
including 
the  poorest  populations, 
CSW, 
IDU, 
prisoners, 
migrant 
workers and 
street 
children. 
The 
project 
would 
also 
contribute 
to 
the development 
of 
civil 
society 
by 
having 
NGOs 
involved 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
services.

partners 
in 
project 
implementation,

which 
can 
be 
financed 
by

services. 
The 
public 
communication 
campaign that 
is 
being 
prepared 
under the 
Moldova

project 
focus 
on 
health 
sector 
reforms, 
but 
it 
has 
also been addressing 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
TB 
issues. 
The 
proposed

includes 
public 
awareness 
campaigns 
and 
other 
IEC 
activities. 
Stakeholders 
would 
also take 
part 
in 
monitoring 
and  evaluation  activities, 
such 
as 
in 
the 
mid-term

and

Additional

First, 
representatives 
of 
NGOs 
are 
included 
on 
the 
Project 
Steering Committee. 
Second, 
during 
the preparation 
of 
the 
project, a 
series 
of 
consultations 
with 
local 
NGOS 
and 
civil 
society organizations 
have been 
carried 
out 
to 
discuss 
the 
project 
design. 
Third, 
NGOs 
would 
be 
contracted 
to 
carry 
out 
relevant  project 
activities, 
especially 
in 
prevention, 
advocacy, 
and 
care 
and 
support 
activities. 
Mechanisms 
and 
requirements 
to 
involve  NGOs 
in 
implementation 
are 
specified 
in 
the 
Project 
Operational Manual. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development 
outcomes? 
The 
Country Coordination 
Mechanism 
would 
be 
the 
implementing 
agency, 
and 
would 
oversee 
project 
preparation 
and implementation. 
The 
IDA 
grant 
would 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
PCU. 
The 
Soros 
Foundation 
would 
subcontract 
NGOs 
to 
implement 
activities 
targeted 
at 
vulnerable and 
highly 
vulnerable 
young 
people. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes? 
The 
Moldova 
HIF 
PCU 
has 
a 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
in 
place, 
which 
is 
being 
hrther 
developed 
to 
include 
M&E 
for 
the 
proposed 
AIDS 
Project.

A 
politically favorable environment 
for 
control 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and

This 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
project 
outcomes. 
The project 
would aim 
to 
create 
a favorable 
legal 
and

as

This 
would 
be

through

as 
NGOs. 
Financial 
sustainability. 
A 
financial 
analysis 
has 
been 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project’s 
economic 
analysis 
(section 
E2 
and 
Annex 
4). 
Upon 
project 
termination, 
the 
estimated recurrent 
costs 
will 
account 
for 
nearly 
US$ 
400,000 
per 
year. 
This 
would 
account 
for 
less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
local 
health 
budget. 
Even 
if 
the recurrent 
costs were 
to 
be 
assumed 
by 
central 
government, 
the 
recurrent 
costs 
would 
account 
for 
only 
3 percent 
of 
central 
government 
health 
spending. 
The 
more 
than 
6,500 
lives 
that 
would 
be 
averted 
by 
the 
program 
would 
directly 
contribute 
to 
increased 
tax 
revenues 
for 
the 
government. 
The 
present 
value 
of 
tax 
contributions 
is 
estimated 
at 
an 
additional 
US$ 
5.8 
million, 
assuming 
a 
tax 
contribution 
of 
25 
percent and a 
per

of

and

the targeted

can 
be 
a

would

as

MOLDOVA: AIDS CONTROL PROJECT 
The Association-financed 
AIDS 
Control 
Project 
cost 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$ 
5.5 
million, 
and 
is 
one 
component 
of 
the 
Moldova TB/AIDS 
Program. 
The 
Program 
would 
include 
parallel 
financing 
from 
the 
following 
grants: the 
IDA 
grant 
of 
US$ 
5.5 
million 
for 
AIDS, 
a 
USAID 
grant 
of 
US$ 
4.0 
million 
for 
TB, 
and a 
US$ 
5.2 
million 
grant 
from 
the 
Global 
Fund 
to 
Fight 
AIDS, 
TB 
and 
Malaria 
(GFATM). 
The 
Government 
would 
finance 
US$ 
0.23 
million. 
The 
IDA 
grant 
would 
finance 
AIDS 
activities 
to 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
the 
Project Coordination 
Unit, 
and 
implemented 
by 
the 
AIDS 
Center, 
the 
TB 
Institute 
and 
NGOs. 
The 
proposed 
IDA 
Project 
would 
include 
three 
components: 
By

Project 
Component 
1 
- 
US$1.77 million 
Strategic 
Planning 
& 
Institutional Capacity Building for 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
control: 
Policy. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
activities 
to 
enhance 
Moldova’s 
capacity 
in 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
policy 
making 
and 
planning. 
It 
would 
support 
the 
CCM 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
National 
Program 
to 
review 
legislations 
and 
regulations 
related 
to 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
and 
propose 
improvements. 
Selected 
operational 
research 
would 
be 
supported 
to provide 
the 
information 
base 
for 
better 
policies. 
Surveillance 
and 
programmatic 
M&E. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
second-generation 
surveillance 
system 
that 
monitors 
both 
HIV 
infection 
and 
risk 
behaviors (especially 
among 
IDUs 
and other 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups) 
to 
inform 
the 
trend 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
Periodic 
KAPB 
surveys 
would 
be 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
behavior 
surveillance. 
A 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system 
for 
the 
National 
Program 
on HN/AIDS/STIs 
would 
be 
put 
in 
place 
with 
quantifiable 
indicators. 
Strengthening 
Laboratory 
Capacity 
for 
HIV/AIDS/STIs. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
the 
improvement 
in 
Moldova’s  laboratory 
capacity 
to 
handle 
an 
expected increase 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
basic 
HIV/AIDS/STIs-related 
testing 
(e.g., 
VDRL, 
Elisa, 
Western 
blot, 
CD4 
and 
CD8 
counts) 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
laboratory 
equipment, 
test 
kits 
and 
training. 
Training. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
training 
for 
health 
care 
workers 
(in 
VCT, 
syndromic 
management 
of 
STIs, 
MTCT, 
HAART 
protocol, 
treatment 
and 
care, 
etc). 
It 
would 
also support 
capacity 
building 
for 
NGOs 
and 
provide 
them 
with 
training 
in 
outreach, 
counseling, 
peer 
education, 
and 
home-based 
care 
and 
support. 
Project 
Component 
2 
- 
US$2.29 
million 
Scaling 
up 
prevention interventions 
for 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
and 
STI 
management 
Targeted 
interventions 
for 
vulnerable 
and 
highly  vulnerable 
groups 
(young 
people, 
especially 
IDUs, 
CSWs, 
MSMs, 
prisoners, 
military 
and STIs 
clinic 
attendees). 
The 
project 
would 
first 
identify 
these 
groups, 
their distributions and 
informal 
networks 
through participatory 
mapping 
exercises. 
It 
would 
then 
target 
them 
with 
prevention 
interventions 
which 
include 
peer 
education, 
VCT, 
condoms 
and 
referrals 
to 
other 
HIVIAIDWSTI 
services. 
The 
project 
would 
strive 
to  improve 
access 
to 
STI 
services, 
especially 
for 
youth 
and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups, 
by 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
STIs 
services, 
making 
them 
free 
and 
more client-friendly. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
IDUs, 
the 
project 
would 
also support 
provision 
-

Page  33
of 
clean 
injecting 
equipment, 
counseling and 
methadone treatment. 
Incentives 
would 
be 
provided 
for 
peer 
educators 
and  other 
service 
providers  to 
encourage 
them 
in 
reaching  vulnerable  and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups. 
The 
Moldova-based 
Soros 
FoundatiodOpen 
Society 
Institute 
would 
manage 
18 
NGO 
subprojects, 
including 
selection, appraisal and 
supervision 
of 
the 
subprojects. 
MTCT 
interventions. 
The 
project 
would 
help 
disseminate 
the 
MTCT 
protocol, 
support 
universal 
VCT 
at 
ante-natal 
clinics,  and 
provide 
HIV-positive 
pregnant women 
with 
short 
courses 
of 
ARV 
and 
infant 
feeding 
options. 
Other 
preventive interventions. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
IEC 
and 
awareness 
campaigns (at 
the 
national 
and 
community 
levels), 
VCT 
services 
and condom social 
marketing. 
A 
strong 
emphasis 
would 
be 
laid 
on 
IEC 
and 
awareness 
campaigns 
for 
youths. 
To 
increase the support 
base, 
the 
project 
would 
recruit 
strategic partners (media, celebrities, 
religious 
leaders, 
community 
and 
business 
leaders) 
and 
involve 
them 
in 
IEC 
and 
awareness 
campaigns. 
PLWHA 
would 
also 
be 
mobilized 
in 
advocacy 
activities 
to 
“humanize” 
the 
HIVIAIDS 
issue. 
A 
safe 
blood 
initiative 
would 
be 
supported 
to 
ensure 
a 
safe 
blood 
supply 
and 
rational 
use 
of 
blood. 
Project Component

US$1 
SI 
million 
Treatment, 
care 
and support 
for 
PLWHA 
Management of opportunistic 
infections 
(01) 
and 
palliative 
care. 
The 
project 
would 
finance 
the 
dissemination 
of 
clinical 
protocols 
for 
01 
management 
(including 
TB) 
and 
care, 
training 
of 
health 
workers 
in 
implementing 
such 
protocols. 
It 
would 
also ensure 
the 
availability 
of 
a 
package 
of 
basic 
drugs 
for 
01 
management 
in 
clinics 
that  deal 
with 
AIDS 
patients. 
A 
possibility 
is 
to 
support a specialized 
HIVIAIDS 
clinic. 
Provision 
of 
HAART. 
HAART 
would 
be 
provided 
free 
of 
charge 
for 
PLWHA. 
The 
initiative 
would 
initially 
cover 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
patients and 
eventually be 
scaled 
up 
under 
additional 
funding 
from 
the 
GFATM 
to 
cover 
all 
PLWHA 
who 
meet the 
medical criteria 
for 
the 
therapy. 
Home 
and 
community-based 
care 
and 
support 
for 
PLWHA. 
This 
would 
be 
conducted 
in 
partnership 
with 
NGOs. 
Such 
organizations 
would 
be 
given 
grants 
and 
training 
to 
provide 
home 
and 
community-based 
care 
for 
PLWHA. 
A 
hospice 
or 
half-way 
facility 
for 
AIDS 
patients 
run 
by 
NGOs could 
be 
established. 
A 
social 
support 
network 
for 
PLWHA 
would 
be 
formed.

of 
the 
Moldova 
HIF 
project. 
Staff 
with 
expertise 
in 
HIVIAIDSISTIs, 
procurement and

MOLDOVA: 
AIDS CONTROL 
PROJECT 
Epidemiological projections 
The 
projections presented 
here 
are 
based 
on 
a 
spreadsheet 
model 
constructed 
for 
the analysis 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
originally 
for 
Belarus. 
The 
functional 
form 
is 
identical, 
but 
the  parameters 
have 
been 
changed 
to 
reflect 
the 
situation 
in 
Moldova. 
These estimates 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
a 
base-case 
scenario; 
i.e., 
what 
might 
happen 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
any intervention. 
The 
Belarus 
model 
is 
in 
turn 
based 
partly 
on 
the 
model 
of 
Kumaranayake, 
Vickerman 
et 
al.  2000. 
The 
model 
comprises 
only 
a 
few 
parameters 
- 
primarily 
the 
sex 
and 
injecting-drug-use behavior 
of 
the population. 
The 
values 
of 
these 
parameters 
are 
chosen 
from 
the 
epidemiological 
literature, 
including 
the 
UNAIDS 
Situational 
Analysis 
of 
2000; 
and 
in 
consultation 
with 
officials 
of 
the 
Moldovan 
government 
and 
the 
international and 
NGO 
community 
in 
Moldova.

Year 
Assumptions. 
The 
model 
assumes 
that 
there 
is no 
net 
population 
growth, 
and 
the 
sexually 
active 
population 
is 
half 
the 
total 
population. 
This 
simple 
model 
also 
assumes 
that there 
is no 
migration. 
This 
may 
lead 
to 
an 
underestimate 
of 
the 
rate 
of 
increase 
in 
HIV, 
since 
as 
the 
Situational 
Analysis 
clearly 
documents, 
there 
are 
active 
channels 
of 
temporary 
migration  and 
international  recruitment 
for 
prostitution 
in 
Europe 
and 
elsewhere. 
The 
number 
of 
injecting 
drug 
users 
is 
assumed 
to 
increase 
exogenously 
at 
0.05 
percent 
per 
month, 
from 
35,000 
in 
2001 
to 
37,000 
in 
201 
1. 
This 
appears 
to be 
a 
relatively 
conservative 
estimate, 
both 
in 
the 
level 
and 
growth 
rate. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Internal 
Affairs 
estimates 
the 
number 
to 
be 
in 
the 
- 
31 
- 
Page  36
range 
of 
50,000; 
but 
this 
number 
may 
include 
more than 
injecting 
drug 
users. 
The 
number 
of 
commercial 
sex 
workers 
is 
determined 
endogenously 
in 
the 
model, 
to 
equilibrate 
the 
demand 
for 
sex 
and 
the 
within-group 
preferences 
of 
IDUs 
and non-IDUs. 
The 
number 
remains 
roughly 
constant 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
simulation 
at 
about 
5,160. 
The 
probability 
of 
transmission 
of 
HIV 
is 
tripled 
when 
at 
least 
one 
sex 
partner 
is 
infected 
with 
another 
(undifferentiated)  sexually transmitted 
disease. 
STI 
prevalence 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
constant 
at 15 
percent, 
for 
sex 
workers, 
IDUs, 
and 
the 
general 
population. 
This 
too 
is 
a conservative 
estimate, and 
is 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
Belarus model, 
in 
which 
STI 
prevalence 
is 
higher 
among 
CSWs. 
The model 
assumes 
a 
base 
estimate 
of 
12,400 
HIV 
infections 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
2001. 
Official 
statistics 
report approximately 
1,000 
cases 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
2000, 
but 
this 
is 
widely 
acknowledged 
to 
be 
a 
gross 
underestimate. 
For 
instance, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Interior 
estimates 
that 
roughly 
20 
percent 
of 
registered 
drug 
users 
are 
HIV 
positive. 
Applying 
this 
ratio 
to 
the 
estimated 
number 
of 
drug 
users 
yields 
7,000-10,000 
HIV 
infections. 
This 
model 
assumes 
that 
prevalence 
among 
IDUs 
has 
already 
reached 
30 
percent. 
Base prevalence 
among 
sex 
workers 
is 
assumed at 
7.5 
percent, 
and 
at 
0.075 percent (75 
per 
100,000) 
among 
the 
general 
population. 
The 
model’s 
base 
estimate corresponds 
to 
an 
adult prevalence 
of 
0.59 
percent 
- 
nearly 
double 
the 
average 
for 
eastern  Europe, 
but 
many 
times 
smaller 
than 
the 
9  percent  estimated 
prevalence 
in 
sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
Predictions. 
The 
model 
predicts 
that 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
any intervention,  epidemic 
prevalence 
will 
increase 
from 
600 
per 
100,000 
adults 
in 
2001 
to 
1900 
per 
100,000 
by 
the 
beginning 
of 
2011. 
This 
is 
very 
close 
to 
the 
epidemic’s 
expected peak 
in 
2017, 
when 
it 
will 
reach 
nearly 
2000 
infections per 
100,000 
adults; 
or 
roughly 
42,000 
cases. 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
HIV 
infections 
will 
occur  among 
injecting 
drug 
users. 
After 
ten 
years, 
prevalence 
among 
IDUs 
will 
have 
increased 
from 
30 
percent 
to 
nearly 
90 
percent. 
The 
share 
of 
infections 
among 
IDUs 
will 
begin 
to 
decline 
in 
2004, 
but 
only 
because 
those 
infected 
begin 
to 
die 
and the 
epidemic 
begins 
to 
spread 
to 
the 
general 
population. 
The 
epidemic 
will 
spread 
through 
sexual  contacts 
between 
the 
general 
population 
and 
sex 
workers,  and 
to 
a 
lesser extent, 
between 
the 
general 
population and 
IDUs. 
Prevalence  among 
sex 
workers 
is 
expected 
to  double 
in 
ten 
years, 
from 
7.5 
percent 
to 
15 
percent. 
Among 
the 
general 
population, 
the  number 
of 
HIV 
infections 
will 
quadruple, 
from 
1,500 
to 
6,000, 
in 
ten 
years, 
corresponding 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
prevalence 
from 
75 
per 
100,000 
to 
300 per 
100,000. 
A 
simplistic evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
HIVIAIDS 
in 
Moldova 
can 
be 
made 
in 
terms 
of 
lost 
income. 
If 
we 
assume 
that 
the 
symptoms 
of 
HIV 
infections 
are 
manifest 
only 
after 7 
years, 
that 
each 
HIV 
infection 
is 
worth 
21 
disability-adjusted 
life 
years, 
and 
that each 
DALY 
costs 
the 
equivalent 
of 
per-capita 
GDP, 
then 
(discounting 
at 
5 
percent) 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
loss 
due 
to 
the 
AIDS 
epidemic 
is 
310,000 
DALYs 
over 
ten 
years, 
or 
the 
equivalent 
of 
more 
than 
$50 
million. 
If 
AIDS 
symptoms 
appear 
after a delay 
of 
five 
years, 
the 
total net 
number 
of 
DALYs 
lost 
rises 
to 
400,000, 
at a 
cost 
of 
$87 
million.

Economic and 
Financial 
Analysis 
This 
annex 
presents 
the 
results 
of 
the project’s  economic 
analysis,  based 
upon 
the 
costs 
and 
the 
measurable 
economic  benefits 
expected 
from 
the 
program’s  implementation. 
The 
project’s  economic 
analysis 
analyzes 
the 
following 
aspects: 
(a) 
the  project’s 
overall 
economic 
evaluation 
including 
cost-benefit,  cost-effectiveness 
and financial 
analysis; 
(b) 
sensitivity 
analysis 
to 
determine 
impact 
of 
project  risks 
on 
project 
outcomes; 
(c) 
sustainability 
analysis; 
and 
(d) 
rationale 
for  public 
sector 
involvement. 
The 
analysis 
is 
divided 
in 
two 
sections. 
The 
first 
section considers 
exclusively the 
IDA 
investment 
of 
US$ 
5.5 
million 
and 
the corresponding 
benefits, 
related 
to 
the

The 
second

evaluates 
the 
full 
impact 
of 
the 
TB 
and 
HN/AIDS 
activities 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the expanded program, 
including 
co-financing activities, corresponding 
to 
a 
total 
of 
US$ 
15.6 
million. 
The 
IDA 
investment 
is 
referred 
to 
as 
the  “project” 
and 
the 
expanded 
investment 
is 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
“program”. 
Economic 
Analysis 
of 
the 
AIDS 
Control 
Project 
The 
project’s  benefits 
are 
analyzed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
lives 
saved, 
cases 
averted, 
disability avoided 
or 
diminished, 
work 
absenteeism 
avoided, 
and 
health 
care costs saved 
(e.g., 
from 
reductions 
in 
inpatient 
care 
of 
changing protocols 
for 
AIDSET1 
patients). 
More 
than 
3,000 
AIDS 
deaths are 
estimated 
to 
be 
averted 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the project’s interventions, assuming reductions 
of 
at least 
25 
percent 
of 
IDU’s 
and 
sex 
workers’ 
AIDS 
infections, 
and 
90 
percent 
of 
the mother 
to 
child 
vertical 
transmission 
cases 
will 
be 
avoided. 
In 
total,  the 
project’s  investment 
is 
expected 
to 
avoid 
6,162 
cases 
of 
ADS 
over 
a 
ten 
year 
period. 
The 
ratio 
of 
benefits 
to 
costs, 
considering the 
full 
cost 
of 
the project, 
would yield 
nearly 
5 
dollars 
of 
benefits 
(direct 
and 
indirect) 
for 
each 
dollar 
invested. 
The 
project 
would 
yield 
a 
present 
value 
of 
net 
benefits, 
after investment 
and 
recurrent 
costs, 
of 
US$ 
29 million 
over 
ten 
years 
and produce an 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
(IRR) 
of 
139 percent.

main

Assumptions. 
The following 
parameters 
are 
considered relevant 
in 
estimating 
the  economic 
benefits 
of 
the proposed 
project: 
the 
length 
of 
the 
project horizon 
and 
the 
time 
to 
impact 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
size 
of 
the 
target 
population, 
the 
existing 
patterns 
of 
morbidity 
and 
mortality, 
the 
number 
of 
years 
of 
productive 
life 
added 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
percentage 
decrease 
in 
mortality, 
and 
the existing 
cost 
structure 
in 
the 
health 
sector. 
Given 
the 
medium-to-long-term  effect 
of 
the 
changes, 
the 
estimates 
presented 
in 
terms 
of 
reduced 
morbidity, 
which 
assume 
a 
project 
horizon 
of 
only 
10 
years, 
are 
conservative. 
The 
analysis 
of 
the 
project 
uses 
the

to 
measure 
the 
direct  and 
indirect 
benefits:

Costs 
and 
Benefits. 
The 
cost-benefit  analysis 
(CBA) 
distributes 
the 
benefits 
over the 
project’s 
time 
horizon 
into 
two 
major 
groups: 
direct and 
indirect 
benefits. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
project 
costs 
include 
the 
direct 
investment 
costs 
and the 
incremental  recurrent 
costs 
of 
the 
project 
over 
a 
ten 
year 
period. 
From 
this 
perspective, 
the 
two 
critical 
indicators that 
are 
evaluated 
include the net 
present 
value 
(NPV) 
of 
all 
benefit and 
investment 
flows 
and the internal 
rate 
of 
return 
(IRR). 
While 
this 
approach 
involves 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
complexity, 
it 
allows 
policymakers 
to 
compare the 
monetary 
value 
of 
the 
benefits 
from 
the 
project 
with 
the 
benefits 
from 
alternative 
investments, 
in 
either the 
same 
sector 
or 
in 
other 
sectors. 
The 
direct 
costs are 
the 
USS 
5.5 
million 
investment 
costs associated 
with 
the 
project. 
These costs 
would 
be 
incurred over the 
period 
2004-2008. 
Given 
the 
expected disbursement 
profile, 
the present 
value 
of 
the future 
investment 
is 
US$ 
4.4 
million 
when 
discounted 
with 
a 
ten 
percent 
discount 
rate. 
The 
direct benefits 
are 
the 
expected 
tangible 
benefits 
accruable 
to 
the 
project 
from 
the 
reduced hospital 
stays, 
eliminating 
unnecessary discharges, 
reducing 
consultations 
and 
avoiding 
drug 
treatment 
for 
HIV 
patients 
that 
avoid infection 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the project. 
The indirect 
benefits 
are 
related 
to 
the 
potential 
life 
years 
saved 
by 
the 
project and 
the  economic 
and 
financial 
value 
of 
increasing 
productivity. 
This 
type 
of 
analysis 
is 
prone 
to criticism 
because 
it 
places 
a 
value 
on 
human 
life 
by 
using 
a 
labor productivity 
measure, 
or 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
losing 
a 
person. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
this 
analysis 
the opportunity 
cost 
is 
measured 
as 
the annual 
per 
capita 
GDP. 
The 
CBA 
is 
provided 
for 
the 
AIDS 
component. 
The 
overall 
investment 
in 
AIDS 
prevention 
and 
treatment 
should 
be 
determined 
in 
the context 
of 
the 
relative 
cost effectiveness 
of 
the proposed project, 
in 
light 
of 
alternative 
investments. 
The project 
would 
have 
three 
main 
components: 
(a) 
Strategic 
Planning 
& 
Institutional 
Capacity 
Building 
for 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
control; 
(b) 
Scaling 
up 
prevention 
interventions 
for 
HIV/AIDS/STIs 
and 
STI 
management; 
and 
(c) 
Treatment, 
care 
and 
support 
for 
People 
Living 
with 
HIV/AIDS 
(PLWHA). 
In 
this 
context the 
project 
would 
aim to 
identify 
and 
target 
high-risk 
groups 
with 
effective 
interventions 
and 
to 
provide 
treatment,  care 
and 
support 
to 
PLWHA. 
The 
epidemic 
in 
Moldova 
is 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
where 
these 
types 
of 
interventions 
can 
have 
a 
great 
impact. 
The 
targeted 
approach 
to 
reduce 
the epidemic 
in 
sex 
workers, 
IDUs 
and 
vertical 
transmission also 
improve 
the 
overall 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
the project. 
The 
project’s  benefits 
are 
the 
reduction 
in 
the number 
of 
HIV 
infections, 
and the 
consequent 
reduction 
in 
treatment 
and 
other 
hospitalization 
costs, 
and 
ultimately 
AIDS 
deaths, 
that 
would 
occur 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
project. 
While 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
predict 
the 
number 
of 
averted 
cases 
with 
any 
accuracy, 
a 
dynamic 
computer 
model 
prepared 
for 
the 
project 
presents 
evidence 
of 
the expected 
impact 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
the project, 
there 
would be 
a 
total 
of 
79,000 
new 
HIV 
cases 
in 
Moldova 
over 
the 
period 
2004-2008. 
Assuming 
project 
implementation 
achieves 
the desired 
results, 
the number 
of 
HIV 
infections 
would 
be 
reduced 
to an 
estimated 
60,000 
cases. 
It 
is 
this 
reduction 
of 
an 
estimated 
20,000 
new 
HIV 
cases 
Moldova 
over the 
period 
that 
is 
the 
main 
direct benefit 
of 
the project. 
Those 
benefits 
then 
- 
34 
- 
Page  39
further 
manifest 
themselves 
in 
terms 
of 
subsequent  deaths 
averted, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
averted 
direct 
and 
indirect 
costs 
of 
treating 
HIV/AIDS 
patients. 
The 
present analysis 
uses 
conservative 
estimates 
on 
the 
reduction 
in 
mortality 
and 
morbidity 
over 
a 
5 
and 
10 
year  period. 
The 
direct 
benefits 
considered 
under 
the 
HIVIAIDS 
component 
include the 
savings  due 
to 
the 
reduction 
of 
the 
number 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
cases. 
We 
assume 
that 
each 
case 
averted 
is 
valued 
to 
US$ 
1,800 
on 
average, 
according 
with 
the 
costs 
criteria 
established 
by 
Moldovan 
doctors. 
The 
indirect benefits 
include 
the 
estimation 
of 
the 
disability 
life 
years 
saved 
by 
the 
new 
interventions. 
The 
calculation 
takes 
into 
account the 
average 
life 
expectancy 
of 
Moldavians 
(65 
years) 
minus 
the 
average 
age 
of 
death 
for 
AIDS 
(27); 
the 
cost 
of 
each year 
of 
life 
saved was 
calculated 
using 
the 
average 
wages 
for 
Moldovan 
workers. 
Those 
estimations 
provide 
an 
estimation 
of 
nearly 
13 
1,000 
years 
of 
life 
saved 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project. 
Based 
on 
these estimates, 
the 
stream 
of 
benefits yields 
a 
net 
present value 
of 
US$29 
million 
with 
an 
internal 
rate 
of 
return 
of 
139 
percent 
(see 
Table 
1.2). 
The ratio 
of 
benefits 
to 
costs, 
considering the 
full 
cost 
of 
the 
project 
would yield 
more 
than 
5 
dollars 
of 
benefits 
(direct 
and 
indirect) 
for 
each 
dollar 
invested. 
This 
scenario compare 
favorably 
with 
similar 
projects 
by 
the Bank. 
In 
India, 
for 
example, 
the 
AIDS 
project 
produced 
an 
estimated 
benefit 
to 
cost 
ratio 
of 
3.5 
to 
1. 
The 
cost 
for 
each 
infection 
averted 
is 
US$ 
108, 
resulting 
in 
a 
cost 
per 
DALY 
gained 
of 
US$ 
5, 
implying 
that the project 
would 
buy 
a 
healthy 
year 
of 
life 
for 
US$ 
5. 
This 
figure 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
results 
obtained 
in 
similar 
AIDS 
projects 
in 
India 
and 
Brazil, 
which 
yield 
results 
of 
US$ 
18 
and 
US$ 
21 
per healthy 
life 
year 
gained, 
respectively. 
The 
cost 
per 
death averted 
would 
be 
US$ 
1,800. 
Sensitivity 
Analysis. 
This 
section 
evaluates 
to 
what 
extent 
the 
project’s  inherent 
risks 
could 
affect the 
overall project 
benefits 
and 
the 
overall desirability 
of 
the 
project 
in 
economic 
and 
financial 
terms. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
face 
two 
types 
of 
risks: 
(a) 
a 
delay 
in 
project 
implementation, 
and 
thus 
deferring 
estimated benefits 
to 
the 
future; 
and 
(b) 
a 
direct 
reduction 
in 
estimated benefits, 
resulting 
from 
problems 
with 
ex 
ante 
estimation 
or 
problems 
in 
project 
implementation. 
Each 
of 
these 
risks 
would 
translate 
into lower 
benefits and 
less 
favorable 
conditions 
for 
investment. 
Delays 
in 
project 
implementation 
could 
come 
from 
the 
following: 
(i) 
political 
and 
administrative 
instability, 
that 
may 
affect 
ownership 
and 
management  capacity; 
(ii) 
number  and variety 
of 
actors 
involved 
(Ministry 
of 
Health, 
Ministry 
of 
Justice, Judets, 
and 
NGOs); 
(iii) 
lack 
of 
counterpart 
funds; 
and 
(iv) 
lack 
of 
funds 
to 
finance  recurrent 
costs. 
The  project 
design 
attempts 
to 
take 
these 
risks 
into 
consideration 
in 
order 
to 
mitigate 
the 
potential impact 
of 
the 
above 
mentioned 
risks. 
Risk 
(i) 
would 
be 
addressed 
by 
ensuring 
political 
support for 
the 
project 
and 
involving 
the 
major 
stakeholders 
(ministry 
officials,  lawmakers, 
major 
NGOs, 
and beneficiaries) 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
of 
project 
preparation. 
Risk 
(ii) 
is 
relatively 
low 
given 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
highly 
experienced 
project 
implementation 
unit 
for 
the 
Moldova 
health 
sector 
projects. 
Risk 
(iii) 
would 
be partly 
addressed 
through the 
design 
of 
a 
project-financing 
scheme. 
Risk 
(iv) 
is 
relatively 
low 
as 
already 
discussed. 
Should 
it 
materialize, 
it 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
delay 
in 
operating the investments 
financed, 
thus 
resulting 
in 
a 
lag 
in 
benefit 
stream. 
The 
second 
type 
of 
risk, 
direct 
reduction 
in 
benefits, 
would 
come 
from 
lower 
than 
expected reductions 
in 
the 
number 
of 
cases 
averted, 
and 
reduced 
mortality. 
While 
evidence 
on 
the 
impact 
of 
interventions 
similar 
to 
those 
proposed 
in 
the 
project 
is 
very 
limited 
in 
Moldova, 
experience 
in 
other 
Bank 
projects points 
to 
similar 
results 
to 
those assumed 
in 
the 
present 
analysis. 
The project 
would 
be 
sustainable 
under 
diverse 
scenarios 
of 
reductions 
in 
benefits 
and 
delayed 
project 
implementation. 
The principal 
risk 
would 
be 
associated 
with 
a 
failure 
to 
continue interventions 
after 
the 
project 
has 
finished, 
thereby 
lowering 
the 
probable 
success 
of 
controlling 
the epidemic. 
The 
following 
table 
provides the 
summary 
results 
for 
the 
sensitivity 
analysis. 
- 
35 
- 
Page  40
As 
Table 
1.2 
shows, 
under 
the 
above 
scenarios, 
all 
the 
indicators remain positive 
even 
in 
the 
worst 
scenario considered. 
As 
a 
whole,  the 
project 
will 
continue generating 
positive 
benefits 
and 
return 
rates 
as 
Table 
1.2 
shows. 
Assuming 
total 
savings 
were 
30 
percent 
lower 
than 
expected, 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
savings 
over 
a 
10 
year 
period 
would 
be 
reduced 
to 
US$ 
18 
million, 
with 
a 
rate 
of 
return 
of 
around 
91 
percent; 
while 
in 
the 
extreme 
case 
of 
50 percent 
fewer 
benefits than 
expected, 
the rate 
of 
return 
would 
be 
lowered 
to 
63  percent, 
with 
a 
net 
present 
value 
of 
US$ 
11.5 
million. 
The 
table 
also 
displays  the 
impact 
of 
a 
delay 
in 
project 
implementation. 
A 
two 
and 
three 
year 
delay 
in 
project 
implementation 
would lower 
the 
NPV 
from 
US$ 
29 
million 
in 
the 
base 
case 
scenario 
to 
US$ 
13 
million 
and 
US$ 
8 
million, 
respectively. 
The 
project's 
return 
would 
also 
decrease 
from 
139 percent 
to 
130 
percent 
with 
a 
two 
year 
delay and 
118 
percent 
with 
a 
three 
year 
delay. 
Under 
both 
cases, 
the 
project 
would 
still be an 
excellent investment 
as 
reflected 
by 
the 
high 
NPV 
and 
solid 
rates 
of 
return.

Public 
Sector 
Rationale for 
Association 
participation. 
The 
prevention and 
treatment 
of 
AIDS 
depends 
almost 
entirely 
on 
the 
public 
sector due 
to 
the 
relatively 
high 
cost 
of 
the interventions 
required 
to 
treat 
these 
illness 
and the 
limited 
incentives 
for 
private provision. 
For 
the 
most 
part, 
AIDS 
fall 
under 
the category 
of 
public good to 
the 
extent that 
due 
to 
the 
externalities 
associated 
with 
treatment 
(or illness) 
cannot 
be 
excluded 
from 
benefiting 
other people 
due 
to 
the 
disease's 
contagious nature. 
With 
regard 
to 
externalities, 
the 
treatment 
of 
AIDS 
clearly lowers 
the negative externalities 
associated 
with 
the 
different 
forms 
of 
HIV 
transmission. 
The 
case 
of 
mother-to-child  transmission 
is 
a 
clear 
example 
of 
a 
negative 
externality 
that  can 
be 
reduced: 
studies 
indicate that transmission 
rates 
can 
be 
lowered 
from 
over 
25 
percent 
to 
around 
8 
percent 
with 
adequate 
intervention.

There 
are 
additional problems related 
to 
asymmetric information 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
individuals 
do 
not 
always have 
accurate 
knowledge 
of 
a 
potential 
partner's 
HIV 
or 
behaviors 
that 
would 
put 
himher 
at 
higher risk. 
An 
informed 
population 
can affect 
the 
chances 
of 
transmitting 
HIV 
to 
current 
or 
future 
sexual partners. 
This 
justifies 
projects 
which 
attempt 
to 
reduce 
the 
information 
problems 
in 
the 
market 
either 
via 
public information 
projects 
to 
the 
population 
at 
large 
or 
through 
targeted campaigns 
oriented at 
HIV-positive 
groups 
and 
the importance 
of 
informing 
potential 
or 
existing 
sexual partners.

Equity 
considerations 
are 
also 
relevant 
as 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
economic 
justification 
for 
the 
project. 
In 
terms 
of 
equity 
considerations, 
studies 
in 
Moldova 
show that the 
majority 
of 
the 
AIDS 
cases 
-

- 
Page  41
fall within 
the poorest 
segments 
of 
the population. 
The 
high 
cost 
of 
care 
for 
HIVIAIDS, 
estimated at 
US$ 
5,000 
to 
US$ 
10,000 
per 
year, 
can 
be 
a 
significant 
barrier 
to 
seeking and 
obtaining 
care 
in 
the 
private 
sector. 
Public 
financing 
and 
provision 
of 
AIDS 
interventions 
can 
therefore 
have 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
distributional  equity 
by 
providing 
services 
for 
a  segment 
of 
the 
population 
that 
would 
otherwise 
not 
have 
access. 
Limited 
private 
sector 
involvement 
and 
aspects 
of 
market 
failure 
are 
thus 
part 
of 
the economic 
justification 
for 
the 
public 
intervention 
advocated under 
this 
project. 
The 
private 
sector 
in 
Moldova, 
as 
elsewhere, 
has 
very 
limited 
incentive 
to 
engage 
in 
preventive 
aspects 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
especially 
given 
the 
“public-good“  nature 
of 
effective preventive 
strategies, 
the 
long 
asymptomatic 
period 
of 
HIV, 
and 
often 
marginalized 
nature 
of 
high 
risk 
groups. 
Project 
Sustainability. 
The 
project 
is 
sustainable. 
The 
activities 
will 
focus 
mostly 
on 
preventive 
measures, 
yielding 
minimal 
recurrent 
costs 
and significant 
returns. 
The 
treatment 
costs 
will 
be 
offset 
by 
the benefits 
derived 
from 
the 
preventive 
activities 
plus 
the 
extension 
of 
life 
to 
people 
in 
their 
most productive 
years. 
Nonetheless, 
based 
on 
the 
limited 
government 
health 
spending 
in 
the 
Moldova’s 
health 
sector 
it 
is 
critical 
to 
assess 
the 
burden 
of 
recurrent 
expenditures 
on 
total 
public 
health 
spending 
generated 
by 
the proposed 
AIDS 
project. 
The 
following 
table 
estimates 
the 
burden 
of 
recurrent 
expenditures 
on 
the 
total 
public 
health 
budget 
for 
five 
years 
following 
project 
termination. 
The 
analysis 
assumes 
that 
the recurrent 
expenditures 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
generated 
by 
annual 
maintenance 
costs 
equivalent 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the recurrent 
costs 
during 
the investment period. 
Recurrent 
costs 
after the 
five 
years 
of 
the 
project 
are 
estimated 
as 
5 
percent 
of 
the amount invested 
in 
Medical 
Equipment, 
Non-Medical 
and 
Other 
Equipment, 
Drugs 
and 
Medical 
Products 
and 
Supplies 
and Materials, 
and 
the 
costs 
of 
ARV 
for 
200 
individuals. 
Those 
200 
individuals 
are 
the 
number 
assumed 
in 
the project’s 
component 
Provision 
of 
HAART 
that 
will 
be kept 
after 
the year 
5 
of 
the project. 
Upon 
project 
termination, 
year 
5 
in 
the 
table, 
the estimated recurrent 
costs 
will 
account 
for 
nearly 
US$ 
400,000 
per 
year. 
Table 
1.3 
displays  the  recurrent 
expenditures 
as 
a 
share 
of 
local 
government 
spending 
on 
health 
and 
state 
health 
spending. 
This 
analysis 
does 
not 
consider the spending 
through 
the 
private 
sector, 
as 
it 
is 
estimated that the 
government 
will 
continue 
to 
assume 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
spending 
on 
AIDS 
given 
the 
public 
goods nature 
of 
spending. 
The 
assumptions 
for 
the table 
include 
annual 
spending 
increases 
equal 
to 
the previous 
growth 
of 
local 
and national 
health 
expenditures 
(0.3 
percent 
and 
11 
percent respectively) 
over 
the 
next 
10 
years. 
Based 
on 
these estimates, 
the 
following 
table 
compares 
the recurrent  expenditures 
generated 
by 
the 
project 
with 
the  estimated 
public 
health 
spending. 
Table 
1.3 
shows 
that 
project and 
recurrent 
expenditures 
represents, 
on 
average, 
nearly 
62 
percent 
of 
the 
currently and projected 
expenditures 
in 
the 
AIDS 
project, 
during 
the 
period 
where the 
project’s 
investments 
is 
largest. 
The 
estimated recurrent 
costs 
of 
US$ 
400,000 
would 
account 
for 
less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
local 
health 
budget, once 
the 
5 
year investment 
period 
is 
finalized. 
Even 
if 
the 
recurrent 
costs 
were 
to 
be 
assumed 
by 
central 
government, 
the recurrent 
costs 
would 
account 
for 
only 
3 
percent 
of 
central 
government 
health 
spending. 
Recurrent 
expenditures, 
as 
a 
share 
of 
the 
increases 
in 
total 
health 
budget, 
represents 
nearly 
5 
percent 
of 
this 
increase; 
with 
a 
real 
expenditure 
growth 
rate 
of 
more than 
10 
percent 
per 
annum, 
the 
health 
spending 
inertia 
should 
cover 
the 
project’s 
incremental 
costs. 
In 
this 
context, 
the burden 
of 
spending 
would 
be 
manageable 
for 
both 
the 
local 
and 
the 
state 
health 
authorities.

Economic Analysis 
of 
the 
Moldova 
TB/AIDS 
Program 
Costs 
and  Benefits. 
This 
section  includes 
the 
results 
of 
the 
expanded 
economic 
analysis, 
considering 
both 
the 
AIDS 
and 
TB 
activities 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
full 
Program. 
Benefits 
are 
analyzed 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
lives 
saved,  cases 
averted, 
disability 
avoided 
or 
diminished, 
work 
absenteeism 
avoided, 
and 
health 
care 
costs saved 
(e.g., 
from 
reductions 
in 
inpatient 
care 
of 
changing 
protocols 
for 
ALDS/STI 
and 
TB 
patients). 
The project 
would 
also 
contribute 
to 
alleviate 
suffering 
of 
the 
poorest 
population, 
as 
tuberculosis 
is 
linked 
to 
poor 
living 
conditions, 
and 
to 
improved 
labor 
productivity. 
Assumptions. 
The 
following 
parameters 
are 
considered relevant 
in 
estimating 
the 
economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
proposed 
project: 
the 
length 
of 
the 
project horizon 
and the 
time 
to 
impact 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
size 
of 
the 
target 
population, the 
existing 
patterns 
of 
morbidity 
and 
mortality, 
the 
number 
of 
years 
of 
productive 
life 
added 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
percentage 
decrease 
in 
mortality, 
and 
the 
existing 
cost 
structure 
in 
the 
health 
sector. 
Given 
the 
medium-to-long-term 
effect 
of 
the 
changes, 
the  estimates 
presented 
in 
terms 
of 
reduced 
morbidity, 
which 
assume 
a 
project 
horizon 
of 
only 
10 
years,  are 
conservative. 
The 
analysis 
of 
the 
project 
uses 
the 
following 
assumptions 
to 
measure 
the 
direct  and 
indirect 
benefits:

Summary 
of 
Expanded 
Program 
Costs 
and 
Benefits. 
The 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
(CBA) 
distributes 
the 
benefits over 
the 
project’s 
time horizon 
into 
two 
major 
groups: 
direct and 
indirect 
benefits. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
project 
costs 
include 
the 
direct 
investment 
costs 
and 
the 
incremental recurrent 
costs 
of 
the 
project 
over 
a 
ten 
year 
period. 
From 
this 
perspective, 
the 
two 
critical 
indicators that 
are 
evaluated 
include 
the 
net 
present 
value 
(NPV) 
of 
all 
benefit and 
investment 
flows 
and 
the 
internal 
rate 
of 
retum 
(IRR). 
While 
this 
approach 
involves 
a 
greater 
degree 
of 
complexity, 
it 
allows policymakers 
to 
compare 
the 
monetary 
value 
of 
the 
benefits 
from 
the 
project 
with 
the 
benefits 
from 
alternative 
investments, 
in 
either 
the 
same 
sector 
or 
in 
other 
sectors.

The 
direct 
costs are 
the 
US$ 
15.6 
million 
investment 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
project. 
These 
costs 
would 
be 
incurred 
over 
the 
period 
2004-2008. 
Given 
the 
expected 
disbursement 
profile, 
the 
present 
value 
of 
the 
future 
investment 
is 
US$ 
13.7 
million 
when 
discounted 
with 
a 
ten 
percent 
discount 
rate. 
The 
direct benefits 
are 
the 
expected 
tangible 
benefits 
accruable 
to 
the 
project 
from 
the 
reduced 
hospital 
stays, 
eliminating 
unnecessary 
discharges, 
reducing 
consultations 
and 
avoiding 
drug 
treatment 
for 
HIV 
and 
TB 
patients that 
avoid infection 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
program. 
The 
indirect 
benefits 
are 
related 
to 
the 
potential 
life 
years saved 
by 
the 
project 
and 
the 
economic and 
financial 
value 
of 
increasing 
productivity. 
This 
type 
of 
analysis 
is 
prone 
to 
criticism 
because 
it 
places 
a value 
on 
human 
life 
by 
using 
a 
labor 
productivity 
measure, 
or 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
losing 
a 
person. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
this 
analysis 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
is 
measured 
as 
the 
annual 
per 
capita GDP. 
The 
CBA 
is 
provided 
for 
each 
of 
the 
two project 
components. 
A 
total 
of 
6,520 
deaths 
would 
be 
averted 
due 
to 
reduced 
mortality 
in 
AIDS 
and 
TB 
patients. 
More 
than 
4,710 
AIDS 
deaths 
are 
estimated 
to 
be 
averted 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
project’s 
interventions, 
assuming 
reductions 
of 
at 
least 
25 
percent 
of 
IDU’s 
and 
sex 
workers’ 
AIDS 
infections, 
and 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
mother 
to child 
vertical 
transmission 
cases 
will 
be 
avoided. 
Also, 
another 
1,810 
deaths 
will 
be 
avoided 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
DOTS 
treatment 
implementation and 
the 
provision 
of 
second 
line 
TB 
drugs 
to 
treat 
MDRTB 
cases 
for 
the 
Moldovan 
adult 
and prisoner population. 
In 
total, 
the 
project’s 
investment 
is 
expected 
to 
prevent 
24,500 
cases 
of 
TB 
and 
9,500 
cases 
of 
AIDS 
over a 
ten 
year 
period. 
In 
total 
the 
TB 
interventions 
are 
expected 
to 
save 
46,000 
life 
years 
saved 
over 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
avoided 
deaths 
represent 
nearly 
335,000 
DALYS, 
each one 
costing an 
amount 
of 
US$ 
21. 
The 
ratio 
of 
benefits 
to 
costs, 
considering 
the 
full 
cost 
of 
the 
project, 
would yield 
US$ 
3 
of 
benefits (direct and 
indirect) 
for 
each 
dollar 
invested. 
The 
project 
would 
yield 
a

value 
of

benefits,

TB/AIDS 
Program 
Sustainability. 
The 
sustainability 
of 
the 
combined 
program 
activities 
is 
lower 
than  the 
HIV/AIDS 
project  activities 
but 
continues 
to be 
sustainable. 
The 
following 
table 
estimates 
the 
burden 
of 
program’s recurrent 
expenditures 
on 
the 
total 
public 
health 
budget 
for five 
years 
following 
project 
termination. 
The 
analysis 
assumes 
that the 
recurrent expenditures 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
generated 
by 
annual maintenance 
costs 
equivalent 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the recurrent 
costs 
during 
the investment 
period 
Recurrent 
costs 
after the 
five 
year 
of 
the 
project 
are 
estimated 
as 
5 
percent 
of 
the amount 
invested 
in 
Medical 
Equipment, 
Non-Medical 
and 
Other Equipment, 
Drugs 
and 
Medical 
Products 
and 
Supplies 
and 
Materials, 
and 
the costs 
of 
ARV 
and 
TB 
drugs 
for 
those 
individuals 
treated 
under the program. 
The 
assumptions 
for 
the table 
include 
annual 
spending 
increases 
equal 
to 
the previous 
growth 
of 
local 
and 
national health 
expenditures 
(0.3 
percent 
and 
11 
percent 
respectively) 
over the 
next 
10 
years. 
Based 
on 
these 
estimates, 
the 
following

compares the 
recurrent 
expenditures generated 
by 
the

TB 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
Social 
Assessment 
Since 
it 
became 
an 
independent 
state 
in 
August 
1991, 
Moldova 
has 
been 
suffering 
from 
a 
deepening 
social 
crisis. 
The 
main 
elements 
of 
this 
crisis 
are a 
decline 
in 
income 
and 
growing 
income 
differentiation, 
decreasing 
expenditure 
and 
consumption, 
growing 
poverty 
and 
sharply  deteriorating 
nutrition. 
The 
situation 
in 
Moldova 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most relevant 
examples 
of 
a 
transition 
to 
market 
economy 
that 
may 
be 
characterized 
as 
a 
transition 
to 
poverty 
for 
most 
of 
the population. 
From 
a 
state 
of 
relative 
well 
being, 
GDP 
per 
capita 
has 
fallen 
to US$ 
300, 
placing 
the 
country 
almost 
at 
par 
with 
the 
poorest 
countries 
in 
Africa 
and 
Asia. 
The 
fall 
into 
poverty 
has 
had 
disastrous  consequences 
on 
the 
health 
status 
of 
the 
population. 
Incidence 
of 
diseases 
such 
as 
tuberculosis,  hepatitis, 
syphilis, 
HJY/AIDS 
and 
cardiovascular 
diseases 
have 
rapidly 
increased 
since 
independence. 
Accessibility 
to 
pharmaceuticals 
has 
become 
a 
major 
problem 
in 
Moldova. 
This 
led 
in 
turn 
to 
the 
increase 
in 
referral 
to 
the 
hospitals, 
as 
these 
services 
can 
provide 
patients 
with 
some 
pharmaceuticals and 
care. 
However, 
a 
large 
burden 
of 
health 
care costs 
is 
borne 
by 
patients. 
As 
in 
many 
other 
countries 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union, 
Moldova 
has 
a 
long 
history 
of 
informal 
payments 
for 
health 
services. 
In 
1999, 
a decree 
on 
introduction 
of 
user 
fees 
and 
a 
list 
of 
prices 
for 
the 
services 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Parliament 
of 
Moldova. 
Still, 
there 
is 
an unofficial price 
list 
for 
surgeries 
and 
other interventions, 
although 
the 
Constitution 
of 
Moldova still 
guarantees 
medical 
care 
free 
of 
charge 
for 
everyone 
for 
all 
care. 
For 
the 
poor, 
therefore, 
illness 
threatens 
survival, 
as 
it 
may 
cause 
job 
loss 
and 
drain 
the 
limited 
resources 
of 
poor 
households. 
As 
it 
was  demonstrated 
by 
the 
institutional 
and 
socialheneficiary 
assessment 
carried 
out 
as 
part 
of 
project 
preparation, 
the 
introduction 
of 
user 
fees 
is 
considered 
both 
by 
patients 
and providers 
to 
be 
a 
major 
reason 
for 
the dramatic 
decrease 
in 
the 
access 
to 
health 
care 
services. 
For 
the 
most 
vulnerable  groups 
of 
the 
population, 
poverty 
and 
inability 
to 
pay 
for 
health 
services 
is 
a 
main 
reason 
for 
social 
exclusion. 
The 
study 
on 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
health 
care has 
revealed 
that 
health 
expenditures 
are 
closely related 
with 
the poverty 
level 
- 
poor 
families 
are 
using 
primary health 
care 
services 
almost 
40 
percent 
less 
often 
than 
the non-poor. 
Expenditures 
of 
the 
poor 
on 
health were 
only 
7.5 
percent 
of 
their 
non-food 
expenditures. 
Social 
Assessment 
of 
groups 
highly 
vulnerable 
to 
HIVIAIDS. 
Drug 
addiction and 
prostitution 
were 
considered non-existent 
during 
the  Soviet 
period, 
as 
was extreme 
poverty. 
As 
a consequence 
of 
increasing poverty, 
criminality 
has 
risen and 
various 
illegal 
economic 
activities 
have 
emerged, 
such 
as 
drug 
trafficking and 
trafficking 
of 
women 
and 
children, 
or to 
be 
more 
exact 
selling 
of 
human 
beings 
into 
slavery 
and 
for 
organ 
transplants. 
Poverty 
in 
Moldova 
has 
been gradually 
“feminized”. 
Young 
girls 
of 
13-15  years 
became 
victims 
of 
traffic. 
In 
most 
cases, 
these 
girls 
come 
from 
orphanages 
or 
from 
risk 
families,  where parents 
abuse 
alcohol 
or 
are 
divorced. 
As 
a consequence 
of 
increased 
drug 
trafficking, 
while 
the 
number 
of 
IDUs 
in 
the 
age 
group 
15-16 
has 
dropped 
by 
1 
percent 
in 
Western 
Europe, 
it 
rose 
by 
5 
percent 
in 
Eastern 
and 
Central 
Europe. 
About 
44 
percent 
of 
drug 
users 
use 
drugs 
in 
groups, 
but 
while 
32 
percent 
buy 
the 
drugs 
from 
distributors, 
42 
percent prepare 
the 
drugs 
themselves. 
It 
has 
been 
noticed 
a 
clear 
tendency 
of 
increased 
use 
of 
synthetic 
injected 
drugs. 
The 
analysis 
of 
questionnaires 
filled 
by 
50 
people 
from 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups has 
revealed 
that 
they 
have become 
part 
of 
these 
groups 
due 
to 
poverty and 
the economic  situation 
of 
the 
country. 
Some respondents 
had 
social motives 
to 
become 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
changes 
that 
have happened 
in 
society 
during 
the 
transition 
years (such 
as 
childhood 
in 
incomplete 
families, 
no 
parents 
or 
unhealthy 
lifestyles 
of 
parents 
with 
alcohol 
abuse, 
family 
violence, 
sexual 
abuse 
of 
children 
by 
their 
parents, 
drug 
abuse, etc.). 
All 
respondents 
are 
unemployed, 
jobless 
for 
2-8 
years 
for 
“women 
involved 
into 
traffic” 
and 
12 
years 
maximum 
in 
the 
case 
of 
IDUs.

income 
supporting 
a decent 
level 
of 
life 
for 
them and their families 
drives 
many 
citizens 
abroad 
in 
search 
of 
jobs 
as 
a 
last

strategy, 
or 
towards 
illegal 
activities 
such 
as 
prostitution 
and 
drug 
business, 
with 
subsequent 
involvement 
into 
intravenous 
drug 
use. 
All 
the 
women 
involved 
into 
prostitution, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
trafficked 
and 
subsequently 
used 
in 
brothels 
abroad, 
either 
voluntarily 
or 
through selling 
into 
slavery 
and physical 
or 
sexual 
abuse, 
are 
young 
persons, 
aged 
18-30, 
of 
reproductive 
age. 
The 
same 
applies 
to 
IDUs.HIV/AIDS 
patients 
interviewed 
in 
various 
institutions 
have 
the 
following 
specific 
features: 
70 
percent have been 
or 
are 
at 
present 
in 
penitentiary 
institutions; 
100 percent 
use 
drugs 
intravenously and 
sometimes smoke 
marijuana; 
all 
are 
HIV 
positive; 
10 
percent 
of 
IDUs 
are 
HIV 
positive, 
without 
concomitant 
illnesses; 
50 
percent 
of 
IDUS 
also have hepatitis 
C; 
40 
percent 
of 
patients 
with 
tuberculosis 
are 
HIV 
positive and 
IDUs. 
The 
average 
age 
of 
respondents 
attending the 
AIDS 
Center 
is 
30 
years, 
varying between 
21 
and 
49 
years; 
70 
percent have 
secondary 
education and 
30 
percent professional 
or 
college 
education. 
None 
of 
respondents 
is 
married 
and 
none 
of 
them 
is 
employed 
or 
registered 
as 
unemployed 
and 
receives 
an 
unemployment 
indemnity; 
30 
percent 
have 
never been 
employed; 
the 
work 
experience 
of 
70 
percent 
of 
respondents 
was 
on 
average 7 
years; 
10% 
of 
respondents are 
disabled 
receiving 
pensions 
of 
MDL 
80 
per 
month. 
About 70 
percent 
had 
been 
in 
penitentiary institutions 
for 
2-12 
years 
and 
30 
percent 
are 
homeless. 
About 
60 
percent consider 
their 
expenditures 
on 
food 
very 
high 
at 
MDL 
150-200 
a 
month, 
and 
20 
percent 
refer 
no 
expenditures 
on 
food 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
money. 
These 
IDUs 
consider that they 
have 
a 
healthy 
life 
style 
although 10 
percent 
smoke 
marijuana 
and 
abuse 
alcohol, 
20 
percent 
use 
narcotics 
and 
80 percent 
use 
drugs 
intravenously. 
Families 
of 
60 
percent 
of 
patients 
are 
also 
refered 
as 
having 
healthy 
lifestyle, 
while 
40 
percent 
refer 
that 
they 
parents smoke 
and 
abuse 
alcohol. 
Only 
30 
percent 
of 
IDUs 
have 
both 
parents. 
The 
issue 
of 
trust 
in 
discussing 
health 
status 
and 
other 
problems related 
to 
drug 
abuse 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
can 
be 
expressed 
in 
the 
following 
numbers: 
only 
30 
percent 
can 
discuss 
with 
their 
parents 
and 
doctors 
their 
life 
and 
health, 
while 
70 
percent 
do 
not 
trust 
anyone. 
All 
respondents 
are 
HIV 
positive; 
10 
percent 
of 
IDU 
are 
HIV 
positive, 
without 
concomitant 
illnesses; 
50 
percent 
of 
drug 
users 
with 
HIV/AIDS 
also  have 
hepatitis 
C; 
40 
percent 
of 
patients 
with 
tuberculosis 
are 
HIV 
positive  and 
use 
drugs 
intravenously. 
Regarding 
measures 
for 
preventing 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STI, 
all 
respondents 
mentioned 
using 
a 
condom 
and 
single 
use needles, 
which 
are 
distributed through 
needle 
exchange programs. 
Still, 
only 
70 
percent 
use 
condoms. 
90 
percent 
of 
respondents 
are 
heterosexual, 
10 
percent 
gave 
no 
answer. 
About 
10% 
have 
found out 
that 
they 
are 
HN 
positive 
when 
they 
were 
hospitalized 
for 
treatment 
and 
diagnosis 
in 
the 
Republican 
Narcology 
Department 
(RND), 
20 
percent 
during 
tuberculosis 
investigations. 
40 
percent 
of 
respondents 
mention 
that 
the 
source 
of 
infection 
was 
intravenous 
drug 
use 
in 
group, 
after 
overdose, 
when 
they 
could 
not 
think 
of 
protection 
measures. 
None 
of 
them 
knows 
exactly 
when 
and 
from 
whom 
they 
got 
infected. 
90 
percent 
of 
respondents 
have 
received 
no 
treatment; 
only 
10 
percent 
(1 
person 
of 
the 
sample) 
has 
received 
partial 
symptomatic 
treatment. 
The 
main 
reason 
for not 
purchasing medications 
is 
lack 
of 
money 
and 
the 
difficult 
financial 
situation 
of 
respondents. 
All 
respondents 
at the Republican 
Narcological 
Dispensary 
were 
men, 
with 
average age 
27 
years; 
50 
percent graduated 
from 
secondary 
school 
and the 
other 
40 
percent 
from 
professional 
school, 
college 
or 
university; 
70 
percent 
come 
from 
urban 
areas; 
80 percent 
are 
single. 
Only 
10 percent 
of 
RND 
patients 
were 
employed 
with 
a 
monthly 
salary 
of 
130 
lei. 
The 
rest 
have been unemployed 
for 
3 years 
on 
average; 
40 
percent have never 
been 
employed; 
40 
percent have 
been 
detained 
in 
penitentiary  institutions; 
10 
percent 
are 
homeless. 
About 
60 
percent come 
from 
incomplete 
families, 
and 
10 
percent 
are 
orphans; 
60 
percent 
of 
their 
parents 
have healthy 
lifestyles, 
30 
percent 
abuse 
alcohol 
and 
smoke, 
10 
percent 
use 
- 
42 
- 
Page  47
injected 
drugs. 
Before 
being 
hospitalized, 
90 
percent 
of 
patients 
had 
never 
asked 
help 
from 
the 
AIDS 
center 
or 
any 
other 
service/NGO; 
30 
percent 
of 
drug 
users 
have 
received 
medical 
assistance 
and 
psychological 
support, 
while 70 
percent 
have 
not 
received 
any 
help. Expenses 
for 
purchasing 
narcotics 
have 
taken 
all 
the 
available 
income 
of 
40 
percent 
of 
interviewed 
drug 
users, 
and 
60 
percent  were 
spending 
on 
drugs 
amounts 
varying 
between 
20-30 
lei. 
About  90 
percent 
of 
respondents 
are 
IDUs 
(intravenous 
drug 
users), 
and 
10 
percent 
chronic 
alcoholics. 
For 
90% 
of 
the 
IDU 
patients the 
cost 
of 
transportation, 
medications 
and 
consultations 
are 
a 
major 
obstacle 
for 
seelung 
a 
doctor and receiving 
treatment; 
40 
percent 
have 
tried 
self-treatment, 
60 
percent 
have used hospitals. 
The 
only 
motive 
for not 
purchasing 
medications 
is 
lack 
of 
money 
(1 
00 
percent). 
All 
respondents 
are 
aware 
of 
measures 
to 
prevent 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
mentioned the 
use 
of 
condoms  and 
needles 
of 
single 
use. 
Radio  and 
TV 
are 
the 
information 
sources 
on 
healthy 
lifestyle 
(e.g. 
safe 
sex) 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
for 
all 
respondents, 
and 
hends 
and 
special 
literature 
for 
20 
percent. Some 
60 
percent 
of 
drug 
users 
communicate 
with 
their 
parents about 
their 
illness, 
but 
30 
percent 
do 
not 
talk 
at 
all. 
Only 
10 
percent 
of 
respondents 
trust 
their 
parents. 
All 
interviewed 
referred 
to 
be 
heterosexual. 
About 
60 
percent 
of 
patients 
interviewed 
in 
the Republican Dermato-Venerlogical 
Dispensary 
were 
women, 
which 
are 
in 
general younger 
than 
men; 
70 
percent 
live 
in 
rural 
areas, 
of 
which 
67 
percent 
are 
women; 
50 percent 
are 
married and 
20 
percent have children; 
70 
percent have 
been unemployed 
for 
an 
average 
period 
of 
4 
years, 
or 
have never worked;  the 
period 
of 
unemployment 
varies 
between 
2 
years 
and 
5 years 
maximum. 
None 
of 
respondents 
receives unemployment 
indemnity. 
None 
has 
been 
in 
prison. 
Patients spend 
40 
percent 
of 
the family’s 
income 
on 
medical 
assistance, 
while 60 
percent 
do not 
spend 
anything 
for 
lack 
of 
money. 
In 
the 
sample 
studies, 
10 
percent 
inject 
drugs, 
most 
use 
alcohol 
(60 
percent) 
and 40 
percent 
smoke. 
Only 
30 
percent 
said they 
had 
healthy 
lifestyles. 
Among 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STI 
transmission 
prevention 
measures, 
90 
percent 
named 
using 
condoms, 
but 
10 
percent 
know 
nothing 
about 
safe 
sex; 
50 
percent 
referred 
using 
condoms. 
Radio 
and 
TV 
are 
information 
sources 
regarding healthy 
lifestyle 
(e.g. 
safe 
sex) 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STI 
for 
all 
respondents, 
while 20 
percent 
also 
referred 
friends. 
None 
has 
mentioned family, 
school 
or 
published 
materials 
as 
information 
sources, 
which 
reveals, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
other 
risk 
groups, 
that 
school 
institutions’ 
educational 
programs, 
as 
well 
as 
newspaper 
information 
is 
absolutely 
insufficient 
and inefficient. Families 
do not 
discuss at 
all 
sex 
problems, 
a 
topic 
considered 
taboo 
for 
generations. 
90 
percent 
of 
respondents 
suffer 
from 
syphilis, 
10 
percent 
of 
gonorrhea 
and 
10 
percent 
are 
IDU. 
About 
14 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
HIV 
positive 
persons 
registered 
in 
Moldova 
have 
contracted 
the 
disease 
through 
sexual 
contact. 
If 
an 
efficient 
diagnosis 
and 
evidence-based system 
is 
established 
in 
Moldova, 
the 
number 
of 
people 
diagnosed 
with 
STIs 
(syphilis, 
gonorrhea, 
chlamidiasis, 
trichomoniasis) 
may 
reach  about 
240,000 
annually. 
Prostitution 
has 
become  widespread 
nowadays, 
commercial 
sex 
involving 
young 
women without 
employment 
or 
other 
sources 
of 
income. 
The 
average 
age 
of 
women 
involved 
in 
commercial 
sex 
work 
is 
21 
years; 
most 
of 
these 
women 
have 
secondary 
education 
(57 
percent), 
but 
only 
14 
percent 
had 
a 
professional 
education; 
86 
percent  were  never 
employed. 
All 
women 
indicated that they 
spend 
most 
of 
their 
earnings 
(over 
75 
percent) 
on 
food. 
All 
the 
respondents 
smoke, 
43 
percent 
abuse 
alcohol 
and 
29 
percent 
use 
narcotics 
and 
smoke 
marijuana.  One 
third 
of 
prostitutes 
are 
offered 
drugs 
by 
their 
clients. 
The 
main 
motivations 
for 
practicing prostitution 
are 
poverty, 
inability 
to 
find 
work 
and need 
to 
support 
children 
andlor 
parents. 
The 
average 
age 
of 
respondents  re. 
traffic 
of 
women 
was  25 
years, 
and  the  nationality 
distribution 
was 
67 
percent 
Moldovan 
and 
33 
percent 
Russian;  35 
percent have 
a 
secondary 
education, 
and 
65 
percent 
have 
a 
professional, 
college 
or 
university 
education. 
About 
25 
percent 
are 
married 
and 75 
percent 
single, 
and 
18 
percent have 
children 
outside 
marriage. 
About 
92 
percent 
of 
women 
do 
not 
receive 
any 
family 
support,  8 
percent 
receive 
it 
from 
their 
husbands. 
Family 
members 
of 
58 percent 
of 
women 
are 
unemployed, 
and 
in 
the 
case 
of 
42 
percent the 
average 
monthly 
income 
of 
the 
family 
is 
272 
Lei.

About 
17 
percent 
of 
women 
are 
orphans; 
some 
68 percent 
of 
respondents 
live 
in 
rural 
areas. 
All 
the 
respondents 
mentioned 
that 
they 
are 
unemployed. 
Accordingly, 
42 
percent 
say 
that 
50-70 
percent 
of 
their 
families’ 
monthly 
budget 
is 
spent 
on 
food. 
All 
the 
women 
have been 
involved 
in 
commercial 
sex 
for 
1 
month to 
2 
years 
before 
being 
repatriated, 
an 
average 
of 
10 
months. 
In 
our 
sample, 
67 percent 
of 
women 
had 
been 
sold 
on 
their 
way 
to 
the 
destination where 
they were promised 
secure 
and 
decent 
work, 
on 
a 
contract 
basis. 
Knowledge 
regarding 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STI 
prophylaxis 
measures 
is 
reduced 
for 
73 
percent 
of 
respondents 
to 
using 
a 
condom, 
and 
17 
percent 
do 
not 
know or 
never 
thought  about 
this 
issue. 
Information 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
prophylaxis 
measures 
is 
primarily 
obtained 
from 
TV 
programs 
(75 
percent) 
and literature 
(25 percent). 
School 
or family 
have 
not 
been 
mentioned 
as 
information 
sources, 
which 
clearly 
demonstrates 
the 
weakest 
link 
in 
education 
of 
the 
youth. 
About 
92 
percent 
of 
women 
do 
not 
communicate 
at 
all 
with 
their families 
about 
these 
topics, 
or 
intend 
to 
do 
that, 
and 
only 
8 
percent 
partially 
communicate 
with 
their 
mothers. 
The 
use 
of 
protection 
measures 
is 
the 
following: 
42 
percent 
of 
women 
used 
condoms 
to 
protect 
themselves 
from 
infection, 
25 
percent 
used 
it 
“when  the 
client 
had 
a 
condom”, 
while 
33 percent never used 
it 
because 
the 
’master‘ 
did 
not 
provide them 
with 
condoms. 
Social 
Assessment 
of 
TB 
patients. 
Respondents 
of 
the 
present 
study 
(80 
patients) 
belong 
to 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
strata 
of 
the 
society. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
interviewees 
were male 
(84 
percent)  aged 
between 
3 
1 
and 
40 
years 
(33 
percent), 
mainly 
urban 
residents 
(58 percent), 
having 
secondary 
education 
(69 
percent), 
and 
unemployed 
(91,4 
percent). 
About 
20 
per 
cent 
of 
patients have other members 
of 
their 
families 
suffering 
from 
TB. 
The 
unemployment 
period 
varied 
between 
a 
couple 
of 
months and 
21 
years. 
About 
35 
percent 
of 
the 
respondents 
are 
disabled, 
receiving 
a 
monthly 
pension 
that varies 
from 
80 
to 
104 
MD 
lei. 
The 
family 
monthly 
income 
varied 
from 
$5-$50 
per 
month. 
Out 
of 
66 interviewed 
patients 
from 
Chisinau, 
Orhei, 
Hincesti 
and 
Vomiceni, 
21 
percent 
have been 
detained 
in 
one 
of 
the penitentiary 
institutions 
of 
the 
country. 
Despite 
the 
fact that 
the 
majority 
of 
patients (51 
percent) 
live 
in 
apartments, 
only 
14 (17 
percent 
0 
benefit 
from 
central 
heating 
system. 
Residences 
outside 
of 
Chisinau 
are 
not 
heated 
during 
the 
wintertime. 
A 
considerable 
part 
of 
the 
family 
income 
is 
allocated 
to 
buy 
food, 
but 
about 
58 
percent 
of 
patients  consider  the 
quality 
of 
their 
nutrition 
as 
bad 
or 
very 
bad.  Patients  estimated 
expenditures 
for nutrition 
vary 
from 
20 
percent 
up 
to 
95 
percent 
of 
the 
family 
budget. 
A 
significant 
part 
of 
the 
patients 
smoke (57 percent) 
and 
abuse 
alcohol 
(46 
percent). 
Only 
5 
patients 
confirmed 
drug 
use, 
including injecting 
drugs. 
Patients 
mention 
being 
sick 
for 
periods 
varying 
from 
2 
weeks 
to 
15 
years. 
In 
the 
majority 
of 
cases, 
TB 
was 
detected 
by 
X-Ray 
investigation. 
The 
majority 
of 
patients 
does 
not 
know 
when 
and 
where 
they 
were infected. 
Some 
of 
the patients consider that 
they 
were infected 
in 
penitentiaries. 
All 
patients 
interviewed 
have 
received 
treatment. 
The 
majority 
of 
patients 
(93 percent) 
prefer 
in-patient 
treatment 
in 
phthysiopneumological 
departments. 
Most 
patients 
(98 
percent 
stated 
that 
the 
cost 
of 
transportation, 
advice, 
medications, 
etc., 
has 
been 
an 
obstacle 
for 
seeking 
a 
physician and 
receiving 
treatment. 
Due 
to 
limited 
resources, 
most 
patients 
(91 
percent) 
did 
not 
receive 
all 
medications (specific 
and 
non 
specific), 
which would 
have  been 
necessary 
for 
recovery. 
Many 
patients 
(67  percent) 
have 
paid 
from 
drugs 
out-of-pocket. 
After 
treatment, 
47 
percent consider 
that 
their health 
has 
ameliorated 
and that they 
have 
partially 
recovered. 
In 
24 
percent 
of 
cases 
the 
disease 
has 
become chronic, 
and 
in 
15 
percent 
of 
cases 
led 
to 
disablement. 
Most 
of 
the 
patients 
are 
not 
satisfied 
with 
the 
hospitals 
services 
offered 
in 
phthysiopneumological 
departments. 
They 
are 
not 
satisfied 
with 
the 
quality 
of 
air 
conditioning, 
drinking 
water and 
food, 
sanitary 
conditions, 
and 
bed 
linen. 
Most 
patients 
(89 
percent) 
are 
unsatisfied 
with 
the 
quality 
of 
heating 
during 
the 
wintertime. 
Practically, patients 
never 
have 
hot 
water. 
In 
addition, 
patients 
have 
limited 
access 
to 
telephone 
and none 
to 
newspapers, 
radio 
or 
TV. 
Conditions 
in 
the 
penitentiary 
TB 
hospital 
in 
Bender 
are 
deplorable. 
The 
state 
is 
providing food 
to 
the 
detainees 
1.5 
MD 
lei 
per 
day, 
which 
is 
far 
from 
covering 
the 
needs 
of 
one 
person, 
especially 
-44- 
Page  49
suffering 
from 
TB. 
There 
are 
over 
20 
persons 
living 
in 
each 
poorly 
ventilated cell. 
One 
patient 
has 
only 
2 
square 
meters 
of 
space, 
but 
in 
some 
cells 
space 
is 
more 
scarce: 
1.3-1.5 
square 
meterdprisoner. 
The 
prison 
hospital 
is 
not 
heated  most 
of 
the 
time. 
The  situation 
of 
TB 
patients 
who 
are 
HIV 
positive 
is 
undetermined. 
A 
random 
examination 
of 
60 
prisoners 
identified 
7 
HIV 
positive 
persons. 
In 
most 
cases, 
the 
TB 
treatment 
regimen 
was 
not 
respected. 
About 
3 
1 
percent 
of 
respondents 
mentioned 
that 
they 
had to 
buy 
pharmaceuticals 
out-of-pocket 
due 
to 
limited 
hospital 
resources. Pharmaceutical 
expenditures 
varied 
from 
50-500 
lei. 
About 
33 
percent 
stated 
that  they 
received 
less 
than 
3 
TB 
drugs, 
while 
other  patients 
have 
periodically 
received 
3 
medications 
each 
during 
1-3 
months. 
The 
majority 
of 
patients 
(80 
percent) have 
spent 
money 
on 
food. 
Patients 
did 
not 
report 
any payments 
to 
doctors 
or 
medical 
personnel 
in 
cash 
or 
in 
kind, 
irrespectively 
of 
the 
institution 
where they 
were treated. 
None 
of 
the 
patients 
had 
any 
medical 
insurance, 
and 
72 
percent 
referred 
that treatment 
is 
very 
expensive, 
The 
large 
majority 
of 
respondents 
highly 
appreciate 
the 
level 
of 
knowledge, 
experience 
and 
training 
of 
physicians 
in 
TB 
hospitals. 
About 
94 
percent 
of 
patients 
consider 
the treatment 
scheme 
as 
being 
correct 
and hope 
that 
it 
will 
bring 
positive 
developments 
in 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
disease. 
Recommendations 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
e 
Rebuilding 
the 
economy and 
promoting 
economic development 
is 
the 
key 
to 
solve 
these 
problems. 
It 
is 
imperative 
to 
implement 
the 
PRSP 
as 
one 
of 
the 
main 
instruments 
to 
improve 
the 
living 
standards 
of 
the 
population 
and 
thus 
improve health 
indicators. 
At 
the 
central 
level 
there 
is 
a need 
to 
establish 
at 
last 
the 
state 
of 
rule 
of 
law 
and 
assure 
that  the 
fiscal 
system 
works  efficiently, 
thus 
creating 
resources 
for 
the 
public 
sector. 
In 
the 
financial 
domain, 
political 
stability 
is 
needed 
and 
clarification 
of 
the 
mandate 
of 
different 
levels 
of 
financial 
management and 
budget 
allocations. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
re-orient 
financing 
of 
health 
care 
towards 
primary 
health 
care and estimate 
the 
budget 
for 
the 
health 
care 
system 
not 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
number 
of 
beds 
in 
the 
hospitals, 
but 
on 
the 
number 
of 
different 
categories 
of 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
groups 
of 
population 
and 
evaluation 
of 
their 
needs. 
For 
these 
groups the 
public 
sector has 
to 
take 
the 
responsibility 
for 
basic 
provision 
of 
services. 
In 
is 
imperative 
to 
give 
priority 
to 
allocation 
of 
the 
resources 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
National 
Programmes 
to 
combat 
TB 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
& 
STIs. 
Wages 
paid 
to 
the physicians 
are 
very 
low, 
and 
the 
need 
to 
keep 
trained 
staff 
on 
health 
services 
is 
imperative. Physicians 
working 
in 
the 
area 
of 
TB 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
should 
be 
remunerated 
taking 
into 
consideration 
harmful 
working 
conditions. 
The epidemiological 
control 
and 
monitoring 
of 
TB 
and 
HIV/AIDS 
& 
STIs 
is 
a 
public 
responsibility. 
The 
introduction 
of 
user 
fees, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
lack 
of 
adequate 
financing 
for 
health 
care 
creates 
a 
situation 
when 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
are 
still 
forced 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
services. 
The 
result 
of 
this 
is 
a 
dramatic 
decrease 
in 
access 
to 
care 
and 
exclusion 
of 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups 
from 
epidemiological 
surveillance 
and 
control. 
The 
national policies 
in 
the 
area 
of 
HIVIAIDS 
should 
be 
thoroughly 
thought  and 
the 
priorities 
identified, 
given 
the 
limited 
budget 
for 
the 
program 
and 
the 
dimension 
of 
the 
problem. 
The 
resources 
should 
be 
allocated 
in 
the 
most 
efficient 
way 
in 
order 
to 
stop 
the 
development 
of 
the 
epidemic. 
The 
Government 
should 
seek 
international 
donors 
support 
in 
provision 
of 
TB 
drugs 
to 
ensure 
access 
to 
treatment. 
The 
focus 
should 
be 
placed 
on 
urgent 
actions 
in 
the 
penitentiary institutions. 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
STIs 
actions 
should 
be 
primarily 
focused 
on 
prevention 
of 
the 
disease. 
Civil 
society 
and 
NGOs 
should 
be more actively 
involved 
to 
achieve 
the objectives 
of 
the 
program. 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to improve 
the 
legislation 
securing 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
patients and 
physicians, 
regarding 
labor 
migration 
and 
trafficking, 
and 
vulnerable and 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups. 
The 
low 
level 
of 
knowledge 
among vulnerable, 
highly 
vulnerable 
groups  and other groups 
of 
the 
- 
45 
- 
Page  50
population regarding 
HIVIAIDS 
requires 
urgently 
public 
communication 
campaigns 
and 
educational 
programs 
for 
all 
levels 
of 
education. 
It 
is 
obvious that 
the 
main 
impediment 
is 
the 
inadequate 
financing, 
as 
reported 
by 
all 
respondents. 
Given 
the 
scarce resources, 
key 
decision 
makers have 
to 
strategically allocate 
these 
resources 
in 
the 
most 
efficient 
way.

Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
Country 
Issues. 
The 
latest 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
Moldova 
on 
April 
29, 
2003 
and 
will 
be 
discussed 
on 
May 
20, 
2003. 
The 
previous 
Country Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
of 
September 
26, 
1995 
was 
prepared 
at 
a 
time 
of 
considerable 
transition and 
therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
time 
that 
has  since 
elapsed, 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
out-of-date. 
The 
I-PRSP 
of 
November 
15,2000 
confirms 
that improvement 
is 
required 
in 
the management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the  budget 
process 
and 
budget 
execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash 
and 
debt 
management. 
The 
PCU 
has 
adopted 
policies 
and 
procedures that 
operate 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
of 
the 
current 
public 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to 
minimize 
project financial 
management 
risks. 
The 
Bank 
conducted 
a 
Country 
Portfolio 
Financial 
Management 
Review  (CPFMR) 
of 
all 
Association-financed 
projects under implementation 
in 
Moldova 
and identified 
some 
common financial 
management 
issues. 
The 
Association 
confirmed 
that 
all 
such 
issues 
have been appropriately 
addressed 
in 
the design 
of 
the 
AIDS 
Control 
Project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements. 
Strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
PCU 
FMS. 
There 
are 
no 
significant 
weaknesses 
of 
the project 
financial 
management system.The 
significant 
strengths 
that 
provide 
a 
basis 
of 
reliance 
on 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
system 
include: 
(i) 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
PCU 
and 
its 
Financial 
and 
Administrative 
Officer 
in 
implementing 
Association-financed 
projects 
and  satisfying  Association 
financial 
management  requirements; 
and 
(ii)

by

PCU 
was 
established 
in 
the 
year 
2000 
as 
an 
implementing 
entity, 
created 
specifically 
to 
implement 
Association-financed 
projects 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
and 
has 
been 
implementing 
successfully the 
HIF 
Project 
(which 
is 
currently 
in 
its 
third 
year 
of 
implementation). 
The 
PCU 
is 
a 
legal 
entity, 
with 
its 
own 
statute 
established 
by 
Government Decision. 
The 
PCU 
reports 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
Ministry 
of

Flow 
of Funds. 
Project 
funds 
will 
flow 
from: 
(i) 
the Association,  either 
via 
a 
single  Special 
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the basis 
of 
SOEs 
or 
by 
direct 
payment 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
direct

Staffing. 
The 
PCU 
includes 
one 
General 
Director, 
one 
AIDS 
Project Coordinator, 
a 
finance team 
comprising 
a 
Finance Administrative 
Officer 
and an 
Accountant,  Procurement 
Specialists, 
and 
various 
specialists 
grouped 
in 
the 
sub-teams 
established 
to 
implement  the 
HIF 
and 
AIDS 
Control 
projects’ 
components 
and 
sub-components. 
The 
PCU 
has 
good 
experience 
of 
implementing 
Association-financed 
projects and 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
it 
is 
fully 
capable 
of 
fulfilling 
the accounting 
and 
reporting 
needs 
of 
the project. 
Accounting Policies and 
Procedures. 
The 
accounting books 
and records 
are 
maintained 
on 
a 
cash basis 
and 
project financial 
statements 
are 
presented 
in 
Moldovan 
Lei. The 
PCU 
has 
instituted 
a 
set 
of 
appropriate 
accounting 
procedures 
and 
internal 
controls 
including 
authorization 
and 
segregation 
of 
duties. 
The financial 
management procedures 
manual 
that 
is 
used 
for 
the 
HIF 
Project 
was 
adjusted 
to

Page  60
include 
the 
specifics 
of 
the 
AIDS 
Control 
Project. 
Specific 
procedures 
are 
put 
in 
place regarding safeguarding the 
inventories, 
since 
the 
Project 
will 
finance the 
acquisition 
of 
important 
and 
high 
value 
drugs, 
medicines, 
equipment  laboratory, 
medical 
consumables 
and 
testing 
kits. 
The 
costs 
of 
storage 
will 
cover 
the 
insurance 
of 
these goods. 
There 
are 
several 
internal control 
procedures 
developed 
regarding 
the 
inventory  distribution. 
Regular deliveries 
of 
goods 
will 
be 
received 
at the 
warehouses 
used under 
the project, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
the 
needed 
level 
of 
supply. 
The 
contracts 
with 
the 
suppliers 
will 
stipulate 
the 
schedule 
of 
deliveries 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis, 
considering the 
needs 
of 
usage 
and 
the 
storage 
capacity 
of 
the 
warehouses. 
Deliveries 
will 
have purchase  orders 
that 
are 
matched 
to 
the  goods 
inwards 
notes, 
certified 
by 
the 
warehouse 
officers 
and 
verified 
by 
the 
PCU 
representatives. 
Goods

notes 
signed 
by 
an 
authorized

by 
the 
PCU. 
The 
warehouses 
will 
communicate 
to 
the 
PCU 
the

Reporting 
and 
Monitoring. 
The 
PCU 
produces 
all 
financial 
reports 
for 
the 
Association and 
Government 
with 
its 
existing project 
software 
system. 
The 
PCU 
has demonstrated 
on 
the 
HIF 
project 
that 
it 
is 
able 
to 
report 
accurately 
and 
timely 
on 
project 
expenditures 
with 
the 
system. 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) 
will 
be 
used 
for 
project 
monitoring 
and 
supervision 
and the 
indicative 
formats 
of 
these 
are 
included 
in 
the Project 
Operations 
Manual. 
The 
PCU 
will 
produce 
a 
full 
set 
of 
FMRs 
every 
(calendar) 
quarter throughout 
the 
life 
of 
the project. 
Final 
formats 
of 
the 
FMRs 
were 
agreed 
at negotiations, 
and include: 
a 
a 
a 
Special

which 
is 
used 
for 
presenting 
all 
needed 
project financial 
reports, 
for both 
the 
Association  and 
Government, 
denominated 
in

The 
PCU 
has 
appointed an 
expert 
to 
customize 
the 
existing 
software 
to 
cater 
for 
the specifics 
of 
the 
AIDS

Project. 
The 
adjustments 
were 
implemented 
by 
the 
FM

consultant, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the  existent 
financial 
and 
accounting, 
monitoring 
and 
procurement 
staff. 
Supervision 
Plan. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
the Association 
will 
supervise 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management  arrangements 
in 
two 
main 
ways: 
(i) 
review 
the  project’s 
quarterly 
financial 
management 
reports 
as 
well 
as 
the 
project’s 
annual 
audited 
financial 
statements 
and 
auditor’s 
management letter; 
and 
(ii) 
during 
the 
Association’s  supervision 
missions, 
review 
the project’s 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
arrangements 
(including 
a 
review 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
SOEs 
and 
movements 
on 
the 
Special 
Account) 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Association’s 
minimum 
requirements. 
As 
required, 
a 
Association-accredited 
Financial 
Management 
Specialist 
will 
assist 
in 
the supervision 
process.

Audit 
Arrangements 
Internal 
Audit. 
The 
PCU 
has 
no 
internal audit 
function and 
none 
is 
considered 
necessary 
given 
the 
size 
of 
the organization.

External 
Audit. 
No 
significant 
issues 
have arisen 
in 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
HIF 
Association-financed 
project 
implemented 
by 
the 
PCU. 
The 
audit opinions 
were 
unqualified 
and 
no 
significant internal 
control 
issues 
were 
mentioned 
in 
the 
management 
1etters.The 
PCU’s previous 
and current 
auditing 
arrangements 
and 
findings 
of 
the 
audits 
are 
satisfactory to 
the 
Association and 
it 
has 
thus 
been 
agreed that 
similar 
audit 
arrangements 
will 
be 
adopted 
for 
the 
AIDS 
Control 
Project, 
to 
include 
the 
AIDS 
Control 
project 
financial 
statements, 
SOEs 
and Special Account. 
The 
terms 
of 
reference that 
were 
used 
for 
audit 
of 
CY2001 
and 
which 
were 
updated 
for 
CY2002 
will 
likewise 
be 
used 
for 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
AIDS 
project, 
starting 
with 
CY2003. 
The 
AIDS 
Project 
will 
require 
that 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
standard 
audit 
terms 
of 
reference, 
the 
auditors 
will 
have 
to 
audit 
the 
warehouses 
used 
under 
the 
project 
for 
the 
storage 
of 
drugs, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
use 
of 
drugs. 
Audit 
Reports 
Entity 
Project, 
SOE 
and Special 
Account 
The 
audit 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
independent 
private 
auditors  acceptable 
to 
the 
Association, 
on 
terms 
of 
reference acceptable 
to 
the 
Association, 
and 
procured 
by 
the 
PCU 
through 
the 
Least-Cost 
Selection  procurement 
process. 
The 
annual 
audited 
project financial 
statements 
will 
be 
provided to 
the 
Association 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
contract 
for 
the 
audit 
awarded 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation 
and thereafter 
may 
be 
extended 
from 
year-to-year 
with 
the 
same 
auditor, 
subject 
to 
satisfactory 
performance. 
The 
cost 
of 
the 
audit 
will 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
IDA 
Grant.

Disbursement 
Arrangements 
IDA 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
under 
the 
Association’s 
transaction-based procedures 
including 
SOEs 
and 
direct 
payments. 
Supporting 
documentation 
for 
SOEs, 
including

for 
each 
consulting 
firm 
and 
more 
than 
US$ 
30,000

each 
for 
individual 
consultants. 
Disbursements 
below 
these 
thresholds, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
training, 
study 
tours and 
for 
PCU 
operating 
costs, 
will 
be 
made against 
certified 
Statement

well 
as 
to 
the 
Association supervision 
mission, and 
will 
be retained 
by 
the 
PCU 
for 
at 
least one year 
after receipt 
by 
the 
Association 
of 
the audit 
report 
for 
the 
year 
which 
the 
last 
disbursement 
was made. 
Disbursements 
for 
expenditures  above the SOE thresholds 
will 
be 
made 
against 
presentation 
of 
full 
documentation 
relating 
to 
those 
expenditures. 
There 
is 
no 
plan 
to move 
to 
periodic 
disbursements. 
The 
processing, 
disbursement 
and 
monitoring 
of 
the 
allocations 
of 
the proceeds 
of 
the

Special account: 
The 
PCU 
will 
open 
and 
manage 
a Special 
Account 
(SA) 
specifically 
for 
this 
project, 
in 
a 
bank 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Association, 
including 
appropriate 
protection 
against set-off, seizure and attachment 
in 
the 
case 
of 
a 
commercial 
bank. 
The 
PCU 
expressed 
its 
preference 
to 
continue 
with 
the 
banking 
arrangements established 
and 
used 
successfully 
on 
the 
HIF 
Project. 
The 
authorized 
allocation 
of 
the 
SA 
would 
be 
US$ 
500,000. 
The 
Authorized 
Allocation 
shall 
be 
limited 
to 
an 
amount 
equivalent 
to 
US$ 
250,000, 
until 
the 
aggregated amount 
of 
withdrawals 
from 
the 
Grant Account 
plus 
the 
total 
amount 
of 
all 
outstanding 
special 
commitments 
shall 
be 
equal 
to 
or 
exceed 
the 
equivalent 
of 
SDR 
1,000,000. 
Replenishment 
for 
the 
SA would follow 
Association 
procedures. 
The 
PCU 
would 
submit 
replenishment applications 
monthly, 
or 
sooner 
if 
desired, 
but 
quarterly at 
the 
latest. 
A 
bank 
statement 
and 
reconciliation 
of 
the 
SA 
against 
the 
Association’s 
records 
would 
support 
the 
replenishment applications. 
The 
minimum 
amount 
for 
application 
for 
direct 
payment 
and 
for 
special 
commitment 
would 
be 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
authorized 
allocation 
to 
the 
SA.

account 
in 
MDL 
to 
be 
managed 
in 
parallel 
with 
the 
special 
account, 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
paying 
the  Association's 
share 
of 
local 
currency 
expenditures. 
Advances 
from 
the 
special 
account 
to 
the 
MDL 
account 
will 
not 
exceed 
budget 
expenditures 
for 
a

and 
any 
cash 
remaining 
in 
that 
account 
at 
the

reconciliation 
statement. 
In 
claiming 
expenditures 
paid from 
the

account, 
the 
PCU 
will 
apply 
the 
historical 
exchange 
rate 
prevailing 
at
