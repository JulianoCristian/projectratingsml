Maternal and\n            infant mortality rates have been relatively stable over the\n            last 10 years but are still 3 to 5 times higher than the EU\n            averages. In the late 1990s, the incidence of TB increased\n            dramatically, especially in prisons. From the mid-\n            1990's onward, HIV/AIDS prevalence increased by more\n            than 25 times among the 15-49 age group, reaching 0.90\n            percent in 2003. Service-wise, the country was trying to\n            maintain extensive facilities inherited from Soviet times on\n            a meager budget. Resources were skewed toward large\n            hospitals, which represented 70 percent of health spending."}, "docdt": "2007-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
