MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A KYONCGI REGIONAL TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for
US$116 million equivalent is submitted for approval.  The proposed loan would
have a term of 15 years, including 3 years of grace, and would bear interest
at the standard variable rate. The proceeds would assist in financing the
first phase of a multimodal program to improve the transport network in the
Kyonggi region of Korea.
2.        Background.  Throughout much of the past 20 years, the transport
system in Korea has been strained bv the demands of rapid growth and has
required massive public sector investments in transport infrastructure. The
Government has been allocating up to 23% of its total capital expenditure to
transport from 1967 to 1977, decreasing to about 15Z in the last ten years.
Investments have been concentrated on the Seoul-Pusan axis where most indus-
trial development is taking place. The Government's basic objective in the
past he; been to increase the capacity of the system to cope with projected
traffic growth and avoid major bottlenecks. This objective has been largely
achieved. The present system is reasonably balanced and there is little
uneconomic allocation of traffic among the various modes. Large investments
in transport infrastructure have been complemented by a considerable effort to
improve the efficiency of the transport system, through the establishment and
strengthening of institutions to plan, construct, maintain and operate the
facilities and services, in many instances with increasing financial and
managerial responsibility of semi-autonomous public corporations.
3.        The Government's basic policy focus in the transport  ector during
the current Sixth Plan period (1987-91) is to (a) increase transport
efficiency, capacity and quality; (b) provide transport facilities that are
balanced regionally; and (c) improve transport administration. The Government
will seek to achieve the above objectives, inter alia, through a more rational
distribution of the means of transport; maximum utilization of existing
facilities with optimization of new investments; and investments aimed to
improve transport in the largest cities.
4.        Kyonggi region, which encircles Seoul, the capital city, and Inchon,
the country's second largest port, includes the two busiest transport corri-
dors in Korea, namely the Seoul-Inchon corridor and the northern section of
the Seoul-Pusan corridor. About 40% of Korea's total population lives in the
region, mostly in 21 cities or towns, each with more than 100,000 people. In
1983, about 42% of the nation's GNP was generated in the region. This
concentration of population and economic activity has resulted in an explosive
demand for transport infrastructure and services, but despite major invest-
ments, the supply of trarsport infrastructure has not kept pace with traffic
growth, partly because of the recent increase in car ownership due to rising



-2-
incomes. Government has therefore adopted relocation policies which aim at
limiting Seoul's growth and inducing population and economic activity to move
to the southern and eastern areas of the Kyonggi region. However, transport
far.ilities between smaller cities are generally poor and traffic problems are
increasing. Consequently, there is a critical need for an improved road
network in the Kyonggi region.
5.        Project Objectives.  In addition to helping meet road transport
demand in two important corridors by financing the construction of two high-
capacity toll expressways, the proposed project would support the Government's
general objective of increasing the efficiency of transport in the Kyonggi
region. Secific policy, institutional and technological objectives to be
addressed under the project include: (a) to support the ongoing process of
coordinating transport investment planning and monitoring the implementation
of transport facilities in the region; (b) to support the preparation of a
comprehensive transport investment program for the region; this program should
take into account the resources that are 'ikely to be available for transport
investments; and (c) to improve traffic management in the secondary cities
served by the new expressway.
6.        Project Description.  In line with these objectives, the proposed
project would include: (a) construction of four-lane toll expressways between
Pangyo and Kuri (23.8 km) and between Shingal and Panwol (23.4 km) in Kyonggi
region; (b) consultants' advisory services for the supervision of expressway
construction; (c) regular consultation with the Bank in the ongoing process of
coordinating transport planning, ard in the preparation of an investment
program for transport in the regior.; and (d) a government commitment to
conduct: a traffic management study in four secondary cities where traffic
patteru.s would be affected by the new expressways. Project implementation is
expected to take five years.
7.        The total project cost is estimated at US$448.2 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$153.0 million (34%). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule, are given
in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
showing project locations is also attached. A Staff Appraisal Report, No.
6619-KO, dated January 4, 1988 is being distributed separately.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In 1983, during discussions on
transport sector development with the Government based on Bank Report No.
4423-KO (Transport Sector Issues Survey--December 27, 1983), a consensus
emerged on the importance of coordinating and integrating the different modal
transport plans in the Kyonggi region. The Bank suggested that the merits of
an integrated planning approach could be demonstrated through a specific
project that would bring sector agencies together in a coordinated effort.
Recent government spatial policies have emphasized the high priority of
dispersing the large population of Seoul by promoting urban growth centers to
the south and east of the city, and the Government is proposing to use the
location of major new highways and rail lines to influence future settlement
patterns as well as provide better access to the city. If such transport



- 3-
demands are to be met efficiently and economically, it is essential that an
integrated transport plan for the region be developed and implemented
encompassing all modes of transport. The proposed project constitutes the
first phase of such a plan which is being finalized by the government to meet
growing demand over the next ten years, and supports existing mechanisms for
the coordination of transport planning in the region.
9.        Actions Agreed at Negotiations.  The Government has agreed to the
following actions: (a) to endorse a Government statement which supports
transport planning and coordination in the Kyonggi region, (b) to furnish the
Bank with a draft of its transport investment program for the region
(currently being prepared) and to invite the Bank to provide comments, (c) to
consult annually with the Bank during the execution of the program, and (d) to
carry out a study on traffic management in four secondary cities affected by
the project expressways.
10.       Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected primarily from the savings in vehicle operating costs (fuel, lubri-
cants, tires, maintenance and depreciation) that occur because of road network
improvements. Savings from accident reduction were not included in the
quantification of benefits. Project costs comprise construction and
maintenance costs, measured in economic terms. On the above basis, the
internal economic rate of return (ERR) for the Shingal-Panwol expressway is
39% and fo- the Pangyo-Kuri expressway is 24%; the overalL ERR is 31%. If
estimates of the value of time saved were also included in the benefits, they
would increase the economic return by about four percentage points.
11.       Risks, The risk in project implementation is considered low, since
Korean authorities have accumulated considerable experience in large-scale
road projects. Even in the unlikely event that construction costs were to
exceed estimates by 20%, the ERR for the project would still be higher than
27% which is ample fcr economic justification.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
