As a first stage in multimodal transport\n            investments needed to meet transport demand, two\n            high-capacity toll expressways would be constructed under\n            the project as parts of future bypass roads around Seoul.\n            In parallel with the expressway construction, Government\n            would further strengthen transport coordination in the\n            region and also conduct a traffic management study in\n            secondary cities affected by the new expressways.  Further,\n            a dialogue  would be maintained with the Bank concerning\n            planned research on traffic flow and congestion analysis\n            preliminary to preparation of a Highway Capacity Manual for\n            Korean conditions."}, "docdt": "1988-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
