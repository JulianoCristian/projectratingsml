Road rehabilitation has a positive overall\n            impact, particularly on the social and economic\n            environments. The major potential downsides are physical\n            (e.g., damage to soil, sand encroachment, flora and fauna,\n            loss of habitat, deforestation) and social (disruption of\n            life, resettlement, loss of cultural sites). The potential\n            effects of road rehabilitation on soil, flora, and fauna\n            have been assessed on every road, especially in the\n            biologically diverse eco-regions. Five of the 350 roads\n            provide greater access to sensitive areas. This could\n            intensify existing pressure on virgin forests and on native\n            fauna. Nevertheless, such effects will be mitigated by\n            measures such as by creating the \"Gestions Locales de\n            Securite (GELOSE) and other similar institutions to protect\n            the environment. For roads going through damaged areas,\n            environmental measures (e.g., reforestation, drainage pit\n            stabilization) will be appraised in the field during\n            preparation of the detailed design studies. Other\n            environmental measures include drainage to reduce water\n            pollution; and road paving and using labor-intensive methods\n            to reduce dust."}, "docdt": "2010-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
