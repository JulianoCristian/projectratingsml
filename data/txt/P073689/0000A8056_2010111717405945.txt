                         Since September, the Road Authority has moved forward and made significant progress vis-à-vis the procurement of the related works and supervision activities. RFP to select the
                         supervision consultants for the works on RN13 and RN14 have been drafted, including the short lists. Bidding documents for the works are well advanced. Required EIE and RAP
                         have been submitted to the Bank.
