1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     The rural poverty rate rose from 74.5 percent in 1993 to 76.7 percent in 1999 although
the overall poverty rate remained broadly stable in the 1990s. The worsening of rural poverty
was associated with increased geographical isolation caused by the deterioration of rural
transport infrastructure. Incidentally, the higher the percentage of population with reliable
transport access was in a given province, the lower the poverty rate. Furthermore, the social and
economic impact of the post-election crisis in 2002 was substantial, especially in the rural areas.
Farm prices, basically halved, causing an unprecedented drop in rural incomes.

2.      The Government and development partners, including the World Bank, pledged about
United States Dollars (US$) 300 million to improve rural transport infrastructure. More
specifically, what was planned was to finance a comprehensive set of activities including
rehabilitation of rural roads, the rehabilitation of the 163 km railway between Fianarantsoa and
Manakara, and development of intermediate means of transport 1. The contribution of the World
Bank to the program was the Rural Transport Project (RTP), which contributed to the interim
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives of improving the accessibility of the rural
population to basic services and stimulating rural agricultural production through the
enhancement of rural mobility and the reduction of travel time and cost. Rural transport featured
prominently in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Improved access
was identified as a key aspect to improve livelihood and foster economic growth.

3.      The project was the second phase on an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) series. The APL
series supported the Government strategy and policy in the transport sector which aimed at: (i)
focusing the relevant Ministries roles in strategic planning, oversight, and coordination; (ii)
creating jointly public-private controlled and user-financed agencies for sub-sector management
and regulatory functions; (iii) divesting operational activities to the private sector; (iv)
developing the local private sector for works design and execution; and (v) rehabilitating
transport infrastructure to appropriate levels. The first phase APL, the Transport Sector Reform
and Rehabilitation Project (TSRRP), in the amount of about US$66 million, was approved on
June 1, 2000, and closed on July 31, 2005 2. The outcomes as well as the Bank and Borrower
performance were rated satisfactory. The sustainability was rated likely. These ratings were
confirmed during the Independent Evaluation Group review of the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR). The TSRRP (APL1) focused on critical reforms in the transport sector, and on
priority transport infrastructure investments.

4.     Originally, the APL series was planned to have four phases: (i) TSRRP-APL1; (ii) an
APL2 of about US$20 million planned to focus on strengthening the civil aviation and railway
sub-sectors; (iii) an APL3 of about US$34 million to focus on rural transport; and, (iv) an APL4
of about US$100 million to finance investments in the roads and ports sub-sectors. However, the


1
  Intermediate Means of Transport include a wide range of devices and vehicles occupying the middle ground
between walking and modern four-wheeled motor vehicle.

design of the APL was modified. What was supposed to be APL3 became APL2 and its amount
was significantly increased. What were supposed to be APL2 and APL4 were merged into APL3
in the amount of about US$150 million. The project (RTP-APL2), subject of the Implementation
Completion and Results Report, was approved on November 14, 2002, and the Transport
Infrastructure Investment Project (TIIP-APL3) was approved one year later on December 8,
2003. The TIIP-APL3 closed on June 30, 2012 3 , six months before the RTP -APL2. The
outcomes as well as the Bank and Borrower performance were rated moderately satisfactory. The
risk to development outcomes was rated high.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.     The development objective of the project was to sustainably improve the access of rural
communities to markets, schools, health centers and other economic and social infrastructure,
and to enhance the mobility of the rural population, in order to improve their quality of life and
promote economic development.

6.      The key performance indicators were: (i) traffic on the rehabilitated road network
increases annually by 10 percent; (ii) six million people who currently do not have reliable
access will be provided with reliable access; and (iii) significant improvement of rural well-being
indicators such as school attendance and morbidity.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

7.      During the restructuring of July 2007, the development objective of the project was
significantly simplified as follows - “increased use of rural roads by residents of beneficiary rural
communes”. The key performance indicators were adjusted accordingly to: (i) motorized and
non-motorized traffic on the rehabilitated road network increases annually by 10 percent; (ii) one
million people who currently do not have reliable access will be provided with reliable access;
and (iii) 20 percent reduction in travel time on rehabilitated rural roads. The key indicator on
rural well-being was dropped.

8.       The 2007 restructuring was necessary since the original PDO and the key performance
indicators were far too broad and captured key outcomes which could not be attributed entirely
to the project activities. Moreover, because of implementation problems, some components and
activities were either dropped, reduced, or significantly modified.

9.      Although the PDO and the key performance indicators were not changed during the
September 2010 adaptive restructuring, the project scope was revised to respond to the
emergency transport infrastructure rehabilitation needs as a result of the political crisis starting in
early 2009.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The primary target group initially was the 6 million people living in partially or
completely inaccessible rural areas throughout Madagascar which would benefit from reliable
transport access. Moreover, the labor-based construction and the rural infrastructure
rehabilitation/maintenance would provide jobs to the rural youth and women. In addition, the
Ministries/entities in charge of rural transport infrastructure and the Fianarantsoa – Manakara
corridor were expected to receive institutional support. Finally, rural households were expected
to benefit from the development of intermediate means of transportation.

11.     As a result of the project restructurings, the primary target group was revised
substantially downwards to about 1 million people living in rural area which was the expected
number of persons benefiting of reliable access as a result of the rural roads improvement
directly financed by the project. The original 6 million rural population target was the expected
cumulative number of beneficiaries of all projects and investments in rural transport in
Madagascar at the time of appraisal. In addition, because of the cancellation of the components
on intermediate means of transportation and the Fianarantsoa - Manakara railway corridor due to
unsatisfactory implementation, the target groups of these activities were dropped from the list of
original beneficiaries.

12.     After the September 2010 adaptive restructuring, the project funded the rehabilitation of
some sections and bridges on the National Roads network in rural areas, the rural population
living in their influence zone was also among the main beneficiaries as well as travelling public,
car owners, and transport companies.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.     Implementation arrangements. At approval, the Program Executive Secretariat (PES)
was fully in charge of all aspects of the project. Due to its declining performance, the PES was
closed in June 2005. A consortium comprising international and local auditing firms was
recruited to ensure the fiduciary functions (financial management and procurement) and the
Road Authority took over the project’s technical, social, and environmental implementation.

20.    At approval, an RTU was created and attached to the PES. The RTU was in charge of
overseeing the implementation of the rural transport policy and strategy. Since the RTU was
never made fully operational, in terms of staff and equipment, it was decided in June 2005 to


                                                        6
change it into a Rural Road Unit (RRU). When the PES was closed, the RRU was attached to the
newly created Road Authority.

21.    Financing parameters. The new country financing parameters allowing for 100 percent
financing of all project expenditure including taxes and recurrent expenditures was adopted
during the July 2007 restructuring. At approval, the percentage of expenditures to be financed by
the Project varied from 80 to 100 percent depending on the components.

22.      Freeze on disbursements. Due to the political crisis starting in early 2009, Madagascar
is still operating under OP/BP7.30 “dealing with de facto government”. Project disbursements
were frozen for about 14 months (from March 2009 to May 2010), and no payments were made
including for completed activities. Project disbursement resumed in May 2010.

23.    Closing date was extended twice. At approval on November 14, 2002, the project was
expected to close on December 31, 2009. During the restructuring of July 2007, the project
closing date was extended to December 31, 2010. During the restructuring of September 2010,
following the lifting of the freeze on disbursement as a result of the 2009 political crisis, the
closing date was extended to December 31, 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     Project design did not incorporate all lessons learned from past experiences. The
following lesson mentioned in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not seem to be taken
into account in the project design: “the sustainability of the rural transport infrastructure would
not be ensured if a clear institutional and financing arrangement for the management and
maintenance of these infrastructures is not effective”. The weak institutional framework for the
management of the rural road network had a major negative impact on the implementation of the
project, and on the sustainability of the rural road assets that were rehabilitated. Nevertheless, the
project adopted the following key lessons: (i) the rehabilitation design of low volume rural road
had to focus primarily on drainage works, structures, and critical spots in order to ensure year
round access and to ensure cost effectiveness; and (ii) support to intermediate means of transport
to complement the improvement in rural transport infrastructure in order to enhance rural
mobility.

25.      The project was overly complex in its design and ambitious in its objectives. The
project, which was supposed to complement the pledged interventions of other development
partners, and support the overarching objectives of the World Bank APL transport sectors series
in Madagascar, attempted to tackle all of the following critical rural transport issues: (i)
institutional framework to manage the rural transport network; (ii) rural transport infrastructure
rehabilitation and maintenance; (iii) introduction on a large scale of intermediate means of
transportation; and (iv) rehabilitation of the Southern Railway including the Port of Manakara.
Furthermore, the all of the project activities and components were not adequately funded. This
means that if all project components were fully implemented, a funding gap would have
probably arisen.



                                                  7
26.    The project did not identify all major risks. The risk of a weak implementation
capacity of the Borrower as well as the private sector (contractors, design and supervision firms)
was not adequately identified and discussed.

27.     All the above factors made the project meant that the project had a low quality at entry
and consequently was difficult to implement. Nevertheless, the results chain was appropriate. By
addressing all the issues identified in the project, the first level objectives, which were the
improvement of rural accessibility and mobility, would be attained. Thus, the second level
objectives that were the improvement of the quality of life and the promotion of economic
development would be achieved since lack of accessibility and rural poverty were linked.
However, the improvement of rural accessibility and mobility was necessary but not sufficient to
improve the well-being of the rural population and to promote economic development.

2.2 Implementation

28.    The implementation of the project can be broken down into three key periods: the first
period until the 1st restructuring of 2007; the second period until the suspension of disbursement
in 2009; and the third period from the 2nd restructuring of 2010 until project closing.

(a) From effectiveness in March 2003 to the restructuring of July 2007

29.     The amounts pledged to fund the country’s rural road component did not
materialize. For example, 9,000 km of rural roads were planned to be rehabilitated as a result of
all the promised financing, of which 3,000 km were expected to be financed by the project.
However, many pledges did not materialize from several development partners and Government,
leading to a much lower scope of investment. Moreover, no monitoring mechanism was put in
place to follow-up on the financing.

30.     The institutional arrangements agreed at project approval were not effective leading
to a slow implementation. The RTU that was expected to be in charge of overseeing the
implementation of the rural transport policy and strategy was not operational when project
implementation commenced. The Provincial Road Authorities that were expected to be in charge
of the operational implementation of the rural roads rehabilitation works were never created.
(The lack of sustainable financial resources to operate the Provincial Road Authorities was the
main reason behind their non-creation.) Thus, the PES was made in charge of the implementation
of the rural roads rehabilitation works. Furthermore, when the rural roads rehabilitation financed
by the project was completed, the Rural Road Unit was closed.

31.    Full rehabilitation was undertaken for the rural roads instead of the agreed basic
access standard. The fact rural roads were fully rehabilitated meant that: (i) the cost per
kilometer was much higher leading to only about 1400 km of rural roads being rehabilitated
against an original target of 3000 km; and (ii) fewer labor based works contracts could be
funded; less person-days and cash revenue for local laborers were generated by the project.

32.    The rehabilitated rural roads were not properly maintained. At approval, it was
agreed that the maintenance of the rehabilitated rural roads would be ensured. However, this was



                                                8
not the case. This is because the RMF did not have sufficient budget to ensure the maintenance
of the rural road network in good or even fair condition. In addition, the choice of the rural roads
to be maintained in a given year was not done based on prioritized objective criteria. Instead,
scarce maintenance resources were often allocated on the basis of political pressure or local
interests.

33.     Poor performance of contractors and consultant firms. In some cases, the realized
rural road works were not of a good quality standard. In these cases, the design and supervision
consultants did not fully ensure their duties as well. (The issue of poorly constructed road
infrastructure, which negatively affected the sustainability of rural roads, is no unique to
Madagascar and is very often flagged in the construction sector in developing countries.) To
improve the quality of rural road works executed, international individual consultant and some
local experts were hired with positive results.

34.     Financing rehabilitation of non-rural roads 4. At approval, the project was intended to
rehabilitate roads among the Temporary or Tertiary National Road, Provincial Road, and
Municipal or Community Road. These roads, most of which were not paved (expect in some
urban area) were planned to be managed at a decentralized level. However, the project financed
the rehabilitation of 366 km of Primary National Road of which 90 km paved, and the
rehabilitation of 17 km of Secondary National Road. The reason for including some primary road
network roads for rehabilitation was to meet emerging rehabilitation needs or complement other
projects in the road sector. The rehabilitation of non-rural roads improved the accessibility of the
rural population in the roads influence zone, by providing a network effect between the
secondary/tertiary road network and the primary road network.

35.     The Intermediate Means of Transport (IMT) component and the transport
infrastructure at community level sub-component (footbridge, track for ox-carts, etc.) were
inadequately prepared. As a result, these activities were stopped a few years after effectiveness
because the corresponding institutional frameworks were never effective. Furthermore, the
management of this component by the PES was not appropriate due to the decentralized nature
of the activity.

36.     Failure to concession the Southern Railway and the Port of Manakara. When the
only technically acceptable bidder for the concession put a requirement for financial subsidies in
its proposal to operate the Southern Railway, the Government rejected the offer and cancelled
the entire concession process. Consequently, the planned rehabilitation works to be financed by
the project could not take place because a successful concessionning was a disbursement
condition. This has meant both the railway and the Port of Manakara did not benefit from better
management and investments which the concession process and the project were supposed to
bring.




4
  Rural Transport Infrastructure includes the intra and near village transport network, as well as the infrastructure that provides
access to higher levels of the road network (World Bank Technical Paper 496 – Design and Appraisal of Rural Transport
Infrastructure)


                                                                  9
37.     1st project restructuring. The PDO and the activities were narrowed into what could be
reasonably achieved taking into account slow project implementation, inadequate project
implementation framework, and inadequate funding to implement all project activities. A pilot
performance based-contract supposed to improve road maintenance was introduced in place of
the rehabilitation of rural roads. The Agency for the Execution of Public Interest Works (Agence
des Travaux d’Intérêt Publique, AGETIPA) which was not part of the project at approval was
made the implementing agency of this new activity.

(b) From the restructuring of July 2007 up to the freeze in disbursements of March 2009

38.     The 1st restructuring did not improve project implementation because of weak
institutional framework and lack of appropriate capacity. Less than 10 percent was disbursed
during a period of about 20 months after the 1st restructuring. A second corrective restructuring
was prepared but was put on hold due to the political crisis starting in 2009.

39.    Failure to adopt a social plan for the Southern Railway and the Port of Manakara.
The financing of the implementation of the social plan was added to the project when the
concessionning had failed. However, no acceptable social plan was ever submitted by
Government.

40.     The pilot performance-based road works which were introduced during the 1st
restructuring did not start because the required upstream activities such as training,
prioritization of the rural roads, took longer time than expected.

41.     Protracted political crisis starting from 2009. Violent civil unrest started in late 2008,
and a mutiny ousted the President of Madagascar in March 2009. A transitional government has
been in place since then and the country remains in political turmoil. The protracted political
crisis has affected the implementation of the project in the following manner:
   •   Field visits were restricted for safety reasons;
   •   Fuel levy allocated to the RMF substantially decreased from about Malagasy Ariary
       (MGA) 100 billion (about US$50 million) in 2009 to about MGA16.7 billion (about
       US$8.35 million) in 2012 severely affecting the quality of the road network;
   •   The performance of the RMF has deteriorated with the financing of non-road activities,
       such as levee and dike rehabilitation, as well as the increase in the use of direct
       contracting and single-source selection;
   •   No new transport sector project/operation was financed by external donors;
   •   No tangible progress has been made since the onset of the political crisis on the transport
       sector reform process supported by the World Bank APL series; and
   •   The state of the road infrastructure network deteriorated sharply due to a lack of
       maintenance and investment funding caused by the crisis.

42.   Freezing of disbursement and application of OP7.30 to whole Madagascar portfolio:
The 2009 political crisis caused the World Bank to apply the OP7.30 (dealing with de facto



                                                 10
governments) to its activities in Madagascar, which has not yet been lifted. Disbursements were
totally frozen in March 2009 for a period of about 14 months. For about one year, high level
discussion with the Borrower was limited. When the disbursement freeze was lifted in May 2010,
an adaptive restructuring was prepared as part of the restructuring of the entire World Bank
portfolio in Madagascar to mitigate the immediate impacts of the crisis. The project was
restructured to focus on emergency works. Although, these emergency works were not part of
the rural road network per se, they were selected to directly benefit rural populations.

(c) From the adaptive restructuring of September 2010 up until project closing

43.     As a result of the adaptive restructuring, project implementation improved because
of the following reasons: (i) most of the emergency road works that were added to the project
had already initiated by either the TIIP-APL3 or other development partners; (ii) unlike the rural
roads, the institutional framework to manage the National Roads network was clearly defined
and functioned reasonably well. Furthermore, the implementing unit (the Road Authority) had
the required capacity to implement the emergency works that were added to the project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) M&E design

44.     Original PDO indicators were in line with the original PDO. The traffic data and the
number of population with reliable rural road access captured respectively the mobility and the
accessibility aspects. The rural well-being indicators covered the improvement in life quality.
The intermediate outcome indicators were adequate and embraced the outcomes/outputs of each
component. However, the target values of some intermediate outcome indicators went far beyond
the project activities and included all identified interventions in the corresponding sub-sector. In
addition, not all baseline and target values were precisely defined.

45.     Outputs and outcomes inadequately captured by the revised M&E framework.
When the PDO was narrowed as a result of the project restructuring, the M&E framework was
revised to reflect what the project could be held accountable for. However, the remaining PDO
indicators captured only the outcomes of the rural roads rehabilitation activities which were
already realized by 2008. The outputs and the outcomes of the about 380 km of National Roads
added during implementation were not taken into account by the M&E framework of the project.
This is because the rehabilitation of National Roads was being monitored by other projects, such
as the TIIP (APL-3).

(b) M&E framework implementation

46.      Data collection particularly on road traffic was weak. There was a lack of periodic
reliable data on traffic and road conditions. No regular traffic counting and road surveys were
undertaken. The few ad-hoc ones were financed by development partners, including the project
itself. Furthermore, the Rural Access Index (RAI) which is a key transport indicator was not
adequately monitored. Nevertheless, some indicators such as the length of rehabilitated road, the




                                                11
percentage of road maintenance funds allocated to rural roads were made available and
monitored.

(c) M&E framework utilization

47.    Given the issues mentioned above, the M&E framework was not used as a primary tool
for decision-making. In addition, the archiving system was weak making it difficult or even
impossible to find some earlier information and documentation which could help in the decision-
making process. This factor also hindered the preparation of the ICR since some of the key
information on road works implemented early in the project was hard to access.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Safeguard

48.      The project was classified as a category A project which was quite common for rural
transport projects prepared during that period. Three safeguards policies were triggered at
approval: (i) Environmental Assessment (OP/BP4.01), (ii) Natural Habitats (OP/BP4.04), and
(iii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP4.12). There was no significant deviation or waiver from
the World Bank safeguards policies and procedures during preparation and implementation. In
addition, the Natural Habitats policies and procedures were not finally triggered because of the
project scope reduction during implementation (fewer rural roads, cancellation of the
rehabilitation of the Fianarantsoa Manakara corridor). More details are provided in annex 10.

(b) Fiduciary

49.      The fiduciary compliance situation of the project can be divided into two periods: before
the closure of the PES in 2005 and after its closure. Before the closure of the PES, the following
occurred: (i) poor archiving; (ii) unclear share of responsibilities among the procurement staff;
(iii) non-compliance with the procurement rules for certain activities. On the financial
management side, there were some weaknesses on internal financial control: (i) purchase order
established after the invoice; (ii) absence of the World Bank no-objection for some expenses;
(iii) inefficient use of gasoline coupons; (iv) assets not regularly registered; and (v) non-use of
the asset management software.

50.     However, after the PES’s closure in 2005, the situation improved. The new team that was
recruited to be in charge of the financial management and procurement tasks provided qualified
and experienced personnel. They complied with the World Bank procurement rules and
guidelines, and put in place adequate financial management arrangements over the course of the
implementation period. The quarterly financial reports and annual audit reports were submitted
to the Bank on a timely basis, and recommendations made subsequent to implementation support
missions were appropriately implemented. The internal controls were spelt out in a Procedures
Manual, and amendments to the Manual were made on a periodic basis in order to take into
account changes in the project’s operations. Despite the absence of the internal audit function, an
internal check mechanism was in place to ensure the appropriate use of project resources.




                                                12
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51.     The main expected post-completion phase of the project was the regular maintenance of
the rehabilitated rural roads by the Government via the RMF. The RMF was initially able to
finance some rural roads maintenance, but its financial resources have significantly decreased
since the beginning of the current political crisis. This situation undermines the sustainability of
the rural roads rehabilitated under the project as well as the entire road network. This was one of
the reasons why the project had to be restructured in 2010 to focus on emergency rehabilitation,
and a new project (the Emergency Infrastructure Preservation and Vulnerability Reduction
Project) in the amount of about US$102 million was prepared and approved in end-November
2012. The objective of this multisectoral project is to preserve key lifeline infrastructure
including roads and reduce household vulnerability.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

52.     Decreasing importance of rural roads/rural transport infrastructure. Since the
beginning of the 2009 political crisis, both the Government and development partners have
reprioritized investment funding away from rural transport infrastructure. For example, the
current World Bank Interim Strategy Note puts little emphasis on rural roads/rural transport even
if it recognizes the necessity to address rural poverty. This is understandable as the ISN is
focusing on short-term emergency activities with a transitional government while the
improvement of rural roads/rural transport in Madagascar requires a medium to long-term vision
within a strong institutional context. Thus, the relevance of the project at the time of the ICR has
become moderate due to the changed priorities. The introduction of the rehabilitation on the non-
rural roads (National Roads) during implementation confirmed this. Nevertheless, the latest
available value of the RAI for Madagascar (25 percent) is substantially below the average RAI
for Sub-Saharan Africa (34 percent). This means that the development of rural roads/rural
transport remains fully relevant for the development of Madagascar.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

53.     As per the ICR guidelines, split evaluation was done due to that fact that the PDO was
substantially revised during implementation. Since one PDO revision took place, the assessment
will be broken down into 2 periods: (i) the first period until the first restructuring of 2007 which
included a simplification of the PDO; and (ii) the second period until project closing which
included the second restructuring of 2010.

(a) First period up until the restructuring of July 2007

54.    Although the traffic on the rehabilitated rural roads increased and school attendance in its
influence zone improved, only about 1 million out of the planned 6 million people living in rural
areas were provided with reliable road access. In addition, only about 1400 km out of the




                                                13
planned 9000 km 5 rural roads were rehabilitated under the project. Moreover, the following
targets were not reached: (i) the setting-up of a clear and performing rural roads institutional
framework; (ii) the regular maintenance of all rural roads in good and fair conditions; and (iii)
the rehabilitation of the Fianarantsoa Manakara corridor. In addition, the successful
implementation of the intermediate means of transportation and the transport infrastructure at
community level did not occur.

(b) Second period up until project closing and including the restructuring of September
    2010

55.    The revised target of 1 million people living in rural areas to be provided with reliable
road access was reached. In addition, as a direct result of the rural rehabilitation works, travel
time was reduced by more than 20 percent and traffic increased by more than 10 percent.

56.     About 380 km of National Roads were rehabilitated to a reasonable quality standard.
Because of the rehabilitation of the 276 km unpaved National Roads between Morafenobe,
Maintirano, and Antsalova (RN1b and RN8a), the accessibility and the travel time in the Middle
West (Melaky region) that was one of the most isolated areas of Madagascar also improved. The
rehabilitation of the paved 91 km National Road between Vohiparara and Irondro (RN25)
ensured permanent accessibility to the South East area of Madagascar and decreased the travel
time. The paving of the 17 km National Road between Ambanja and the port of Ankify (RNS30)
improved access and decreased travel time to Nosy-Be Island, which is the main international
tourist destination of the country.

57.     More emergency works than planned were realized due to lower than expected bid prices
from contractors. It included the following: (i) the construction of 18 river jetties on National
Roads instead of the 16 planned; (ii) the construction of 10 bridges/culverts on the RN44South
instead of the 7 bridges/culverts originally planned; (iii) the rehabilitation of 3 bridges on the
RN13; (iv) the repair of the cyclone related damages on the RN25; and (v) the resurfacing of
about 35 km of RN44South. Without these emergency road works there was a substantial risk
that the following would occur: (i) traffic would be interrupted; (ii) bridges/culverts would have
collapsed; (iii) the accessibility and the mobility of the rural population in the project influence
zone would be further reduced because there would be no affordable alternative way to access
them; (iv) the use of rural roads that linked the rural communes to the National Roads would
decrease; and (v) the Alaotra region, which is the main rice producer area, and the Anosy region,
where is located the only one port of Madagascar would be isolated.

58.    However, the following expected targets were not reached: (i) the rehabilitation and
maintenance of 200 km of rural roads using a performance-based method which was dropped
during the 2nd restructuring; (ii) the allocation of 30 percent of the budget of the Road
Maintenance Fund for the maintenance of the rural roads network; and (iii) the staff
retrenchment plan for the Southern Railway.

3.3 Efficiency

59.     The efficiency of the project is rated modest because of the following: (i) the agreed
efficiency measure to do spot improvements in order to provide basic access standard on selected
rural roads was not followed. Full rehabilitation was undertaken even though there were no more
than 50 vehicles per day on the rural roads selected; (ii) although a cost-effectiveness indicator 7
was used to define a set of priority rural roads, some of the rehabilitation works made on rural
roads were not in the priority list; and (iii) although the rehabilitation on the National Roads was
relevant taking into account their geographical location and level of traffic, no economic analysis
was undertaken to support the investment decision. The lack of accurate data on road traffic
could explain this. Nevertheless, the added Emergency Works component was efficient since
more works than planned were realized without any additional financing.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

60.    The overall outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory because of the following: (i) the
relevance is Moderate; (ii) efficacy was Moderately Unsatisfactory; and, (iii) efficiency was
Modest. In addition, sustainability is weak given the lack of appropriate maintenance and the
ambiguity on the institutional framework.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

61.     The Rural Poverty decreased as shown in the table below. The improvement in rural
accessibility, which was partly supported by the project contributed to that reduction. However,
the poverty rate started increasing again in 2010 due primarily to the political crisis that started in
2009. On the gender aspect, female population constituted more than half of the rural population
benefitting from the project. In addition, about 15,000 women- day were employed to realize the
crushed stone works on the RN44.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

62.     The institutional strengthening supported by the project was limited to the provision of
technical assistance, analytical works, materials, and equipment to the ministries and agencies
working in rural transport. Nevertheless, the project contributed in reinforcing the capacity of the
ministries and the Road Authority to deal with environmental and social safeguards. The
environment units of these institutions got the capacity to manage the requirements of the
safeguards policies and procedures.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

63.     The availability and affordability of transport services improved as a result of the roads
improvement works. In addition, the contracts linked to the road infrastructure works provided
jobs to different categories of persons ranging from unskilled worker to newly graduated youth
technicians. Furthermore, the capacity of small and medium firms in civil engineering was
reinforced with the experience gained in roads rehabilitation financed by the project.

64.      Road safety on the RN44 improved considerably with the construction of 10 new two-
lane bridges and culvert in place of the old one-lane structures. In addition, air quality improved
as a result of the paving of the unpaved section of the RN44 going through two populated
localities that had major dust problems before the project.

Political instability and uncertainty
Since early 2009, Madagascar has undergone a deep political crisis without any successful
way out so far. The economy has stalled, income per capita has fallen, insecurity has                S          H
worsened, and poverty has increased. The situation will continue to worsen unless the crisis
is resolved.
Lack of clear and performing institutional framework in rural transport
There is often some confusion among the different entities involved in rural transport. There
is no clear division of responsibilities between the central ministries, the Regional                H          M
Directorate of Public Works, the Regions, and the Communes. Different implementation
arrangements exist in rural transport operations.
Worsening operational and financial situation of the Road Maintenance Fund
Since the beginning of the 2009 political crisis, the fuel levy dedicated to road maintenance
is not fully recovered. Even before the crisis, maintenance funding was inadequate.
                                                                                                     H          H
Moreover, the use of the road maintenance funds is not always done in a transparent and
efficient manner. The impact is that the rehabilitated infrastructure and the road network
will not be maintained correctly and could deteriorate prematurely.
Use of the traditional wooden cartwheels with narrow metal rims
It is recognized that this kind of ox-cart, extensively used in the highlands of Madagascar,
damages roads due to the use of narrow wheels. However, immediate ban is not possible as
                                                                                                     H          S
the cartwheel issue is complex. They are often owned by low income persons who justify
their use by its affordability, availability, endurance, low cost maintenance (puncture free),
good brakes, and high clearance.
Inability to reinforce rain barrier
In order to protect rural roads against damage during the rainy seasons, several rain barriers
were put in place to stop heavy trucks from using the roads after rains. However, they are
                                                                                                     H          S
no longer functioning for several reasons: political crisis, trucks owners and drivers refusal
to comply with instructions, lack of authority of the persons or entity in charge of the rain
barrier, etc.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66.     During preparation, strong analytical on rural poverty was done giving a strong rationale
to intervene in rural transport. Furthermore, at the time of preparation, the project was in line
with the Government strategies, with the World Bank strategy in the country, and with the other
development partners’ contribution. Moreover, the project partly recognized the substantial risk
rating of the activities it was supporting.

67.      However, considering the weak institutional context and inadequate funding available,
the design of the project was overly complex and ambitious since it tried to address a wide gamut
of critical issues in rural transport in Madagascar. In addition, the project tried to introduce the
concept of Performance Based Contracts (PBCs) for rural road maintenance for the first time in
Madagascar with inadequate preparation. Furthermore, the implementation arrangements of the
project were inadequate and not ready at approval. More specifically, although the PES was
already in place and functioning, it was not the case for the RTU, the Provincial Road


                                                         17
Authorities, and the entities in charge of the IMT and the transport infrastructure at community
level. This was a major project design flaw which hindered project implementation from the start.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     The World Bank acted proactively during supervision to restructure the project to
respond to both exogenous and endogenous shocks that affected the implementation of the
project. More specifically, comprehensive action plans were prepared each time major issues
affecting implementation arose. If the defined action plan was not satisfactorily implemented, the
project was restructured. Three major restructuring were prepared during implementation (the
second one was not submitted for final approval because of the 2009 crisis) to improve project
performance and to adapt to the changed circumstances on the ground. The World Bank was
innovative in introducing the performance-based approach which was an alternative to deal with
a lack of regular maintenance although the Borrower was not able to timely implement it. The
World Bank was realistic in undertaking an emergency bridge reconstruction program when road
rehabilitation and maintenance were not performing. In fact, bridges require less maintenance
than roads, yet their role in ensuring permanent accessibility is more critical due to the nature of
the terrain in Madagascar. The World Bank was flexible and focused on the overall development
impacts by using the project to follow-up on activities initiated under the TIIP (APL-3) and other
development partner funded projects.

69.     However, the weaknesses of the M&E framework could have been corrected to more
effectively capture all the outputs and outcomes of the project. The revised targets for PDO
indicators were reached before the 2nd project restructuring. Furthermore, the ratings in the ISR
seemed to be rather optimistic and did not fully reflect the difficulties faced by the project during
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

70.     The combination of a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating at Entry and a Moderately
Satisfactory rating during supervision is Moderately Unsatisfactory provided that the outcomes
are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

71.     Although a strong commitment was shown during preparation, the Government did not
take the necessary actions to properly implement the project. Such actions included: (i) the
timely staffing of the Rural Transport Unit; (ii) the updating of the rural transport policy and
strategy; (iii) the decentralization of the management of the rural roads network; (iv) the
implementation of a least-cost methodology for the design of the rural roads; (v) the appropriate
maintenance of the rehabilitated roads; and (iv) the retrenchment of the Southern Railway staff.
Moreover, the last minute cancellation of the concession process for the Southern Railway and



                                                 18
the Port of Manakara was a setback to all the efforts made to save these two critical pieces of
transport infrastructures. Furthermore, there was no synergy between the services and
departments dealing with roads infrastructure and those dealing with the other transport sub-
sectors leading to a difficult coordination during implementation. Moreover, the concept of spot-
improvement was not adopted leading to a much decreased length of rural roads rehabilitated
under the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

72.      Several implementing agencies were involved in the project. Each one had its own
activities and during a certain period of the project life. The PES was closed for unsatisfactory
performance. The newly created association in charge of the IMT component as well as the RTU
did not perform well and does not exist anymore. The RRU was closed de facto after the
completion of the rural roads rehabilitation. The pilot performance-based works implemented by
AGETIPA as well as the transport infrastructure at community level were not realized.
Nevertheless, the emergency activities as well as the intervention on the National Roads
implemented by the Road Authority were achieved in a reasonable quality standard.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

73.    The combination of an Unsatisfactory rating of the Government and the Moderately
Unsatisfactory of the implementing agencies is Moderately Unsatisfactory provided that the
outcomes are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

74.     Complex project design in a low capacity environment leads to poor implementation
and non-attainment of objectives. Major risks and adequate mitigations measures should be
comprehensively identified during project preparation. In fact, the Borrower appeared to be
almost overwhelmed by the scope of reforms and activities supported by the APL series and so
focused only on few ones (setting-up of the central Road Authority, staff retrenchment of the
ministries, and rehabilitation of National Roads). This meant that the institutional strengthening
of rural road management did not occur, making project implementation problematic.

75.     Clear and performing institutional framework is required to be put in place before
implementing a rural transport operation. This requirement was not fulfilled leading to a
difficult implementation. Moreover, the intermediate means of transportation activities and the
community transport infrastructure need the presence of the project at local level to continuously
involve the end-users. This was not the case with the project because the decentralization aspect
did not take place.

76.     Project components/activities should be properly funded to achieve PDOs. The
project clearly faced a mismatch between the resources provided and the activities to be funded.




                                               19
This means that robust and realistic cost estimates must be provided during the preparation of
projects to avoid funding gaps.

77.     The selection of monitorable indicators is essential to monitor the results chain. This
will avoid the case where the project activities are still in progress while the direct target values
are already reached. In addition, the availability of regular and accurate data on traffic is
essential to assess the efficiency of transport project.

78.     Implementation of spot improvement maintenance concept. The introduction of the
spot improvement concept on rural roads requires careful preparation/advocacy/planning for it to
work in the field due to the tendency of road administrations, contractors and consultants to want
to fully rehabilitate rural roads. This means that without full ownership of the spot improvement
maintenance concept and capacity to implement it, it should not be attempted or should be
redefined as a bridges/culvert/drainage works rehabilitation/construction approach.

79.     Realistic traffic forecasts and assumptions are critical when assessing the viability of
railway and port investments. During preparation, assumptions were made that the provision of
fuel to the Fianarantsoa–Manakara area would again be done via the Port of Manakara and the
Southern Railway. However, during implementation, the provision of fuel to the area by road
trucks from the Port of Toamasina via Antananarivo was firmly established. Without the
transport of fuel, the Southern Railway and the Port of Manakara were not commercially viable
unless subsidized.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     This annex compares what were the efficiency assumptions made during project
preparation (before project) and what was the situation after project.

(a) Rehabilitation of rural roads

2.     For the rehabilitation of rural roads, two efficiency assumptions were made during
preparation:
   • Least-cost investment to improve each road section to basic access standard was adopted
       as most of the traffic on the rural roads was less than 50 vehicles per day.
   • Selection cycle was done during which road links were ranked according to the cost per
       population served.

3.       However, these efficiency measures were not followed during project implementation:
     •   Full rehabilitation was realized on all the rural roads.
     •   Road links which were not among the priority list were rehabilitated.

4.      As a result of the changed approach during implementation, (i) the cost of the works was
double than what was estimated (about US$20,000/km instead of US$10,000/km); (ii) fewer
rural roads were improved by the project (about 1,400km instead of about 3,000 km planned);
and (iii) no more selection cycle was undertaken since the first round of selected rural roads was
not even realized. The rural roads rehabilitation component which constituted about 30 percent
of the project amount was not efficient.

(b) Rehabilitation of the Fianarantsoa–Manakara corridor

5.      This is the only project activity having a cost-benefit analysis during preparation. The Net
Present Value, with 10 percent discount rate, was estimated at US$12.5 million for the Southern
Railway, and at US$2.5 million for the Port of Manakara. The Economic Internal Return Rate
was respectively 15.5 and 33 percent for the Southern Railway and the Port of Manakara.
However, this analysis was made on the assumption that the provision of fuel for the region of
Fianarantsoa–Manakara would use this corridor. But, since it was not the case (see below), the
real potential traffic on this corridor was less than expected. In addition, an ex-ante economic
analysis took into account the environmental, social, and agricultural benefits. Financial analysis
realized during implementation showed the exploitation of railway corridor requires subsidies
estimated at about US$500,000 per year. This component which was not implemented
constituted about 12 percent of the project amount at approval.

6.     The Southern Railway and the Port of Manakara were constructed during the colonization
era to be the main transport infrastructure for international traffic to and from the region of
Fianarantsoa and Manakara. During the political crisis of 2002, when the Antananarivo
Toamasina corridor was blocked for several months, the Port of Manakara was even used to
supply the region of Antananarivo in fuel. But, traffic pattern changed because of the
construction and rehabilitation of the road linking the main port of Toamasina with Fianarantsoa
and Manakara via the capital Antananarivo combined with the deterioration of the Southern


                                                30
Railway and the Port of Manakara infrastructure. Thus, only short haul domestic traffic remained
the main user of the Fianarantsoa Manaraka rail corridor.

7.      The supply of fuel of the Fianarantsoa–Manakara area by road from the main Port of
Toamasina was cheaper and more reliable although it represented more hazards. Since then, the
Southern Railway and the Port of Manakara started losing traffic. These two infrastructures
could not be profitable unless the provision of fuel to the region of Fianarantsoa and Manakara is
shifted to both of them. The Port of Manakara has been out of business since 2009. The annual
traffic volume in 2007 and 2008 were respectively about 2,683 and 1,000 tons. In addition, the
dock draught of the Port of Manakara was only about 2.5 meters. International vessels had to
anchor in harbor and transship its freight using smaller boats.

(c) Road Maintenance Fund

8.     A financial forecast of the evolution of the Road Maintenance Fund was done during
preparation. This financial forecast estimated the total requirement to appropriately maintain the
road network.

9.     The actual yearly budgets of the Road Maintenance Fund were more or less equal to the
forecasted amounts during preparation. However, all roads in good and fair conditions were not
maintained correctly. It means that not only the cost for an adequate maintenance of the road
network was underestimated during project preparation, but also the use of the funds was not
adequate.

(d) Rehabilitation and emergency works on the National Roads

10.    The rehabilitation/construction on the National Roads did not have an ex-ante cost-
benefit analysis when introduced during project implementation. This was because of the
unavailability of accurate data on road traffic volumes on the selected sections and the
emergency scope of the works that were done. Thus, without available ex-ante cost-benefit
analysis data available and without accurate traffic data, it was not also possible to do an ex-post
cost-benefit analysis.

11.     However, the emergency works implemented after the restructuring of 2010 can be
considered efficient because it was possible to realize more infrastructure than appraised. Seven
bridges were appraised to be rehabilitated on the RN44 whereas nine bridges and one box-culvert
were realized. Fifteen river jetties were appraised to be constructed, whereas eighteen were
realized. Neither funds reallocation nor additional financing was needed for this particular scope
increase. This was possible due to the drop in bids price as a result of the 2009 crisis. Since the
supply of works was higher than the demand, works prices decreased. In fact, the number and

capacity of contractors increased before the 2009 crisis as a result of the different infrastructure
investment in the country. But, since the beginning of the crisis, infrastructure investment
sharply dropped leading to a lower works prices.

                         SUMMARY OF THE COMPLETION REPORT

Preface

1.     The preparation of the Rural Transport Project (RTP) was initiated during the
implementation of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) series. The APL series preparation started
in 1994. Between 1998 and 2000, the discussion between the World Bank and the Government
of Madagascar (GoM) established the following:

   •   A National Transport Policy, April 2000, and its annexes. These documents were updated
       and integrated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy of 2003.
   •   The Bank Assistance Strategy of 2003.

1. Description of the project

1.1. Context

2.      The start of the RTP occurred within the 2002 post-election crisis. During the first
semester of 2002, this crisis disorganized the public services, decreased the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) by 13 percent, increased the poverty rate from 69.6 percent in 2001 to 80.7
percent in 2002, and deteriorated transport infrastructure. The crisis ended during the second
semester of 2002. A new elected Government was in place. They initiated some socioeconomic
measures such as the liberalization of the economic sectors comprising transport. Combined with
the resumption of external aids, these measures improved the economic situation.

3.      In 2003, the GDP increased by 9.6 percent compared to its value in 2002. The inflation
rate stabilized at about 2.7 percent. But this growth was limited to certain sectors and did not
impact the rural area where live about 75 percent of the population. One third of this rural
population did not have access to basic services such as health, education, and market place
because of the lack of reliable transport infrastructure. In 2004, Madagascar suffered from
external shocks such as cyclones and the drop of the vanilla prices in the international market.

1.2 Objectives

4.     The long-term objective of the entire APL series was to accelerate the poverty reduction
by reducing transport cost and by improving accessibility mainly in rural area. The objective of
the RTP was to sustainably improve the access of rural population to markets, schools, health
centers and other economic and social infrastructure, and to enhance the mobility of the rural
population, in order to improve their quality of life and promote economic development. This
ambitious objective was revised in 2007 as follows: “increased use of rural roads by residents of
beneficiary rural communes”.



                                               37
1.3 Components and institutional arrangements

5.       The project had 6 components:
     •   Capacity building for implementation of rural transport policy and strategy
     •   Rehabilitation of rural transport infrastructure
     •   Maintenance of rural road network
     •   Rehabilitation of the Fianarantsoa–Manakara corridor
     •   Promotion of intermediate means of transport
     •   Emergency works

6.     From 2003 to 2005, the project was managed by the Vice Prime Minister in charge of the
transport sector which was supported by the Program Executive Secretariat (PES). From 2005 to
2012, the project was managed by two ministries (the ministry in charge of public works and the
ministry in charge of transport) which were supported by a consortium of private audit firms that
ensured the fiduciary function.

2. Evaluation of the project

2.1 Design

7.      The design of the RTP that was integrated within the other APL transport projects was
relevant with regard to the needs in Madagascar. Improving the accessibility and the mobility of
the rural population in order to improve their quality of life and to boost economic development
was a priority. In 2003, the transport sector reform was in progress and the PES was temporary
in charge of the implementation while the capacity of the different technical units and executing
agencies was being built.

8.      The lack of capacity of the private sector, particularly the contractors and engineering
firms, was one of the major risks. In addition, the risk that other donors’ financing of the rural
road rehabilitation was not forthcoming did materialize. Furthermore, the assumption that all
rehabilitated roads would be regularly maintained by the Government via the Road Maintenance
Fund (RMF) was not realistic. The RMF as well as the local collectivities did not have the
required financing to ensure the regular maintenance of the roads in good and fair conditions.
Finally, the objective to improve the well-being of rural population was too ambitious. This
objective was dropped during the 2007 restructuring.

2.2 Achievement

                                                        was due to the higher cost than planned as a result

2.3 Coordination and project management

10.    The PES, which was the first main implementing agency of the project, had an extended
scope of responsibilities. Thus, its accountability was clear, leading to a better institutional
coordination. After the closure of the PES, each implementing unit had a limited scope of
responsibilities that required a stronger coordination. Because 2 ministries were involved after
the division of the Vice Prime Minister in charge of transport, coordination and project
management became more difficult.

11.       The following lessons can be drawn:
      •   The capacity of the central ministries should be reinforced so that they are able to
          properly manage complex projects;
      •   The adverse impacts of sector reform should be mitigated so that the central ministries
          always have the required capacity to manage complex projects; and
      •   The coordination arrangement of a project should be formally structured.

2.4 Other project impacts

12.    Although the ministries and the different implementing agencies had at the beginning
some difficulties to comply with the Bank safeguards, their capacity finally improved and so
they were able to fulfill the requirements of the policies and procedures.

3. Critical analyses of the project stakeholders.

3.1 The Bank

13.     The Bank decision to finance 100 percent of all project expenses allowed avoiding the
severe issue of counterpart funding. However, the restriction resulting from the application of the
OP/BP 7.30 has slowed implementation pace. The procedures and process to interact with the
Bank remained unchanged all along the project life despite the different changes of Bank staff.
However, the style of leadership and interaction varies from one Bank staff to another. Initially,
supervision mission took place twice a year. Later on, supervision mission became more frequent
but less heavy. The lesson learned from the collaboration with the Bank is the following: a
working relationship based on a mutual trust and a clear share of responsibilities is conducive to
better results.

3.2 The Government

14.     Because there was no formal interface structure at the highest level of the project
management (General Secretaries of the ministries), the project suffered from the frequent
change of high-level decision-makers persons. Moreover, the setting-up of certain project
structures such as the rural transport unit which became a rural roads unit afterwards was quite
slow. It was also the case for the supporting functions such as monitoring and evaluation and
safeguards. Finally, the spilt of the Vice Prime Minister into two ministries and the impacts of
the crisis of 2002 and 2009 made the project implementation more difficult. The lesson learned


                                                 40
from this is as follow: steady strong ownership on the Government side is necessary to
appropriately implement a project.

3.3 The private sector

15.     The performance of the private sector involved in the project implementation (mainly
contractors and engineering firms) was mixed. Some contractors and firms did correctly their
jobs whereas other did not. Sometimes, their performance depended on the ability of the
Government and the Bank to ensure their role respectively as project owner and project
financier.

4. Prospects

16.    Reform. The restructuring of the ministries in charge of transport was effective and
advanced. Some adjustment might however have to be considered. Nevertheless, the institutional
arrangements in the rural transport subsector still required some reorganization and capacity
building.

17.    Operations. The realized transport infrastructure rehabilitation was generally in a good
standard. Nonetheless, some failure was seen in the rural roads rehabilitation.

18.     Budget. The lack of funds remained a deep problem. Most of the investment was
externally funded. The Government did not have enough resource to invest in transport
infrastructure. But, a good intervention planning and programming is critical. A good resource
allocation between National Roads and rural roads is necessary.

5. Conclusion

19.     The RTP initial design was largely relevant and the project components were
comprehensive. However, some pertinent activities were dropped for different reasons. The
restructuring of the ministries as part of the transport sector reform had also some adverse
consequences that impacted the project implementation. Moreover, there was sometimes some
misunderstanding between the Bank and the Government particularly during activity
prioritization at project restructuring. Finally, an operational project focal point is essential to
coordinate the different institutions and players involved in a project.

             COMMENTS ON THE WORLD BANK ICR OF NOVEMBER 2013

1. General considerations

1.1 Understanding of the report

The World Bank Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is in English and follows a
formalized template. Although the ICR was largely disclosed, a certain familiarities with the
project and the different concepts mentioned in the document are needed to fully understand it.

1.2 Preparation of the report

The processes used to prepare the ICR including the Government completion report, were
inclusive despite that several persons and entities involved during project preparation could not
be reached. The ICR is well-written, concise, and seems objective.

2. Reference and results framework

2.1 Relevance and continuity

The ICR indicates the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the initial results framework were
complex but in line with the Government’ strategy and needs. However, the Government staff
and technicians did not get enough exposure during the restructuring of 2007 and particularly of
2010. In addition, the results framework was not considered as management and decision-
making tools.

2.2 Project Development Objective (PDO)

The three PDO indicators used in the ICR (Datasheet, Section F-a) are different from the ones
used in the last five supervision aide-memoires.

3. Description, analysis, and evaluation

3.1 Project Appraisal Document (PAD)

The author of the ICR emphasizes the data and studies problems of the PAD which could have
supported the situation before project. The attainment of the project objectives and the
assumptions made during project implementation were not satisfactory (Datasheet, Section H).

3.2 Explanations of the gaps and modifications

The gaps between the targets and actual values are relatively well explained. There are however
some exceptions such as the determination of the 1 million beneficiaries during the 2007




                                               42
restructuring, the decision to do a full rehabilitation instead of the least-cost basic access
standard (Section 2-2, Paragraph 31), the overarching impacts (Section 3-5-a), etc.

3.3 Restructuring process

The different restructurings of the project are well described. However, the ICR could have
discussed more the activities which were not retained. These activities which included the
Fianarantsoa Manakara corridor as well as the water transport on the Pangalanes channel were
relevant to improve the accessibility of isolated rural areas.

3.4 Fianarantsoa Manakara corridor

It could have been better to do some hierarchy on the reasons why this component was dropped:
Lack of economic viability, concessionning conditions of the Fianarantsoa-Manakara railway
and the Port of Manakara, economic context of the fuel transportation, and Internal Rate of
Return vis-à-vis of the opportunity cost of capital (Annex 3-b), etc.

3.5 Performance rating

The overall Government rating including the implementing agencies is not satisfactory. It could
have been more relevant to analyze the performance taking into account the different
assumptions and risks which were not appropriately captured since the beginning of the project,
particularly on the institutional and budgetary aspects.

4. Lessons and conclusion

The lessons are well formulated. But there is no evaluation of the overall Transport Sector
Program (Section 1-1). Given that the RTP was the latest project, a brief evaluation of the overall
program could have been done to take stock of the actual values of the program indicators such
as the accessibility and the transport costs. It could have also indicated the contribution of the
overall program to the poverty reduction as well as the sustainability of the sector achievements.

Annex 10: Additional information on safeguards

1.      Initially, the Rural Transport Project (RTP) was designed to finance the rehabilitation of
existing rural roads (provincial roads), the Southern Railway (Fianarantsoa Cote Est, FCE), and
the Port of Manakara. The environmental category of the RTP was “A”. The list of potential
rural roads was defined before appraisal and considered like “first year investments”. For the
FCE and the Port of Manakara, the civil works studies and the viability study were in early stage.
The activities were considered as “second year investments”.

2.      Before appraisal, a Resettlement Policy Framework and full Environmental and social
Impact Assessments (ESIA) were carried out for all planned rural roads identified as “first year
investments”, and an Environmental and Social Management Framework for any new rural roads
identified later. These safeguard instruments were disclosed in the country and to Infoshop
before appraisal.

3.      An Environmental Audit was conducted two years after project launch to review the
implementation of safeguard measures on the rehabilitated rural roads. Mitigation measures were
identified to reduce the subprojects impacts and to ensure the compliance with the agreed
Environmental Management Plan. These measures were implemented in a satisfactory manner
by local Non-Governmental Organizations.

4.      An Environmental Audit for the FCE and the Port of Manakara, and the corresponding
Resettlement Action Plan were available and disclosed in the country. These safeguard tools
were not implemented after the project restructuring that cancelled the Southern Railway and the
Port of Manakara component.

5.      Environmental and social studies were prepared for the rehabilitation on existing
National Roads (Routes Nationales, RN), mainly RN25, RN44South, and bridges on RN13. The
studies that were in a satisfactory quality were disclosed in their respective project zones. The
environmental and social impacts were mitigated in a satisfactory manner as a result of the
developed guidelines and the correct implementation of the environmental and social
management plans.

6.      Moreover, the project contributed to strengthen the environmental unit of the Road
Authority as well as the Ministry of Public Works. These units had an operational environmental
and social manual to ensure consideration of safeguard dimensions within the project cycle
(design, implementation, and monitoring). Both units were very active in reviewing the
subproject safeguard documents and monitoring in an acceptable manner their implementation
by the contractors during the works execution.

7.     In addition to the environmental and social aspects of the project, an HIV-AIDS program
was also carried out by the Government, through a Non-Governmental Organization, to sensitize
the contractors’ employees and the local population living along the rehabilitated roads.
