SAC-I was designed to support economic\n            policy during the period in which Ethiopia went through a\n            fundamental transformation from centralized planning to a\n            market-based economy. The program consisted of two main\n            components: (i) support for economic stabilization and (ii)\n            support for the private sector. Bank performance in the\n            identification of the program was highly satisfactory and\n            consistent with the Government's policy as well as with\n            the Bank's assistance strategy. One important lesson\n            learned in this project is providing support and technical\n            assistance for a new Borrower to learn the ropes on\n            procurement and disbursement procedures. The overall\n            performance under the SAC-I was found to be satisfactory.\n            Efforts made to restore growth and stabilize the economy and\n            the results thus obtained were encouraging. Moreover, the\n            private sector has positively responded to the new\n            investment Code. In particular, the targets for real\n            economic growth, inflation rate, and fiscal balance had been attained."}, "docdt": "1997-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
