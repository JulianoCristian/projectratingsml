The TGE's\n            economic objective is to reduce poverty through rapid\n            labor-intensive growth. This is to be achieved through a\n            fundamental transformation of the economy from centralized\n            planning to markets, with a dominant role for the private\n            sector. In the period immediately following its assumption\n            of power, the TGE concentrated on rehabilitation and relief\n            to cope with the problems of civil disruption, extreme\n            poverty and physical devastation caused by prolonged\n            internal conflict. Since late-1992, when agreement on a\n            Policy Framework Paper (PFP) was reached, the focus has\n            shifted to reconstruction and structural reform. In the\n            first phase, the program will consist of two main\n            components: support for economic stabilization, and support\n            for the private sector. For this, the following actions are\n            covered by SAC I: adjustments in key economic prices\n            (exchange rate, finance and wages); improvements in domestic\n            resource mobilization, including a reduction in the fiscal\n            imbalance; changes in the boundary between public and\n            private economic activity; promotion of price signals and\n            competition; introduction of a market-based system for\n            allocating foreign exchange; trade reforms; and safety net\n            policies for those affected by structural adjustment. During\n            SAC I implementation period, the TGE will also build\n            institutional capacities."}, "docdt": "1993-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
