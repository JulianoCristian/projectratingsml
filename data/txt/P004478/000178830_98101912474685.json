It\n            includes: (a) provision of tenure, basic services and home\n            improvement loans to low income communities, benefitting\n            about 160,000 persons; (b) provision of critical basic\n            services benefitting about 300,000 persons; (c) provision of\n            about 6,140 served plots, about one-half of which would be\n            developed by NHA and the remaining by private developers;\n            (d) employment promotion through the development of\n            commercial sites and small business loans, creating\n            approximately 6,000 new jobs; (e) provision of equipment and\n            facilities for refuse collection; and (f) technical\n            assistance to strengthen national agencies and local\n            governments. The primary risks are related to management and\n            coordination of new programs which will require rapid\n            expansion to improve the conditions of the urban poor.\n            Measures proposed under the project to strengthen the\n            institutions would minimize the risks."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
