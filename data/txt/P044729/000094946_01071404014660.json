Some of the many lessons\n            convey that: 1) although the financial viability of\n            beneficiary enterprises, is difficult to predict, a good\n            monitoring system, such as the one established under the\n            project, does help maintain a dialogue on the subject, and\n            further investor confidence; 2) combining the Ozone\n            Depleting Substances (ODS) phase-out investments, with\n            legislative controls to discourage the use of ODS (a\n            consumption tax), proved to be an effective experience,\n            resulting in a cooperative relationship between the Ministry\n            of Natural Resources, and the participating enterprises; 3)\n            while the establishment of procurement, and financial\n            management capacity at the start of a project is critical\n            for implementation take-off; in this case however, this\n            proved difficult because of restrictions placed on civil\n            servant staff: this was the one key drawback of\n            implementation arrangements, and furthermore, hampered\n            predictability on the length of time such issues might be\n            resolved; 4) the knowledge of, and reliability on the ODS\n            market, helped build support for the refrigeration servicing\n            initiatives, and, helped regulators decide which enforcement\n            methods would be most appropriate. Despite an unfavorable\n            macroeconomic environment, a project of this nature is worth\n            pursuing, for it helped maintain the Bank's dialogue in\n            the country during a period of non-lending: due to this\n            situation, full support, and attention was given to the\n            project by Bank management, and lead to establish good Bank\n            implementation track record."}, "docdt": "2001-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
