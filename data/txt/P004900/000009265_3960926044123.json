To\n            this end, the project supports:  (i) the newly established\n            Technical Quality Control Organization (CTTP) in planning\n            and supervising pavement strengthening programs and in road\n            maintenance planning and management; and (ii) the creation\n            of a transport investigation study and planning center under\n            the Ministry of Transport's (MOT) direction, to improve\n            sector policy formulation.  The proposed loan aims to\n            finance:  (i) a road rehabilitation and maintenance\n            component; (ii) technical assistance; and (iii) preparation\n            of a comprehensive, multi-modal transport study.  Finally,\n            the project provides funds for (iv) preparation of priority\n            engineering studies and analyses for railways and ports; and\n            (v) procurement of related training materials and equipment.\n            Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected\n            from reduced road-user costs and prolonged life of road pavements."}, "docdt": "1987-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
