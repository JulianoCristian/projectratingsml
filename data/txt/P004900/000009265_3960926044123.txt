MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Democratic and
Popular Government of Algeria for US$120 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 15 years including
3 years of grace at the standard variable interest rate.  It would help
finance pavement strengthening, improvements in road maintenance opera-
tions, training and studies for improvements in road and rail transport,
port operations and personnel management.
2.       Background.  The four previous Bank-assisted highway projects sup-
ported road construction investments, road rehabilitation, and development
of road maintenance capability through institutional development, training,
and equipment acquisition. These projects depended largely upon interna-
tional engineering and construction assistance, as local capability was
being developed. Although substantial progress was made in developing both
local construction capability and maintenance services, costs remained high
due to operational deficiencies, cumbersome management structures and
insufficient planning and control.  To bring management closer to opera-
tions, the Government split up the larger state-owned firms into a number
of smaller, regionally based companies, or in some cases specialized com-
panies  (such  rs bridge  builders).   At the same time, in an .,Lort  to
improve fiscal discipline, the Government transformed the mechanized, force
account, maintenance work forces into regional, state-owned enterprises.
These enterprises were formed overnight without operational guidelines or
associated training of regional maintenance engineers on contractual pro-
cedures. Additional funds were allocated for maintenance without assurance
that the supplement would adequately cover contract overheads and required
taxes. Negotiated contracts with the new enterprises have been in general
use, resulting in many cases in virtually imposed and often subsidized unit
rates. Lacking planning and control mechanisms, the maintenance capability
has deteriorated, and there is an urgent need for the development of a
maintenance management system. In addition, the Government is contemplat-
ing reorganization and reform of the highly regulated road transport opera-
tions, which are predominantly in the hands of state owned enterprises and
largely comprised of own-account fleet operations which are of questionable
efficiency.
3.       Improvements in the efficiency of road maintenance and transport
operations are of high priority for the Government. The recent fall in oil
and gas revenues caused the Government to focus on a core program of in-
vestments for the highway subsector in the 1985-89 Five-Year Plan with
priority given to rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing network
and to completing ongoing projects.  The proposed project is designed to
support this program while also addressing important policy issues such as
the level of highway investments, cost recovery, road transport efficiency
and safety, and competitive bidding for road maintenance work.



-2-
4.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to assist
the Government in concentrating its reduced resources on preservation of
existing roads, in effectively implementing institutional changes and in
improving the financial viability and efficiency of road transport.  It
would contribute to: (i) reducing the backlog of pavement strengthening and
rationalizing planning and control of this work; (ii) improving planning,
operational efficiency and control of road maintenance; (iii) eliminating
subsidies of maintenance costs; (iv) strengthening personnel management and
training functions in the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), the Ministry of
Transport (MOT) as well as in road and rail enterprises, and (v) improving
planning, operational efficiency and policy formulation in the transport
sector as a whole.
5.       Project Description.   To achieve  these objectives,  the project
will support: (i) the newly established Technical Quality Control Organiza-
tion (CTTP) in planning and supervising pa-7ement strengthening programs and
in road maintenance planning and management; and (ii) the creation of a
transport investigation study and planning center under MOT's direction, to
improve sector policy formulation. The proposed loan would finance: (i) a
road rehabilitation and maintenance component which includes pavement
strengthening on about 400 km of primary roads and, in seven Wilayas, a
two-year pilot program of road maintenance (1987-88), in which competitive
bidding for mairtenance contracts (principally about 1000 km of sealing
each year) would be introduced; (ii) technical assistance (a) to the CTTP
in improved collection and use of road network data for planning, optimiza-
tion, implementation and control of pavement strengthening and road mainte-
nance programs, and research into the use of natural local materials (e.g.
gravel) for road construction; and (b) to MPW, MOT and transport enter-
prises for personnel skills improvement of their personnel managers,
teachers, instructors, training officers, also regional engineers, techni-
cians and field laboratory staff; (iii) preparation of a comprehensive,
multi-modal transport study including diagnosis of road traffic safety
problems and analysis of road user charges; (iv) preparation of priority
engineering studies and analyses for railways and ports; and (v) procure-
ment of related training materials and equipment.
6.       The total cost  of  the project  is estimated at US$287 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$125.5 million (44X) of
which US$120 million would be financed under the proposed loan since only
that portion of routine maintenance work which would be contracted through
competitive bidding (about 40X), would be eligible for Bank financing.  A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Algeria are given in
Schedules  C and D,  respectively.   A map  is also attached.   The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6527-AL dated April, 1987, is being distributed
separately.

7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would con-
tribute to building on past successful interventions in the highway subsec-
tor.  It would strengthen and broaden the dialogue within the transport
sector by initiating collaboration with MOT on: (a) increasing the effi-
ciency of the road transport industry, and improving and increasing cost
recovery from road users and (b) improving planning and policy formulation
for the sector as a whole.   Institutional efficiency would be further
enhanced through (a) the integration of road resurfac-ing and maintenance
planning as part of a longer-term effort to establish effective pavement
management, (b) improving the management of road maintenance by contract in
line with the recent organizational changes, and (c) the creation of the
multi-modal transport investigation study and planning center under MOT's
direction.
8.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has entered into a Convention with
CTTP under which a Road Maintenance Planning and Management Department and
a Pavement Strengthening (planning and control) Unit have been esta-
blished. The convention includes the terms of reference and staffing plan
for technical assistance to these units.  In addition, the Government has
agreed to the following actions: (i) that the project would be carried out
in accordance to the Project Action Plan which inter-alia provides for
presentation of annual highway investment programs to the Bank and appro-
priate adjustments in the 1988 and 1989 road maintenance budgets;  (ii)
that annual programs of maintenance works to be let by competitive bidding
would be prepared for Bank review;  (iii)  that the bid procedures used
would be consistent with Bank guidelines; (iv) that studies under the
project, and lists and schedules for procuring training materials and
equipment, would be completed by specific dates; and (v) that after taking
into account the Bank's comments regarding the recommendations of the
studies, the Government would formulate action plans, and take all measures
necessary to implement them.
9.       Justification.   Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from reduced road-user costs and prolonged life of road pave-
ments.  The economic rate of return (ER) of the first tranche of pavement
strengthening works ranges between 14? and 35% with an overall average of
about 23%.  Improved levels of road maintenance yield typical incremental
ERs of over 100%.  Institutional and procedural changes would also serve to
avoid higher than needed road maintenance costs which might otherwise
occur. Training under the project would support the effort to improve the
efficiency :f transport and protect capital investments.   It would also
4            contribute to improved utilization of established education and training
institutions.   Additional,  non-quantified  benefits  would  accrue  from
(i) improved personnel management in MPW, MOT and land transport enter-
prises throughout the country, (ii) improvement in the quality of teaching
in MPW's and MOT's schools, and (iii) preparation of highly important
studies which would provide ;I0T with the basis for formulating policy
changes.

10.      Project Risks.  The main risks are that some of the desired re-
sults from introducing competitive bidding for maintenance contracts, may
not be fully attained during the project period. The elimination of sub-
sidization of certain maintenance unit prices may increase these prices
more than improved efficiency can reduce them. Satisfactory response of
those road contractors who presently do not engage in maintenance may also
take time to develop. The institutional objectives of strengthening plan-
ning and control capability, however, should be fully attainable, thus
serving to assure long-term sustainability, in view of the high priority
given by the Government to the road rehabilitation and maintenance. The
risk of budgetary shortages are minimal. Funds for the road strengthening
program have already been included in the proposed 1987 budgets, while the
required increases in maintenance budgets for the pilot maintenance program
have been agreed.
11.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies
with Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
