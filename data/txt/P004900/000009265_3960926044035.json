          assist the Government in concentrating its reduced resources\n            on preservation of existing roads, in effectively\n            implementing institutional changes and in improving the\n            financial viability and efficiency of road transport.  To\n            this end, the project supports:  (i) the newly established\n            Technical Quality Control Organization (CTTP) in planning\n            and supervising pavement strengthening programs and in road\n            maintenance planning and management; and (ii) the creation\n            of a transport investigation study and planning center under\n            the Ministry of Transport's (MOT) direction, to improve\n            sector policy formulation.  The proposed loan aims to\n            finance:  (i) a road rehabilitation and maintenance\n            component; (ii) technical assistance; and (iii) preparation\n            of a comprehensive, multi-modal transport study.  Finally,\n            the project provides funds for (iv) preparation of priority\n            engineering studies and analyses for railways and ports; and\n            (v) procurement of related training materials and equipment.\n            Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected\n            from reduced road-user costs and prolonged life of road pavements."}, "docdt": "1987-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
