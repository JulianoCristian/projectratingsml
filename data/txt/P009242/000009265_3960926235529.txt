MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED LOANS TO
JUGOBANKA-UNITED BANK BEOGRAD
LJUBLJANSKA BANKA, ASSOCIATED BANK
UDRUZENA BEOGRADSKA BANKA, BEOGRAD
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
FOR AN EXPORT INDUSTRIES PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on proposed loans of
US$40 million equivalent for Jugobanka, US$40 million equivalent for LBL, and
US$40 million equivalent for UBB, with the guarantee of the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia is submitted for approval. The loans will be on
standard Bank terms with a maturity of 15 years, including 5 years grace, and
help finance an export industries project.
2.       Background.  The industrial sector dominates the Yugoslav economy
which in recent years has been experiencing a balance of payments financing
gap, high and accelerating inflation, and uneven Gross Social Product growth.
Although new laws adopted since 19G4 have included significant positive steps,
the progress made so far in liberalizing trade and prices and in enforcing
financial discipline has been limited and not sufficient to improve efficiency
and restrain domestic demand. In November 1987, the Government initiated an
anti-inflation program which seeks to stabilize prices while at the same time
renew the efforts aimed at systemic reform. A temporary price freeze and a
partial wage freeze were instituted. A new interest rate regime was put in
place on January 1, 1988. The Government has placed a high priority on
improving export performance in view of the substantial convertible currency
debt service burden and industry's dependence on imported intermediate
inputs. The exchange rate was devalued by 20% in real terms in 1987, and
current legislation has been amended to provide higher priority to current
exporters for available foreign exchange. A Standby Agreement hes been
approved in principle by the IMF Board subject to the completion of the
financing plan expected by end-June 1988. The Bank is also discussing with
the Government means of supporting its adjustment efforts with a second
Structural Adjustment Loan. The Government is also collaborating with the
Bank on a financial sector study with a view to a future program of financial
*       sector adjustment.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Strong and sustained export
*      performance, reinforcement of financial discipline in the banking sector, and
the rechanneling of resources toward activities which are internationally
competitive will be crucial to the success of the current stabilization effort
and to prospects of output growth through productivity increases. There is
substantial scope to begin alleviating some of the disadvantages faced by
exporters, to consolidate the financial position of the relatively stronger
financial intermediaries, and to invest in restructuring of a capital stock
that is not well suited to competition in convertible currency markets and
unable to provide the rapid supply response to a reformed domestic price
structure. These are the principal aims of this project which has been
designed to help strengthen and expedite implementation of the recent



- 2 -
legislation and to facilitate further reforms. The Bank's assistance has been
critical in helping to prepare this project and the Bank would, through its
involvement in the project, both continue its past efforts as well as
facilitate future collaboration to support development of the industrial and
banking sectors in Yugoslavia.
4.       Project Objectives.  The principal objectives of the proposed project
are to expedite growth of efficient exporting from Yugoslavia and to
strengthen the banks to enhance their effectiveness in resource allocation and
in promoting financial discipline in the economy. The project would achieve
these goals through (i) improvements in the export administration and export
finance systems and in export marketing; (ii) the strengthening of key
financial institutions; and (iii) the careful selection and financing of high
return export projects in sound enterprises.
5.          Project Description.  The project consists of a line of credit
component and a technical assistance component. Funds from the line of credit
(US$119.2 million) will help finance investment in export-oriented
manufacturing industries to improve product quality and international
competitiveness and to expand or develop new competitive capacity. The
borrowing banks (UBB, LBL and Jugobanka) expect to receive requests for
financing of subprojects from enterprises throughout Yugoslavia and will be
responsible for appraising these subprojects in accordance with Bank agreed
standards. All subproject appraisals will include assessment of the export
orientation, market prospects and marketing, technology, impact on the
environment, and financial and economic viability of the subprojects, as well
as of the performance of the management, commercial viability, and financial
strength of the investing enterprise. The subprojects are likely to be
distributed over about fifteen industrial subsectors. The borrowing banks,
who will be the intermediaries under this project, are three of the largest
and relatively stronger of the nine commercial bank groups in Yugoslavia, and
account for about 50 percent of the total assets of the commercial banks in
the country. They are also critical in terms of coverage of export-oriented
industries. Like all Yugoslav banks, the financial performance of the three
borrowing banks has been unfavorably affected by the difficult economic
environment in recent years.  However, each of the three b9nks has begun to
take actions to remedy this situation, and each will implement a multi-year
program of financial measures under this project to substantially expand and
accelerate these efforts. These programs will strengthen the banks' financial
performance and will enable them to sustain and further improve this
performance if improvement is achieved in the overall economic and financial
environment. The technical assistance component is designed to assist in
strengthening the three borrowing banks. It will consist of assistance to
Jugobanka, LBL, and UBB (US$800,000) for institutional development. In
support of this project, the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Economic
Relations (FSFER) will carry out a program to develop a duty exemption system
for exporters and prepare measures to improve exporters' access to imported
inputs. In parallel with the project, the Government also intends to support
programs initiated by the Yugoslav Bank for International Economic Cooperation
(YBIEC), the National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY), the Social Accounting Office
(SDK), and the Yugoslav Bank for International Economic Cooperation (YBA) to



- 3 -
develop strategies to strengthen the export finance system and export
marketing, and to enhance bank supervision and auditing, and implementation of
a uniform methodology for investment selection. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and the disbursements schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Yugoslavia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 7123-YU dated June 3, 1988, and a map are also attached.
6.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the following salient
agreements were obtained from the Government and the borrowing banks.  The
Government will take all necessary actions on its part to implement a
duty-exemption system for exporters and measures to facilitate exporters
access to imported imports. Jugobanka, LBL, and UBB will (a) implement
multiyear programs of financial measures including (i) adoption of an interest
rate policy, including initial increases in interest rates and commissions,
designed to ensure that for each bank revenues will cover operating expenses
and allocations to reserves, (ii) write-off of deferred and current foreign
exchange losses and reduction of foreign exchange exposure, (iii) build-up
reserves, (iv) limitation on dividend distribution until the required part of
foreign exchange losses are written off and annual reserve build up
requirements are met, and (v) careful evaluation of the financial and economic
viability of the borrowing enterprise as a basis of loan rescheduling and new
lending; (b) on-lend loan investment funds to subprojects that are
commercially and environmentally sound, have an ERR higher than 12%, an FRR
higher than 12% (and at least as high as the cost of borrowing for the
sub-project) and export at least 40% of incremental production to convertible
currency areas and 20% in exchange for convertible currency; (c) on-lend only
to enterprises which are judged to be creditworthy based on an assessment of
management effectiveness and the enterprises' commercial viability and
financial strength; and (d) conduct regular supervision of the subprojects.
Bank investment funds would be limited to US$7.0 million per subproject and
per enterprise; at least US$20 million of each Bank loan will be for subloans
of less or equal to US$4.0 million; and the maximum size of any investment
subproject to be financed under the Bank loan will be US$25 million. The
borrowing banks will on-lend Bank funds at a variable rate consistent with
Bank agreed overall interest rate policy. Subloans will have maximum maturity
of 15 years (including 5 years of grace). The foreign exchange risk on all
subloans would be borne by the borrowing enterprises.
7.       Benefits.  The project would have several benefits.  It will help
increase exports directly through financing of high return investments with
positive and quick foreign exchange impact. It is expected that the present
value of the net economic benefits of the line of credit component of the
project would be about US$600 million and that the subprojects will be net
foreign exchange earners within four years of implementation. Accompanying
measures to the project will help pave the way for further improvement of the
export environment through the FSFER programs to evaluate and improve
exporters' access to imported inputs and develop a duty-exemption system for
exporters, and the YBIEC study which will help provide the basis for
enhancement of the export finance system and of export marketing. The project
will also help to modernize the capital stock and thus help facilitate price
reform.



- 4 -
Furthermore, by supporting and expediting an ambitious program for
consolidation of the financial position of the three borrowing banks,
institutional strengthening of these banks and of the regulatory agencies in
the banking sector, and implementation of a satisfactory methodology to be
used by all banks and enterprises in evaluating investments, the project, and
the accompanying measures which are planned to be undertaken in parallel with
it, will reinforce efforts to ensure financial discipline in the economy and
help set the stage for a comprehensive program for financial sector reform.
8.       Risks.  The principal project risk relates to the possibility of the
Government delaying further reform measures needed to promote higher
industrial productivity and financial discipline. However, the Government's
commitment to these reform measures is strengthening, and in any case, the
project would have a beneficial impact even if such reform measures are
postponed through the net direct foreign exchange earnings and the economic
returns on the investments to be financed, and the longer-term benefits of the
technical assistance components.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loans.
