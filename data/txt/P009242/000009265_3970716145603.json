Following an exchange of correspondence with the\n            proposed borrowers, the Bank notified them on August 25,\n            1989 that it had withdrawn its offer to enter into the\n            loans. The delay in signing and eventual cancellation was\n            linked to the evolution of economic policies and\n            circumstances in the former SFRY. High interest rates and\n            expected changes in the structure of the banking and\n            enterprise sectors led to a marked slackening in demand for\n            investment credits. The circumstances in the former SFRY\n            could not have been anticipated at the time of project approval."}, "docdt": "1996-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
