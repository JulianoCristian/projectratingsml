for the Financial Sector\n            Technical Assistance Loan (FSTAL) Project for Guatemala were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is desirable\n            to retain a degree of flexibility in the project to allow\n            adjustments to respond to changing priorities within the\n            overall framework of the operation. Broad definition of the\n            disbursement categories can contribute to such flexibility\n            and facilitate the movement of funds without difficult\n            formal reallocations. This is particularly relevant if the\n            implementation period is lengthy, there is a risk that\n            individual priorities become less relevant. The preparation\n            of the project counted with the strong commitment of both\n            the highest levels of Government and the implementing\n            agencies. The successful development of regulations for the\n            resolution of insolvent banks, the new handbook of Risk\n            Based Supervision (RBS) and the chapter on consolidated\n            supervision were all due not only to the high quality of\n            international consultants recruited but also the commitment\n            made by the authorities in providing technical resources and\n            personnel exclusively dedicated to these tasks. Importantly,\n            as technical capacity was build and the new supervisory\n            vision was institutionalized, the Superintendency of Banks\n            (SB) claimed clear ownership, reflected in their commitment\n            to continue such work beyond the lifespan of the FSTAL."}, "docdt": "2009-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
