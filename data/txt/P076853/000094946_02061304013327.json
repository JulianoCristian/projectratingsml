program, by\n            providing technical assistance (TA) in banking systems, able\n            to improve, and expand its intermediating functions, and to\n            withstand shocks. The project components will: 1) provide\n            rapid exit and resolution of insolvent banks, by financing\n            TA to the Super-intendency of Banks (SB) to establish\n            benchmarks to assess viability, and solvency of banks, by\n            designing templates to prepare, and evaluate bank's\n            rehabilitation plans. Legal and financial instruments will\n            be designed for the transfer of liabilities from insolvent,\n            to solvent banks, and for the transfer of assets to a\n            special trust while compensation mechanisms will be\n            established for institutions acquiring assets, and\n            liabilities from insolvent banks; 2) establish the Fiduciary\n            Fund for Bank Capitalization, providing TA for its\n            operation, including the design of financial instruments to\n            capitalize viable banks. Policy and strategic formulation\n            will be addressed, and the evolution of capitalized banks\n            will be monitored; 3) finance TA to establish a credit\n            information system to centralize, organize, and maintain\n            information of debtors of financial institutions in\n            Guatemala. The acquisition of operational software and\n            hardware will encourage better lending practices, and\n            improve the overall financial system; and, 4) finance TA to\n            strengthen the Special Unit Against Money Laundering,\n            including training, and supervisory assistance. Moreover, TA\n            will support the adoption of international accounting\n            standards by the Central Bank, and a strategy for the\n            financial system development."}, "docdt": "2002-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
