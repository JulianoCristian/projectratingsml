THIRD RAILWAY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2935 - IN)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Railway Modernization
Project in India, for which a loan in the amount of US$390 million equivalent was approved on
May 5, 1988 to the Government of India with Indian Railways (IR) as the Beneficiary. The loan
became effective on August 10, 1988. The loan amount was later revised at the request of the
Borrower to US$248.94 million.
The final disbursement was made on June 20, 1995 and the loan was closed on December
31, 1995, compared with the original closing date of December 31, 1993. The Special Account
balance was refunded on June 11, 1996 and the loan uncommitted balance was canceled on the
same date, reducing the loan amount to US$245.40 million.
The ICR was prepared by Harald Hansen (Task Manager) of the Energy and
Infrastructure Operations Division (SA2EI) of South Asia Country Department II, with the
assistance of Jitendra Sondhi and J.S. Mundrey, independent consultants retained by the Bank. It
was reviewed by Francois Bauer, Division Chief, SA2EI, and Kazuko Uchimura, Project Adviser,
SA2DR.
The preparation of this ICR was begun in December 1995 and carried through the Bank's
final supervision mission in February 1996. It is based on project files, field visits and analysis
carried out by independent consultants and data furnished by the Borrower and Beneficiary. The
Beneficiary contributed by preparing its own evaluation and commenting on the draft ICR. The
borrower provided comments that are included as appendixes to the ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
THIRD RAILWAY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2935 - IN)
Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives
1.    The project focused on track renewal and modernization with the objective of improving
the planning and execution of Indian Railways' (IR) track renewal/upgrading and maintenance
program, enhancing the quality and capacity of track and thus promoting efficient train operation
and improving IR's financial performance. The above project objectives were pursued by: (i)
renewal/upgrading of track on arterial (A routes) and other heavy density routes; (ii) acquiring
equipment for track relaying and maintenance; (iii) acquiring locomotives and wagons for
transport of track material; and (iv) technical assistance and training.
Implementation Experience and Results
2.    By September 1995, 3,881 km out of 4,000 km of track had been renewed. The
remaining 119 km oftrack renewal were completed by March 31, 1996. Indian Railways' main
heavy density routes, covering 16,568 km, were included in this project. At project closing, 1,052
km of track renewal on these routes were overdue (6.3 percent). One hundred thirty-seven track
machines were purchased and have been received and commissioned.
3.    The Beneficiary was to fund procurement of Hopper and BFR wagons and locomotives
but did not procure any for the exclusive use of track renewal or maintenance. The training sub-
component was successfully completed, and in all, about 275 man months of training was
arranged. However, there has been considerable delay in the development and implementation of
the computer-based, track maintenance planning system and it has so far been implemented only
on a pilot section.
4.    The total cost of the project was estimated at US$1,206 million (Rs. 16,875 million). The
actual cost of the project is estimated at US$1,050 million (Rs. 23,503 million) with a foreign
exchange component of US$247 million and local component of Rs. 18,481 million. The Bank
financed the full foreign cost of the project and local costs were financed by IR.
5.    Post-project economic evaluation shows that for the track relay, the revised IRR is 14, 17
and 25 percent, respectively, for the three typical initial traffic levels, as against the original SAR
estimates which had an IRR of 16, 20 and 29 percent for traffic levels of 13, 20 and 35 million
gross tonnes, respectively. The investment evaluation of track machines for maintenance shows
an IRR of 25 percent. A sensitivity analysis showed that the return on investment for track



- ijj -
machines is very sensitive to a reduction in maintenance cost and this should therefore be
monitored closely.
6.    The project was planned for full implementation by the middle of 1993. However, due to
long delays in procurement as well as installation, the track relay component was only completed
by March 1996, almost three years behind schedule. Track machines, which were planned for
delivery and commissioning by March 1992, were actually commissioned in the last quarter of
1995, resulting in a delay of over 30 months. The delays were caused mainly by the lengthy
interval between bid opening and award recommendations to the Bank. Some delay to project
implementation was also due to resource pressures resulting from external factors such as a
change in GOI policy, which reduced the budgetary support to IR in the post economic reform
period.
7.    The annual traffic growth, in terms of net tonne km, peaked during the period from 1981
to 1986 at 5.5 percent and has been declining in subsequent years; 3.3 and 1.2 percent in the
periods from 1985/86 to 1990/91 and from 1990/91 to 1994/95, respectively. Thus, the traffic
growth was lower than the 4 percent anticipated at appraisal.
8.    Key indicators for project implementation during FY1990, 1992 and 1994 show that
freight and passenger traffic were below targets, but traffic units per employee, locomotive
availability, wagon utilization and gross trailing load per freight train exceeded the targets. By
and large, the key indicators met the targets for FY1990 to 1994.
9.    From FY1987 to FY1995, the operating ratio and the net revenue receipts, as a
percentage of capital-at-charge, have shown a healthy trend. The dividends to general revenues
have been maintained at satisfactory levels. In all these years, railways generated a post dividend
surplus. Indian Railways was, however, not able to increase the total freight traffic output in
terms of net tonne km in line with demand, and in the period from FY1991 through 1995, it grew
by an annual average of 1.2 percent (Annex C: Table 4), although the overall transport demand
increased at an average estimated rate of 7-8 percent per annum. Thus, IR lost market share and
long-distance traffic continued to move by road at a higher economic cost to the country.
10.   The project objectives, components and broad implementation schedule were included in
the SAR. However, a detailed procurement schedule for various items was not defined. The
Borrower purchased rails and track equipment through more than 25 separate tenders. In the
absence of a detailed procurement schedule, delays in initiating procurement action were not
easily monitorable by IR management.
11.   Long intervals between bid opening and award recommendation to the Bank (six to twelve
months) were a common feature for several tenders. This necessitated repeated extensions of bid
validity.
12.   During project preparation and loan negotiations, a framework for review and evaluation
of benefits from specific components was not developed. The key indicators for Project
Implementation included in the SAR and monitored during project supervision relate to macro
vt



- iv -
level efficiency. It would have been useful to include some indicator with targets specifically
related to project components for monitoring during project supervision and after project
implementation.
13.   During project implementation the economic scenario underwent a change due to the
reform of the Indian economy. Indian Railways' budgetary support was progressively reduced.
This, coupled with deployment of significant resources for gauge conversion, had a negative
impact on resources that could be allocated for this project. Furthermore, as a result of a
weakening Indian Rupee, the landed cost of imports more than doubled during project
implementation. Due to these factors and slow procurement of rails and machines, the
implementation of the project slowed and its completion was delayed by two to three years.
14.   Indian Railways' performance in managing the procurement was not satisfactory as
evaluations and recommendations for awards took much longer than planned. The long time
taken to secure approval of award proposals at Minister's level contributed to the long delays in
finalization of procurement contracts.
Overall Assessment
15.   The outcome of the project is assessed as 'satisfactory' since most of the major project
objectives have been achieved.
16.   With a heavier track structure in place on main corridors and improved quality of track
maintenance, IR will be in a stronger position to meet the challenge of increasing transport
demand and competition from road transport, as the Indian economy continues to grow at an
expected rate more than 5 percent per annum.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
17.   This project has demonstrated that the mechanization of certain manual operations is
inescapable. As a new generation of infrastructure is introduced, higher standards of maintenance
are called for and utilization becomes more intensive. Furthermore, even in a low wage economy
such as India, the unit cost of maintenance is lower with the mechanization of selected activities.
18.   In future operations, it would, in line with the new policy, be useful to insist that
procurement procedures be modified to ensure that tenders are finalized within the original bid
validity of 90 or 120 days. Consideration should be given to the possibility of IR obtaining
Ministerial approval of projects as a whole so that the requirement of individual approval of each
bid evaluation at this level, with attendant delays, is eliminated.
19.   Project monitoring must place the same emphasis on the realization of perceived benefits
as it does on procurement and physical implementation. Future projects should have specific
project component related indicators and targets, in addition to overall and macro-level indicators
and targets, which are indicative of project costs and benefits. The Borrower/Beneficiary should
have appropriate costing systems in place to facilitate monitoring such indicators.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
THIRD RAILWAY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2935 - IN)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.     PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    This project was the last of a series of four interrelated technology transfer projects
launched between 1978 and 1988. The rationale for the project was to support the
implementation of the key elements of IR's Corporate Plan (1985-2000), especially: (i) improved
utilization of assets; (ii) improved planning and investment in key areas; and (iii) increased internal
generation of funds for asset renewal and new investment. The project focused on track with the
objective of improving the planning and execution of IR's track renewal/ upgrading and
maintenance program, enhancing the quality and capacity of track and thus promoting efficient
train operation and improving IR's financial performance. The above project objectives were
pursued by: (i) renewal/upgrading of track on arterial (A routes) and other heavy density routes;
(ii) acquiring equipment for track relaying and maintenance; (iii) acquiring locomotives and
wagons for transport of track material; and (iv) technical assistance and training.
2.    The project was expected to substantially reduce track maintenance costs. By reducing
speed restrictions and the track occupancy time required for renewal and maintenance work, it
would increase track capacity in critical corridors as well as improve the utilization of rolling
stock.
B.    ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
(i) RenewaWUpgrading of Track on Arterial (A Routes) and Other Heavy
Density Routes
3.    The status of track renewal carried out until September 1995, is summarized in Annex C.
By September 1995, 3,881 km, out of the planned 4,000 km of track had been renewed. The
remaining 119 km track renewal was completed by end of March 1996.
4.    Against the original plan for the procurement of 480,000 tonnes of 60 kg, 90 UTS rail,
259,000 tonnes of 60 kg, 90 UTS rail was imported. Over 190,000 tonnes of rail (mostly 60 kg,
90 UTS) was purchased locally. A large proportion (about 85 percent) of track has been relayed
with 60 kg, 90 UTS rail, while the balance (about 15 percent) has been relayed with 52 kg rail,
due to the non-availability of 60 kg rail. The renewed track has been laid on concrete sleepers



- 2 -
(1,660 per km) with elastic fastenings and standard ballast cushion of 30 cm. All renewed track
has welded joints, mostly in long continuous lengths of 2 to 3 kms.
5.    Group A and heavy density routes covering 16,568 km were included in this project. At
project closing, 1,052 km of track renewal on these routes were overdue (6.3 percent). It is
expected that Indian Railways would continue with track renewal with 60 kg, 90 UTS rails on
these routes at 2,000 - 2,500 km per year and all arrears of track renewal would probably be
cleared over the next year.
(ii) Equipment for Track Laying and Maintenance
6.    Originally, procurement of 141 units of track equipment was planned. During project
implementation, IR, with the agreement of the Bank, reduced the track equipment to 137
machines plus two contactless sensors for track recording cars. Annex C (Table 2) shows the
status of machines originally planned, a modified plan and the quantity actually purchased. All
machines have been received and commissioned.
(iii) Locomotives and Wagons for Transport of Track Materials
7.    To assist in the transport of track materials, the project included the procurement of 204
Hopper and BFR wagons and 4 locomotives. These were to be funded by the Borrower/
Beneficiary. Indian Railways did not procure any wagons or locomotives for the exclusive use of
track renewal or maintenance. However, 700 hopper wagons were included in its rolling stock
procurement program. These wagons have not been procured so far. Wagons were made
available for track work from the general wagon pool as and when required. A similar procedure
was applied to the deployment of locomotives for track renewal and maintenance work. As IR is
currently facing a shortage of wagons as well as locomotives, in the absence of dedicated rolling
stock for track work, it is likely that sufficient rolling stock may not be available for track work
for some time.
(iv) Technical Assistance and Training
8.    This project component included:
(a) manpower planning;
(b) planning of track renewal and maintenance programs; and
(c) technical training in the operation and maintenance of the track equipment to
be procured under the project.
9.    Training: The training sub-component has been successfully completed, and in all, about
275 person months of training was arranged. Specific training modules were designed for track
renewal planning, track maintenance and track machine operation and maintenance. Trained
personnel were debriefed and were utilized in the development of revised track maintenance
systems and utilization of track machines. The re-organization of track maintenance field units
has been recommended by a committee. The recommendations include a significant reduction in
track maintenance manpower and an increased use of track machines. These recommendations



-3 -
are currently under review by top JR management. The manpower norm for high density routes
has already been reduced from 2.2 to 1.1 men/track km for track under mechanized maintenance.
10.   Track Monitoring and Management System: Development and installation of a
computer based track maintenance planning system was a sub-component of the project. This
required software development and availability of a high speed track recording car, All the
software modules except two have been developed and are expected to be completed by mid-
1996. An existing high speed track recording car has been retro-fitted with contactiess sensors
and is undergoing test and validation runs. Considerable field testing of a maintenance planning
system is, however, required before it will be ready for general application.
11.   The computer-based, track maintenance planning system has been introduced in one
division of IR as a pilot and is being used for need-based maintenance with track machines and
monitoring the deployment of resources. It is proposed to extend this system to 27 of the 59
divisions of IR, covering the high density routes on the quadrilateral and diagonals which connect
the four metropolitan cities and carry 80 percent of IR's traffic.
12.   There has been considerable delay in the development and implementation of the
computer-based, track maintenance planning system. It is expected that the system will be fully
developed and installed on track, covering high density routes, over the next two years provided
the high speed track recording car has satisfactory data acquisition integrity.
C.  IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING
THE PROJECT
13.   On February 24, 1993, the Bank canceled US$120 million of the loan at the request of the
Borrower from the loan amount of US$390 million. Indian Railways stated that:
(a) It was forced to reduce investments due to pressure on resources;
(b) The indigenous capacity for 60 kg, 90 UTS rails had improved; and
(c) The landed cost of imported rails (including import duties) was higher and
this import was not cost effective.
14.  It was suggested that procurement of imported rails be curtailed and rails required for the
project be acquired from Indian sources. There were three further cancellations to the tune of
US$21.06 million due to a decision not to purchase six track machines and favorable exchange
rate movements that reduced the US dollar cost of some of the rail and track machines. After
various cancellations requested by the borrower, and agreed by the Bank, the loan amount was
revised to US$248.94 million. Following the refund of the uncommitted balance in the Special
Account and cancellation of that amount, the final loan amount was US$245.40 million.
15.   The project was planned for full implementation by the middle of 1993. However, due to
long delays in procurement as well as installation, the track relay component was only completed
by end of March 1996, about three years behind schedule. Track machines which were planned
for delivery and commissioning by March 1992 were actually commissioned in the last quarter of



1995, resulting in a delay of over 30 months. The delays were primarily the result of lengthy time
intervals between bid opening and award recommendations to the Bank. This cause for delay in
project implementation was within the control of IR. However, some delay to project
implementation was also due to resource pressures caused by external factors such as GOI policy
changes, which reduced the budgetary support to IR in the post-economic reform period. As a
result, implementation of this project slowed.
16.   Traffic growth is indicated in Annex C and selected performance indicators for the IR's
broad gauge system are shown in Table 5. It is noted (Annex C: Table 4) that annual traffic
growth in terms of net tonne km peaked in the period from 1981 to 1986 at 5.5 percent and has
been declining in subsequent years; 3.3 and 1.2 percent in the periods from FY1986 to FY1991
and from FY1991 to FY1995, respectively. Thus, the traffic growth was lower than the 4 percent
anticipated at appraisal.
17.   Key indicators for project implementation (Table 5) for FY1990, 1992 and 1994 show
that freight and passenger traffic were below targets, but traffic units per employee, locomotive
availability, wagon utilization and gross trailing load per freight train exceeded the targets. The
locomotive utilization for passenger services and load in net tonnes per freight train was below
targets.
18.   By and large, the key indicators met the targets during FY 1990 to FY 1994.
(i)  Project Cost and Financing
19.   The total cost of the project was estimated at US$1,206 million (Rs. 16,875 million), with
a foreign exchange component of US$390 million and a local component of Rs. 11,805 million.
The actual cost of the project is estimated at US$1,050 million (Rs. 23,503 million) with a foreign
exchange component of US$247 million and a local component of Rs. 18,481 million. The
estimated and actual project costs are shown in Table 6 of Part II: Statistical Tables.
20.   The actual cost details for track relay costs were made available by IR for 1,247 km of the
Northern and Western Railways. The total actual relaying cost for 1,247 km was Rs. 5,506
million giving an average track relay cost of Rs. 4,415 million/km. The total relay cost for 4,000
km was thus estimated at Rs. 17,660 million, out of which the cost of imported rail was
US$121.86 million (equivalent to Rs. 2,803 million). For this review, where actual data were not
available for converting local cost to US$ cost and vice versa, an average conversion rate of Rs.
23 = 1 US$ has been adopted since the exchange rate ranged from Rs. 14.48 to Rs. 35.00 over
the project implementation period from FY1989 to FY1996. The total project cost, net of taxes,
is thus estimated at Rs. 18,690 million (US$812.6 million).
21.   Originally, the Bank Loan was to finance 100 percent of the foreign cost estimated at
US$390 million. Later, due to mutually agreed cancellations, the Bank financed US$248.94
million of project cost. This amount was disbursed. However, the unused balance in the Special
Account was subsequently refunded and the uncommitted balance canceled. This reduced the
loan amount to US$245.40 million. The Bank financed the foreign cost of the project and Rs.
18,481 million in local cost was financed by IR.

(ii)   Economic Analysis
22.   Retrospective economic analysis of the track renewal project has been carried out along
lines similar to those used for the economic analysis at project appraisal, but actual data were used
for parameters such as traffic growth, cost of track renewal, operating cost, track maintenance
cost, etc.
23.   The details of the economic analysis are described in Annex D. It is seen that against the
original SAR estimates which had an IRR of 16, 20 and 29 percent for the typical base traffic
levels of 13, 20 and 35 million gross tonnes, respectively, the revised IRR is 14, 17 and 25
percent, respectively.
24.   The economic evaluation for investments made for track machines employed for
mechanized maintenance of track has also been carried out and is discussed in Annex D. It shows
that this sub-component of the project has an IRR of 25 percent. A sensitivity analysis showed
that the return on investment is very sensitive to a reduction in maintenance cost and therefore,
this aspect should be monitored closely. The economic evaluation for investment in track
machines for mechanization of track maintenance was not undertaken at appraisal.
(iii)  Indian Railways' Financial and Economic Performance
25.   The financial results of IR are summarized in Annex F. Over the period (from
FYI 987 to FYI 995), the operating ratio and the net revenue receipts as a percentage of capital-
at-charge have shown a healthy trend. The dividends to general revenues have been maintained
at satisfactory levels. In all these years, IR generated a post dividend surplus.
26.   Indian Railways was, however, not able to increase the total freight traffic output in terms
of net tonne km in line with demand. In the period from 1990/91 to 1994/95, it grew by an
annual average of 1.2 percent (Annex C: Table 4), although the overall transport demand
increased at an average estimated rate of 7-8 percent per annum. Thus, IR lost market share and
long distance traffic continued to move by road at a higher economic cost to the country.
D.   PROJECT SUSTAINABELITY
27.   Indian Railways, with this project, has covered almost all but about 1,000 track km of
arrears of track renewal on its group A and heavy density routes. The annual new need for track
renewal is estimated at about 2,000 km per year and IR plans to undertake track renewal at the
rate of 2,000 - 2,500 km per year in the forthcoming years and remain current with track
renewals. About 24,000 km of track are already laid on concrete sleepers and have mechanized
maintenance in place. Indian Railways proposes to continue extending mechanized maintenance
progressively. Activities initiated during this project are, thus, likely to be sustained in the future.

E.  BANK PERFORMANCE
28.   The project objectives, components and broad implementation schedule were included in
the SAR. However, a detailed procurement schedule for various items was not defined. Indian
Railways purchased rails and track equipment through more than 25 separate tenders. In the
absence of a detailed procurement schedule, delays in initiating procurement action did not stand
out and attract the attention of IR management.
29.   Bank staff participating in supervision missions repeatedly pointed out to the Borrower
and IR that procurement action and installation work were behind schedule and needed to be
speeded up. The Bank responded to requests for approval of various award proposals promptly.
Long intervals between bid opening and award recommendation to the Bank (six - twelve months)
were a common occurrence during several tenders. This necessitated repeated extensions of bid
validity. It may be noted that the Bank and the Region has since introduced much more stringent
guidelines for the approval of bid validity extensions.
30.   During project preparation and loan negotiations, a framework for review and evaluation
of benefits from specific components was not developed. During the preparation of the ICR, it
was discovered that IR did not have a costing system capable of generating costs for specific
activities over selected sections of track. It would have been useful, if during project preparation
or at loan negotiation, IR's agreement had been secured for the maintenance of accounts so that
data such as total cost of relay for each section, track maintenance costs prior to and after relay,
operating and maintenance costs of specific groups of track machines, etc., would be available.
The key indicators for Project Implementation included in the SAR and monitored during project
supervision relate to macro-level efficiency. It would have been useful to include some indicator
with targets specifically related to project components (e.g., planned and actual start and finish
dates for relay of specific sections, manpower ratio and cost of track maintenance on selected
sections laid with 52 kg and 60 kg rails having manual and mechanized maintenance, track
occupancy time for maintenance, track capacity, utilization of rolling stock, frequency of
accidents, etc.) for monitoring during project supervision and after project implementation.
F.  BORROWER/BENEFICIARY PERFORMANCE
31.   This loan enabled IR to fund the purchase of imported 60 kg, 90 UTS rails and track
machines. Except for the loan, it was very difficult for IR to secure foreign exchange for import
of rails and machines. During project implementation, the economic scenario underwent a change
due to the reform of the Indian economy. Firstly, IR could now access foreign exchange provided
it had matching Indian funds to purchase it. Secondly, budgetary support was progressively
reduced and IR had to depend increasingly on internal generation of funds and market borrowing
for capital investments. These factors, including the deployment of significant resources for
gauge conversion, had a negative impact on resources that could be allocated for this project.
Thirdly, as a result of the weakening of the Indian Rupee, the landed cost of imports more than
doubled during the period of project implementation (1988/89 - 1995/96). Due to the above
factors, and slow procurement of rails and machines, the implementation of the project slowed
and its completion was delayed by two to three years.



- 7 -
32.  Indian Railways' performance in managing the procurement was not satisfactory as
evaluations and recommendations for awards took much longer than planned. The long time
taken to secure approval of award proposals at the Minister's level contributed to long delays in
finalization of procurement contracts. For example, in one case of the procurement of track
machines, the Tender Committee took seven months to finalize its evaluation report. Another five
months were taken to secure approval of the Minister and the Competent Authority.
33.   An important element of the technical assistance component of the project was to improve
the planning and execution of IR's track renewal and maintenance program. The progress on the
development and implementation of the track maintenance planning system has been slow and it
has so far resulted in only a pilot application. It was determined during the field visit that the long
delay in system development, which includes a track monitoring system that provides periodic
reports on track condition computer hardware and software, including degradation models for
track geometry and components to forecast track maintenance and track renewal requirements,
has affected the morale of field staff adversely. Unless the system development and
implementation are completed quickly and the new system is extended to other divisions rapidly,
the objective of developing a more cost effective, need-based track maintenance system may not
be realized. One of the reasons for the delay was IR's decision to modify an existing track
recording car rather than procure a new high speed car for measuring current track condition.
Procurement of contactless sensors and testing and validation of the modified car has taken
considerably longer than anticipated. Since reliable data on current track condition is an essential
input for the track maintenance system, the overall system development and application on a large
scale have been delayed. The satisfactory functioning of the system will depend on the data
acquisition integrity of the car that has been modified by [R. Since this sub-project has the
potential of generating major technical and financial benefits for IR, it is important that the
implementation of the new track management systems on all major routes of IR receives support
of management at the highest level and its progress is monitored closely.
G.  ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
34.   The outcome of the project is assessed as 'satisfactory' since most of the major project
objectives have been achieved as indicated in more detail in the evaluation in Table 1. Physical
objectives of track renewal and procurement of track machines were met. Sector policy, financial
and public sector management objectives were, however, only partially achieved. Project
sustainability has been rated as "likely" since IR is expected to continue track renewal and expand
mechanized track maintenance. Borrower's performance in preparation, covenant compliance and
operation was also satisfactory. However, Borrower's performance in implementation was
somewhat deficient since project implementation was delayed by two to three years, mainly due to
delays in finalization of procurements.
H.   FUTURE OPERATIONS
35.   Indian Railways proposes to continue with a track relay program as an ongoing activity to
clear the current arrears of track relay of about 1,000 track km within a year and to ensure that



- 8 -
such arrears do not accumulate in the future. Indian Railways proposes to mainly utilize 60 kg,
90 UTS long-welded rail and laid on concrete sleepers and 30 cm ballast cushion on it's main high
density corridors.
36.   Similarly, the change from manual to mechanized track maintenance is being expanded as
more track is being relaid on concrete sleepers. This change should also be sustained since
mechanized maintenance leads to improved quality of track and reduced cost of track
maintenance.
37.   At the time of project preparation, rail meeting IRS/T-12-88 specification was not
available in India. In 1990, IR asked the Indian manufacturer to upgrade its manufacturing and
treatment process so that local rails met the IRS/T-12-88 specification fully. Indian Railways
gave the local manufacturer a special relaxation with respect to some requirements of the
technical specification for a limited period up to March 1993 and the manufacturer was required
to fully meet the specifications thereafter. In order to do so, the manufacturer was required to
manufacture fully-killed steel by concast process, set up in-line ultrasonic testing and improve
upon dimensional and straightness tolerances for rails. An investigation by an autonomous
research center based in Ranchi for RDSO had indicated residual stresses as high as 20 kg/sq. mm
in rail manufactured locally, calling for an improvement in the cooling and straightening process.
Very little progress has taken place in the quality improvement of the rails manufactured locally
and indications are that IR continues to buy rails with special relaxation which relate to quality of
steel, ultrasonic testing and dimensional and straightness tolerances. Indian Railways runs the risk
of lower than expected levels of performance from such rails in the long run. (The Indian supplier
did not bid for any of the global tenders under this project for procurement of rails to IRS/T-12-
88.) Indian Railways will be well advised to insist that only those rails that fully meet the
technical specifications be procured in future. Alternatively, consideration should be given to
opening up competition through the import of high quality rails. In commenting on the draft
report, Indian Railways has indicated that the rail specifications have recently been revised, and as
a result, the quality of rails from the local supplier will improve.
I.    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
38.   The main corridors on IR have a high traffic density and some of them are working near
full capacity, permitting little time for track maintenance. Heavier long-welded rails are being laid
on concrete sleepers to cater to higher traffic density and that in turn calls for mechanized track
maintenance, which is not only appropriate but also more cost effective in comparison to manual
maintenance. This project, which facilitated renewal of track with 60 kg/m, 90 UTS rail (which
has three times the life of 52 kg/m 72 UTS rail in use earlier) and mechanization of track
maintenance was, therefore, appropriately designed and timed to serve the current and future
needs of IR.
39.   With a heavier track structure in place on main corridors and the improved quality of track
maintenance, IR will be in a stronger position to meet the challenge of increasing transport
demand and competition in road transport, as the Indian economy continues to grow at an
expected rate of more than 5 percent per annum.



9-
40.   This project has demonstrated that the mechanization of certain manual operations is
inescapable. As a new generation of infrastructure is introduced, higher standards of maintenance
is called for and utilization becomes more intensive. Furthermore, even in a low wage economy
such as India, the unit cost of maintenance is lower with mechanization of selected activities.
41.   Indian Railways followed its traditional procurement procedures for project
implementation which slowed down procurement. In future operations, it will be useful to insist
that procurement procedure be modified to ensure that tenders are finalized within the original bid
validity of 90 or 120 days. The Bank has already informed India that, as a general policy,
extension of bid validity will, in the future, only be agreed to as an exception and that too only
once. Indian Railways could perhaps try to obtain Ministerial approval of projects as a whole so
that the requirement of individual approval of each bid evaluation at this level, with attendant
delays, is eliminated.
42.   The project monitoring must place the same emphasis on the realization of perceived
benefits as it does on procurement and physical implementation. Future projects may, in addition
to overall and macro-level indicators and targets, have project-specific component-related
indicators and targets which are indicative of project costs and benefits. In case of projects such
as track relay and mechanization of track maintenance, it is essential that costing systems, which
can generate cost data for specific activities, be in place so that it is possible to monitor overall
and unit costs, as well as the benefits that arise as a result of project implementation. Where such
cost systems and indicators are not available, their establishment should precede the start of the
project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
THIRD RAILWAY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2935-IN)
Aide Memoire
1.    This aide memoire presents the findings of the supervision mission for the Railway
Modernization III Project (Loan 293 5-IN). The mission included Messrs. H. Hansen, Task
Manager and J. Sondhi (Consultant) and held meetings with IR officials between September 11
and 18, 1995. The mission appreciates the help of Mr. C. S. Sharma, Executive Director (L&F),
Mr. Rakesh Chopra, Executive Director (TM) and Mr. Gaurav Dave Director (Plng.) and other
staff of Indian Railways.
2.    The original loan amount of US$390 million was earlier revised to US$252.50 million due
to cancellations requested and agreed. Recently another US$3.56 million has been canceled thus
reducing the loan amount to US$248.94 million.
3.    The status at the end of September 1995 for various components of the loan was:
Item                      Allocation          Disbursed
(US$ Million)      (US$ Million)
Rails                       117.50              121.86
Track Machines              129.44              120.97
Consultancy                   2.00                0.83
Total                    248.94             243.66
4.    Rails: All contracts for the supply of rails have been completed and materials supplied
and paid for. No further disbursement is to be made.
5.    Track Machines and Consultancy: All contracts have been placed for track
machines. A commitment for US$781,156 has recently been made for consultancy related
with training of civil engineers. It is anticipated that between October and December 1995,
payments for most of the remaining amount will be made against pending contracts for track
machines and consultancy. A small amount, not disbursed till project closing, is expected to
be disbursed in the first quarter of 1996.



- 19 -
6.    Cancellation: Indian Railways' request for further cancellation has been agreed to and
US$3.56 million was canceled. This cancellation is due to savings as a result of favorable
currency fluctuation in some of the contracts.
7.    Closing Date: The closing date has been extended to December 31, 1995. Most pending
disbursements are expected to be made before the closing date.
8.    The mission once again requested IR to furnish detailed information on actual cost and
physical progress for various elements of the project since the same will be required for the
Project Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The cost information should indicate cost for
total imports, local taxes and duties separately. It was requested that the cost data and physical
progress be furnished latest by November 15, 1995. Indian Railways and DEA were reminded
that the Special Account Audit report for 1994/95 was due by September 30, 1995.
9.    Indian Railways' officials were requested to furnish an update on the following. These
may also be furnished latest by November 15, 1995:
(i)    Measures taken to improve the quality of rails supplied to IR by Bhilai Steel Plant.
(ii)   Status for the acquisition of high speed Track Recording Cars using contactless
sensors.
(iii)   Setting up of an effective Track management System with the help of a modern
Track Recording Car.
(iv)   Fixing of "Thresh hold Values" for track maintenance and renewal with the
assistance of Derby Research Center and results of validation trials.
(v)   Selected Operational Statistics for the year 1994.
8.    The audit report of the project accounts for the year 1993-94 has now been submitted.
The next report (for 1994-95) was due in February 1996. The audit report for the special
account for 1994-95 is now overdue (September 1995). This may be expedited.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
THIRD RAILWAY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2935-IN)
A. Borrower/Beneficiary Contribution
The performance of the project was generally satisfactory. However, the following
observations may be considered by the World Bank in formulating subsequent project, as these
have arisen out of the experience gained on this project:
(1) The World Bank procurement procedure requires very frequent consultation with the
Bank. World Bank could consider standardizing document sectorwise particularly for
the rail sector where considerable data is to be provided.
(2) At the time of formulating the project, the evaluation criteria for the success of the
project and the format in which the data should be collected and maintained were not
specified. In several cases, these may be at variance with the set norms and
procedures of the organization. World Bank may consider formulating after
discussion with the organizations, a suitable success criteria which should be
reviewed periodically, instead of leaving it for a final review at the end of the project.
Together with this, the above mentioned format for data collection should also be
finalized.
(3) The criteria for mid course changes in the procurement of the items and mid course
proportionate reduction and increase in the fund resources should be made more
liberal by the World Bank to allow flexibility in the project as also unnecessary
expenditure of commitment charges before surrender of excess funds.
B. Indian Railways' Comments of Draft ICR
The following are the comments on the above ICR. The relevant paragraphs of the draft
may be modified keeping these comments in view:
(1) Improvement of quality of indigenously manufactured rails - The specifications
for the rails have been revised recently in consultation with the Steel Authority of
India Ltd. These revised specifications will result in the manufacture of improved
quality of rails indigenously. (This point has been reflected in para. 37 of the report.)
(2) Track Maintenance Planning System - The system envisaged:
(i)   development/procurement of a high speed Track Recording System for IR



- 21 -
(ii) development of computer based track management system for need based
track maintenance and monitoring of resources including on-line track
machines; and
(iii) development of threshold value of track maintenance.
The status of the above is as follows:
Item (i): Global bids were called for procuring a Track Recording Car (TRC) because
final bidder with whom negotiations were going on resiled from the original conditions; the offer
was closed.
Simultaneously, IR had upgraded two of its own TRCs for broad gauge for recording at a
high speed with the capability of attachment with fast mail/express trains. Board, therefore,
decided to upgrade under Phase-HI its own two TRCs by providing contactless sensors to
measure alignment and gauge since most of the other measuring devices have been upgraded to
meet all other above requirements, instead of going in for an imported TRC.
Contactless sensors for both TRCs have been procured. These have been provided on one
TRC and tested. First run with mail-express attachment is done on 17th July. Thus, IR had
achieved the objective up to 130 kmph.
Item (ii): Board decided to entrust task of development TMS to CRIS after foreign
firms were found to charge very high. Phase-I of the TMS was successfully developed in 1990-92
and implemented. Under Phase-I of development one sub-division of each zonal railway was
provided with TMS. Under Phase-I1 in 1992 this was provided on the whole of Allahabad
division of Northern Railway besides above sub-divisions. As a next step, 27 divisions of the
golden quadrilateral and its two diagonals were located and identified. It is being provided under
the 9th Plan for a modular composite for computerization in the civil engineering department of
IR.
Item (iii): A project was made by RDSO and consultancy awarded to Transmark with
the approval of World Bank and Railway Board. The contract was signed in 1991. The modules
to be developed including revised track geometry for IR for a range of speeds and traffic
categories and study of TRC on IR and BR to work out methodology for generating corrections
with input to 'roll' and 'Yaw'. The penultimate phase report of Transmark was available only in
December 1995. The same is under consideration of RDSO and Board for further action.

THIRD RAILWAY MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2935-IN)
Economic Analysis
Track Renewal
The evaluation of this project component was originally based on the economic analysis of
complete renewal, comprising re-ballasting, new sleepers/fasteners and new 60 kg/m 90 UTS rail for
different levels of traffic (13, 20 and 35 Million Gross Tonnes) expected to be experienced on various
selected routes for track renewal. The costs and benefits were converted to economic prices by expressing
the imported content c.i.f. prices and applying the factor of 0.8 to local costs. Costs in this analysis were
netted out for the value of released materials in subsequent renewal cycles in the 'without project' case, but
not for the first renewal since the value of released material was the same. The analysis period taken was
the period required to exhaust the service life of 60 kg/90 UTS rail. Assumptions made at the project
appraisal and for post-project analysis are:

The rationale for these assumptions are discussed below:
Traffic Growth: The actual traffic growth for IR for the period 1985/86 to 1994/95 in
terms of net tonne km was 2.4 percent per year against an anticipated growth rate of 4 percent
(Annex C: Table 4). At appraisal it was estimated that on the main rail corridors the traffic
density in terms of million gross tonnes (MGT) will grow at a rate of 5 percent per year, a rate
somewhat higher than the average traffic growth for the entire railway. For IR, the traffic density
grew at about 2 percent per annum during the period 1985/86 - 1994/95. It is seen that on
specific group A routes the annual growth rate of MGT varied from 0.7 percent (Wardha-
Bombay) to 3.2 percent (Mughalsarai-Delhi) except that on one corridor Balharshah-Gudur, it
grew at an annual average of 6.5 percent. The average traffic growth rate on the main corridors
for re-evaluation has been assumed at 3.0 percent per year, i.e., a little higher than the national
average.
Cost of Track Renewal: This project has been carried out over the period 1988/89 -
1995/96. Year 1991/92 was chosen as the reference year for cost of track renewal. Year
1991/92 has also been chosen as the first year for economic re-evaluation. Cost of track renewal
for 1991/92 with 60 kg, 90 UTS rails was estimated from the actual project costs less taxes and
duties. The local costs were converted to economic cost by applying a factor of 0.8. The
economic cost of track renewal with 60 kg, 90 UTS rails came to Rs. 3,125 rnillion per km. The
cost of relay of 52 kg, 72 UTS was estimated in the same proportion as at appraisal (87 percent).
The residual value released assist was estimated at 15 percent of cost of relay.
Operating Cost Saving: The approach undertaken at appraisal was retained except that
the actual operating cost as in 1991/92 of Rs. 265 per thousand NTKM was adopted. A saving of
2 and 5 percent after renewal with 52 kg and 60 kg rails, respectively has been assumed as at
appraisal.
Track Maintenance Cost: At the time of appraisal (1988) track maintenance was largely
undertaken by manual means. In the meantime, track maintenance has been mechanized for
52 kg as well as 60 kg track laid on concrete sleepers. In the re-evaluation, the cost of
mechanized maintenance has been used.
On the mechanized maintenance section laid with 52 kg rails, there are two elements of
cost. As per IR data, these are firstly, the tamping cost (undertaken once a year) which is
estimated at Rs. 12,000 per km and secondly, the non-tamping cost estimated at Rs. 10,000 per
km per year, giving a track maintenance cost of Rs. 22,000 per year. This does not include the
cost of patrolling, drainage and other maintenance activities on and along the track.
It has been the experience that on 60 kg rail track, tamping is required once every two
years. Therefore, the track maintenance cost is Rs. 22,000 in the first year and Rs. 10,000 in the
second year and so on. Indian Railways has had the same maintenance system and cost, even in
the early years after relay, and the reduced cost of maintenance assumed in year one to five after
track relay in the SAR did not materialize.



-28 -
Service Life of Rails: Assumptions as at appraisal of 250 MGT for 52 kg, 72 UTS and
800 MGT for 60 kg, 90 UTS were retained for re-appraisal also.
Investment for Mechanization of Track Maintenance: Since similar investments have
been made for mechanized track maintenance for 52 kg and 60 kg rail track, these investments
were not considered for re-evaluation.
An economic cost-benefit analysis was undertaken and shows an economic rate of return
of 14, 17 and 25 percent for track relay component on sections having traffic density of 13, 20
and 35 MGT, respectively. Somewhat lower IRR than the estimate at appraisal is perhaps due to a
lower rate of growth in traffic density.
There was no change in IRR when it was assumed that the frequency of tamping for track
laid with 60 and 52 kg rails would be the same.
Track Mechanization
The appraisal report did not evaluate the investments proposed for track machines. A
little over half (US$23 million) of the Bank loan has been utilized for the procurement of track
machines for track relaying and mechanized maintenance.
As a result of the introduction of a large number of track machines, it has been possible for
IR to mechanize track maintenance on 24,000 track km of track laid on concrete sleepers. The
mechanization has helped IR reduce the cost of track maintenance substantially. These cost
savings are achieved mainly through a reduction in cost of maintenance staff. As a result of
mechanization, the staff deployment is reduced from 2.2 to 1.1 men per track km for main high
density corridors. Over 10,000 staff reduction has already taken place, mainly through non-
replacement of retiring staff.
It is estimated that every 500 track km requires one high output tamper, one point and
crossing tamper and half ballast regulator. These machines were imported and their economic cost
on c.i.f basis was US$2 million, equivalent to Rs. 46 million, for each section of 500 track km.
Thus the investment for track mechanization was Rs. 92,000 per track km. As per IR data the
operating and maintenance and overhaul cost of track machines per track km is estimated at
Rs. 4,416 and Rs. 13,948, respectively. The overhaul cost is incurred at mid life, that is, after
seven years as these machines have an economic life of 14 years. Using a factor of 0.8, the
economic costs for operation and maintenance and overhaul come to Rs. 3,530 and Rs. 11, 150,
respectively. The economic cost of manual track maintenance for A routes and heavy density
corridors for 1991/92 was estimated at Rs. 58,000 per year (mainly cost of labor) which includes
all costs such as patrolling, drainage and other maintenance activities. Since after mechanization
the labor strength is reduced to half, the track maintenance cost has been assumed at Rs. 34,800
per track km for track after maintenance is mechanized (60 percent of original cost). An
economic evaluation was undertaken for a period of 14 years (life of machines). The residual
value of machines was taken at 10 percent. This analysis shows an economic rate of return of 25
percent for investments for the mechanization of track maintenance. With post-project
maintenance cost of 70 and 50 percent, the IRR changes to 17 and 37 percent indicating that the



-29 -
return on investment is very sensitive to a reduction in maintenance cost and the same should be
monitored closely.
