The project focused on track renewal and\n            modernization with the objective of improving the planning\n            and execution of Indian Railways' (IR) track renewal or\n            upgrading and maintenance program, enhancing the quality and\n            capacity of track and thus promoting efficient train\n            operation and improving IR's financial performance. The\n            above project objectives were pursued by: (i)\n            renewal/upgrading of track on arterial (A routes) and other\n            heavy density routes; (ii) acquiring equipment for track\n            relaying and maintenance; (iii) acquiring locomotives and\n            wagons for transport of track material; and (iv) technical\n            assistance and training. Bank performance were highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower performance was satisfactory. The\n            main corridors on IR have a high traffic density and some of\n            them are working near full capacity, permitting little time\n            for track maintenance.With a heavier track structure in\n            place on main corridors and the improved quality of track\n            maintenance, IR will be in a stronger position to meet the\n            challenge of increasing transport demand and competition in\n            road transport, as the Indian economy continues to grow at\n            an expected rate of more than 5 percent per annum. This\n            project has demonstrated that the mechanization of certain\n            manual operations is inescapable. Indian Railways followed\n            its traditional procurement procedures for project\n            implementation which slowed down procurement.  The project\n            monitoring must place the same emphasis on the realization\n            of perceived benefits as it does on procurement and physical\n            implementation. In case of projects such as track relay and\n            mechanization of track maintenance, it is essential that\n            costing systems, which can generate cost data for specific\n            activities, be in place so that it is possible to monitor\n            overall and unit costs, as well as the benefits that arise\n            as a result of project implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
