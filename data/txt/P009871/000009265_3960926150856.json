Project\n            consists of : (a) renewal and upgrading of 4000 kilometres\n            of IR's (Indian Railways) heavy density routes,\n            especially the major trunk routes connecting India's\n            four major cities : New Delhi, Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta\n            and provision of track equipment and rolling stock for\n            transporting track material. The project, moreover provides\n            advisory services and training in manpower planning and\n            track related services. The principal risk is in\n            implementation delays. This risk is being minimized by\n            allowing advance procurement of equipment needed to\n            implement renewal work and by selecting as the major project\n            component an item which is free of the complex design and\n            procurement issues which have characterized recent projects\n            with IR."}, "docdt": "1988-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
