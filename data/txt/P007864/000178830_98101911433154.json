industrial,\n            agro-industrial and tourism investment subprojects (costing\n            on the average US$190,000), and projects of small-scale\n            productive urban enterprises, mainly operated by artisans\n            (average investment about US$16,000 equivalent); (b) the\n            purchase and installation of equipment to improve Banco\n            Nacional de Fomento (BNF) communications systems; and (c)\n            technical assistance to help BNF design and implement a\n            comprehensive institutional rehabilitation program. The\n            US$10.0 million loan to the Republic of Paraguay will help\n            finance the foreign exchange cost of part of BNF industrial\n            credit program during 1977-81 and the communications system\n            component. A grant of about US$0.5 million from the United\n            Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is expected to finance\n            the cost of implementing the technical assistance component."}, "docdt": "1977-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
