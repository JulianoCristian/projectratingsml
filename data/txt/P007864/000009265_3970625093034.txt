PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PARAGUAY - INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT (BNF)
(LOAN 1419-PA)
PREFACE
This report reviews the performance of the first Industrial credit,
Loam 1419-PA, made to the Development Bank of Paraguay, Banco Nacional de
Fomento (BNF), through the Government of Paraguay, and the impact upon BNF of
a UNDP-financed, Bank-executed technical assistance program which was
conceived as part of the original design of the project.  The loan for US$10
million was approved in May 1977 and, following a one-year extension, the
final closing date was established as September 30, 1983. Final
disbursements were made in December 1983, and a portion of the loan totaling
US$0.35 mllion, mainly Intended for an unused telecommunications compoaent,
was canceled as of June 11, 1984.
This project completion report was prepared by the Bamnk's Latin
America and the Caribbean Projects Department on the basis of data obtained
during a Bank mission to Paraguay in May 1984 and data provided in a draft
project completion report prepared by ENF. Comments from the Borrower are
reproduced as Annex 16.
This project has not been audited the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PARAGUAY - INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT (BNF)
(LOAN 1419-PA)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.          This report covers experience under Loan 1419-PA, an
industrial credit loan for USM10 mil ion, the first made by the Bank in
Paraguay and the second operation through Banco Nacional de Fomento
(BNF). The main objectives of the loan were (a) to help BNF to restore
Its viability through a program of institutional and financial
rehabilitation; and (b) to transfer resources to help finance high-priority
snnall and medium industry and tourism projects in the private sector. A
UNDP-financed technical assistance program (TAP), for which the Bank was the
executing agency, was an integraL part of the project (para. 2.01).
2i          While BNF's performance in achieving the objectives of Loan
1419-PA was, for the most part, satisfactory, the executiom of the project
identified areas where further improvements are required, and lessons to
be learned for future operations were brought to light (para. 6.01).
Disbursements under the US$9.75 million industrial credit component of Loan
1419-PA started more slowly than expected but, ia 1979-1980, picked up
momentum and were completed within appraisal estimates (para. 3.01).  A
US$0.25 million telecommunications component intended to improve 1RNF's
communications with rural branches caused a oae-year delay in the closing
date, but was finally canceled since the service was obtained by BNF directly
from ANTELCO (para 4.04).
3.          A total of 55 subprojects were financed under the loan, with
an average subloan size of US$175,900 (para. 3.03). Only 19 required
subloans above the US$150,000 free limit, and more than half of the total
subloans were very small in size (less than US$54,000). The majority of
subprojects were established in 1980-1981, and all of them were in
operation by the end of 1983.  Only 20 subloans went to new enterprises;
the rest went to expand or improve installed capacity using a significant
proportion (53%) of companies' interaal savings (para. 3.04). In line with
appraisal estimates, sectoral distributlon emphasized food and textile
industries, which received 53% of total disbursements.
4.          The economic impact of the subprojects was on the whole,
satisfactory, although a few of them were severely affected by the recession
of 1982-1983 or by the big floods of 1983. Some 2,100 new or incremental
jobs were estimated to have been generated, with an average cost per job of
about US$13,000.  Ex ante eLonomic rates of return (ERR) for subprojects
above the free limit ranged between 20% and 50%, exceeding the expected
average, at appraisal, of 20%. Ex ante financial rates of return for the



same group of subprojects averaged 35%. Although a detailed ex post analysis
of subproject performance was hindered by a severe lack of regular
supervision by BNF, visits to a sample of beneficiaries and a special survey
of their current status showed a majority of enterprises performing at, or
above, projected levels. A sample of 23 enterprises that received subloans
showed a threefold increment in total sales between 1977 and 1983. Only
eight subprojects were in arrears, representing 11% cf total subloan
financing aad 4% of total subproject cost. This arrearage is reasonable in
view of the recessiox and the natural catastrophes that affected Paraguay in
1982-1983 (para. 3.05 and 3.06).
5.        BEF's progress in institutional development has been substantial,
although uneven. The project was a very important factor in this develop-
ment, mainly through loan requirements, through close Bank supervision, and
through the execution of the Technical Assistanee Program (TAP). Under the
TAP, whose final cost was US$762,000, ENF received 120.6 man-months of expert
assistance in several fields, such as financial management, programing of
agricultural credit data gathering, electronic data processing, portfolio
management, project appraisal and supervision, human resources management and
accounting and auditing procedures (para. 4.02).  Although results as a whole
were positive, some components raise doubts concerning their cost
effectiveness. The most successful components proved to be those which
combined on-the-job training with preparation of manuals and guidelines.  The
program as a whole was rather ambitious and lacked a strong integrating
element. However, it proved sufficiently positive to motivate BNF into
undertaking a second stage of technical assistance, using mostly its own
resources and having as one of its objectives the implementation of some of
the recommendations of the first TAP (para. 4.06). An important element in
making possible the changes in the institution has been the continuity of
leadership by BNF's top management team since February 1976, when the current
President took charge. Under his management,the attitude of BNF has been to
give high priority to institution-building and to welcome the Bank's
technical assistance (para. 4.08).
6.        During the life of the loan, BNF's financial performance improved
significantly.  After operating at a loss for 12 consecutIve years, it has
had profitable operations since 1977. This improved performance was aided by
(a) increased capitalization by the Government, which exceeded the original
appraisal estimates of G 2.4 billion; and (b) improved financial management
induced by the Bank project, and which resulted in increased effective
Interest rates. As a result of the recapitalizatlon program and improved
profitability, BNF's ecquity grew considerably over the period of the loan,
improving its financial structure and liquidity, both of which remained well
within the limits set under the loan (para. 5.04). BNF, however, was unable
to sustain fully the momentum arising from financial rehabilitation
measures. Growth in net income was restrained in the last few years by
increased operational costs and loan arrears.  High inflation levels, in
conjunction with a slowdown in asset growth, have resulted In a decline in
the value of BNF's assets in real terms (para 5.09).



- vi -
7.        Despite commendable positive improvements, there are still some
problem areas In BNF which did not improve significantly during the period
covered by the loan. First, despite earlier improvements, debt recovery
procedures are still very lax, and the political and legal environment
appears to be continuing to hamper debt collection efforts. As a
consequence, BNF's loan arrearage has averaged 20% of total portfolio in the
last few years (para. 5.10). Second, supervision activities are almost
non-existent and inadequate, contributing to the accumulation of arrears and
minimizing the positive impact of debt recovery efforts (paras. 4.12 and
4.13). Third, personnel management policies are rigid and without iacentives
to emphasize functional responsibilities and stimulate professional
achievement (para. 4.09). Fourth, poor data management at the working level
continues to hamper BNF's managerial decisions and hinders the more efficient
use of scarce professional capabilities (para. 4.11).
8.        In retrospect, the project results appear to justify the Bank's
decision to go ahead with the project despite the great difficulties that
affected BNF at the time of appraisal. Appraisal estimates of subproject
performance concerning the loan impact and risks involved in BNF's
institutionaal development were realistic. For the most part, loan objectives
were achieved.  Since greater than normal efforts were required to help solve
BNF's difficulties, mainly of an institutional nature, the time and effort
spent in supervision of the loan and in the execution of the TAP were
justified and made an important contrIbution to the satisfactory results of
the project.  The main lessons to be learned for future operations are that:
(a) Bank projects addressing institutional development require regular and
close supervisioa by Bank staff; (b) the best results in technical assistance
are obtalned when there is a balanced combination of on-the-job training with
preparation of manuals and guidelines and where the consultants Involved
attempted to adapt to the couatry's environment and work within its
restrictIons; (c) a narrowly focused technical assistance program can
facilitate efFective supervision and increase effectiveness in implementation
of recommendations - alternatIvely, large multipurpose technical assistance
programs require stroag In-field coordination; aad (d) expansion in a DFC's
portfolio should be closely monitored aad accompanied by major improvements
in the DFC's supervision capabilitles (paras. 6.05 and 4.06).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PARAGUAY - INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT (BNF)
(LOAN 1419-PA)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This project completion report reviews Loan 1419-PA, the first
industrial credit loan in Paraguay, which was granted to Banco Nacional de
Fomento (BNF) through the Government of Paraguay. The report also assesses
the impact of a UNDP-sponsored Technical Assistance Program, PARJ77/005,
which was an integral part of the institution building and financial
rehabilitation program of Loan 1419-PA. Prior to approval of Loan 1419-PA,
the only bank credit to BNF had been an agricultural loan of US$6.2 million
in 1974. A second agricultural loan of US$22 million was processed in
parallel with Loan 1419-PA. The Bank Group has since become a major source
of long-term credit for BNF. Five additional loans to BNF, totaling US$77
million, have been approved since 1977. As of December 31, 1983, World Baxk
funds represented 84% of BNF's available long-term funds from external
sources.
1.02      BNF, the largest financial institution in Paraguay, was established
in 1961 as a multipurpose bank, lending for agriculture, livestock and
industry. In the mid-1970s, as a result of poor performance and substantial
operational losses, BNF was virtually decapitalized. In 1976, a new
president and board of directors were appointed with a mandate to
rehabilitate the institution. The Government and BNF's new management
requested Bank assistance in developing a financial and institutional
rehabilitation program in addition to am industrial credit loan.
1.03      Macro-Economic Setting and Sectoral Performance 1/. Paraguay is
one of the least industrialized countries in the Latin Amelrican region.
Value added in the industrial sector has accounted for some 16% of GDP, with
a substantial portion of manufacturing activities made up of the simple
processing of the agricultural and forestry resources of the country
(Annex 1). Nevertheless, the sector has demonstrated considerable dynamism
in recent years. From 1975 through 1981, manufacturing grew in real terms at
an annual rate of 10.5%, similar to the GDP growth rate; both represented
historic peaks. However, the sector was not the engine of growth for the
economy during this period; the main impetus to expansion came from external
sources. The first was the rapid expansion, after 1970, in the exports of
two major crops, cotton and soybeans, in response to generally favorable
demand conditions in the principal consuming countries. The second was the
undertaking of investment in the major hydro-electric project at Itaipu and

the initiation of Yacyreta. Construction at Itaipu began in 1975, and, at
its peak in 1981, it was estimated that these expenditures in Paraguay
amounted to 8o of the country's GDP.  Iu addition to the direct impact of
these factors on income and demand, there were substantial indirect effects
since expectations concerning future economic growth stimulated considerable
interest in investment in productive facilities in various parts of the
economny.
1.04      The expansionist phase, however, ended during 1981 with the
emergence of the world recession, falling demand from the neighboring markets
of Argentina and Brazil, and completion of the major construction efforts at
Itaipu, as well as delays in the construction at Yacyreta. A significant
endogenous factor contributing to the recession has been the progressive
overvaluation of the Guarani, which discouraged local investment and
increased the demand for imports. In 1982 and 1983, there were declines in
all sectors of the economy, with the floods in 1983 contributing further to
the recession. However, by the end of 1983, there appeared to have been some
bottoming out in the drop in export demand, and moderate increases in exports
above the previous lows appear to be emerging in 1984.
1.05      The increase in manufacturing output was characterized, during the
period 1976-1981, by a number of structural changes. The relative share in
sectoral output of petroleum refining and products increased substantially as
a result of price increases. The percentage of forest products in total
industrial value added more than tripled, as output expanded almost
sevenfold, with about half of the production going toward the requirements of
Itaipu. While output growth was impressive by most standards, the rate of
growth of employment in manufacturing was somewhat disappointing. Industrial
employment expanded in the 1975-1981 period at a rate well below the increase
in the labor force in the economically active popualation, as well as below
the rates of employment growth achieved in other sectors of the economy.
Available data on investment suggest that there -as a substantial increase in
investment in relatively capital-intensive industries.  The investment cost
to create one job in manufacturing activities during this period is estimated
at some US$35,000 to US$40,000 in 1q80 dollars.
1.06      While little data on sources of long-term finance are available to
permit detailed analysis, interviews with industrialists by the industrial
sector mission in 1983 indicate that foreign suppliers' credits (particularly
from Brazil) played a major role in financing investment in Paraguay d=ring
recent years. Equity and retained earnings constituted the largest source of
finance for industrial investments. Analysis of the projects approved under
the investment incentive law for the period 1975-1980, prepared by a German
consulting group, showed tha' one-third of total investment costs were
expected to be provided by foreign investors. The level of financing to
industry by commercial banks has been increasing since 1972, due, in part, to
a Central Bank regulation which r'equired commercial banks to allocate 20% of
their portfolios to industrial activity. The rate of growth of commercial
bank lending to industry, however, has been restricted in recent years by
their reduced liquidity, resulting from increased reserve requirements. The
principal domestic long-term source of credit for industry was the Banco
Nacional de Fomento (BNF).   In the period 1976 through 1982, BNF approved
some US$150 million in industri,l loans, equivalent to approximately 15% of



-3-
the total industrial investment approved under the Investment Promotion Law
in those years. BNF's lending to the industrial sector was aided by the
availability of funds provided by the World Bank through Loan 1419-PA and
Loan 1866-PA.
II. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE LOAN
2.01      The project had two main objectives: (a) to help BNF restore its
viability through a program of institutional and financial rehabilitation and
(b) to help finance high priority industrial and tourism projects in the
private sector. To achieve the first objective, it was antic,pated that the
Government would increase its paid-in capital by G 2.4 billion, US$19.1
million equivalent, during 1977-1980 and that BNF would reduce operating
costs, increase financial cnarges, improve debt collection procedures,
improve general data collection and cost accountirg procedures, and adopt new
financial and operating policies. To assist BNF, a UNDP-financed,
Bank-executed, Technical Assistance Program (TAP) was made an integral part
of Loan 1419-PA. The TAP was expected to focus on financial and resource
management, cost accounting procedures, agricultural credit analysis,
manpower planning and personnel training.
2.02      With regard to industrial credit, it was expected that Loan 1419-PA
would be directed mainly toward small and medium-size companies. Subloans
were not to exceed US$750,000 per subproject or company, and the average cost
per subproject was expected to be about US$190,000. Bank funds would amount,
on average, to about 5C% of project costs. Finally, a component of
US$250,000 would be used to help finance the purchase of equipment to improve
BNF's communications system between headquarters and its widely dispersed
branch offices.  BSF's performance in utilizing the loan is discussed in
Chapter III. The specific institutional-building objectives and achievements
are reviewed in ChapEers IV and V.
2.03      The project's institution-building and economic benefits were
expected to be significant. It was anticipated that technical assistance and
capitalization wxuld strengthen BNF's institutional capabilities and improve
its financial structure and operations, enabling it to maintain its role as
the primary source of development financing in Paraguay. The loan was
intended to assist BNF in maintaining its historical 202 share of industrial
fixed assets financing during 1977-1980 and, thereby, to help the country to
achieve an expected average industrial growth rate of 6 to 7% per annum
through 1981.  Subloais were to support mainly small- and medium-size
enterprises and, in particular, those that would contribute to the
development of an efficient agroindustrial sector.  The direct employment
generat'on resulting from the project was expected to exceed 2,000 jobs, with
an average investment cost of US$10,000 per job. In addition, a substantial
ind'rect employment effect was expected from the project because of backward
linkages in the agricultural and forestry sectors, given that about
two-thirds of the proposed loan would finance agroindustrial projects. The
impact of the subprojects upon Paragjay's balance of payments would be
substantial. About 60% of the loan proceeds were expected to be lent to
exporting and tourism enterprises. and the remainder to import substitution
industries. The average economic rate of return of subloans under the loan



-4-
was expected to be about 20%. Although no significant risk other than the
usual for DFC-type operations was anticipated for the industrial lending
component, a considerable risk was attached to BNF's expected
institution-building efforts. It was recognized that management would face a
series of difficult decisions requiring strong Government support. Close
monitoring of BNF's operations was recommended.
III. UTILIZATION OF LOAN PROCEEDS
Resource Transfer
3.01      Rate of Utilization.  Loan 1419-PA was signed on May 18, 1977.
After some initial delays in meeting the conditions of effectiveness, the
loan was declared effective on January 17, 1978. Additional delays were
encountered in the initial processing of the subloans since this was the
Banks first DFC-type operation in Paraguay. The first disbursements were
processed in the third quarter of 1978, one year behind appraisal estimates.
Then, commitments and disbursements picked up momentum and, by the third
quarter of 1979, were in line with appraisal estimates (Annex 2). At the
loan's original closing date, September 30, 1982, the industrial component
was fully committed and 93% disbursed. Nevertheless, the closing date had to
be extended until September 30, 1983 in order to accommodate the uncommitted
US$250,000 telecommunications component. After ANITELCO offered to provide
the telecommunications services for BNF's rural office, the loan was closed,
and BNF officially requested cancellation of the remaining US$0.35 million.
By that time, a second Bank loan to BNF, Loan 1866-PA, was already effective.
3.02      Fund Allocation.  Financing for 55 small- and medium-industry
subprojects was provided under this US$9.75 million line of credit
(Annex 3). Of these, 19 were subprojects requiring subloans ranging between
the free limit of US$150,000 and the maximum of US$750,000 permitted per
project or enterprise. The remaining 36 loans were all under US$150,000.
The majority of these, 30 loans, were for less than US$54,000 and went to
companies with assets below US$397,000.
Subproject Characteristics
3.03      Annex 4 summarizes some characteristics of the subprojects.  A
thorough analysis of subproject characteristics was hampered by the lack of
data on current performance of recipient companies and by incomplete records
of the final cost of subprojects and their incremental impact on the perform -
ance of existing firms. Although the number of subloans (55) was lower than
expected at appraisal (200) and the average subloan size was US$175,900,
double the appraisal estimate, only three subloans reached the maximum of
US$750,000 permitted under the loan, with 11 companies receiving subloans for
less than US$20,000. The appraisal estimate of 200 subprojects, with 100
subloans below US$16,000, might have been too ambitious considering that very
small clients are not used to dealing with the banking system in Paraguay,
and that they require special procedures for processing and appraising loans
which were not, and are still not, available in BNF. A second Bank
Industrial Credit (Loan 1866-PA) recognized this fact in 1979-1980 and is
attempting to establish such procedures with a program of assistance to



-5-
small-scale industry (ssI) through the Fondo Especial de Desarrollo (FED) and
Servicio Nacional de Promocion Profesional (SNPP). In the absence of special
procedures, the allocation achieved by BRb should be considered
satisfactory. Twenty subloans went to new enterprises while the majority,
35, were used to expand or improve installed capacity, using a significant
proportion of companies' internal savings (para. 3.04). Sectoral
distribution of subloans was in line with appraisal estimates and emphasized
food industries and textiles, which received 53% of total amounts, followed
by chemicals (pharmaceutical and plastics) with 16% and ceramics (bricks and
tiles) with 8%. Only one project was financed in the tourism sector. The
large percentage of projects funded in the more labor intensive food and
textiles industry resulted in a lower than average investment cost per job
(para. 3.05). Geographically, 69% of the subprojects approved were
established in Departamento Central, of which 51% were in Asuncion,
reflecting the existing concentration of population and of economic
activities around the capital city.
3.04      Maturities of subloans ranged from four to ten years and grace
periods from one to two years, with 45% of the subloans having less than five
years maturity. The Bank's participation in total project cost reached 33%
compared to an original forecast of 50%. Financing through the enterprises'
own resources covered 53% of total ex ante estimated costs, plus all cost
overruns incurred during construction and startup.  In addition, and building
upon the initial impact of the subloan, many enterprises kept expanding
during the 1980-1982 period using their own resources. The combined effort
gave substantial leverage to the funds used in subloans.

Impact And Current Status of Subprojects
3.05      All subprojects financed by the loan are presently in operation,
but, as mentioned in paragraph 3.03, regular supervision of subprojects is
still very weak in BNF and information on the effect of subloans almost non-
existent (para. 4.11). Therefore, in order to gauge the actual impact of the
industrial credit component of the loan, BNF undertook a special survey of
subprojects prior to the arrival of the mission. In addition, the mission
visited a sample of 12 enterprises located in Asuncion, Paraguari and Ciudad



-6-
Stroessner and obtained 1983 financial statements for another 25
enterprises. Annex 5 summarizes the results of the BNF survey. Ex ante
economic rates of return (ERR) at appraisal, for projects above the free
limit, ranged between 20 and 50% against an expected average at appraisal of
20%. Ex ante financial rates of returc (FRR) for the same category of
subprojects ranged between 16 and 39%. In spite of the lack of more
systematic information and of rather unreliable data officially supplied by
firms (due to the widespread practice of maintaining dual accounting
systems), mission visits and spot checks of BEF's survey indicate that ex
post results are in line with or above ex ante estimates (para. 3.06). Total
expected investment was estimated at US$25 million to generate about 2,000
new jobs.  According to BNF's survey, total subproject cost under the loan
reached USS27.3 million, which is very close to the original estimates, but
these results could somehow be distorted since enterprises did not keep a
close account of project costs as a separate item, and a majority of the
subprojects were completed in 1980-1981, three years before the survey. The
minor recorded cost overruns were attributed mainly to increases in
construction costs caused by rising demand during the building of Itaipu
dam. Because the majority of subloans were for expansion or modernization of
existing installations, the survey could not determine very precisely the
incremental volume of employment creation.  However, ex ante estimates for
subloans projected the creation or preservation of 3,900 jobs, of which about
1,500 were to be new jobs. The survey recorded 4,700 jobs created or
maintained through tne implementation of subprojeczs, of which between 1,800
and 2,400 could be Considered new. Based on these results, the average cost
per new job under Loan 1419-PA would fall within a US$11,300 to US$15,100
range, US$14,900 to US$19,800 in 1980 dollars, in line with appraisal
estimates and much lower than overall estimates for the indastrial sector,
which range between US$35,000 and US$40,000 (para. 1.05).
0Perational Results
3.06       Mission viSitS, EBF's surwey and a sample of 1983 financial
statements indicate that most subprojects are doing reasonably well.  As of
April 1984. only eight of the 55 subprojects were in arrears, with total
arrears of principal and interest amounting to US$1 .2 million equivalent,
which represents 11% of the total financing provided by the subloans,
including Bank and BIF resources, and 4% of the total cost of the
subprojects. Such arrearage is very reasonable in view of the economic
recession and the natural catastroDhes that affected Paraguay in 1982-1983
(paras. 1.03-1.06).  It reflect3, however, a wide spectrum of external
factors ranging from flooding of the materials source in the case of one big
brick factory to a shortage of imported raw material in the case of some
garment manufacturers, and it reflects, as well, some internal -weaknesses,
particularly a widespread entrepreneurial deficiency in financial management
and an inability to cope with critical events. On the cther hand, many
subloan recipients took advantage of the 1977-1981 growth period to
consolidate and/or expand their operations, and the recession found them well
established in the rather structured Paraguayan market.  Combined total
sales, for a sample of 23 firms which received loans for expansion, were
USS122.1 million in 1983, compared -witnh USS44.6 million in 1977, before
implementation of the subprojects.  Even allowing for distortions in
information caused by the lack of regular supervision and the use of dual



accounting systems mentioned previously, overall performance of the
subprojects financed under the loan can be considered quite satisfactory.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The Technical Assistance Component
4.01      G5vea the very weak financial condition of BNF at the time of loan
appraisal, one of the main objectives of the project under Loan 1419-PA was
to help BNF to restore its financial viability tbrough a program of
Institutional and financial rehabilitation.  This obj ective was to be
achieved, in part, through a comprehensive technical assistance program
jointly designed by the Bank, BNF and UNDP and implemented concomitantly with
the Bank project. The program was expected to cover a two-and-one-half year
period, to retain expertenced consultants total-ing about 96 man-months at an
estimated cost of US$500,000, to be financed by UNDP and BNF, and to have the
Bank as executing agency. The program was expected to assist in upgrading
financial management, programing and budgeting policies and procedures; to
improve flancIal reporting and cost accounting; to review and assist in the
planning and training of manpower; and to assist in programing agricultural
credit operations.  Coordinating the execution of the technical assistance
program and of the lending components was expected to require extensive
supervislon by Bank staff,  which, in the process, would provide additional
on-the-job assistance to BNF.
4.02      The Technical Assistance Program (TAP) was reviewed several times
during execution in order to reformulate or add components as a consequence
of observed results. The maiL revision (revision -C-), in October 1978,
added four activities: implementation of financ5al programing and resource
management; improvement of BNF's debt recovery system and portfolio
administration; assistance to the Development Department in appraisal and
supervision of industrial projects and assistance to BNF In establishing its
electronic data processing system and a telecommunications network between
headquarters and its rural branches. Further periodlc revisions of the TAP
introduced few changes of substance, but made periodic adjustments of the
budget to reflect required extensions or shortening of consultant
appointments. As of the last revision (revIsiou -K'), in 1982, the TAP had
used 120.6 man-months of experts and consultants with a total budget of
US$762,095, of which UNDP contributed US$578,410 and BNF US$183,685.
ExecutIon of Program PAR/77/005 lasted over four years, from the time the
first expert arrived in BNF in September 1977 until the last one finished his
assignment in late 1981. During that period, 15 experts were engaged in the
Program, w-ith individual appointmeats ranging from two weeks to two years.
Supervision by Bank staff required a total of 7.3 man-months, which can be
considered an additional coatribution to techaical assistance.  Some
components not fully covered or implemented under PAR/77/005 are now being
reviewed and implemented ia a second stage of technical assistance currently
under execution by BNF with some foreigpi support, but using mostly its own
resources .2/
2/    BNF has described these compoaents in Annex 16.



-8-
4.03      Annex 6 sumarizes the achievements of each TAP component and the
tasks included in the second stage currently under way. Some results of the
TAP are clearly discernable in BNF's present operations, which are reviewed
in the rest of this chapter. The first component to produce tangible results
was that on financial monagement (para. 4.08), with the Financial Management
Department being established at the end of 1978. It provided the basis for
sound programing and administration of BNF's resources, helped BNF to fulfill
one of the conditions for releasing the second tranche of Loan 1419-PA and
prepared the ground for implementation of some other components of the TAP.
Other components which had a reasonable degree of success included
strengthening of the Development Department's appraisal procedures
(para. 4.11), improvement of BNF's accounting systems and procedures (para.
4.19) and development of BNF's debt collection procedures. On the other
hand, another component, the assistance in electronic data processing, was
not so successful. It had a long and laborious development because of
problems with suppliers of equipment and software. After three years r'
dealing with a computer representative in Paraguay and with foreign suppliers
of specialized software for banking operations, BNF had to start all over
again in 1981-1982 with a new equipment supplier, with new software and with
retraining of personnel, and it is now moving ahead in what seems to be the
appropriate direction. The mission examined, in retrospect, the information
available at each stage of decision for this component, and, in spite of the
delays and problems observed, it has concluded that the course of action
recommended at each stage was appropriate at that time.
4.04      The telecommunications component also went through a laborious
development which started in September 1977 with a report recommending the
use, by BNF, of ANTELCO's network rather than developing a parallel system.
Only in those areas not covered by ANTELCO was BNF expected to install its
own VHF radio equipment. Another consultant reviewed equipment needs and
assisted BNF in its negotiations with ANTELCO to use the existing
infrastructure. The first stage of liaison with 23 branch offices was
completed in early 1980. The second stage required additional consultants to
review the type of radio equipment to be used and to prepare the bidding
documents, which were subsequently reviewed by ANTELCO and the Bank in early
1982. Following an international tender for purchase of equipment, two
proposals, one for US$4.0 million and the other for US$2.0 million, were
received for equipment which BNF had estimated would cost US$0.4 million.
Consequently, BNF declared the tender void in May 1982 and, in 1983, reached
an agreement with ANTELCO through which the latter provided the
telecommunications services to those BNF rural offices for which the
equipment was necessary. As a result, and at BNF's request, the US$0.25
million component of Loan 1419-PA earmarked for telecommunications equipment
was canceled. This component is probably very typical of a difficult case
for technical assistance evaluation. While, on the one hand, the end result
fits with the initial objective, which was to improve BNF's communications
system, on the other hand, a high cost was involved in obtaining the results,
and there is no way to ascertain with precision whether the same results
could have been obtained, and when, without all the consultants involved
during the six years it took to resolve the problem.
4.05      Another component which encountered a few problems and which is not
reviewed elsewhere in the report was the agricultural credit component. This
component was expected to produce a methodology for programing agricultural



- 9 -
credit. In practice, the expert in charge developed a methodology, but he
had to invest more of his time in generating the data to estimate future
demand of credit than in applying and testing the methodology. Although the
final results were perceived by BNF as positive, this component was out of
the main stream of concern of the rest of the TAP and, consequently, received
less supervision and support during execution.
4.06      The results for most components of the TAP are described in Annex 6
and discussed further on in the sections dealing with the procedures of ENF
(paras. 4.07 to 4.20). Although TAP overall results are considered positive,
there are still some lessons and conclusions applicable to its procedures
which deserve to be highlighted:
(a)   Most components under the TAP were expected to combine a
certain amount of on-the-job training with the preparation of
reports and operating manuals. In retrospect, the amount of
on-the-job training and report-writing varied a great deal
from one consultant to another, and the impact of the
assistance was in direct proportion to the amount of time
spent by the experts in implementing their own
recommendations. Long reports or manuals, with little time
left for training and implementation, had reduced impact upon
BNF. In addition, results indicate that the most influential
experts were those who, in addition to having practical
knowledge of their subject, made an important effort to adapt
to the Paraguayan environment and to work within its
restrictions.
(b)    In retrospect, the coverage of the TAP was rather ambitious,
and it was set up as a group of components rather than as an
integrated package. Although three of the experts were
formally appointed, in successive periods, as coordinators,
for administrative and reporting purposes, there was no
hierarchical relationship between the coordinators and the
rest of the experts in the field. The principal coordinating
function rested with the periodic Bank supervision missions,
-which then had to cover areas as different as
telecommunications, agricultural credit, financial
programing, computer software and human resources
management. As a result, some experts (e.g., agricultural
credit and personnel management) performed their assignments
with little connection to the rest of the team.
(c)    On balance, the institutional changes in BNF between 1977 and
1983 were substantial, and it is unquestionable that the TAP
had an influence on the changes. It is very difficult,
however, to ascertain how many of the institutional changes
were due to the appointment of a strong administration in
early 1976, which guided BNF during all the period covered by
this report, how many can be credited to the TAP itself, and
how many to close and frequent supervision by Bank staff
during the period. Probably a good indicator of the TAP's
influence was the eagerness of BIF's administration to
implement, mainly with its own resources, a second-stage TAP



- 10 -
and the hiring, as ENF's own coordinator for this program, of
one of the experts selected by the Bank under PAR/77/005.
The results of the TAP provide evidence that technical
assistance impact depends not only upon the design of the
program and the interest of the supplier, but also, and more
importantly, upon the timing of the assistance and the
attitude of the recipient.
Management, Staffing and Organization
4.07      ENF was established in 1961 as a Government-owned autonomous entity
under the authority of the Ministry of Finance with a mandate to promote and
finance projects in agriculture, livestock, forestry, industry and commerce.
In order to carry out these objectives, BNF was given a complex institutional
structure composed of three operational departments each having separate
capital, financial resources, and lending programs. The three departments
were initially supported by an Administrative Department which included
functions as diverse as accounting, legal services, supervision of over 40 of
BNF's rural branches, personnel management and loan collections. It is
against this background that the instituional rehabilitation objective set
forth in Loan 1419-PA has to be measured.
4.08      As a result of negotiations for the loan, and with support from the
TAP, a number of steps were taken to strengthen BNF's organization, reflected
in the changes made in the organization between 1977 and 1984 fAnnex 7). The
Financial Department (FD) was established in 1978, with responsibility for
preparing BIF's annual budget, coordinating resource mobilization and
allocation among BNF's lending departments and branches, preparing financial
plans and forecasts, and managing BNF's liquidity.  In addition, a Loan
Collection Office (OKP) was strengthened and recently put under the direct
control of the Portfolio Coordinating Committee (CCC), itself established to
improve portfolio quality and collection of loans in arrears. Also as a
result of the TAP, and in order to carry on its second stage of
implementation, a Technical Assistance Unit, reporting directly to the
President, was established in late 1981. The Computing Center was completely
restaffed and, for the present, is being managed directly by the Technical
Assistance Unit in order to complete the retraining of personnel and the
preparation of all software.   Further organizational changes are now being
studied, including the possibility of integrating BNF's three autonomous
departments to ensure BNF's operations as a unified, sound development bank.
The preceding changes and the financial rehabilitation of the institution
were made possibie by the clear and strong leadership of BNF's top management
team, which has been in place since February 1976 when the current President,
Mr. Julio Rejis Sanguina, took charge. Under this management, BNF's attitude
throughout the execution of Loan 1419-PA and, currently, of Loan 1866-PA, has
been to give high priority to institutional building and rehabilitation and
to welcome technical assistance from the Bank.
4.09      A major roadblock to further improvement of BilF's work quality is
the lack of well trained technical staff. Because of restrictionrs in
mobility of personnel and a system of incentives based more upon age in the
institution than upon functional responsibility, staff quality, productivity
and morale have been low. Under the TAP, a specialist in personnel



- 11 -
management completed a staff survey of job descriptions, salary structure,
present and projected staff levels and training needs. The final report,
presented by the specialist in 1980, was very critical of existing personnel
policies and included recommendations to BDF's management to review personnel
policies, procedures, salary levels and staff positions with a view toward
enabling BINF to attract and retain suitable staff. However, BNF's management
has been extremely cautious in applying some of the recommendations. Annex 8
presents the evolution, since 1976, of BNFs staff composition and shows
that, in spite of the institutional changes and with the exception of the
number of accountants, the rest of the structure remained very similar.
Although major changes in incentive policies could be a very sensitive issue
for BNF, one of the most important public sector institutions in Paraguay,
BNF's management recognizes that failure to review the present scheme might
jeoDardize the future growth of the institution and cause it to lose part of
the momentum gained so far. In view of the impracticality of attempting
substantial restaffing, BNF has embarked upon a major and costly retraining
program for all segments of personnel, which will introduce them to
administrative and banking practices. The program started with basic
training and has not yet reached the more specialized banking practices
required by medium-level professionals.
The Development Department
4.10      The Development Department (DD) was responsible for administering
Loan 1419-PA and is currently handling a portion of the Bank's second
industrial credit to Paraguay. The DD has mainly been engaged in the
financing of manufacturing industry and agroindustrial activities. Much of
ti-e DD's lending has been oriented toward medium and large-scale industrial
enterprises, although, under Loan 1419-PA, the majority of subloans went to
small-medium enterprises. The DD's operations have been financed mainly with
long-term funds from bilateral and multilateral lenders (IBRD, IDB, USAID and
KfW). The DD has direct responsibility for appraising subprojects,
supervising subloans and authorizing disbursements. To upgrade its
performance in such functions, DD has received technical assistance,
particularly for project appraisal and supervision, not only from the Bank
but also from other multilateral lenders.
4.11      Appraisal Procedures.  The DD's appraisal procedures improved
steadily during the period. Two experts under tne TAP were assigned to the
DD, one for 18 months and the other for 12 months. Both provided on-the-job
training and developed appraisal and supervision manuals for subprojects in
order to facilitate and systematize department procedures. Close supervision
of subproject analysis by Bank staff provided additional assistance in
upgrading appraisal quality. The team of analysts (five professionals in
early 1984) has been in the DD an average of four years, providing a certain
continuity of operations. In spite of these developments, further
improvements in appraisal procedures are still needed. Analysts tend to
spend too much effort on data collection and filling in every item of
information required by administrative procedures (from BNF and from outside
lenders) rather than on making judgments concerning the underlying
assumptions and the overall viability of the pro3ect. Special forms and
guidelines for reviewing small-scale projects (subloans under US$40,000) were
prepared as part of the TAP and have been an important help. However,



- 12 -
procedures for SSI are still too cumbersome, and, in a second stage of
upgrading, the available forms could be further streamlined to replace some
of the current data requirements with information and detailed knowledge
about the entrepreneur himself, which is the key variable in small business.
In the medium to large size subprojects, further improvement in the analysis
of market and technical alternatives is needed.
4.12      Project Supervision.  Supervision procedures were a subject of
major concern between BNF and the Bank during the execution of Loan 1419-PA.
Supervision was identified, at loan appraisal, as one of the weak points in
the structure of the DD and of ENF as a whole. A plan of action to
strengthen supervision was agreed during negotiations of Loan 1419-PA and,
subsequently, during negotiations of Loan 1866-PA. One of the TAP experts
assigned to the DD during 1980-1981 prepared a complete supervision manual,
including forms and instructions, for three stages of supervision:  (a)
supervision during disbursement, to ensure proper utilization of funds; (b)
periodic desk supervision, based on financial statements and information
supplied by enterprises; and (c) detailed field supervision during operation
of the subproject, to be used when financial supervision detected major
weaknesses.  An initial effort to comply with the provisions of the loan
agreement for Loan 1419-PA and to apply the results of the TAP was undertaken
in 1980-1981.  The staff of the Supervision Division was increased to a total
of 15 persons, many of whom received on-the-job training from the TAP
expert. Thereafter, the Supervision Division was gradually disbanded, as
staff leaving the division were not replaced, and, by the end of 1983 and in
early 1984, it reached its lowest level with only three staff, none of whom
has special supervision training.
4.13      At present, supervision activities are almost non-existent and have
been reduced almost exclusively to routine follow-up during disbursements. Of
the 55 subprojects financed under Loan 1419-PA, only 21 were ever visited for
supervision. Among these 21, only three supervision visits were made in
1984, seven in 1983. Some of the subprojects have not been supervised since
1980-1981. The lack of supervision of its outstanding loans has been one of
the main factors preventing BNF from reducing its level of arrears, which
have grown faster than debt recoveries. To address this weakness, BNF's
management is currently considering some organizational changes and an
important reinforcement of supervision activities for the institution as a
whole. Unfortunately, the training in supervision activities provided under
the TAP could be considered lost because staff trained have since left and
additional training will be required to prepare new staff in these tasks. It
is unlikely that results could be very rapid, but a lack of aggressive action
in this area could hinder any serious effort to reduce the portfolio in
arrears.
Systems and Procedures
4.14      One condition of loan effectiveness was the approval by BNF of a
satisfactory Policy Statement. A draft statement was prepared, with Bank
assistance, during appraisal of Loan 1419-PA. It was approved and adopted by
BNF and, except for minor adjustments to reflect updating of loan sizes, is
the same Statement of Operating Policies and Procedures which is currently
being used (Annex 15).



- 13 -
4.15      Debt Collection.  BNfF*s level of arrears in 1976-1977 and its debt
collectio,n procedures were additional points of major concern during
appraisal of Loan 1419-PA. On December 31, 1976, BEF's reported arrears
amounted to 22.0% of outstanding portfolio.  In addition, auditors indicated
a significant level of unreported arrears in the branch offices. BIT's
arrears situation was not only serious in its amount but also extremely
complex to manage because ENP is a multi-purpose, multi-sector financial
institution and different approaches are required in collecting arrears from
distinct types. Also, some of the oldest arrears were in loans made in
support of Government-sponsored programs (such as the National Grain
Program), for which lending decisions were based predominantly upon political
rather than technical grounds. One condition for effectiveness of Loan
1419-PA was that ENF should prepare and adopt a manual for debt collection
and implement a debt recovery plan acceptable to the Bank. During the post
appraisal mission for Loan 1419-PA, in January 1977, Bank staff members
worked closely with BNF's management and staff to (a) gather information on
loans in arrears in order to prepare a loan collection plan; (b) determine
actions to be taken by BDF on loans with arrears above G 2 million; and (c)
design control systems and procedures for a more effective recovery system.
The draft recovery procedures prepared clearly defined the role of the Loan
Collection Office (ONP) which had been established in March 1976, the
supervision departments and branch offices, department directors, and BEN's
Consejo Administrativo. The debt recovery plan which was agreed upon at
negotiations established (a) debt collection objectives based on amount and
length of arrears; (b) procedures and a time frame for achieving the
objectives; and (c) a goal of reducing arrears to 15% of total portfolio by
the end of 1978 and to 10% in 1979 and subsequent years.
4.16      BNF was slow to adopt the measures called for under the debt
recovery plan. Although some progress was made in recovering major
delinquent cases, loan recovery efforts in 1977 were still haphazard and
inadequate, and the loan collection office was understaffed. Bank missions
in 1978 also found major problems with BNF's debt recovery efforts, including
lack of data on delinquent clients, no specific strategy for loan recovery
and poor supervision of loans. The establishment of a committee composed of
directors of the three departments to oversee collections, to implement
policy changes, to expedite negotiations, and to define and standardize terms
for rescheduling was recommended. The impact of continuing supervision and
assistance by Bank staff proved positive.  A Portfolio Coordinator Committee
(CCC), consisting of the directors of the three departments, was set up in
September 1978, and the Loan Collection Office (ONP) was strengthened. The
scope of the technical assistance program (TAP) was extended to provide BNF
with assistance in portfolio control and management. BNF's debt recovery
efforts intensified in 1979 and, during the first quarter, BIF recuperated
about half of the amount that had been recuperated during the 1977-1978
period. Since then, the results of BNF's debt collection efforts have been
uneven. Despite some successes (para. 5.10), arrears have ranged between 16
and 22d of total outstanding portfolio since 1979.
4.17      Debt recovery targets set under World Bank loans provided important
incentives for BNF's debt recovery efforts. In early 1979, when it was
recognized that the goals of 15% and 10% were unrealistic, the Bank agreed,



- 14 -
based on a review of actual loans in arrears and on an assessment of
collectabillty, to a minimum collection level of G 600 million of arrears of
more than 180 days as of December 1978. In July 1979, BNF reached a level of
G 625 million of collections for the first semester, and, on this basis,
access to the second tranche of Loan 1419-PA was granted. To provide an
additional incentive, one of the conditions for effectiveness of the second
loan was that BNF collect not less than G 725 million from loans which
individually were in arrears for more than G 2 million each as of October
1979. BNF was also required to adopt a debt recovery plan with specific
targets for debt recovery. Bank-BNF dialogue has continued to emphasize the
importance of BNF's debt recovery efforts.
4.18      While there has been a significant improvement in debt collection
achieved partly through the constant Bank assistance mentioned previously,
some of the main flaws in debt collection procedures are still present in
BNF, and it should be recognized that there is ample room for improvement in
this area. Debt collection procedures are still very lax and supervision is
almost non-existent. Problems are not detected in time, and entrepreneurs
are not assisted while they are still recoverable. Direct action or
assistance is often delayed to the point where it can no longer be
effective. There is no clear definition of priorities in the debt recovery
efforts, and there is some confusion at staff level and a tendency to
associate the concept of a development bank with lack of strength in recovery
procedures. While it appears that legal procedures in Paraguay do not
facilitate rapid execution of mortgages and collateral, the past track record
on recoveries has favored the image of BNF as a patient creditor which can
always be left until the end of the line.
4.19      Accounting Systems and Procedures.  BNF's accounting system
improved considerably over the perioa of the loan. In 1976, when Loan
1419-PA was appraised, BNF's financial reporting and cost accounting were
very weak. Data on branch office overations were inadequate, with
significant levels of unreported arrears and inadequate and incomplete
reporting on status of accounts, especially by the Agricultural Department.
One of the objectives of the TAP was the strengthening of BNF's accounting
system.  The consultants hired under the program reviewed BNF's accounting
policies and procedures and concluded that deficiencies in BNF's accounting
policies meant that: (a) there was uncertain evaluation of main asset
accounts; (b) interest receivable was not adequately recorded and accrued;
(c) extraordinary income such as penalty interest rates were not properly
recorded; and (d) accounting for contingent assets was inadequate.
Accounting procedures and breakdown of acccants were found to be outdated and
in need of revision. In addition to the fact that accounting and financial
information systems were not sufficiently accurate, delays experienced in
producing reports limited their usefulness for management control (e.g.,
monthly balance sheets were one month late, and accounts were not classified
according to maturity, impeding estimations of liquidity).
4.20      In view of the preceding inadequacies, the consultants proposed
that BNF adopt a new computerized accounting system. At the time that the
consultants' report was presented, implementation of the proposed system was
not possible because BNF's computing resources were inadequate and the lack
of communication links between branch offices and Headquarters prevented



- 15 -
timely collection of data. These areas have since been improved and the
recommended system, with some modifications, is currently being implemented
under the second stage of the TAP. At the time of the completion mission in
May 1984, a new, fully computerized accounting system for the Head Office was
already in service, and consolidated balance sheets and income statements for
Read Office and branch offices were being prepared on a daily basis by the
Computing Department. These.improvements, in conjunction with cash flow
projections and detailed five-year financial projections prepared by the
Financial Department, have facilitated BNF's management of its resources.
Availability of daily financial data has improved BNF's cash management.
Five-year financial projections, in particular of resource requirements for
each department, have allowed BlE to identify, in a timely fashion, future
needs for long-term and short-term credit.
V. OPER&TIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Operations
5.01      BNF's disbursements grew from G 10,123 million in 1978 to a peak of
G 21,374 million in 1981 before declining to G 18,820 million in 1983
(Annex 9).   Growth in lending operations was not consistent throughout the
period. initial growth in 1978 was relatively modest despite BNF's increased
licuidity from the recapitalization program and increased demand deposits,
partly because of the decision taken by BNF to use G 1.6 billion of its new
resources to reduce BNF's obligations to the Central Bank.  BiF's lending
operations reached a peak in 1981, influenced by the buoyancy of the
industrial sector and favorable agricultural prices.  In 1982, with the
impact of the recession, both the Commercial and the Development Departments
experienced sharp declines in lending activity, reducing the growth rate of
BNF's portfolio.
5.02      Agricultural lending, particularly short-term  loans for crop
production, continued to be the most important aspect of BiNF's operations.
Annual disbursements by the Agricultural Department grew an average 22% in
the period from 1978 to 1983, exceeding the average inflation rate and
increasing the Department's share of total BNF disbursements from 495 in 1978
to 67p by 1983.  Factors favoring the growth of agricultural lending were (a)
increased production and export of agricultural products; (b) favorable
prices for cotton, soyDean and wneat; (c) availability of long-term funds
from the World Bank, KfW, UJSAID and IDB for agricultural lending; and (d)
short term agricultural production loans and liquidity support from the
Central Bank (para. 5.08).
5.03      Approvals by the Development Department during the period of the
loan increased from G 1,693 million in 1978 to a peak cf G 2,117 million in
1981 before declining to G 1,970 million in 1983 (Annex 9). Lending to the
industrial sector in the period 1978 to 1981 was favored by the direct impact
of expenditures and the increased income and demand arising from the
construction at Itaipu.  Initial approval and disbursement growth by DD,
however, was lower than expected because of the inadequate promotional
efforta of the department.  During the period, the department's lending was
also adversely affected by the difficulty experienced in raising counterpart



- 16 -
funds. On average, 50% of total lending by DD to the industrial sector went
to industries producing consumer products, i.e., food products, beverages,
tobacco, textiles, wearing apparel and leather goods (Annex 9). Approvals by
DD peaked in 1981, declining by 9.5% between end-1981 and end-1983 as a
result of the recession in Paraguay's export markets, low world prices for
agroindustrial exports, and competition from contraband imports. The floods
in 1983, the reduced growth of the tourism sector following the devaluation
of the Argentine and Brazilian currencies, and the reduced profitability of
firms relying upon imported materials as a result of the imposition of
foreign exchange controls further curtailed demand for investment funds.
Over this period, DD's portfolio declined by 2.3% in real terms, reducing its
share in BIF's total disbursed portfolio from 21.6% in 1981 to 19.1% in 1983.
Financial Performance
5.04      After operating at a loss for 12 consecutive years, BNF has been
making profits since 1977, demonstrating a significant improvement in
financial performance (Annex 10). A comparison of projected and actual
balance sheets (Annex 11) sho-ws that growth in total assets, net portfolio
and total equity compared favorably with appraisal estimates. There were
significant differences between BNF's financial position in 1976, when
Loan 1419-PA was appraised, and BNF's performance during the period of the
loan. -fNF's interest and commission income increased from G 1.4 billion in
1976 to G 4.6 billion by 1983. The resulting financial spread increased from
5.3% of average outstanding portfolio in 1976 to 8.4% by 1983. Roughly
three-fourths of BlE's operating income was generated by the Development and
Agricultural Departments. Through the recapitalization program, discussed in
paragraph 5.05, BNF's capital structure and other financial ratios improved
significantly (Annex 12). Its debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 12.9:1 in
1976 to 3.23:1 by 1983, staying well within the 8.1:1 limit established under
Loan 1419-PA throughout the period. BNF s liquidity also improved, remaining
above the 1 .1 limit through 1982 despite the impact of increased legal
reserve requirements imposed by the Central Bank in 1979, although it fell to
1.03:1 in 1983 as a consequence of the increase in BilF's loan arrears and
in_:eased short-term liabilities.
5.05       B3!F's improved financial performance was made possible by a major
recapitalization program and an increase in effective interest rates, both of
which were conditions for effectiveness of Loan 1419-PA. In 1976, a series
of heavy portfolio losses, initially from the national grain program and then
as a result of the Agricultural and Commercial Departments' inadequate
lending policies and supervision procedures, had left BNlF virtually
decapitalized. In order to compensate BIF for past decapitalization and for
anticipated future losses and to provide a capital base to support future
borrowings, the Government agreed, during negotiations for Loan 1419-PA, to
make a G 1.3 billion capital contribution to BIE prior to loan
effectiveness. Through other Government commitments which involved
capitalization of outstanding IDB loans, a budgetary contribution in 1977
equivalent to 10% of B}3F's paid-in capital and compensation for accumulated
agricultural portfolio losses, BNF obtained a further G 2 billion of capital
between 1976 and 1980.



- 17 -
5.06      Low financial income in relation to its financial expenses was
identified, during appraisal of Loan 1419-PA, as one of the principal factors
which affected MNO's financial condition. An increase in effective lending
rates for the Agricultural and Development Departments to 13% was therefore
made a condition for effectiveness of the loan. Compliance with this
condition had an immediate effect upon BNF's financial revenues a-d financial
spread (para. 5.04). Since the original increase, as a consequence of the
improved financial management resulting from the establishment of the
Financial Department, BNF's lending rates have been adjusted several times,
allowing it to maintain an average spread of about 9% since 1979. In
addition to the above measures, BNF's financial position was further
strengthened by the satisfactory resolution of the FINAP project. During
regotiations of Loan 1419-PA, assurances were obtained that the Government
would compensate BNF for any payments overduLe by more than 90 days from any
one project or borrower (including FINAP) with loans or guarantees in excess
of 30% of BNF's equity. This condition was not complied with during the
period of Loan 1419-PA, but the Government eveutually fulfilled its
obligations in 1981, when, as a condition for effectiveness of the second
loan, it agreed to take on the obligation to repay Loan 1419-PA, thus
compensating BNF for losses resulting from FINAP.
5.07      Although BNF's total assets grew an average 12.1% annually in
nominal terms during the period of the loan, exceeding appraisal estimates,
this was due, to a large extent, to the impact of inflation. In real terms,
total asset value declined by 7%, and the net loan portfolio grew by only 8%
between 1977 and 1983. The growth in BNF's net income, both in absolute
terms and in relation to the growth of its portfolio and assets, was less
than projected at loan appraisal, remaining relatively low during the period,
despite improvements in financial spread and leverage.  Althouigh net income
exceeded appraisal estimates in 1977 and 1978, by 1979, the increase in
operating costs (para. 5.09) and the level of loan arrears (para. 5.10)
resulted in a reversal of the previous trend and, by 1981, net income was
roughly half the original appraisal estimate. In the last two years, 1982
and 1983, return on equity and return on net portfolio averaged 2.19% and
0.67% respectively, reflecting continuing poor net income performance.
5.08      On average, 32%  . the growth in BNF's portfolio and assets was
financed by checking, savings and term deposits, 16% by external borrowings,
32% by local borrowings, and 28% by increased equity.  BlF's reliance upon
external borrowings, particularly short-term bank and suppliers' credit, has
declined since 981. The World Bank Group, which has approved a total of
US$77 million in loans for BlF since 1977, was the most important source of
long-term external credit over this period.  At year-end 1983, World Bank
loans represented 84% of BNF's available long-term funds (Annex 13).  Local
short-term borrowings, primarily from Banco Central de Paraguay (BCU), have
also become an important source of funds for BNF in recent years.  BCP's
agricultural support program provides funds annually to institutions lending
for agricultural production on the basis of projected total demand for credit
and each. institution's historical share of agricultural product lending. A
significant percentage of this amount has been allocated to BlF based upon
its historical high share of lending for wheat (85%), soya (25%), and cotton
(25p) production.  Additionally, as one of the conditions for effectivenesss
of the second industrial credit, 1866-PA, a short-term self-liquidating



- 18 -
rediscount facility of about US$8 million equivalent was established by BCP
for BNF.  This arrangement allows BEF to resort to BC? financing during the
period of peak demand for agricultural credit, thus solving the liquidity
problem it had experienced previously because of the seasonal nature of its
operations. With this liquidity support, ENF was able to utilize part of its
large cash balances for long-term lending, although its cash balances, in
general, have still remained well above appraisal estimates. In 1981, to
complement other local sources of funds, BEF issued agricultural bonds.
Through this mechanism, it w-as able to raise G 1.5 billion of new resources
for agricultural and agroindustrial lending.
5.09      Progress made by BEF in reducing operating costs was
disappointing.  A major cost reduction program, in 1978, reduced ENF's
operational costs as a percentage of its total outstanding portfolio from
5.7% in 1976 to 5.4% in 1977, the target set under Loan 1419-PA.  However,
BIEF was unable to maintain costs at this level. Increases in staff salaries
in 1978, to compensate for the impact of inflation, contributed to a 17%
increase in operational costs between 1977 and 1978. Since then, operational
costs increased steadily, rising to 7.8% of average outstanding portfolio by
1981 instead of decreasing to 4.9% as anticipated during appraisal, primarily
because of high inflation levels over the period. Inflation in 1979 reached
20% (as compared to 11% in 1978), averaging 16.5% between ,979 and 1983.  The
impact of inflation upon staff costs in particular, which represented about
75% of BiF's total operational costs, was significant.  With the reduced
staff levels following staff reductions in 1978, ENF had little scope for
reducing costs further through additional staff cuts. Further, in order to
keep qualified staff, it had to pay salaries which are comauetitive with other
banks and businesses. These factors were recognized at the time of appraisal
of the second loan, and the target for operational costs was raised to 6.5%
of average outstanding portfolio.  However, BNF was still unable to meet the
new target, and operational costs have remained above this level since 1380.
Portfolio Arrears
5.10      Despite efforts to rehabilitate ENF's portfolio, both under
Loan 1419-PA and the subsequent Loan 1866-PA, portfolio arrearage continued
to be a major problem for BEF. As mentioned previously, IMF's loan arrears
amounted to 22% of the total outstanding loan portfolio at the time of
appraisal of Loan 1419-PA, and access to US$6 million loan funds under Loan
1419-PA was made contingent upon progress in reducing loan arrears until it
became clear that this goal was unrealistic for BKF (para. 4.17).
Notwithstanding major debt collection efforts, reported levels of loan
arrears in the period 1977 to 1979 were high, increasing from 21.8% at the
end of 1977 to 22.4% at the end of 1978, falling slightly to 20.1c at the end
of 1979. Although BEF was able to reduce its loan arrears in 1981 and
significantly increase the level of recoveries, Particularly of agricultural
loans (para. 5.11), the proportion of loans falling into arrears increased
faster than recoveries, and the level of arrears averaged 20% of total
outstanding portfolio between 1980 and 1983 (Annex 14).  Lack of supervision
of outstanding loans contributed to the increase in arrearage. In add4tion,
debt collection by ENF was made more difficult by the legal and political
environment which hampered debt collection efforts. . It is important,
nevertheless, to note that the present overall level of arre&rs does not



- 19 -
adequately reflect what was achieved by BNF's debt recovery efforts. First,
during 1977-1979, there were some significant recoveries of arrears which
were outstanding as of 1977. These reductions in arrears were largely
canceled by improved reporting, which resulted in increased arrears being
listed on BNF's accounts, and by a change In the definition of arrears, which
are now listed as such the day after the payment is due and not 30 days
after, as in 1976.  Second, BNF is reluctant to write off doubtful loans
(some of them 15 and 20 years old) because of possible legal implications
that could limit BNF's claim should a client become able to repay, as was the
case in early 1984, when very good prices for soya allowed some farmers to
repay debts nearly ten years old. Third, the level of arrears of BNF in
1982-1983 cannot be measured only in relation to the -ideal, but must be
contrasted with that of the rest of the private banking system in Paraguay,
which, as of December 31, 1983, recorded an average 19.6Z of arrears as a
percentage of outstanding portfollo.3/ Finally, during the period
1982-1983, the economy was affected by some extraordinary events over which
BNF had little or no control: a sudden loss of markets in Argentina and
Brazil, strong restrictions on availability of foreign exchange for raw
materials, and floods during the first part of 1983.
5.11      The level of loan arrears varied across departments.  In 1977, the
major portfolio problems were in the Agricultural Department, where loans in
arrears represented 23.8% of the total outstanding portfolio.  Between 1978
and 1980, loans in arrears averaged 23.5% of the total outstanding
agricultural portfolio. In 1981, arrearage in the agricultural portfolio
decreased significantly, falling from 24.3% of the total outstanding
portfolio in 1980 to 16.6Z. This reduction was caused by two factors:
first, the reduction in arrears growth in the branch offices and agencies;
and, second, the recovery of a long-standing overdue debt of about US$10
million, which was recovered through foreclosure and adjudication. Favorable
prices for agricultural products from 1981 through 1983 also helped to
insulate agricultural lending from the impact of the recession. The
Development Department initially had the lowest level of loan arrears; 14.1%
of DD's portfolio was in arrears in 1977, falling to 12.1% by 1978. However,
decreased supervision of DD loans, in corjunction wiith the economic
recession, resulted in loan arrears increasing significantly by 1983 to 18.7%
of the total outstanding portfolio. The performance of the portfolio of the
Commercial Department was also adversely affected by the recession. By
end 1983, the decrease in the department's portfolio, in conjunction with
increasing arrears, resulted in arrears of 47.5% of the outstanding
portfolio. High levels of arrears In CD were also due, in part, to factors In
the Paraguayan environment (para. 5.10), which restricted BNF's recovery
measures.
3/    Based oa published balance sheets for all banks in Paraguay as of
December 31, 19°3. Arrears for some of the local branches of private
foreign commercial banks were as high as 31.0% (Baak of America), 33%
(Chase Manhattan), 27% (City Bank), 24% (Bostoa) and 23% (Banco do
Bras'A).

VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01      While the performance of BNF in achieving the objectives of Loan
1419-PA was, for the most part, satisfactory, the execution of the project
enabled identification of areas where further improvements are required as
well as lessons to be learned for future operations. Disbursements under the
industrial credit component of Loan 1419-PA started more slo-ly than expected
but, in 1979-1980, picked up momentum and w-ere completed within appraisal
estimates. Thne USS0.25 million telecommunications component caused a
one-year delay in the closing date and was finally not utilized since the
service it was intended to provide was obtained by BNF directly from
ANTELCO. A UNDP-financed, Bank-executed technical assistance program (TAP),
which was carried out in conjunction with the loan, was completed in 1981 and
was a key element in fulfilling the institutional rehabilitation objectives
of Loan 1419-PA.
6.02       A total of 55 subprojects were financed under the loan.  Only 19
reouired subloans above the US$150,000 free limit, and more than half of the
subloans were small in size (less than US$54,000). Thirty-five subloans were
used to expand or improve installed capacity, using a significant proportion
of companies' internal savings and thus multiplying the impact of Bank funds,
which covered only 33% of total project cost.  In line with appraisal
expectations, sectoral distribution emphasized food industries and textiles,
which received 53% of total disbursed amounts. In spite of a severe lack of
data due to poor subproject supervision by BNF, mission visits and a special
BNF survey indicate that all subprojects were in operation by the end of 1983
and performing in line with, or better than, expectations. Some 2,100 direct
new jobs are estimat'ed to have been generated, with an average investment
cost per job of about US$13,000.  In addition, about 2,600 jobs were
maintained through the improvement of existing firms' productivity and
profitability. Total sales. for a sample of 23 enterprises which receitred
subloans, expanded threefold between 1977 and 1983.  Ex ante economic rates
of return (ERR) for subprojects above the free limit ranged between 20 and
50% against an expected average, at appraisal, of 20%.  Although there is a
shortage of reliable ex post data on subprojects, mission estimates indicate
that results are in line with ex ante projections.  As of early 1984, only
eight subprojects were in arrears for an amount representing 11% of
outstanding subloans and 4% of total subproject value.  This arrearage is
reasonable in view of the economic recession and the natural catastrophes
that hit Paraguay in 1982-1983.
6.03      BNF's progress in institutional development has been substantial,
although uneven. The project was a very important factor in this
development, mainly through loan requirements, Bank supervision, and the
execution of the TAP. Under the TAP, whose final cost reached US$762,000,
BNF received 120.6 man-months of expert assistance in several fields, such as
financial management, programing of agricultural credit loans, data gathering
and electronic data processing, portfolio management, project appraisal and
supervision, human resources management and accounting and auditing
procedures. Although results, on the whole, were positive, some components
raise doubts concerning their cost effectiveness. The program was rather
ambitious and lacked a strong integrating element. However, it proved



- 21 -
sufficiently positive to motivate BEF to undertake a second stage of
technical assistance, using mostly its own resources and having, as an
objective, the implementation of the recommendations of the first TAP. An
important element in making possible the above changes in the institution has
been the continuity of leadership by EIF's top management team since February
1976, when the current President took charge.  Under his management, the
attitude of BEF has been to give high priority to institution-building and to
-elcome the Bank's technical assistance.
6.04      The Government took the necessary steps, agreed upon with the Bank,
which were designed to bolster the long-term resources base of BNF and to
strengthen BNF's overall financial coordination.  Appraisal forecasts were
correct in estimating the need for full Government support in order to carry
out the rehabilitation process. As a result of the increased funds provided
by the Government and revised financial policies, BNF was able to operate
profitably throughout the period of the loan. Growth in total assets, net
portfolio and total equity in nominal terms compared favorably with appraisal
estimates.  BlF's financial structure and liquidity improved considerably,
staying well within targets set under Loan 1419-PA.  BNFi, however, was unable
to meet the targets set for reduction in loan arrearage and operating costs.
Both of these increased steadily over the life of the loan, averaging 20% of
total outstanding and 7.8% of average outstanding portfolio in the last three
years. 4s a consequence, the growth in BliF's net income has slowed. With
the exception of these two areas, BNF's financial management is generally
satisfactory. Improved accounting data and the availability of cash flow
projections and five-year financial projections, prepared by the Financial
Department, have allowed BNF to make better use of its resources and to
forecast, in a timely fashion, its need for short-term and long-term funds.
Both of these improvements were directly or indirectly due to the impact of
the TAP.
6.05      In spite of the preceding signs of positive development, BNF is
still hampered in its growth and effectiveness by a few problem areas in
which there is still ample room for improvement or in which BNF did not
evolve significant&y during the period of Loan 1419-PA. First, debt recovery
procedures remain very lax and slow and, as an consequence, BNF's level of
arrears has averaged 20p of total portfolio in recent years. Second,
supervision activities are insufficient and inadequate, having reached, in
1983 and early 1984, their lowest point since 1977. The lack of supervision
contributes to the accumulation of new arrears and negates the efforts of BNP
in debt recovery. Third, personnel management policies are rigid and lack
incentives to stimulate professional achievement.  Fourth, poor data
management at the working level is still hampering a more efficient use of
scarce professional capabilities. All four problems are causes of major
concern in the Bank-BNF dialogue and are being partially tackled by BNF
through its second-stage TAP. Although it is unlikely that results can be
very rapid, the Bank, based upon the institution-building experience of this
loan, should continue with close supervision during the execution of Loan
1866-PA.  Some lessons which could be learned from this first Bank industrial
loan to BNF are summarized as follows:
(a)     The problems of rehabilitation of a large, multipurpose Government
development bank w-ere much more complex and intractable than
initially realized. Substantial progress would not have been



- 22 -
possible without an appropriate combination of management
willingness to change, an intensive technical assistance program
and close and regular supervision by Bank staff. The last two
elements were especially important in maintaining the momentum
through frequent visits and renewed inputs to the institution.  In
the case of Bank supervision, the lesson to be learned is that,
when institutional development is an important objective of a
project, close supervision is a key element in fulfilling that
project objective and more regular visits are fully justified.
Supervision can be facilitated if technical assistance programs
have a narrow focus rather than complex, multipurpose objectives.
More complex programs require strong coordination in the field.
(b)     The most effective corntributions in the teohnical assistance
program were those ir. which the preparation of manuals or reports
by consultants was a.:comparied by, or immediately followed by,
implementation. Such was the case for the establishment of the
Financial Department amd the upgrading of appraisal procedures.
In other areas, BoF has decided to continue with a second stage of
technical assistance and will carry out the followup and
implementation of the results of the first stage. This is not
always the case, and an important amount of work could have been
lost or used inefficiently.
(c)     In spite of major efforts by BIF to reduce its arrears, the lack of
appropriate and regular supervision of all outstanding loans has
created a flow of arrears that counterbalances all the positive
efforts in debt recovery.  This situation raises a general question
regarding the practicality of encouraging t*he growth in portfolio
of an institution before the institution is fully committed and
soundly prepared to keep a close control over that growth.

MF's TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRA (STAGE II)
I * To continue institution-building programs, EBF has established a
second-stage tecbnical assistance program. For phase II, UNDP was
financially unable to assist EF. It -as therefore decided to continue
the Technical Assistance Program with some help of international
experts, but essentially with ElF's own resources, and under BEF's
direct coordination.
2.   The phase II objectives have been defined by BNF's Board of Directors as
follows:
(a) Strengthening of accounting, computing, financial management,
and administration of BNF's lending operations; and
(b)  Implementation, under M's responsibility, of the
recommendations and changes made under TAP PAR/77/005 in
telecommunications, loan appraisal and supervision, and human
resources.
The implementation of the second phase started in early 1982, under the
coordination of Mr. C. Verastegui, one of the experts hired under
PAR/77/005. All activities are carried out by a special mnit (Unidad
de Asistencia Tecnica) which reported directly to BNF's President.
Phase II was initially expected to last until 1984 and to cover the
following areas:
(a) Accounting and financial administration
Ci)  Design and introduction of a new computer-based accounting
system linking the branch offices and headquarters;
(ii) Establishment of the financial budgeting and planning system
at headquarters and interior offices;
(iii) Design and introduction of BNF's lending operations manual,
based on the methodology and procedures recommended in
PAR/77/005; and
(iv) Implementation of the recommendaticns concerning the Treasury
and Budget Divisions of the Finance Department.
(b)  Data processing
(i)  Choice of e;Laipment and software to be used by 3NF;
(ii) Restructuring of the Data Processing Department (Computing
Center). Restaffing and training of personnel to operate
taF's equipment and system;
(iii) Acquisition, through purchase or lease, of all data processing
equipment and systems; and

AN     
Page 5
(iv) Test and startup of systems and preparation of operations and
guidelines.
(c)  Human resources
(i)  Implementation of the human resources recommendations proposed
by PAR/77/005;
(ii)  Additional work on job descriptions and terms of reference for
BUF's functional units, with a view toward establishing a
remuneration system based upon responsibilities; and
(iii) An intensive-training plan for all levels of personnel in BUF,
in particular for those who will be responsible for
implementing the operational tasks and systems to be proposed
under the Technical Assistance Program.
(d) Industrial credit
fi)  Implementation of recommendations in PAR/77/005 concerning
programing, appraisal and supervision of industrial credits in
the Development Department.
ie) Banking operations
li) The survey of current regulations, rules, printed forms and
procedures for proper banking operations to be used as the
basis for the new computer-based operations system.
(f) Agricultural credit
(i) Implementation of the recommendatons made by PAR/77/005 on the
programing and management of agricultural credit for suitably
reorganizing the Agricultural Department; and
(ii)   Preparation-of suitable guidelines and operational manuals for
agricultural credit.
4.   At the time of the completion mission, May 1984, most of the activities
listed above were under way, but the final date for implementation had
been extended until 1985. BNT requested, in 1984, that the coordinator
be paid out of the technical assistance funds available under the Bank's
second industrial credit (1866-PA). The Bank agreed to this request.
