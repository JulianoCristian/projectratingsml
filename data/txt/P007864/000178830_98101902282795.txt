REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY FOR AN
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I subnmit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$10.0 million to assist
in financing an Industrial Credit Project. The interest rate on the proposed
loan would be 8.2% per annum. The Government would make available the proceeds
of the loan to Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) at the same interest rate plus
a commission of up to 1/2 of 1%. BNF, in turn, would relend the loan proceeds
to subborrowers at an effective rate of interest of at least 13% per annum,
and with terms of 4 to 12 years, including an appropriate grace period.
Amortization of the proposed loan would be made on the basis of a flexible
repayment schedule with a maximum term of 15 years based on the aggregate of
the amortization schedules of subloans. The Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
PART I - TIE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Medium- and Long-Term Economic Prospects
of Paraguay" (899-PA) and a sector report entitled "The Agriculture Sector of
Paraguay" (933-PA) were distributed to the Executive Directors in December 1975
and February 1976, respectively. An updating economic memorandum is near comple-
tion and will be distributed to the Executive Directors in the near future.
A su2mmary of Country Basic Data is attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        Paraguay's econormy has recently begun a period of rapid transforma-
tion, largely stimulated by the expansion of production of exportable crops
and the construction of the Itaipu hydroelectric project, on Paraguay's east-
ern border at the Parana River. This project, a joint effort with Brazil,
will be one of the largest projects of its kind ever built. Expenditures
for its construction would be equivalent to about four times Paraguay's
national output in 1976. Under the terms of a treaty between Brazil and
Paraguay, a binational authority was created to construct and operate the
project. Financirig to the binational entity will be provided by Brazil and
suppliers' credits with the guarantee of the Brazilian Government. Paraguay
will be entitled to half the power outTput of Itaipu and its acquisition of
50% of the ownership of the plant would be financed from the revenues generated
by its sales of power to Brazilc  The initiation oi construction activities in
1975-76 has already had a streng favorable impact on the balance of payments.
Net foreign exchange resoérves increased by US$65 million during 1975-76,
primarily because Itaipu's large capital inflows more than offset its negative
effects on the current account deficit, which climbed sharply from an average

-2-
of US$9 million in 1972-73 to nearly US$190 million in 1975-76.  The indirect
effects of the project have also been notable. The initiation of the Itaipu
works and the possib 1ity of further development of the hydroelectric potential
of the section of the Parana River bordering Argentina have already resulted
in an upsurge of private direct investment (from an average of US$6.0 million
in 1972-73 to an average of US$37 million in 1975-76), and sharply increased
the demand for public services and development credit.
Current Economic Position
4.        Despite the handicap stemming from Paraguay's landlocked position
and the disadvantages inherent in the country's remoteness from the major
world markets, the Paraguayan economy was able to achieve moderate, but fairly
steady growth (4.6% per annum) during the 1960s. This was accomplished in an
environment of monetary stability and balance-of-payments equilibrium, as
indicated by an average inflation rate of only 3% and a stable exchange
rate.
5.        The 1970s have witnessed an acceleration of the country's growth
with GDP increasing at an average annual rate of 6.7%, due largely to an
expansion of output in agriculture and agriculturally based industry. Agri-
culture, the main sector of the economy, accounts for about one-third of
GDP and about 97% of export earnings, including processed agricultural
commodities. Industry, on the other hand, accounts for about 15% of GDP.
Agricultural and industrial production expanded at an annual rate of about 6%
during the 1970-76 period. This performance represents a notable improvement
over the average growth rate experienced during the previous decade, when the
increase in agricultural and industrial output barely kept pace with popula-
tion growth. The rise in external demand and favorable prices were probably
the most important factors in accelerating growth. However, the effective
supply response of Paraguayan agriculture was also made possible by a consis-
tent effort on the part of the Government to improve the country's transport
infrastructure and implement a comprehensive set of programs designed to
increase and diversify exports, particular,y of agricultural and agroindus-
trial products.
6.        The recent rapid growth of agriculture (nearly 7% annually between
1972-76) has had a favorable effect on Paraguay's agricultural income and
employment. About four-fifths of the increase in crop production is attri-
butable to the expansion of land under cultivation by small- and medium-
farmers who have benefited from the Government's efforts to colonize new lands.
The Government, aware of the country'.s unexploited agricultural potential,
has committed itself to the colonization of virgin lands and the increase of
production Qf exportable agricultural commodities. Since the early 1960s,
the Government has established about 250 colonies of over 40,000 families for
settlers from the Asuncion minifundia zone. Although existing institutions
have been unable to provide the colonies with all the needed services and
infrastructure, the colonization policy has brought about major changes in
the land.tegure structure.  Moreover, considerable success has been achieved
in implementing three major commodity prcgram3 (soybeans, cotton and tobacco)



-3-
.which have been instrumental- itt improving small farmers' income. The share
of these crops in total export earnings has increased from only 18% in 1972
to 44% in 1976. The rapid expansion of production of these relatively labor-
intensive commodities, coupled with the increased demand for labor generated
by the construction of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Project, have led to a rise
of more than 50% in real agricultural wages since 1971.
7.        The adverse effects of the international economic situation on the
Paraguayan economy since 1973 have been surprisingly small. Although there
was a decline in economic growth from 8.3% in 1974 to 5% in 1975, the economy
recovered and grew at an estimated 7% in 1976. Inflation which had escalated
to 22% in 1974, largely reflecting price increases in the the foreign sector,
was brought under control rapidly as price increases declined to 8% in 1975
and to an estimated 6% in 1976. The ability of Paraguay to sustain its growth
and restore financial stability was largely due to: (a) continued strong
demand for Paraguayan exports (other than beef) and good supply responses
in agricultural commodities; (b) large private capital inflows associated with
oil exploration in the Chaco region; new investment opportunities related to
the construction of the large hydroelectric power projects in the Parana;
investments in land, agroindustries, commercial banking, and other indus-
tries stimulated by the incentives provided to foreign investors; (c) the
authorities' adherence to flexible pricing policies, allowing increases in
- oil, wheat and meat prices to be entirely passed on to the consumer; and
(d) an adoption of monetary, fiscal and incomes policy designed to restrain
the growth of consumption.
8.        Paraguay's imports have risen much more rapidly than its exports
since 1973--34% per year compared with 15% for exports. The rapid growth of
imports largely reflects higher prices (and, to a much lesser extent, import
volumes) for petroleum and petrochemicals, and imports associated with the
Itaipu dam. Export growth has been inhibited by EEC restrictions on beef
imports and limitations on wood imports in neighboring countries. This has,
in large measure, been offset by the growth of other agricultural exports.
The divergence between export and import growth has resulted in a swing in
the trade balance from a small surplus in 1973 to a deficit of US$131 million
in 1976. The rise in the current account deficit has generally paralleled
that of the trade gap, reaching US$206 million in 1976.
9.        Despite the large and rapidly increasing current account deficit,
heavy capital inflows have, as already noted, permitted the country to achieve
overall balance-of-payments surpluses during the last four years. Net foreign
exchange reserves reached a level of US$152 million at the end of 1976, equiv-
alent to five months' imports. The Government has relied more heavily than in
the past on external borrowing and this has resulted in a notable, although
not serious increase in external debt. Total public and publicly guaranteed
debt (disbursed only) has risen from US$149 million at the end of 1974 to
US$222 million at the end of 1976. The country's debt service ratio has risen
from 6.7% in 1974 to 6.9% in 1976. On the whole, however, the level of debt
is moderate, average interest rates modest, and the maturity structure reason-
able enough so that there is no threat to the country's external liquidity.



-4-
Economic Prospects
10.       Paraguay's development prospects are quite promising.  The exploit-
ation of the country's vast hydropower resources will provide a source of
plentiful low cost energy and foreign exchange earnings. The construction
of the Itaipu project jointly with Brazil and other possible projects in
cooperation with Argentina will provide a significant stimulus to the growth
of the economy, while capital inflows associated with them fortify the balance
of payments. In addition, since only 12% of the country's arable land is
presently under cultivation, there is also considerable potential for further
expansion of agriculture and agroindustry taking advantage of the country's
extensive land suitable for agriculture, livestock and forestry, as well as
favorable market opportunities in its main trading partners.
11.       The Government's development strategy aims at sustaining the growth
momentum of agriculture and agroindustry, giving high priority to land settle-
ment and to the provision of transport infrastructure to facilitate the flow
of goods to markets and export outlets. It is implementing a program to
assist farmers in settlement areas to increase their productivity and is
expanding credit for agriculture and agroindustries. In the case of small
farmers, the emphasis is on the consolidation of existing colonization schemes
and the establishment of a few new ones. Through foreign private investment
and credit programs, the Government hopes to underpin the concurrent develop-
ment of industries, particularly of those that would help raise the value
added content of its primary production. The results to date indicate the
soundness of this approach; real per capita income increased by more than 35%
during 1967-76.
12.       Sustaining rates of GDP growth in the 7-8% range will require
stepped-up investment efforts on the part of both the private and public
sectors. Continued high rates of economic growth are bound to place consider-
able pressure on the country's social and economic infrastructure. An accel-
eration of public capital formation will require tax action to ensure the
generation of internal resources to provide the domestic contribution for the
investment program.
13.       At the same time, the achievement of a 7-8% GDP growth rate during
1977-81 will require increasingly large capital inflows from foreign private
and official sources. Despite an expected recovery of Paraguay's traditional
exports (beef and wood) during this period, a continued strong growth of soy-
beans and cotton exports, and a considerably higher level of sales for the
construction of Itaipu, the balance-of-payments current account deficit is
projected to widen from US$200 million in 1976 to about US$600 million in
1981. The larger gap will result primarily from a continued rapid increase
of imports, particularly capital goods, and goods and services for the Itaipu
project. The transactions associated with this project will continue to exert
a major impact on Paraguay's current account balance as nearly 40% of the
projected annual deficits during the next five years will be directly attri-
butable to Itaipu.



-5-
14.       The direct capital inflows stemming from the Itaipu project will be
more than sufficient to finance its contribution to the current account defi-
cit and should, in fact, cover 65% of the entire external gap. These capital
flows will, in turrn, be serviced by foreign exchange receipts resulting from
the sale of Paraguay's share of the electricity produced by the dams after the
first turbines are installed in 1984. This will leave a requirement of
approximately US$165 million per year to be financed from other sources.
Direct private investment, which can be expected to continue growing rapidly,
would provide about one-third of this. Suppliers' credits and official
external assistance will probably provide US$75 million per year. The
remaining gap of about US$35 million would need to be financed by borrowing
from commercial banks. Since Paraguay has in the past obtained the bulk of
its capital needs on concessionary terms and, as a result, its present debt
service ratio is low by initernational standards, the country's creditworthi-
ness is not expected to be impaired by additional borrowing of this estimated
magnitude. The debt service ratio is expected to remain between 10-12% until
1981, assuming that funds from bilateral and multilateral sources will continue
to be forthcoming, thereby preventing an undue hardening of Paraguay's overall
borrowing terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PARAGUAY
15.       Paraguay has received US$103.8 million (net of cancellations) in
Bank loans and IDA credits. Of this amount, US$58.3 million has been in the
form of teni lERD loans, and eight credits totalling US$45.5 million have been
made from IDA resources. As of March 31, J.977, the Bank and IDA held
US$96.1 million, including US$47.3 million undisbursed,  The amount held by
the Bank ana IDA was equivalent to 25.2% of Paraguay's external debt, a
blend of about 45% IDA and 55% IERD, and the service on this debt amounted to
13.1% of total debt service in 1976 representing about 1% of exports of goods
and nonfactor services.  On a sectoral basis, Bank and IDA assistance to
Paraguay has been 45% for agriculture, 32% for transportation, 19% for educa-
tion and 4% for preinvestment studies in several sectors. Execution of these
projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory.
16.       IFC has had only one operation in Paraguay.  In 1974, it financed
a wood processing project.  Its participation, a US$5.4 million operation with
FINAP, S.A., consisted of a US$4.0 million loan, and equity participation of
US$1e0 million, and a contingent loan for the financing of cost overruns of
US$0.4 million, Annex II contains a summary of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of December 31, 1976, and niotes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
17.       Bank Group lending to Paraguay in FY76 consisted of a credit for
preinvestment studies and a Third-Window loan for vocational training, total-
ling US$8.0 million. In FY77, the program consists of the recent'ly approved



-6-
Third Education Project, and the proposed industrial credit and rural develop-
ment projects. In addition, work is underway on highway maintenance and con-
struction, a rural water supply and a domestic airports project for possible
consideration by the Executive Directors during the next two years.
18.       In lending to Paraguay, the Bank Group tries to assist the Govern-
ment in achieving four major objectives which are interdependent and comple-
mentary. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more widely than
before and, more particularly, to attack directly the problem of rural poverty.
A second objective is to help Paraguay expand output, including exports, by
supporting projects that directly or indirectly make large contributions to
production and employment. A third objective is to support programs that will
bring about improvements in the management of the economy and, particularly,
that will help to strengthen public institutions and financial intermediaries.
A fourth objective is to transfer sufficient external resources to complement
Paraguay's domestic savings and provide the necessary funds for maintaining
an adequate level of economic and social investments in a framework of sound
domestic finances and a viable balance of payments.
19.      WIhile the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of the
Bank Group's program in Paraguay, the other three jointly determine its compo-
sition. Naturally, many operations serve more than one of the ends listed and
may, moreover, support more specific government objectives. Thus, Bank Group
assistance for education and rural development is designed to help ease the
rural poverty problem and to improve the educational standards of the lowest
40% of the income distribution scale. Bank Group lending for industry is
aimed at increasing the value added of agricultural products destined for
export and at expanding marketing outlets for small farmers. Lastly, loans
in the transport sector are designed to transfer resources to Paraguay and
to help improve institutional structures and policies of the sector, which
play a vital role in supporting the production activities of the agricultural
and industrial sectors. The proposed project will help strengthen the Banco
Nacional de Fomento, which is the most important source of credit in Paraguay,
and support the industrial development of the country.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCING
The Sector
20.       The industrial sector plays an important role in the Paraguayan
economy. It accounts for about 15% of GDP, 70% of the country's foreign ex-
change earnings (mostly agroindustrial products) and 16% of total employment.
The sector's economic significance is highlighted by its close interdependence
with the agricultural sector--about three-fourths of Paraguay's exports con-
sist of processed and semiprocessed agricultural goods. The sector is charac-
terized by the small size of enterprises, most of which employ less than ten
-- rrkeavs,. lTuatrial,-irowth has accelerated during the l-97Gs, averaging 72X



-7-
per annum during the 1970-74 period, and has made a significant contribution
to overall economic expansion.  While in 1975 the sector's rate of growth
declined to 1.8%, largely due to difficulties in marketing processed beef, it
recovered to an estimated 9% in 1976, mainly due to an expansion of construc-
tion and a moderate recovery of the manufacturing subsector. The rapid
expansion of industrial production was made possible by a rapid rise in
external demand, an effective supply response induced by appropriate Govern-
ment policies and an increased availability of investment credit.
Policies and Investment Climate
21.       Paraguay's political stability and the Government's deliberate
effort to create a policy framework conducive to the expansion of private
investment have created a favorable investment climate. Following the enact-
ment of the 1970 Investment Promotion Law, fixed industrial investment rose
substantially, increasing at an average annual rate of about 15% in real terms
during 1971-74, compared to the 4% growth achieved during 1965-71.
22.       The Investment Promotion Law provides tax holidays and import duty
exemptions for projects judged to be either "necessary" or "convenient," based
on criteria established in the National Developmenit Plan. "Necessary" indus-
tries include mainly those processing domestic raw materials for export, while
the "convenient" category covers mainly labor-intensive irAport substitution
industries. The Paraguayan Technical Planning Secretariat (STP) annually
prepares a list of "necessary'" and "convenient" subsectors and the Ministry
of Industry and Commerce (MIC) grants the beniefits (by decree) for indiv'idual
project requests.  The Government has agreed to grant similar benefits to
subprojects financed with the proceeds of the proposed loan (Section 3.05 of
the Loan Agreement).
23.       Although Paraguay's nominal tariffs appear high, actual protection is
low for most consumer products since there is substantial nonregistered trade
across Paraguay's long borders, particularly with Brazil and Argentina.
Effective protection may even be negative for many Paraguayan industries which
have to pay duties on imported inputs without enjoying any effective tariff
protection on their finished products. This de facto openness has discouraged
the creation of inefficient import substitution industries, favoring the
establishment of relatively efficient, mainly export-oriented industries,
based on the country's comparative advantages.
Growth Prospects
24.       Conditions are favorable for a furtlher acceleration of industrial
growth in Paxaguay over the next few years. Industrial output is projected
to grow at an annual average rate of 6-7% in real terms during the 1977-81
period, about the same as in 1975-76. The growth rate could be even higher if
Paraguay is able to take full advantage of the opportunities for industrial de-
velopment stemming from a rapidly rising demand for goods and services during
the construction phase of the large hydroelectric projects referred to in paras.
3 and 10 above. This increased demand should initially enhance the growth



-8-
prospects of various industrial activities such as construction materials,
beverages, textiles and foodstuffs and eventually of energy-intensive industries
by the mid 1980's when the hydroelectric complexes are expected to be in opera-
tion. On a subsectoral basis, manufacturing industries are expected to grow
at an annual rate of about 8-9%, and agroindustries at about 5-6% during the
1977-81 period.
Investment Requirements
25.       It is estimated that to reach an estimated growth rate of 6-7%
during the 1977-81 period would require industrial investment averaging
almost US$50 million per year in current dollars. This level of invest-
ment seems attainable, particularly considering that during 1970-74 industrial
investment averaged about US$35 million per year and that it grew at an
annual average rate of 15%. To finance this level of investment, however, it
will be necessary to mobilize a larger flow of internal and external resources,
a difficult task in a country where the capital market is not yet well devel-
oped and where the main source of development credit, the BNF, faces serious
financial and operational problems (see para. 42).
26.       Presently, equity and credit financing account for about 55% and
45% respectively of total industrial financing. About one-half of new equity
investments involve foreign capital inflows and the other half is financed
with retained earnings. The credit financing, on the other hand, is funded
through development banks (46%), commercial banks (29%), and suppliers (25%).
The Financial System
27.       Paraguay's financial system consists of the Central Bank (CB), which
also operates the Livestock Fund, BNF, 13 commercial banks (mostly foreign
controlled), and COMDESA (a small private development finance company), and a
1housing bank. BNF is the largest institution, holding 37% of the banking
system's total outstanding portfolio in 1975; commercial banks accounted for
47%, the Livestock Fund for 10%, and the other institutions for the remaining
6%.
28.       BNF is the main source of term lending, accounting for about 85% of
the total outstanding. Short-term lending, on the other hand, has been
provided mainly by commercial banks, which account for about 95% of total
short-term credit. Although commercial loans typically average 90 days, they
are usually rolled over, raising their effective term to close to one year.
29.       Resource mobilization by the banking system has been increasing
substantially faster than GDP. Overall, deposits doubled from a level of 7%
of GDP in 1965 to 13.5% in 1975. However, the outstanding banking portfolio
has been rising only at about the same rate as the economy (averaging 5.4% per
year in real terms since 1965), mainly as a result of the Government's high
reserve requirements. To stimulate the growth of foreign deposits, reserve
requirements on them have been set at 15%, compared to 42% on deposits in



_9-
domestic currency. This has spurred a drive to increase foreign deposits
(which yield 7.5% a year, the same as local currency deposits) and resulted
in fast growing foreign exchange savings accounts. The banking system holds
today some US$22.2 million equivalent in foreign exchange, compared to only
US$1.6 million in 1972.
30.       The country's interest rate structure is by and large consistent
with that required for efficient resource allocation. Interest rates to
savers have kept up with an estimated 7.2% rate of inflation during the
1965-75 period and interest rates to borrowers have been positive in real
terms. Yields on commercial bank portfolios have averaged about 15% per
year--ranging from 12.5% for agricultural and industrial loans and 23% for
commercial activities providing a rather high 6% spread over the current 9%
average cost of funds. During the next five years, interest rates are expected
to remain positive in real terms and should thus enable the banking system to
sustain its satisfactory past growth rates.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       A report entitled:  "Appraisal of an Industrial Credit Project
Through Banco Nacional de Fomento" (No. 1391b-PA, dated April 8, 1977) is
being distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III. Following two project preparation missions in 1975, the Bank
mission appraised the project in March 1976. This was followed by an
appraisal completion mission in July 1976, which reviewed further information
on BNF's financial position. Negotiations were held in Asuncion, Paraguay,
from March 25 to April 1, 1977.
32.       The Bank Group has one ongoing operation with BNF, i.e., the agri-
cultural credit component of a Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development
Project (Cr. 509-PA). The execution of this component is proceeding at a
slower pace than envisaged during appraisal but with satisfactory results,
except for the institution-building objectives of the project, which have been
only partly fulfilled. Due to inadequate management follow-up, BNF was unable
to comply on a timely basis with its commitment to prepare and implement by
September 6, 1976 a plan to reduce the level of arrears to 10% of its total
portfolio. However, an adequate debt recovery plan has recently been adopted
(see para. 42).
Project Objectives
33.       The proposed project has the dual objective of setting in motion
an institutional and financial program designed to help rehabilitate BNF, and
to foster the development of industrial sector activities. Particularly,
emphasis will be given to those activities that will increase employmernt
opportunities and the value-added content of Paraguay's main agricultural
commodities.  In time, the successful implementation of the project should
enable BNF to mobilize an increasing flow of resources for development pur-
poses.



10 -
Project Description
34.       The proposed project, the first Bank operation in Paraguay's indus-
trial sector, would consist of: (a) an industrial credit component that would
help finance small and medium-sized industrial, agroindustrial and tourism
investment subprojects (costing on the average US$190,000), and projects of
small-scale productive urban enterprises, mainly operated by artisans (average
investment about US$16,000 equivalent); (b) the purchase and installation of
equipment to improve BNF communications systems; and (c) technical assistance
to help BNF design and implement a comprehensive institutional rehabilitation
program. The proposed US$10.0 million loan to the Republic of Paraguay would
help finance the foreign exchange cost of part of BNF's industrial credit
program during 1977-81 and the communications system component. A grant of
about US$0.5 million from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is
expected finance the cost of implementing the technical assistance component.
BNF Management and Staff
35.       BNF is a government-owned autonomous entity under the authority of
the Ministry of Finance. It was established in 1961, following the closure
of the former Banco del Paraguay, as a multipurpose development bank with the
mandate to promote and finance general programs and specific projects in
agriculture, livestock, forestry, industry and commerce. BNF has three
independent lending departments, each with separate financial resources
and accounts, and a supporting Department of Administration. The three
lending departments are: (a) the Development Department, which holds about
27% of BNF's portfolio, and is responsible for industrial, agroindustrial and
some livestock operations financed mainly with long-term concessionary funds
from bilateral and multilateral sources; (b) the Agricultural Department which
holds 60% of BNF's total portfolio, and performs the role of an agricultural
development bank; and (c) the Commercial Department, which holds 13% of BNF's
portfolio, and is responsible mainly for short-term commercial loans financed
with resources from sight and savings deposits.
36.       BNF is governed by an Administrative Council, chaired by BNF's
President who serves a renewable five-year term, and seven council members
appointed for a three-year renewable term. The Administrative Council is
responsible for formulating BNF's general policies and for approving its
operations, programs, budgets and accounts.
37.       As of December 31, 1976, BNF had approximately 1,000 employees, about
60% of whom worked in BNF's headquarters and the remainder in 38 branches and
agencies located throughout the country. About one half of headquarters staff
are engaged,in lending operations, the balance in accounting, administration
and support functions. This imbalance between supporting and operating staff
explains in part the relatively high operating costs which in 1976 amounted to
about 5.8% of BNF's average outstanding portfolio. To overcome this and other
problems, BNF agreed to establish, not later than December 31, 1977, a financ-
ial management, programming and budgeting unit to improve its resource alloca-
tion, cost efficiency and management capability (Section 2.10 of the Project
Agreement).

BNF Financial Structure and Results
38.       Since 1971 BNF has been beset by operating and portfolio losses
stemming mainly from its support of national agricultural development activ-
ities, including a relatively large National Grain Program, without adequate
appraisal capabilities. While these efforts may have contributed to foster
agricultural development, they have been costly to BNF and the Government.
These operations have exposed BNF to the risks inherent to agriculture, such
as sharp fluctuations in prices, yields, and export market demand. In a
country of the size of Paraguay, these risks are substantial, and negative
events can affect a large part of the country's production. To protect BNF
from these risks, Article 12 of its Organic Law stipulates that "the State
shall provide BNF with the necessary funds to cover BNF's agricultural losses,
should they exist." This Article has, however, proven to be largely ineffec-
tive and somewhat counterproductive because it has led BNF to undertake
large risky programs, while the Government has been slow in fulfilling its
commitment. Furthermore, this Article may have discouraged BNF from taking
appropriate action to cut down its high operating costs, which contributed
to a further deterioration of its financial condition.
39.       By December 31, 1975, BNF had accumulated large operating losses,
a high level of arrears, and faced serious liquidity problems. Furthermore,
the value of its principal asset accounts appeared to be substantially over-
estimated, and as a result its equity was probably depleted. This financial
crisis prompted the Government to appoint, in early 1976, a new management
team with the mandate to rehabilitate the institution. Subsequently, the
Central Eank rescheduled BNFΩs short-term debt over a longer period (12 years,
including 2 years of grace) reduced interest charges on this debt from 6% to
4% per annum, and issued instructions to carry out an independent audit of
BNF's principal asset accounts to determine their value. These measures have
helped overcome some of BNF's problems, particularly its liquidity crisis, and
has set the stage for a rehabilitation program. However as of December 31,
1976, BNF still faced serious financial difficulties: (i) only 61% of BNF's
total assets (estimated at 0 18,3 billion) generated income; (ii) its arrears
were equivalent to 22% of its loan portfolio (of about X 14.3 billion); (iii)
it had to make provisions for accumulated bad debts equivalent to about 13% of
its total portfolio; and (iv) its equity base was too small to sustain a
relatively large lending program financed mainly with borrowed funds. A
comprehensive plan of action is, therefore, needed to overcome a problem of
this magnitude and to enable the institution to perform its developmental
functions satisfactorily.
Financial and Institutional Rehabilitation Program
40.       To strengthen BNF's financial position and structure, it would be
necessary to (i) broaden its capital base; (ii) intensify its debt recovery
efforts; and (iii) adopt appropriate policy measures to increase its revenues
and reduce its operating costs. In addition, BNF would need to undertake an
institutional reform program to improve its overall resource management
capability, including the programming and budgeting of its operations.



- 12 -
4i.       To strengthen BNF's financial structure, the Government would need
to take action to increase BNF's paid-in capital by 0 2,437 million (US$19.3
million) during the 1977-80 period. This would enable BNF to cover its past
and estimated future losses, and provide an adequate base to borrow additional
resources to finance a program consistent with Paraguay's development require-
ments. The Government has already taken action to increase BNF's paid-in
capital by about 0 1,137 million (about US$9.0 million). To cover the remain-
ing portion, assurances were obtained from the Government that it would make,
prior to loan effectiveness, an additional capital contribution of 0 1,300
million (US$10.3 million) (Section 3.03 of the Loan Agreement). Also, to
improve BNF's debt service profile, liquidity position, and maintain an
adequate capital base vis-a-vis its lending operations, assurances were
obtained that the Government and BNF would take appropriate action to maintain
liquidity and total debt equity ratios of 1.1:1 and 8:1 respectively (Sections
3.05 and 3.06, Project Agreement).
42.       To prevent the continued erosion of BNF's capital, debt collection
efforts will have to be stepped up substantially. To do this, BNF would have
to improve its lending policies and procedures, implement a detailed loan
recovery plan, and improve its communications systems with its often isolated
branches. Regarding policy and procedures, BNF would need to review its
policy statement to limit the scope of its exposure under any one loan. It
would also need to define appropriate policies to ensure, among other things,
that: (a) its operations are backed by an adequate collateral or insurance
coverage; (b) the financial position of each subborrower has been adequately
determined; and (c) repayment schedules for new (or renegotiated) loans to
delinquent borrowers are fully consistent with their repayment capacity. The
Bank loan would become effective upon adoption of an adequate Policy Statement
covering these points (Section 6.01(c), Loan Agreement). Regarding the loan
recovery efforts, BNF adopted on April 5, 1977 a plan of action to reduce its
arrears to an acceptable level, and to upgrade and maintain the quality of its
portfolio. The debt recovery plan, which is satisfactory, would reduce
arrears to 15% of the portfolio by December 31, 1978, and to 10% by December
31, 1979. Finally, regarding the communications system, it would be necessary
to acquire adequate equipment to enable BNF to enhance its management control
over 38 widely dispersed rural branches. For these purposes, BNF would
undertake a study to determine its equipment needs, the results of which will
be included in the specifications for procurement. Subject to the Bank's
approval of this study, up to US$250,000 of the foreign exchange cost of this
communications system would be financed under the proposed loan.
43.       Consistent with the above-mentioned measures, BNF would need to
review its interest rate policy, and its resource allocation procedures to
gradually reduce its operating losses. In the past three years, BNF incurred
substantial losses due to its high operating costs, sharply rising financial
expenses, and inadequate financial revenues. In 1976 BNF's losses increased
sharply as a result of a necessary salary increase and the new administration's
decision to make provisions of approximately 0 1.0 billion (about US$8.0 million)



- 13 -
to cover the bad debts and other losses accumulated over the last few years.
To reverse this trend, BNF also needs to make a concerted effort to increase
the profitability of its Agriculture and Commercial Department operations.
While the Development Department has maintained an adequate annual net return of
of about 3.0% on its average portfolio during 1971-76, the Commmercial Department
has barely managed to break even, and the Agricultural Department has sustained
high operating losses, estimated at 3.2% of its average portfolio during the
same period. The institution, as a whole, nevertheless, should be able to
break even by the end of 1978, provided the interest rate structure applicable
new loans made by the Agriculture and Development Departments is set at levels
that would yield, on average, 13.0% per annum and operating costs are reduced
to about 5.4% of BNF's average outstanding portfolio. To accomplish this, BNF
would need to undertake an institutional rehabilitation program to upgrade the
quality of its operations.
44.       With the assistance of the Bank and a UNDP-financed consultant, BNF
has prepared an institutional rehabilitation program designed to: (a) create
the capability to manage the institution's financial resources and improve
its overall programming, budgeting and general resource allocation activities;
(b) improve BNF's decision-making process and efficiency of its lending
operations by providing management with the necessary operational, financial
and cost accounting information; (c) help improve the Agricultural Department's
capability to program its annual operations, to develop its long-term financial
and operational programs, and to assess the costs and benefits of alternative
program options, including sources of finance; and (d) improve BNF's man-
power and personal training capabilities. To help implement this program,
the proposed project provides for about 96 man/months of consultancy ser-
vices, which would consist of the following advisory services: 28 man/months
for financial management and planning, 23 man/months for programming and
budgeting, 12 man/months for agricultural credit and planning, 12 man/months
for manpower planning, and 21 man/months for general and cost accounting
systems. The average cost per man/month is estimated at US$5,177. The total
cost of this technical assistance program, estimated at about US$0.5 million,
is expected to be financed with a grant from the United Nations Development
Program. The program is expected to begin during the second half of 1977.
The Bank would act as executing agency on behalf of the UNDP. Assurances
were obtained that BNF would undertake the above-mentioned program (Section
2.08 of the Project Agreement).
BNF's Industrial Credit Program
45.       BNF's 1977-81 industrial credit program is estimated at US$40 million
equivalent, and would be financed as follows: (a) US$20 million already
secured from,external sources (of which Banco do Brasil, US$11 million,
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), US$4 million, Inter-American Development
Bank, US$2.0 million, various other sources, US$3.0 million); (b) US$10 million
from BNF's own resources; and (c) the proceeds of the proposed loan. BNF's
program would meet 20% of the estimated financing required by the industrial
sector during 1977-81 (see para. 25), the balance being covered by new equity
(30%), retained earnings (25%), commercial banks' lending (13%), suppliers'
credits (8%) and other development banks (4%).

Execution of the Credit Component
46.       The Development Department, BNF's most efficient operational unit,
would administer the industrial credit component of the project. Its credit
operations, oriented mainly towards small- and medium-scale enterprises, are
designed to support productive investments in manufacturing, agroindustrial
and artisan activities. At the end of 1975, about 90% of its 1,500 loans
outstanding were for less than 0 3 million (US$23,809), and averaged about
0 2.0 million (US$15,873). Its staff is competent, its project appraisal
methods adequate, and its supervision procedures acceptable although in need
of further improvement--a task already underway in connection with an opera-
tion recently financed by the Inter-American Development Bank. The financial
position of BNF could, however, be significantly affected by the outcome of a
large operation in support of a wood-processing project, jointly financed with
IFC. BNF's exposure under this project, 0 802 million in loans and 0 265
million in guarantees, represents over 81% of its equity as of December 31, 1976.
Such a large exposure could jeopardize the financial viability of the institu-
tion and reduce the chances of success of the financial and institutional
rehabilitation plan. Assurances were, therefore, obtained during negotiations
that the Government would take appropriate action to reimburse BNF for any
losses in excess of 30% of its capital sustained under this and any other
projects (Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement).
Subloan Terms and Conditions
47.       BNF would relend Bank funds at a rate of not less than 13% per annum
(including charges, fees, etc.), with the Government taking the exchange risk.
Subloan terms are expected to range between 4 and 12 years with an average of
about 9 years, including an appropriate grace period. Due to lack of suffi-
cient funds, the Development Department has had a tendency in the past to
shorten development loan maturities whenever possible, and only a third of its
outstanding portfolio has terms over four years. To reverse this trend,
subloans would carry a minimum term of four years (Section 2.03(c) of the
Project Agreement).
48.       The maximum subloan limit to a single subborrower would be US$750,000.
Also, subloans exceeding a level of US$150,000 would be subject to the Bank's
prior approval. This is consistent with both the "free limit" established in
lending to BNF by the Inter-American Development Bank and bilateral donors,
and with the Development Department's experience in evaluating projects. The
Development Department would prepare appraisals for all subloans above US$50,000
equivalent, including internal economic rate of return calculations for sub-
projects above the "free limit," and brief summaries for subloans below this
amount. During supervision missions, Bank staff would review a sample of
small-scale subloans under US$50,000.



-15 -
Procurement and Disbursement
49.       Bank disbursements on each subloan would cover:  100% of foreign
expenditures or 60% of the documented local expenditures on (i) imported
equipment and machinery, (ii) services, and (iii) initial stock of raw
materials; and 25% of expenditures on civil works--representing the estimated
foreign exchange cost. BNF would establish that the goods and services
financed are appropriate in quality and competitive in price. The communica-
tions equipment for BNF would be procured in accordance with the World Bank
Guidelines for Procurement.
Special Assurances and Undertakings
50.       To afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to assess and review
the progress made in the implementation of BNF's financial and institutional
rehabilitation plan, assurances were obtained that by December 31, 1978 BNF
would take appropriate action to meet the following targets and objectives:
(a) carry out the activities scheduled for 1977 and 1978 under the debt re-
covery plan; (b) reduce BNF's operating costs to a level not exceeding 5.4%
of its average outstanding portolio; (c) obtain a yield on interest rates and
financial charges on loans made by its Development and Agriculture Depart-
ments equivalent to a rate of at least 13% per annum and (d) BNF's office
for financial management, programming and budgeting is operating with such
staff, facilities and resources as required in the light of the proposed
technical assistance program. It was agreed that BNF would not submit to
the Bank withdrawal applications of more than US$4.0 million from the loan
account unless satisfactory evidence on progress towards fulfilling the above
conditions has been presented to the Bank (Section 2.03 of the Loan Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
51.       The project's benefits are expected to be substantial from both the
institution-building and economic point of views. The technical assistance
and financial rehabilitation programs would enable BNF to maintain its role
as the primary source of development financing in Paraguay. Its industrial
credit program for 1977-81 would be needed to meet the sector's targeted
annual growth rate of 6-7% during this period. The subprojects to be financed
are expected to generate about 2,000 jobs at an average investment cost of
about US$10,000 per job. Indirect employment benefits and the impact of
subprojects on Paraguay's balance of payments should also be substantial.
About 60% of the loan proceeds are expected to be lent to exporting (mostly
agroindustries) and tourism enterprises, and the remainder to import-
substitution industries. Total exports generated after full implementation of
subprojects would amount to some US$12 million, and net foreign exchange gains
to about US$8.5 million annually. The average economic rate of return of
sub-loans under the loan is estimated to be about 20%.
52.       There is a considerable risk that BNF's institution-building efforts
may not fully succeed as the new management faces a series of difficult
decisions and tasks that require strong Government support. To help BNF's



16 -
management   meet its objectives the Bank would allocate sufficient manpower
to monitor closely BNF's operations. Moreover, the performance review prior
to the disbursement of the final US$6.0 million of the proposed loan would
provide an opportunity to detect problems and agree on appropriate corrective
action. The risk involved in the execution of the credit component of the
proposed project, on the other hand, does not appear to be higher than usual
for a DFC-type operation, mainly because BNF's Development Department has a
proven record of ability to administer credits for productive purposes.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between Republic of Paraguay and the Bank,
the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and BNF, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Bank's Articles
of Agreement and the draft resolution approving the proposed development loan
are beinig distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Special condi-
tions of the Project are referred to in Part IV above. BNF would not submit
to the Bank withdrawal applications of more than US$4.0 million from the loan
account until it had made progress satisfactory to the Bank towards fulfilling
the special conditions referred to in paragraph 50 above (Section 2.03, Loan
Agreement). The following additional conditions of effectiveness have been
included:
(i) The Statement of Policy has been approved in form and substance
satisfactory to the Bank (Section 6.01(c), Loan Agreement);
(ii) BNF shall have adopted a manual for debt collection satisfactory
to the Bank and that the measures required to carry out the
Debt Recovery Plan are being taken (Section 6.01(d), Loan
Agreement); and
(iii) BNF has received the additional equity funds referred to in
paragraph 41 above.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECO1MENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.  Projects in Execution 1/
Credit 347-PA   First Education Project, US$5.1 million, December 22, 1972;
(Date of Effectiveness:  October 30, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979).
Project implementation is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.
Construction of the first-phase schools is completed and equipment and furni-
ture are being installed. Two project items, whose phasing will be delayed
to facilitate the provision of local funds, will be completed eight months
later than originally scheduled but the project is expected to be completed
by the original closing date of December 31, 1979. Total project cost is
estimated to exceed the appraisal evaluation by about 20% but no difficulties
are foreseen by the Government in providing the required counterpart funds.
Loan 1037-PA    Fourth Livestock Project, US$10.0 million, September 6, 1974;
(Date of Effectiveness: February 21, 1975; Closing Date:
February 28, 1979).
Progress in project implementation is satisfactory despite the
deterioration in the beef export market. The total number of subloans made to
ranchers/farmers has surpassed appraisal estimates for the first year.
Credit 509-PA   Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project, US$11.0
million, September 6, 1974; (Date of Effectiveness: April 14,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979).
Project execution, on the whole, has been satisfactory. Agri-
cultural credit, which is the main component of the project, is being success-
fully implemented except that the institutional improvements have fallen short
of the results envisaged during appraisal. The project has encountered cost
overruns in the civil works component because of rapidly increasing construc-
tion costs. The Government and IDA have reached agreement on a plan of action
to resolve the cost overrun problem.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 1059-PA    Fourth Highway Project, US$14.5 million, December 12, 1974;
(Date of Effectiveness: March 11, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979).
Construction works on the two project roads are being carried
out by two joint ventures of Japan-Paraguay and Argentina-Paraguay firms.
Works on the two contracts are behind schedule, mainly because of insufficient
equipment and poor management, but corrective measures are being taken. Pro-
gress in one of the roads is about 22%, instead of the scheduled 59%, and in
the other road it is 14%, compared to 45% originally scheduled--a combined
delay of about seven months. The roads are expected to be completed in
February and October 1978, respectively. The two consulting firms engaged
for assistance in highway maintenance and in transport planning are at work;
the draft preliminary report on maintenance needs has been completed and
reviewed by the Bank.
Credit 587-PA   Preinvestment Studies Project, US$4.0 million, October 17,
1975; (Date of Effectiveness: April 15,_1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980),
The credit is encountering initial start-up difficulties of
processing subproject and contractors' payment applications on a timely basis.
Technical assistance support is also behind schedule--the technical assistance
team envisaged during appraisal was completed in March 1977, Government has
agreed to take appropriate measures to expedite the Preinvestinent Fund opera-
tions.
Loan 1252-T-PA  Vocational Training Project, US$4.0 miion, Ma  13, 1976;
(Date of Effectiveness: August 26, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980).
The loan became effective on August 26, 1976. At this stage,
no difficulty is foreseen in completing the project by the closing date of
June 30, 1980. Total project cost is estimated to exceed the appraisal eval-
uation by about 3% and counterpart funds are available for 1977 calendar year.
Loan 1346/       Third Education Project, US$4.0 million CredIt and US$8.0
Credit 667-PA   million loan, December 22, 1976; (Date of Effectiveness:
March 4, 1977; Closing Date:  June 30, 1981).
The Loan and Credit Agreements became effective on March 4,
1977. The project is expected to proceed without major problems.

PARAGUAY - INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECt StUAARY
Borrower:      Republic of Paraguay
Amount:        US$10.0 million
Te rms:        Part of the loan (97.5%) would be used by BNF for its normal
industrial credit operation and would be repaid in accordance
with a schedule which would conform substantially with the
aggregate of the amortization schedules of subloans. The maximum
repayment period would be 15 years and would be applicable to
the remainder (2.5%), that would be used to purchase communica-
tions equipment for BNF. The interest rate on the proposed
loan would be 8.2% per annum. The Government would bear the
foreign exchange risk and make available the proceeds of the
loan to Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) at the same interest
rate plus a commission of 1/2 of 1%. BNF, in turn, would
relend the loan proceeds to subborrowers in local currency
at an interest rate of about 13% per annum, and with terms
of 4 to 12 years, including an appropriate period of grace.
Purpose:       The project is designed to help rehabilitate Banco flacional de
Fomento and to expand the availability of industrial credit
financing to increase employment and the value added content
of Paraguay's primary production. About US$9.75 million of
the proposed loan would be used by BNF to make subloans to
finance the foreign exchange component of industrial subproj-
ects during the 1977-81 period. The remaining portion, about
US$250,000, would be allocated to improve communications
between BNF and its 38 widely scattered rural branches.

Disbursements:                Calendar year              US$ million

Consultants:  As integral part of the proposed project, the UNDP would finance
the cost of implementing an institutional rehabilitation program
for BNF. The Bank would act as executing agency. This program
would provide about 96 man/months of consultancy services to:
(a) improve BNF's financial management and planning (28 man/
months); (b) establish a programming and budgeting office (23
man/months); (c) improve BNF's agricultural credit planning
capability (12 man/months); (d) improve BNF's manpower planning
(12 man/months); and (e) improve BNF's general and cost account-
ing systems. The average cost per man/month is estimated at
US$5,177.
