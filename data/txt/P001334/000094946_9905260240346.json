{"cdata!": "The implementation of the project was\n            rated as partial and the outcome unsatisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned include: 1) Government commitment is\n            important. The government needs to build confidence through\n            steady and consistent implementation of reforms. There is a\n            perception that over the past decades, Kenya undertook\n            reforms in fits and starts. This intermittent approach to\n            reform has undermined confidence among aid sources and\n            business circles about government commitment. Staff turnover\n            was cited as a factor affecting commitment to\n            implementation. 2) A coherent policy design is important.\n            Given that containing the growth of the government wage bill\n            was very critical for consolidating fiscal and financial\n            stability, as well as improving the management of public\n            resources and redirecting support to priority non-wage\n            activities the social sectors, the design of the reform\n            program could have been more effective in capturing the main\n            pressures points on the wage bill. 3) Performance on\n            economic governance measures was less than expected, and\n            this affected overall policy performance. Key economic\n            governance issues, especially combating corruption,\n            enhancing transparency in budget allocation, expenditure\n            reporting, and enforcing accountability for the use of\n            public resources are now at the center of dialogue with the authorities."}, "docdt": "1999-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
