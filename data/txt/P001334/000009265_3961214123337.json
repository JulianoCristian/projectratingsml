    is based upon the government's Policy Framework Paper\n            and related Letter of Development Policy which set out the\n            government's medium term strategy. This strategy has as\n            objective the reduction in poverty and unemployment through\n            an acceleration of economic growth. This is to achieved by:\n            1) strengthening monetary and public sector finance\n            management and consolidating fiscal discipline; 2)\n            accelerating and streamlining reform in the civil service\n            and public enterprises and improving the delivery of\n            infrastructural services; 3) liberalization of markets; 4)\n            addressing the social aspects of development; and 5)\n            eliminating corruption. The project will focus on government\n            reforms in the areas of public sector management, public\n            enterprise and civil service reform in line with the overall\n            medium term strategy. Specific reforms supported by the\n            project include: 1) improvement in the quality of public\n            expenditures through expenditure reallocation; 2)\n            enhancement of efficiency of key public enterprises through\n            restructuring and divestiture of activities; 3) reduction in\n            the size of the public sector through accelerated\n            privatization; and 4) reduction in the size of the civil\n            service and improvement in efficiency through ministerial\n            rationalization. At the macroeconomic level, the project\n            will support government efforts to consolidate the fiscal\n            position and improve Kenya's external position to\n            levels sustainable over the medium term."}, "docdt": "1996-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
