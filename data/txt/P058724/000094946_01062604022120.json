   Project is processed as a Learning and Innovation Loan to\n            support the Government of Eritrea's cultural asset\n            rehabilitation and conservation agenda with regard to\n            capacity building, increasing sources of growth, and human\n            resources development. The project aims to test out and\n            develop means for more fully integrating the conservation\n            and management of Eritrea's cultural assets into local\n            and national economic development. The project consists of\n            four components: 1) The site planning, conservation, and\n            museum development component will focus on developing pilot\n            community-based and growth oriented conservation activities\n            at historic sites around Qohaito and Asmara. This component\n            will also strengthen the National Museum of Eritrea by\n            upgrading and improving its facilities and establishing\n            linkages through specialized program with educational\n            institutions. 2) The second component will focus on\n            conserving the built environment especially the unique\n            architectural heritage of Asmara. It will support enterprise\n            development; improve the delivery of community and public\n            services; and support training and capacity building. 3) The\n            support living cultures component will provide support for\n            the development of language, literature, and history and for\n            strengthening Eritrea's rich oral traditions, in\n            particular poetry and storytelling. 4) The documentation and\n            information management component will support to establish a\n            national Archival System."}, "docdt": "2001-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
