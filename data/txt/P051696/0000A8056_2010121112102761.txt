                         commuter rail and bus networks through the construction of METRO's Line 4 . Su                                         bsidiary objectives are:i) to improve the
                         accessibility of the low-income popula                                     tion who are the main users of the METRO to employment centers and health and ed
                         ucation facilities; and ii) to seek private sector participation in the developm                                ent of Line 4.
