Paulo Metro Line 4\n            Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: clear lines of responsibility and response\n            mechanisms need to be established since the safety of civil\n            works and operations is ultimately a shared risk between\n            government (and its agencies) and the contractor regardless\n            of contract terms. As recognized by METRO (Sao Paulo Metro\n            Company - Companhia do Metropolitano de Sao Paulo),\n            International Tunneling Insurance Group's Code of\n            Practice for risk management of tunnel works should be\n            observed. This considerably reduces risks connected to the\n            design and execution of subterranean works. The Line 4\n            experience confirms that the expropriation process,\n            environmental licensing and advance procurement must be\n            carefully planned from the beginning and executed by the\n            Government to avoid costly delays in project implementation.\n            To the extent foreseeable, potential litigation and\n            potential procedural delays should be factored in\n            implementation time and the procurement process should\n            ensure that the possibility of such litigation is minimized.\n            The bid for the Public-Private Partnership (PPP)\n            concessionaire should have been completed at the time the\n            civil works were bid so that the concessionaire could have\n            actively participated in the implementation of the civil\n            works and possibly requested adaptations to accommodate the\n            equipment it intended to buy. This was the original intent\n            for Line 4 but the PPP law was only approved much later than\n            the start of the civil works and the concession law (which\n            existed at that time) did not allow risk mitigation or\n            operational subsidies. Contracts for concession should be\n            clear about mediation procedures as well as include clauses\n            to allow government to demand proactive measures from the\n            concessionaire to repair defects and indicate measures to be\n            taken in case a defect cannot be immediately repaired."}, "docdt": "2012-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
