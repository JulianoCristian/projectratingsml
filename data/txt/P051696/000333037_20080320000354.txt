                                        ADDITIONALFINANCING

I. INTRODUCTION

 1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional loan in
an amount of US$95 million to the State of SBo Paulo, Brazil for the SBo Paulo Metro Line 4 project (ID
PO51696, Ln.4646-Br). The proposed additional loan would help finance the costs associated with the
devaluation of the US$in relation to the Brazilian Real which caused a financing gap.

2.       Phase 1of the project was co-financed by the Japanese Bank for InternationalCooperation (JBIC)
in the same amount as the Bank's financing (US$209m), by the State of SBo Paulo (US$332m) and by the
private sector (US$183m) which was awarded a concession to operate the system for 30 years in
exchange for the provision of rolling stock and systems. The same co-financing ratio for the Bank and
JBIC would be maintained for this proposed additional financing.


11.      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING

3.       The Board approved the ongoing loan for the SBo Paulo Metro Line 4 project for US$209 million
on January 22,2002 andthe project becameeffective on September 05,2002.

4.       The mainobjective of the project is to improve the quality and long-term sustainability of urban
transport in the SBo Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) by interconnecting the existing subway,
commuter rail and bus networks through the construction of Metro Line 4 under a "BOT" type scheme,
partially financed by the private sector. A subsidiary objective is to improve the accessibility of the low-
income population of the areas served by Line 4 to employment centers and health and education
facilities. There have been no changes in the Project Development Objectives which will remain the
same in the proposed additional financing.

5.       The project includes two main contracts: (a) a turnkey contract for the provision of civil works
and electrification for the 12.8 km of metro line which is financed by the Bank, JBIC and State; and (b) a
concession to operate the system for 30 years, in exchange for the provision of the rolling stock and
systems, financed mainly by the private sector and the State. The turnkey contract accounts for 80% of
the total project cost and is made up of 3 lots. The contracts were signed in Reais in August 2003 when
the exchange rate was R$2.993 per US$. As of March of 2007, the exchange rate has been below R$2.00.

6.       The Project Development Objectives and Implementation Performance ratings are
satisfactory and the project has performed very well. An initial 14 month delay in start up, caused by
judicial litigation on one of the bids (Lot 3) and a prolonged process of expropriations due to a long strike
of the property valuators, was overcome. The project has since continued to perform well in all areas
including physical construction and institutional reform with about 50% of the civil works concluded and
more than 60% of the institutional development completed. The project is also fully compliant with its
legal covenants. There are no audits outstanding and the financial management of the project is
satisfactory.

7.       ProjectManagement: The SBo Paulo Metro is a very experienced organization with a dedicated
department in charge of supervising the works of Line 4, staffed with 32 engineers and technicians. Metro



                                                     1

also has a Project Management Unit (PMU) which follows the project on a full time basis from the
 institutional, financial, fiduciary and safeguards standpoint. This unit issues a project management report
to the Bank every three months. In addition, the P M U is supported by a Project Management Oversight
Consultant (PMOC). As part o f its Terms o f Reference (TOR), this consultant must report its views to the
 State Secretary o f Metropolitan Transport (STMSP) and to the Bank and issues monthly reports. Finally,
at the level o f the STMSP there is a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which reports to the Secretary and
to the Governor on strategic aspects o f the project.

8.        In November 2006, the Government successfully awarded a 30-year concession for system
operation. This was a landmark event, and the first PPP signed by any public sector agency in Brazil
since the passage o f the new PPP legislation more than 2 years ago.

9.        On January 12, 2007 a landslide occurred at the construction site o f the shaft o f the future
Pinheiros Station o f Lot 2 o f Line 4. Seven people - passengers in vehicles and pedestrians on nearby
streets - died in the accident. No tunnel workers were killed or hurt. Several homes and other structures
were also affected. Six were demolished shortly after the accident and others were evacuated by Civil
Defense authorities. The cause of the accident is currently under investigation. Because of the importance
o f this accident, this Project Paper includes annexes on the social safeguards related to the accident. A
description o f the accident and a review o f the construction safety methods with recommendations for
their enhancement and better enforcement can be found in the project file. The State i s undertaking a full
audit o f the accident which the World Bank is closely following. It is important to note that the additional
financing was already requested before the accident and will not be used to pay for any accident-related
costs as these are the responsibility of the contractor and its insurers.

Rationale and reasonsfor requestingthe additional financing

 10.      According to OP/BP 13.20, the Bank may provide additional financing through additional loans
in the context of ongoing, well-performing projects. The additional financing requested by the State is
being requested solely to cover a portion o f the financing gap due to the devaluation o f the US$ in
relation to the Brazilian currency. This devaluation and the usual effect of inflation affected the turnkey
contract costs and their annual price readjustment clause, and the impact was exacerbated since inflation
went up slowly and the exchange rate went down sharply. Annex 1 gives a detailed estimate o f the
financial gap.




111.      PROPOSED CHANGES

11.       There are no changes in the original project design since this was a turnkey project. Metro has
approved modifications in construction methods proposed by the Contractor in parts o f Lot 2 and by
Metro in selected stations but these do not affect the alignment, the number o f stations and the project
design.

12.       The additional financing will cover the devaluation o f the US$ loan o f the Bank in relation to the
original project costs that were calculated in Reais. The additional financing will also cover the cost o f
extending the supervision services and project management oversight consultant. A similar additional
financing loan is being processed between the State and JBIC to cover the additional costs associated with
the JBIC contribution to the project. Table 1 show the Bank cost-sharing of the project in US$ will
increase from 22.7% to 27%. In Reais the cost-sharing will be the same as the original one.

 13.       As shown in Table 2, 97.4% o f the US$95M in additional financing will be used to cover the
financing gap in works (turnkey contract) and 2.6% will be used to complement the financing gap in the
project management oversight consultant contract and other supervision contracts.

14.       The proposed additional financing operation can be accommodated in the context o f the ongoing
project, with the SBo Paulo Metro organization responsible for implementation as it has proven its ability
to handle such contracts with good results. The proposed additional activities are expected to be
completed within a maximum o f three years o f the current closing date o f the loan, which is consistent
with the Bank's policy on additionalfinancing.

Disbursement
15.       The additional financing is expected to be disbursed withinthree years after the signing o f the
contract, as shown in Table 3, while Table 4 indicates the amount o f additional financing allocated to
each expenditure category. The present closing date o f June 30, 2009 will be extended to June 30, 2010.
FM arrangements for the additionalloan remainthe same and continue to meet Bank requirements.

16.      Procurement:no new procurement activities will take place. The additional financing will be
used to increase the allocations in the Turnkey Contract and Consultants expenditure categories. Annex 3
describes where the additional funds will be added to the original procurement categories.




IV.      CONSISTENCY WITH CAS


17.      As indicated above, there are nochanges to the original project design which was described inthe
appraisal o f the existing loan. The additional financing is only to cover the financing gap in phase 1which
was approved by the Board in January 22, 2002. The project remains consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy Progress Report endorsed by the Bank's Board o f Directors on May 6, 2006. A new
Country partnership Strategy (CPS), under preparation will continue to support the four pillars put forth
in the original CAS: (a) equity, (b) sustainability, (c) competitiveness and (d) sound macro-economic
management. In addition, the Bank has prepared a transport strategy for Brazil, in which urban transport
figures as one o f the 4 thematic priorities. More specifically, the project supports: (a) reforms and
financial viability o f public enterprises, including the concession o f state-owned urban transport agencies
to the private sector; (b) improved efficiency o f infrastructure investments; (c) economic growth by
improving efficiency in the metropolitan area; and (d) contribution to poverty alleviation by improving
accessibility o f low-income segments o f the populationto jobs, educational and health facilities.



V.       ECONOMICANALYSIS OF FINANCING GAP

18.      The investment costs were spread over a longer period of time than originally planned due to the
initial project delays. Due to the delays in the conclusion o f the works, the first year benefits also start
later. On that basis, a revised economic evaluation produced an EIRR o f 16% compared to 17.7%
estimated at appraisal. A revised economic evaluation cash flow can be found in the project files. The
fiscal impact o f the additional financing on the State finances is very small and was examined in detail by




                                                      4

 the Brazilian Federal authorities when the State negotiated the Fiscal Adjustment Program (see Project
 Files) which took into account all the ongoing and future loans to the State.


 VI.      EXPECTEDOUTCOMES

 19.      The expected outcomes o f the project are the same as the original ones.

 VII.     BENEFITSAND RISKS

 20.    There are no changes inthe project beneficiarieswho are the residents o fthe Sgo Paulo Metropolitan
 Region, and particularly the low-income households (earning up to four minimumsalaries)         - themajor users
 o f public transport. The Government o f the State of Silo Paulo will also benefit from the turnkey with
 concession to the private sector because it will not pay any operating subsidies and yet continue to expand
 its Metro system. This expansion also serves to diversify a substantial number o f commuters from road-
 based transport modes, thereby alleviating congestion and pollution. The reduction o f bus-kilometers and
 less congestion inthe area o f influence o f the line will have positive air quality impacts which are quantified
 inthe economic evaluation.

 21.    Project Risk factors: The main foreseen risks associated with this project have to do essentially
 with construction delays and/or accidents which could happen with these types o f complex civil works.
 Inthis case, construction delays could be caused either by soil conditions which might have been missed
 in the very detailed geological studies, or slower performance of the method o f construction selected.
 These risks are related with project cost and time overruns leading to delays in completing the project.
 The investigation and judicial inquiries o f the January 2007 construction accident may also cause
 additional delays. An updated risk table i s presented below:

VIII. FINANCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONSFORTHE ADDITIONAL FINANCING

22.      The Project will be implemented as a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) to be disbursed
over 2008-2010. The Borrower chose a Fixed Spread loan in US$ with a total maturity of 25
years and 5 years grace, with Automatic Rate Fixing by period with options for currency and
interest rate conversion. The Borrower benefited from the n e w policy maturity extension
approved by the Board on February 12, 2008. The mainreasons for the selection of this type of
loan and options reflect the Borrower's intention to hedge against possible currency devaluation.



IX. CONSTRUCTION SAFETY, SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS AND THE JANUARY 12, 2007
ACCIDENT AT PINHEIROSSTATION

23.      Because o f the impact o f the January 12,2007 accident (see Project Files), the preparation o f this
additional financing included a detailed analysis o f the application o f social safeguards related to the
accident and an environmental monitoring progress report.              A summary o f the findings and
recommendations is presented in Annex 2.            A review o f the construction safety methods and
recommendations to enhance and enforce the safety measures which were put in place was prepared by
the PMOC and is available in the project files.       A review of the construction safety methods and
recommendations to enhance and enforce the safety measures which were put in place is also available in
the Project Files.

24.     Right after the accident, the State ordered a full audit o f the accident and hired the Instituto de
Pesquisas Tecnol6gicas (IPT) o f the University o f S?io Paulo to undertake the study. IPT is a very
prestigious organization and has proposed to also have the results o f their audit validated by an
international organization. The audit is not expected to be concluded until June 2008 because access to
the site was delayed to allow the investigation to proceed and thereafter because o f the stabilization
measures which were required to prevent further collapse o f the site. The Bank team visited the site on
February 13, 2007 with a JBIC delegation and although the sides o f the shaft were stabilized, the area o f
the tunnel collapse was, at that time, still not cleared nor safe for the experts to start the field based
technical audit. In the meantime, the audit was concentrating on the project design documents and
construction methods. Subsequently, the Bank project team has visited regularly the site to follow-up on
the remediation measures and the compensation process. The area i s now stabilized and the audit
continues.

25.     In order to ensure to the public that all other work fronts were safe, the Ministerio Publico, the
Metro and the Contractor (ConsQcio Via Amarela) signed on February 15, 2007, a term o f conduct by
which the work activities on all work fronts were temporarily suspended until the IPT would conclude a
safety inspection and clear the areas for continuation o f work activities. This agreement allowed a third
party, other than Metro (the Employer) and C V A (the contractor) to ensure that the structures were safe
and all preventive safety measures had been enforced to minimize the probability o f future accidents.
After a rigorous inspection, IPT authorized the continuation o f the works in early May 2007 and
recommended a number o f measures to improve construction safety. These measures have been promptly
implemented by CVA.

26. The Safeguards Advisory Team requested that the Borrower submit a monthly report on the accident
containing the following information: a) a census survey o f the displaced persons and valuation o f assets;
b) a description o f compensation and other resettlement assistance provided to date and yet to be
provided; c) a description o f initial and ongoing consultation processes with displaced people to define



                                                   7

acceptable alternatives; d) institutional responsibilities for the implementation o f the remedial
resettlement action plan , including the period after available insurance resources are exhausted; e) a
description o f existing procedures for grievance redress; f )        arrangements for ongoing monitoring
(suggested to include monthly reports to the Bank until final resolution is has been reached with all
affected individuals and households on settlement); and g) indication o f the timetable for the remaining
assistance to be provided, as well as source o f budget. The Borrower has been submittingthese monthly
reports starting June 22, 2007 with the above information and will continue to submit them periodically
until the process is closed. The Borrower has also committed to an independent ex-post-evaluation o f
livelihood restoration actions to be carried out by an entity with no affiliation with the project or the
construction consortium. Furthermore, the Consortium has indicated the source o f contingency funding
to carry out the remediation actions for those affected who elected to go to court because they did not
reach an agreement on the amount o f compensation by November 2007.

27. As o f January 31, 2008, nearly all the families affected by the accident had been attended to by the
Consorcio Via Amarela (CVA) with the financial cooperation o f the insurance company Unibanco          - AIG.
Nearly all families who owned homes and apartments that were not destroyed or damaged beyond repair
by the accident have been able to returnto their homes. Others, primarily renters, have rentedapartments
elsewhere in STio Paulo. All but 8 families (renters and owners) have reached financial settlements for
their losses with Unibanco   - AIG.  Some five families have decided to litigate their claims, a decision that
is likely to cause significant delays in settlement o f claims. Inthe immediate aftermath o f the accident, all
the evacuated families were accommodated at five-star hotels at the expense o f CVA. Gradually, as
settlements were reached and civil defense allowed families to return to their homes in the neighborhood,
the number o f families temporarily housed in hotels declined to five as o f January 31, 2008. Negotiations
for settlements included the claimants, CVA, Unibanco       - AIG, Metro, the STio Paulo Public Defender and
the State Justice Department (Secretaria de Justiqa) which ratified all decisions. Settlements included fair
market value for lost assets, new appliances to replace those damaged during the power cuts, payments
for pain and suffering (danos rnorais), lost profits for business owners as, payments for late rent payments
as well as significant levels o f support for temporary housing, food, transportation, medications, and
psychological counseling. While the monetary payments may not have fully compensated families for the
psychological trauma and inconvenience they underwent, many families emerged from the crisis with
increased assets. Several renter families were able to make down payments on new homes and some
business persons invested in new or expanded businesses.

28.      Regarding construction safety, the Project Management Oversight Consultant reviewed in detail
all the construction safety procedures in place, and the efforts being made by the State, Metro and the
Contractor to ensure the continuation o f the turnkey contract ina way that preventive safety measures will
be further enhanced to minimize the occurrence and impact o f future accidents.

1.       This annex describes the impact o f the devaluation o f the US$ in relation to the Brazilian R$
(Real) on the overall turnkey contract financing. This i s the main contract financed by the loan and
consists o f the civil works and electrification systems required to build Line 4 from the Luz station to the
Vila Sonia yard (depot), a distance o f about 12.8 kms.

2.       Phase Io f Si30 Paulo Metro Line 4 project was financed by loans from the Bank (US$209.OM),
JBIC (US$209.OM), the Government o f the State o f Sao Paulo - GESP (US$332.9M) and the private
sector (US$183 .OM).The latter would finance the rolling stock and systems under a concession contract.
The centerpiece o f this project is the turnkey contract for civil works and electrification, fully financed by
the Bank and JBIC loans and GESP.

3.       The Bank provided a no objection to the turnkey contract on August 25, 2003, at which time the
US$was worth R$2.993. The international biddingprocess was extremely competitive and the cost was
about 10% lower than estimated. Table A 1      .1provides a breakdown o f contract financing by source:

                                       TableAl.1: StructureFinancing

4.       After the effectiveness o f these contracts, two trends in the Brazilian economy occurred: the R$
started to appreciate in relation to the US$ and the inflation rate held steady with very small growth. In
other words, the two variables evolved in opposite directions: while inflation grew the exchange rate
decreased. This affected all o f the annual price readjustment formulas inthe turnkey contract and resulted
in the need for the withdrawal applications submitted to the Bank and JBIC to use a much larger amount
o f dollars to cover the costs o f the R$ than foreseen at the beginning o f the contract. This also led to the
use o f significantly higher than initially expected GESP resources.

5.       A simulation was prepared considering the 2007 GESP budget, the 2008 forecast and the actual
values up to December, 2006 as well as the projections as o f January, 2007. The following assumptions
were used:

(ii)US$exchangerateofR$2.133(January, 2007)forthesimulationperiod.

6.       The results below show that the values disbursed by the Bank and JBIC in R$ end up being
considerably lower than those originally expected.

8.      Based on a financing schedule related to the actual construction schedule, Metro applies for
monthly withdrawals from the Bank and JBIC loans. These withdrawals are converted from US$ in R$at
the exchange rate of the withdrawal day; and are subsequently used to pay the expenses incurredwith the
turnkey contract.

Inflation Impact

10.      The turnkey contracts have an annual price readjustment clause which is allowed by the
national and Bank guidelines for projects with implementationperiods over one year. Reviewing
the data for exchange rate evolution and inflation rate from December, 2001to June, 2003 shows
that they both evolved inthe same direction.

11.     When the project was appraised the share o f the Bank and JBIC in the turnkey project was
roughly two thirds o f the overall cost.
As of August, 2003 the inflation curve and the exchange rate curve evolved indifferent directions and this
led to a higher than initially expected share o f costs for the GESP. The table below shows the loss due to
the inflation impact insofar as the Bank and JBIC's participation inthe turnkey contract are concerned.

Conclusion

12.    Based on the above explanations, the total financial gap due to the exchange rate appreciation of
the R$ vs. the US$ and the impact of inflation on the price readjustment US$190.0M of which the
exchange rate portion is US$115.OM and the price readjustment portion i s US$75.OM.

                                               Social Safeguards
Background

1.        Construction o f the Line 4 project (also known as the Yellow Line) is divided into two phases, the
first o f which is a 12.8-km line from the Luz Railway Station in downtown Sgo Paulo and Vila SGnia, a
mixed residential and commercial district in the southwest quadrant o f Sgo Paulo. Phase Iis scheduled
for completion in 2009 and is the object o f World Bank financing. The Borrower is seeking additional
financing for Phase I,primarily due to unexpected exchange-rate fluctuations.

2.        The project was classified under environmental Category A and triggered OP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment) and OP4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement).                An environmental impact
assessment (EIA), Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP were
prepared for the project) and were appraised along with the project. Executive summaries o f the EM,

Resettlement Concluded

4.        Line 4 was designed and planned from the early 1990s. An official expropriation decree was
issued in 2001 by executive decree, ratified by the courts. Metro designed the project to minimize
displacement, using underground tunneling technology over most o f the length o f the line. Vacant lots,
parking lots and gasoline stations were expropriated to excavate shafts for stations and ventilation shafts
causing minimum disruption o f residents and traffic. All o f the anticipated resettlement for Phase Ihas
been completed.      See below for a summary and a discussion under the heading, "Pinheiros Station
Accident  ."

5.        Nearly all the resettlement occurred in Vila Sbnia, the western terminal o f Phase Io f Line 4
where the tracks raise the surface to accommodate a train parking area and maintenance shops.         All o f
the occupants o f expropriated properties could be described as middle-class, aware o ftheir rightsand able
to defend their interests. Nearly all held formal legal title to their homes and businesses and these titles
were duly registered. No squatments or other informal settlements were affected by the project. During
the early 1990s, social workers from Metro visited the occupants o f properties and discussed their
options. All o f the displaced occupants preferred compensation as the solution. Property values were
assessed by independent real-estate experts and compensation was set at market replacement value. In
most cases, the process o f negotiation over the value o f compensation to be paid had already begun.
Unfortunately, project financing was delayed by nearly 14 years duringwhich time many o f the occupants
lost confidence inthe process. Most were persuaded to hire lawyers who encouraged their clients to take
their compensation cases to court, in expectation o f higher settlements than had been offered.

6.        Between June and December 2005, 198 residential properties and some 67 businesses were
expropriated under the expropriation decree. The decree allows the State to take possession o f the
properties after Metro and the property owner reached a voluntary agreement o f the compensation. If
such agreement could not be reached by the parties, the courts adjudicated the value o f the compensation


                                                     18

and issued an authorization for Metro to occupy the property after Metro had deposited an amount
equivalent to the value o f the property based on a preliminary assessment. The court process caused
additional delays during which court-appointed independent professional property assessors to evaluate
the properties. According to Metro, in most cases, this process did not lead to substantially larger
settlements than had been offered previously. The process created a problem for many owners because,
in cases o f contested compensation, payment was not made in full but rather in two stages. The first
payment was set at 80% o f the preliminary value set by the assessors. The remaining 20% is payable
after a final assessment ratified by a judge.      The owners also had to pay lawyers' fees, generally a
percentage o fthe settlement.

7.       As a result, many owners entered the market for replacement business sites and housingwith less
than the full compensation amount in hand, obliging some to purchase properties o f lower value than the
ones they had previously occupied. This process, exacerbated by the long delay in beginning the project
and further delays arising out o f the judicial process, caused negative feelings among the displaced
business owners and families.     However, there is no concrete evidence that any resettled occupant
experienced a decline in standard o f living caused by the resettlement. Those who preferred to remain in
the area found replacement properties in the vicinity and business people were able to rebuild their
businesses. Occupants were offered access to a line o f credit to finance their purchase o f new properties,
but very few availed themselves of this service. Complaints centered on the size o f the compensation
received and lack o f continuous communication with Metro. Given the long delay between the first
expropriation decree and the actual removal o f families and litigation, such complaints are not surprising.

8.       N o further displacement caused by the construction design is anticipated in Phase I.In general,
the resettlement process was conducted in compliance with Bank policy but not optimally, primarily
because o f the long delays and the decision o f the property owners to seekjudicial redress.

9.       For Phase 11, Bank missions have recommended strengthening Metro's capacity to communicate
effectively and continuously with affected people, primarily by maintaining personal contact with
displaced families. Metro will also seek to avoid delays and will strive to reach voluntary agreements
regarding compensation in order to avoid the problems that plagued the Phase I,particularly the
interventiono f the courts.

Pinheiros Station Accident

10.      On January 12, 2007 a partial tunnel collapse and landslide occurred at the shaft for the future
Pinheiros Station o f Line 4. Seven people - five passengers in a van and two pedestrians on nearby
streets - died in the accident. No'underground tunnel workers were killed or hurt. Several homes and
other structures were affected. Six were demolished shortly after the accident and others were evacuated
by Civil Defense authorities. The cause o fthe accident is currently under investigation.

Response to Accident

11.      The consortium together with the Municipal Fire Brigade and the Civil Defense authorities took
immediate action to secure the site and to begin operations to locate the missingvictims and later to shore
up and secure the collapsed area and to remove debris from the tunnel. After the accident, the
Consortium reinforced the excavated structure with concrete, and installed anchors to prevent further
landslides. Drainage systems were installed to avoid further undermining o f the retaining walls. These
measures allowed rescue and clean up work to continue. Some 103 buildings in all were affected by the
accident and their residents were evacuated to hotels in the same vicinity.




                                                     19

12.      Shortly after the accident, the contractor, Cons6rcio Via Amarela (CVA), mobilized a team of
social workers and psychologists. They were given three maintasks: (a) to provide moral and logistical
support to the families of the fatal victims of the accident, (b) to provide assistance to the families who
were evacuated the vicinity of the accident, and (c) to provide psychologicalsupport and counseling to
CVA staff members. Since the initial period, their role has evolved into providing logistic and
psychologicalsupport to the families who remainintemporary housingwhile they await decisions on the
habitabilityoftheir homes or the validity oftheir claims.

13.      With regard to the families of the fatal victims, the team identified their close relatives shortly
after the accident and provided transport (including intercity transport) of relatives and friends of the
victims. The team set up a 24-hour vigil with the victims' relatives who remained at the site of the
accident until the bodies of their loved ones had been located and removed. The team provided moral
support, food, personal needs, communications, etc.          Thereafter the team assisted with funeral
arrangements, grief counseling and other support to the victims. Of the seven fatal victims' families, five
have agreed on financial compensation for their loss including payments for pain and suffering (dunos
moruis). Agreements were made with the victims' families and their legal representatives, with the
participation of Metro, CVA, the Unibanco-AIG Insurance Company, and the Sgo Paulo State Public
Defender.

Evacuationsfrom the Accident Area

14.      One hundred three housing and business units in the vicinity of the accident were evacuated by
civil defense authorities pending verification of the structural integrity of the buildings. Most of the
structures are residential(47), some mixed-use buildings (13), and six businesses. Six buildings close to
the site were demolished shortly after the accident because they were in danger of collapse and at least
twelve more are slated for demolition because they werejudged to be structurallyunsound following the
accident. Seventeenare still under analysis as of August 1, 2007. Thirty additionalstructures (including
single-family and multipledwellings) were evacuatedpendinginspections. Some 48 residentialbuildings
in the area have beendeclared safe and are reoccupiedfollowing necessary repairs.

15.     Part of the area adjacent to the site, bounded by the Rua Capri, Rua Gilbert0 Sabino and the Rua
Conselheiro Pereira Pinto, has been condemned by the Municipal Government of Sgo Paulo (PMSP) for
the constructionof an intermodaltransfer station for buses, Metro Line 4 and CPTM trains. Ideally, the
evacuated homes and businesses in this area would be expropriated prior to being reoccupied so as to
avoidhavingto removethese families twice. However, there is no firm timetablefor the expropriation of
these properties and construction of the station. The suggestion has been advanced to have the
consortium finance the resettlement of these families and be reimbursed later by the PMSP for its
expenses. However, this arrangement does not appearto be likely becauseof uncertaintyon bothsides.

16.     Inthe area surroundingthe Pinheiros Station, some 70 families (23 1 people) were evacuated and
taken to hotels in the Pinheirosarea with all expenses paid by CVA. Two families outside the accident
zone were relocated by court order, even though they do not appear to be in a danger zone. Most of the
evacuees are working people or lower-middle-class including public sector workers, housewives,
schoolchildren, and some retiredpersons, or small business persons. About half are renters, and half are
property owners; some of the latter derive part of their income from rental payments. Some operated
small businessesinthe area.




                                                   20

Assistance Provided to Evacuees

17.      C V A promptly housed the relocated families in hotels in the Pinheiros area, using six first-class
hotels. The families were provided with hospitality, meals, room service, taxi service, school bus service,
prescription medications, boarding facilities for pets and entertainment programs for children, exercise
programs for adults, and - as necessary - individual and group counseling, psychotherapy and medical
referrals. These services have now been greatly reduced because nearly all the families have been
relocated. Only five families were staying in hotels, at CVA's expense, as o f September 21, 2007. The
services provided to the families have been generous and complete. The social team recognizes the need
to set limits and to avoid creating excessive dependency, signs o f which are already appearing. The team
also recognizes the importance o f returning families to their normal lives as soon as possible. In addition
to the five families still residing in hotels as o f September 21, 2007 there were three additional families
livingwith relatives.

18.      C V A has worked to assist families to return to their homes as soon as they are cleared for
occupancy. As o f August 1, 2007, C V A has found it is easier to reach agreements with renters than with
owners because renters have the option o f not returningto their current neighborhood and therefore need
not await clearance by Civil Defense.          The negotiations included the affected family, their legal
representative, if any, Unibanco-AIG Insurance, the SBo Paulo State Public Defender's Office
(Defensoria Publica), Metro, and the State Attorney's Office (Procurador).

19.      Most o f the affected families have now returned to their neighborhood or moved elsewhere. A
supervision mission on September 21, 2007 met with several affected families (both renters and owners)
who had returned to the neighborhood. While there are still some psychological residues o f the traumatic
evacuation, the families interviewedseem to be well established. Some were able to use their insurance
settlements to establish or expand small businesses.

20.      The social teams o f CVA and Metro have set up a routine o f visiting affected families on a
fortnightly basis to evaluate their progress and provide assistance. These visits have provided needed
comfort to families who underwent a great deal o f stress following the accident. CVA has continued to
provide services such as paying for prescription drugs and for medical visits even for families who
received settlements. This level o f follow-up service is unprecedentedand will provide an excellent basis
for the ex-post evaluation. Metro has agreed to contract an independent evaluation o f the resettlement to
be carried approximately one year after the bulk o fthe settlements were reached.

21.      According to the Public Defender's office, all parties agree that negotiated settlements without
litigation is preferable because o f the likelihood o f long delays in the judicial process. Nevertheless, five
families have decided to bring civil cases to recover damages, having been convinced that they could
obtain a more favorable settlement in the courts. Unfortunately, these cases could drag on for years. In
most o f the cases that went to mediation, agreements were made for cash settlements that include
compensation for material losses, pain and suffering(dams rnorais), moving expenses, penalties for late
rent payments, and a 12-month rent supplement. Small business owners received compensation for lost
profits caused by downtime and relocation. Payments already made for hotel; room and board, taxis,
medical expenses, etc. are not deducted from compensation.              The exact amounts o f payments, by
agreement, are kept secret by mutual agreement.

22.      The insurance policy written by AIG-Unibanco has a maximum payout value which had not been
reached as of January 31, 2008. Projections based on settlements reached to date suggest that the overall
maximum will not be reached. There are only 13 settlements outstanding o f which five are in litigation.
The policy had a limit o f R$4,000,000 for pain and suffering (dams morais) which has already been
exceeded by R$800,000. C V A has assumed this cost and will pay any additional amounts for pain and


                                                     21

sufferingthat may be awardedunder this category. CVA has assured Metro and the Bank that it will be
responsiblefor any settlements exceedingthe insuredvalue.

DamageAssessment

23.      Multiple studies by independent consultants or agencies, with oversight by the Institute for
Technological Research (IPT) of the University of Sgo Paulo were commissioned. Because of the
sensitivity of the matter and the fact that the exact cause or causes of the accident are as yet unknown,
elaborate procedures have been set to assure the habitability of homes in the area. The final decision
regarding reoccupation or demolition will be taken by the Civil Defense Authorities based on these
studies.

Evaluation

24.      CVA, together with Metro, the Public Defender, and the State of Sgo Paulo have worked well
together to assist the relocated families. In general, the measures taken are compliant with the Bank's
Policy on Involuntary Resettlement; with the obvious exception that an ex ante plan and community
outreach were not done due to the unexpected nature of the accident. The extensive assistance
spbntaneously provided to the evacuees can be understand by the fact that CVA and its insurer,
Unibanco-AIG,have a vested interest in avoidingconflictwith affected people becauseof their financial
liability and also their corporate image. It is also in the Bank's interest to reduce the time people are
without access to their homes as much as possible. Fortunately,all stakeholders involved agree on this
need.


Environmental Issues

25.      On March20,2007, a Bankteam visitedthe Metroto reviewthe environmental managementplan
of Metro Line 4. the Bank team met with a number of representatives of Metro to discuss the
environmental aspects duringproject implementationand adequacyof mitigationmeasures and proposed
supervision arrangements that are currently in place. A number of documentswere also reviewed as part
of this assessmentprocess:

OverallProject Impacts

26.      This project will have a positive environmental impact since it will promote more efficient and
cleaner transport systems in Sgo Paulo and interconnect existing subway, commuter rail, and bus
networks. The Metro Line 4 is being implemented in a highly urbanized and densely populated area.


                                                  22

Environmental Impact Assessment and Preliminary Environmental Reports were prepared to receive the
environmental license for construction o f Metro Line 4. An integrated Environmental Management Plan
was prepared by the Consortium. The Environmental Assessment and Management Plan were adequate
in identifying and addressing environmental impacts.          The main challenges have been to deal with
contaminated soil at construction sites (mainly from gasoline stations whose tanks had leaked into the
ground) that were encountered along the path o f the metro, and nuisance due to construction noise. An
adequate management and supervision system is in place, but enforcement mechanisms should be
strengthened and made more transparent.

Organizational Framework

27.       To implement the environmental management system, an organizational structure was established
with clear responsibilities, procedures and required resources to monitor environmental and social
impacts o f the project and ensure that mitigation measures are adequately implemented during
construction phase. The consortium has prepared monthly progress reports on the environmental and
social aspects o f the project. These reports have been improving in quality over time and have an
adequate format, although some o f the graphs and data presentation could be improved.                    An
environmental officer within Metro reviews these reports and provides detailed comments, so there is an
extensive database o f information available. Besides this supervision by Metro, the PMOC (Project
Management Oversight Consultant) provides overall oversight on project implementation and CETESB
provides specific support to Metro and the consortium in monitoring air quality around selected sites.
The State Secretary o f Environment receives regular summary reports and is responsible for licensing
selected activities and overall project implementation.        Some activities (e.g. vegetation removal and
replacement, disposal o f spoil at sites that will have future development) require separate licenses and
different environmental agencies get involved inthe process and provide additional supervision.

Air Quality

28.       This is the first Metro project in Sgo Paulo that includes an air quality monitoring program. Since
Metro had little experience with air quality monitoring, it signed an agreement with CETESB, the State
Environmental Management Agency, to help set up and supervise the program. The monitoring program
focuses on total suspended particulate matter (TSP) as a result o f dust emissions from the construction
sites. Other pollutants are not being measured as background levels in the city are high and it would be
expensive and complex to sort out the impacts o f other pollutants emanating from the project. The
monitoring program started with a single Hi-Vol meter that was transported between two sites (Fradique
Coutinho and Vila Sonia), but currently has two fixed Hi-Vol stations at two sites with the highest
potential for dust emission (Vila Sonia and Fradique Coutinho) to enable comparisons between both sites.

29.       A dust suppression program designed to aggressively reduce dust and air pollution during
construction has been implemented, measures include the cleaning truck wheels prior to leaving the
construction site, coveringtruck loads, wetting down demolition areas and transport routes at construction
site, enclosing activities such as the opening o f cement bags and overall cleanliness o f the construction
site. Some problems have been found during inspections by Metro with damaged screens that cover truck
loads and improper cleaning of construction sites and wheels; but overall the program has been successful
and continuous supervision by Metro has ensured that specific problems are detected and non-compliance
i s detected. Only 3% of the TSP sampled in Fradique Coutinho and 9% o f the samples at Vila Sonia can
be considered as inadequate according to CETESB air quality standards (24-hour concentrations above
240pg/m3).




                                                     23

30.      Metro has also implemented a program to reduce emissions from diesel vehicles.                   The
Ringlemanntechnique has been used to identify gross-polluters and a preventive maintenance program i s
inplace to reduce emissions from trucks.

Noise and vibration

3 1.     One o f the main nuisances o f this project is the noise impacts during construction. Although
construction is taking place in highly urbanized and typically "noisy" areas, the main complaints from
surrounding population have been the noise levels from generators, pumps and other equipment and from
underground blasting.      Since construction goes on 24 hours a day, the main concerns are the noise
impacts duringnighttime

32.      Metro has a noise monitoring program but it may not be fully effective. Overall, the data show
little increase in noise levels above background levels from the construction sites.        In some cases a
reduction o f noise levels around construction sites is observed, which may be a consequence o f rerouted
traffic around the construction sites or simply due to the high background noise levels measured prior to
construction. The Smin sample provides a "snapshot" o f noise levels each month at a particular site that
can be influenced by several factors. This may or may not be representative o f actual noise levels at the
site and makes comparisons difficult or even irrelevant.

33.      The consortium has been required by local authorities to implement several measures to reduce
and alleviate noise impacts during construction.       Among others, the following measures have been
introduced to reduce noise levels around the construction site: use o f silent generators, installation o f
noise suppression equipment at ventilation outlets, truck back-up warning horns are turned off at night,
inspection o f vehicle exhaust systems, concrete mixing i s done off-site, construction o f enclosures to load
and unload trucks, training o f workers and improved planning o f activities to avoid nighttime noise
impacts.

34.      While the measures implemented seem to be adequate and effective, the actual monitoring
program o f noise levels is not effective in identifying problems or enforcing sanctions. The Bank has
made recommendations regarding sampling frequency and appropriate times for sampling background
noise levels.

35.      A project-wide vibration monitoring program has also been implemented to minimize vibration
and respond to community complaints, especially during blasting. The Metro also has an ongoing
outreach program to discuss mitigation options with the public, including sensitive uses - such as
hospitals - that could be particularly affected by various project disturbances.         The plan includes
temporary displacement o f most sensitive population.

Soil Contamination

36.      Prior to construction, an investigation is undertaken to identify locations along the alignment o f
Metro Line 4 that might have contaminated soil. Samples are taken from these sites. The most common
form o f soil contamination i s fuel and oil leakage from gas stations. Gas stations are often the preferred
locations to create access to underground stations, since complex resettlement and demolition o f buildings
are avoided. Almost always, these sites require special care and proper soil clean up to avoid future
impacts. In the case o f displacement o f gas stations, clean up is easier since the cost o f disposing o f
contaminated soil can be deducted from the compensation for the displaced station. The problem is more
complex when no displacement i s involved and legal action must be taken against owners responsible for
the soil contamination. To avoid delays, Metro often pays clean-up costs up front, but there is no
guarantee that it will recover these costs.    Soil clean up and removal is done under the supervision o f


                                                    24

CETESB.       The process has significantly slowed the construction process since it involves another
contractor, ECOTEST, that is responsible for the removal, clean up and disposal o f contaminated soil.

SolidWaste

37.      Solid waste is segregated at each construction site and collected and transported by Translix, a
private company. Hazardous materials are collected in sealed containers and stored in secure places
before being transported for final treatment and disposal. Health and safety procedures are employed to
minimize exposure to workers and the public.          Specific regulations exist for handling, stockpiling,
loading, transporting and disposing contaminated materials. The procedures taken by the consortium
seem adequate to reduce risks and inspection has not found major issues.

Liquid Effluents

38.      All effluents from the construction site are collected and treated. The consortium has installed
treatment plants at the main construction sites with high effluent volumes. Three times a day the effluents
are monitored for sediments and pH levels to ensure quality prior to discharge. The consortium prepares
reports that are submitted to the Metro. These reports are not always submitted in time, but no major
irregularities have been found.

39.      Maintenance and cleanliness o f drainage and the truck-wheel cleaning system i s problematic in
some construction sites. By comparing between the different construction sites and showing the "best
practices," Metro has been successful in addressing some specific problems.

Vegetation removal

40.      During project preparation, careful assessment and registration was done o f all trees that are
affected and should be removed along the alignment and construction sites o f the Metro Line 4. State and
municipal regulations specify procedures for compensation and maintenance of vegetation. A major
problem for Metro has been finding adequate space for tree planting and that, by law, it is requiredto care
for these trees for two years. For trees planted and maintained around Metro stations this would not be a
major issue, but maintenance o f trees off-site might be problematic.       Agreement must be reached
regarding donation of trees to public parks and spaces, while appropriate government agencies take care
o f maintenance.

Spoils Removal and Disposal

41.      The sites for the disposal o f soil were identified by the consortium and presented to the
environmental authorities for approval. Currently, seven sites are used for disposal o f excess excavation
material from Metro Line 4. Two of these sites will undergo future development and went through a
process o f environmental licensing. These sites are more carefully monitored by the State Environmental
Agencies and regular reports are submitted on spoils volume deposited by truck load and source.
However, all disposal sites have monitoring plans on disposal volumes. Contaminated soil is being
separately treated and disposed.

42.      Specific routes for the transport o f spoils from excavation to disposal sites have been planned
before-hand and compliance monitored, Each truck's load and its source is also registered and monitored.
Metro regularly follows trucks to ensure they comply with agreed routes and disposal. To date, no major
irregularities were found. As mentioned before, during inspections problems were found with damaged
screens that cover truck loads and the cleaning o fwheels.



                                                    25

CulturalProperty: Archeology Findingsand Historic Building

43.      Current legislation in Brazil is adequate in addressing potential impacts o f project on historic
buildings. Following the Brazilian norm, a database o f historic buildings, protected by either federal,
state or local laws, was prepared. Based on a 300m radius around each o f these historic buildings, the
potential impact o f above-surface structures o f the Metro Line 4 project was identified. The final design
o f these structures requires a special license from one or more government agencies to avoid or minimize
any esthetic impacts.

44.      An independent archeologist was hiredto carry out an assessment o fthe project area and identify
the potential of having a historic settlement based on available information and data. The project area
was cleared and procedures are in place for chance-finds o f artifacts or other archeologically interesting
objects. The measures taken by Metro and requiredby law are adequate to mitigate potential impacts.

EnvironmentalImpact of the Accident

45.      The environmental impacts o f the January 12, 2007 accident described above were minor. Some
minor impacts occurred due to fuel and oil losses o f the vehicles involved in the accident, but the impacts
were not quantified.      Other impacts were due to traffic detours and interruptions along Marginal
Pinheiros, a major traffic artery, redirection o f public transport away from Rua Capri, removal o f some
compromised trees and to enable proper access o f rescue squads. Some services were interrupted due to
the accident, among others: gas, electric energy, water, sanitation and drainage.

46.      The debris and spoils as a result o f the accident were transported following the usual routes to
regular disposal sites. A total volume o f 26,9 thousand m3 o f spoils were removed after the accident and
transported to the Lagoa de Carapicuiba landfills. Construction debris (772m3) were disposed o f at
different sites and reusable materials (352 m3)were brought to the central construction site o f Jaguare e
Villa Lobos Park.

Overall Recommendations

47.      The project has been successful in preventing and mitigating the direct environmental and social
impacts o f the project. The procedures and supervision given to the project are adequate, but some
aspects can be improved and are summarized below:

Recommendations

48.      The following recommendations have been accepted and are being carried out by Metro:

Social aspects:

     1   Metro will take measures to avoid, if possible, the double resettlement o f the evacuees who
         occupied areas affected by the Municipal decree. ;
     1   Keep careful records including the forwarding addresses o f people who move away from the
         neighborhood;

         as to prevent rumors and present a true picture o fthe situation.
     1  Metro should prepare a plan for providing adequate assistance to the families evacuated from the
        accident site. Such plan should be consistent with the Bank's policy on involuntary resettlement
        and should include eligibility criteria for compensation and guidelines for benefits to be provided.


                                                     26

         This plan shouldbe submittedto the Bank for reviewprior to negotiations and implementationof
        this plan in atimely fashion should be agreedto underthe amendment.
         Metro will provide monthly reports to the Bank on the status of the evacuees from the accident
         site 'until all the evacuees havebeensuccessfully resettled or returnedto their originalhomes. In
         addition, Metro will conduct an ex post evaluation of the situation of the resettled families
         approximately one year after the date ofthe accident.

EnvironmentalAspects:

49.      Regardingthe environmental aspects of the project, Metropreparedan addendum to the existing
EnvironmentalManagementPlan, which incorporates and strengthensthe followingaspects:
     .  Data quality control'for effluent monitoring: Metro is hiring an independent laboratory to
         implement quality control measures to ensure the accuracy and precision of water quality
         monitoringundertakenby the Consortium.A preliminaryplanto maintainquality inall aspectsof
         the environmental program, including:proper documentationof all procedures, data management
         and analysis, and frequent independent quality controlof collecteddata was preparedand will be
     .   refinedonce the laboratory has beenhired.

        Improved noise management plan: Metro and Consortium Via Amarela evaluated the noise
         management programand presenteda new sampling planthat will includemore sampling times,
        more sampling points and more detailed description of activities during sampling. In parallel,
        Metrowill monitordaytime and nighttimenoise levels at the work sites and comparethe readings
        with samples taken by the Consortium. The Consortium also agreed to present environmental
    .   progressreports, the VibrationReportswith allowablelevelsbasedon Seismographic Reports.

        Environmental data presentation. Starting with the EnvironmentalReport of August 2007, all
        environmental data presented in the reports will be compared to actual environmental quality
         standard and norms, or overall (realistic) benchmarks to allow for qualitative control by Metro
        and environmental agenciesandmore clearly identifynon-compliance.

        Non-compliance: Metro agreed to strengthen the enforcement systems and ensure that the
        consortium and other companies involved in project implementationare required to address
        shortcomings raised during inspection. The EnvironmentalReports will also include a special
        section summarizingnon-compliances in a visual way to increasepressure on the Consortium.

50.     As requestedby the Bank, Metro and the Consortium ViaAmarela provideddetailed information
regardingthe solidwaste generated and disposedat the Jaguare site. The quantity(tons) and composition
of the waste were reportedand all environmental licenseswere found to be incompliance.

5 1.    Finally, regarding blasting, the Consortium agreedto schedule blasts at times when they will be
less disruptive. There shouldbe a curfew on late-nightblastingunlessthere i s a demonstratedoperational
need to do blastingat that time. In any case, the consortium and Metro will continue to provide public
information, for each construction site, regarding when blasting will take place and over how long a
period. This would allowpeopleto adjust moreeasily to the inconvenience ofblasting.




I        Metro has compliedwith this agreement.
