the Sao Paulo Metro\n            Line 4 Project in Brazil are to improve the quality and\n            long-term sustainability of urban transport in the Sao Paulo\n            Metropolitan Region (SPMR) by interconnecting the existing\n            subway, commuter rail, and bus networks through the\n            construction of Metro Line 4 under a Built Operate Transfer\n            (BOT) type scheme, partially financed by the private sector.\n            The project includes two main contracts: (a) a turnkey\n            contract for the provision of civil works and\n            electrification for the 12.8 km of metro line which is\n            financed by the Bank, Japanese Bank for International\n            Cooperation (JBIC), and State; and (b) a concession to\n            operate the system for 30 years, in exchange for the\n            provision of the rolling stock and systems, financed mainly\n            by the private sector and the State. The Bank may provide\n            additional financing through additional loans in the context\n            of ongoing, well-performing projects. The additional\n            financing requested by the State is being requested solely\n            to cover a portion of the financing gap due to the\n            devaluation of the US$ in relation to the Brazilian\n            currency. The additional financing will also cover the cost\n            of extending the supervision services and project management\n            oversight consultant. The additional financing operation can\n            be accommodated in the context of the ongoing project, with\n            the Sao Paulo Metro organization responsible for\n            implementation as it has proven its ability to handle such\n            contracts with good results."}, "docdt": "2008-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
