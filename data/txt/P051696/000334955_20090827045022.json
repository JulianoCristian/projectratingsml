These\n            stations could not be included in Phase 1 of the project due\n            to the debt limits imposed on the State of Sao Paulo by the\n            Federal Ministry of Finance at the time Phase 1 was\n            launched. The stated main objectives of the Line 4 project\n            were: a) to improve the quality and long-term sustainability\n            of urban transport in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region\n            (SPMR) by interconnecting the existing subway, commuter rail\n            and bus networks through the construction of Metro Line 4;\n            b) to improve the accessibility of the low-income population\n            of the areas served by Line 4 to employment centers and\n            health and education facilities; c) to seek private sector\n            participation in the development of Line 4. The impacts\n            during the implementation of the works are concentrated\n            mainly in areas adjacent to fronts of work, caused by the\n            implementation of traffic diversions; the movement of trucks\n            to transport supplies and exhaustion of surplus material\n            from the excavation of tunnels, causing increased levels of\n            contamination of air and noise, possible temporary\n            relocation of services to the network services, among\n            others. These areas will be affected by the physical changes\n            necessary for the deployment of the work venture, including\n            the expropriation and demolition of urban buildings, the\n            relocation of networks of utilities, among others. The\n            negative impacts of greater magnitude occur during the\n            deployment phase of the works and are temporary."}, "docdt": "2009-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
