reduce vehicle operating costs between the main population\n            centers of Dacca and Chittagong through the construction of\n            bypasses around the towns of Comilla and Chandina. It will\n            provide for the procurement of construction equipment,\n            construction of civil works by contractors, and supervision\n            of construction by consultants. The project's principal\n            beneficiaries will include producers and consumers as well\n            as users of bus transport in the project area who will\n            benefit from more efficient road services resulting from\n            lower vehicle operating costs. The formulation of the\n            project reflects lessons learned from the First Highway\n            Project (Credit 408-BD) and the risks are accordingly small."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
