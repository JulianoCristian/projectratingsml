Thus\n            lessons convey the need to ensure political commitment to\n            privatization during project preparation, and, to understand\n            the precise implications of its privatization process. And,\n            particularly in light of imperfect markets, where monopolies\n            still persist, regulatory strengthening should be\n            established prior to privatization itself."}, "docdt": "2000-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
