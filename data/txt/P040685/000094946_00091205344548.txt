3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the project were to: (i) help Government choose structural options for sector
reform; (ii) develop a sound legal and regulatory framework in support of privatization; (iii)
reduce, and if possible, eliminate constraints to privatization in sectors covered by the loan; and
(iv) provide support to the privatization preparation process, through the Interministerial
Commission on Privatization (CID).
The first objective of the project was clear and realistic and important for Mexico and its
infrastructure sector and for the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The second
objective, to develop a sound regulatory framework was also clear and equally important to
achieve the objectives of the project and of the Bank's CAS. The third project objective, to
reduce and eliminate constraints to privatization in selected sectors was clear, but it did not define
some of the major constraints to privatization such as political opposition to privatization in some
sectors. It was important for the achievement of the project's overall privatization goals and for
the Bank's CAS. Finally, the fourth objective, to provide support for the privatization preparation
process, through the CID, was clear. The CID played an important role in managing and
controlling the process, meeting 220 times over the life of the project. It was important for the
Bank's CAS in that it affected the institutional and financial ways privatization was achieved.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable.
3.3 Original Components:
Project activities included: (i) hiring consultants to assist in the analysis of sector structure, the
development of strategic options, policies and regulations; (ii) hiring consultants to design and
participate in the privatization process; (iii) financing participation in training prograrns and other
human resource development activities; and (iv) procurement of necessary software, hardware
and related equipment. Several impacts were expected from the project, including: (i) design of
sound market structures and appropriate regulations in areas where firmns retain natural monopoly
characteristics; (ii) sectoral privatization strategies and decisions on specific strategic issues; (iii)
new or revised legal frameworks at both sector and cross-sectoral levels that provide an enabling
environment for private participation in infrastructure; (iv) a strengthened process for
privatization, including a robust program of information dissemnination and consensus building;
and (v) new and strengthened regulatory agencies.
The components were reasonably related to achieving project objectives. However, cross sectoral
issues were not accorded the samne high priority as sectoral issues. As a result, relatively little
cross-sectoral analysis of the privatization framework, the regulatory framework or the general
business environment for private participation in infrastructure was carried out. This remained
part of the Bank-Govermment dialogue, however, and was addressed in a subsequent PSD
Country Framework Study.
When it was concluded that Bank funds would not be used for electricity, secondary
petrochemicals and ports privatization or for cross-sectoral work, the Bank recommended that the
government request cancellation of US $18.75 million from the loan in January 1997 ($12.25
- 2 -



million for electricity, $3 million for secondary petrochemicals, $2.5 million for ports, and $1
million for cross-sectoral assistance). The government requested that the Bank review the
possibility of using loan funds for possible additional privatization and regulatory work in
electricity and water sectors. The Bank proposed closing of the loan at the end of FY97.
However, following discussions with the government the Bank decided not to close the loan and
to focus on helping to develop a more comprehensive reform package in the energy sector.
3.4 Revised Components:
Not applicable.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The quality of the project at entry was satisfactory. An agreement to focus on privatization of
infrastructure was a key reform element, especially for power generation and secondary
petrochemicals, and after the 1994 economic crisis, was incorporated into the IMF program and
also into an aide-memoire on privatization signed by the government, the Bank and the IDB in
January 1995. Accordingly, privatization was a key component of the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy in support of the government's long-term strategy of stimulating productivity and
growth in Mexico. In the face of the economic situation, and based on privatization that had
already occurred and was underway, further privatization, mainly in infrastructure, was given
high priority by the governrment.
The risk of opposition to the privatization program from state owned enterprises, the unions, the
public, and some private sector groups was recognized by the Bank which believed that the broad
composition of the CID and activities planned under the project would mitigate such risks. This
had important implications for the way the privatization process was handled and the way the
project was supervised by the Bank.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Privatization The status of the privatization that has occurred and was supported under the
project is discussed below.
Electricity In 1992 legislation was passed to permit private participation in power generation in
the form of (i) self-supply; (ii) cogeneration; (iii) independent power production; and (iv) small
production. In May 1993 regulations were issued. The Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE)
was created in 1995 with new functions after receiving technical assistance under the project. In
1995, CID reviewed a strategy paper for the electricity sector proposing: (i) no change in the
structure of the industry but providing for independent power producers to provide most new
generating capacity; and (ii) vertical and horizontal break-up of the industry, independent
transmission, privatization of existing generation and distribution and power pooling. No decision
was taken on this issue at that time. In 1999 a second attempt at reform was made. A
Constitutional amendment and new sector legislation were prepared and presented to Congress.
In the build up to the 2000 Presidential elections, however, the proposal was viewed as
controversial and has not been voted on by the Congress.
Secondary Petrochemicals. The Petrochemical Law was amended in May 1995 and PEMEX
- 3 -



started the privatization of secondary petrochemicals in October that year. Some 61 secondary
petrochemical plants were organized into 10 complexes, the first of which was to be auctioned in
June 1996. Seventy five to 80 percent of the shares of each complex were to be auctioned with
PEMEX retaining 20% of the shares. Union protests and environmental liability risks deterred
private interest, and political opposition resulted in a decision to suspend privatization. In
October 1996, the government approved the sale of 49% of the shares in the companies to the
private sector, with auctioning of the first plants scheduled for 1997. Minority ownership was not
attractive to potential investors and no privatization has occurred.
Basic Telephone Services. In 1989, Telmex, the monopoly telephone company was privatized
with six years exclusivity over long distance service and an additional year over the provision of
local services. During this exclusivity period Telmex was to rebalance rates and reduce
long-distance rates which were used to cross subsidize low local service rates. In 1995 a new
Telecommunications Law was passed permitting privatization of the entire Telecom sector and in
September, 1996 COFETEL, the regulatory agency for telecom services, was established.
Significant privatization occurred, beginning in 1996. By the end of 1999 there were 19 long
distance carriers other than Telmex accounting for 31 % of the local and international long
distance market. Since 1996, local long distance rates have fallen by about 50% and international
long distance rates by over 40%. Interconnection rates have been gradually reduced and are now
2.6 US cents per minute, close to the international average. For local service, the number of lines
per 100 population has increased from 6.4 in 1990 to 10.8 now, which continues to be very low
by international standards (although Telmex has promised to increase the rate to about 20 per 100
population in the next year particularly to meet Internet access demand). The number of cellular
phones has increased from about 64,000 in 1990 to some 7.0 million today. Forty seven permits
have been issued to establish 150,000 public telephones (other than Telmex). The benefits of
privatization are being realized but somewhat more slowly than expected.
Radio Electric Spectrum. Auctions between October 1996 and November 1998 for paging, fixed
and mobile wireless, restricted radio and television microwave, and personal narrow band
communication point-to-point connections produced some US$1.2 billion in revenues.
Satellites. Satelites Mexicanos was privatized in November 1997 when 75% of its shares were
sold to private interests for some US$923 million. The government reserved 7% of satellite
capacity for security purposes and social services.
Ports. A new ports law was passed in 1993 and government owned integrated port
administrations (APIs) were established for each port or group of small ports. Privatization of
port operations was achieved through concession contracts between APIs and private firms.
Since July 1995, some 90% of port operations have been privatized producing some US$270
million in revenues. More importantly, the efficiency and productivity of port operations has been
improved with a reduction in cargo handling charges. Private investment in infrastructure and
equipment have generated substantial additional capacity and the fiscal impact of the privatization
has been highly positive due to concession payments and taxes paid by concessionaires.
Railways. In February 1995, the Mexican Congress approved an amendment to the Constitution
- 4 -



thereby permitting private investment in railways. In May 1995, a regulatory law for railway
services was approved which defined the conditions for private participation in the provision of
railway services. In order to prepare for privatization, the assets of the Mexican National Railway
(FNM) and its operations were separated into three regional companies based on the regional
divisions and short lines of FNM. A fourth company was established to provide interconnection
switching services in the metropolitan Mexico City area to be owned in equal parts by the three
operating companies. Each company was granted a 50 year extendable concession for providing
railway services. Eighty percent of the three operating companies were to be auctioned in a first
stage and the remaining 20% of the first one within 5 years. In addition, 30 year concessions
were to be auctioned for the operation of 3 short lines. Two of the principal operating companies
were auctioned in 1997 and the third in 1998. The short lines were auctioned in 1997 and 1999.
Total proceeds from the auctions amounted to approximately US$2.3 billion but significant
amounts had to be paid out to establish a pension fund for railway employees and to compensate
redundant staff. Railway employment fell from over 50,000 prior to privatization to about 20,000
today. Since privatization, freight traffic has increased considerably, significant new investments
have been made, pilferage of merchandise has fallen 50% to 70% and train operations and
customer service has been significantly improved. The fiscal impact has been positive, especially
due to the elimination of the large losses of FNM which had been borne by the government and
the shift in railway investments to the private sector.
Airports. A new airport law was passed in December 1995 and, in February 1998 after some
study, guidelines for private investment in Mexico's airports were issued. They provided for the
establishment of an entity for each airport which would be granted a 50-year concession for the
operation of the airport. Some 35 airports, accounting for 97% of passenger movements were
divided into 4 groups (three regional groups and one for Mexico City). Each group was to be
auctioned in two stages. In stage one, auctions were restricted to strategic partners who have
airport operating experience who will hold 15% of the shares of the controlling entity
(representing the respective airport group). They will be responsible for the development of the
operating, financial, commercial and development functions of their group of airports. In the
second phase, the remaining 85% of the shares in each group will be sold on the stock market.
The first phase for two of the regional groups was completed in December 1998 and August 1999
and produced some US$382 million. The third group is to be auctioned in May 2000 and the
second phase for the first two groups is being planned with advice from investment bankers. A
master plan for a new airport in Mexico City has been prepared but the new site has not yet been
selected.
Natural Gas. In 1995 the law was changed to pernit private sector participation in the
transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas, and regulations were issued in the same
year. Permits are issued for 30 years for natural gas transportation - for a specific route- and
distribution - for a specific zone. Distribution permitees have an exclusivity period of 12 years.
Permits are based on an evaluation of a five year average revenue yield cap, that must be based in
costs (including the investment program for the period), a reasonable rate of return and sales
forecasts. There are high fines for non-compliance. Tariffs are regulated by an average revenue
yield cap that is adjusted periodically taking into account domestic and US inflation and changes
in the exchange rate and an efficiency factor. Bidding for permits covering the nineteen
- 5 -



geographic zone are now being reviewed. After this award virtually all the major population
zones in Mexico will be covered. A directive was issued recently covering policies and
procedures for sales of natural gas by PEMEX which are to be made to all clients on a
non-discriminatory basis.
In summary, the project was successful in its first objective and helped the government choose
structural options for sector reforms in all the sectors covered under the project. As discussed
below, it was less successful in developing a sound regulatory framework. The project helped
reduce constraints to privatization through the legal and regulatory reforms which did take place,
and the identification of privatization mechanisms which were well designed to attract private
interest. The project provided support to the privatization process both by Bank staff and by the
technical assistance financed under the loan. This assistance was provided to the CID and to the
sector ministries. When the project was prepared it was expected that the privatization would be
largely completed by the end of 1996 and would generate some US$6 billion in 1995 and from
US$6 billion to US$8 billion in 1996. The privatization process was only carried out in some of
the sectors covered under the loan, has taken longer than expected and has to date generated
about US$4.7 billion. However, significant amounts are still expected to be generated from the
sale of the remaining shares in the railway companies and in the privatization of the airport
companies.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Technical Assistance (see also Annex 1). Very little work was done under the cross-sectoral
component of the project, covering the privatization framework, the regulatory framework and
the general business environment for private participation in infrastructure. Consultants were
engaged to support CID in establishing and servicing working groups of CID and sector ministry
staff. External consultants were also engaged to assist in the establishment of a computerized
documentation center on privatization in CID which maintains the data base on all privatization
done in Mexico. Computer equipment and software were also financed under the loan for the
documentation center. Under the cross-sectoral category of the technical assistance component
of the loan, consultants also carried out studies on the effects of privatization on enterprise
restructuring and a strategic study of the electricity industry in Mexico. The absence of the
cross-sectoral activities of the project was due to the focus of the main privatization work in the
sectors. As mentioned above, these cross sectoral activities remain prominent in the
Bank-Government dialogue.
In addition to the strategic study of the electricity industry referred to above under the
cross-sectoral component, consultants were engaged to prepare a regulatory policy for the
provision of electricity in Mexico. Consultants were also engaged to prepare regulations for
CRE, and, after the private sector was permitted to participate in the transportation, storage and
distribution of natural gas in 1995, consultants were engaged to review tariff policy for natural gas
and to prepare regulations for issuing permits to private distributors.
For basic telephone services, consultants were engaged under the project to prepare
recommendations for sector structure, including restructuring of the telegraph and mail services,
numbering, signalling, billing, routing and synchronization, procedures and requirements for
awarding permits to operators, competition polices including cross-subsidy policy, incremental
- 6 -



cost analysis, interconnection rate regulation and dispute resolution. For satellites, national and
international financial advisers were retained under the project to find and qualify bidders for the
privatization auction. For spectrum privatization the project financed consultants who advised on
spectrum band identification, market analysis and sales promotion and prepared and tested auction
software, bidding rules and documents.
For transport, technical assistance was provided for the valuation of the assets of the FNM, and
to design the Mexico City Switching Company. National and international financial consultants
were also engaged to provide advice and assistance in the privatization of the companies into
which FNM had been divided. The project also financed a study of the regulatory system for
airports in Mexico and national and international financial experts in the privatization of airport
companies. Finally, the project financed a study to establish a regulatory agency for transport to
be in charge of regulating all transports modes, road, ports, airports and railroads. No Bank funds
were used to finance studies for the privatization of ports, as this was essentially completed
during project preparation.
No Bank funds were used for the technical assistance to be provided under the project for
secondary petrochemicals.
In summary, a significant amount of important technical assistance was financed under the project
to prepare and assist in the privatization process in railways and airports, basic telephone
services, satellites and radio spectrum and important privatization was achieved in each of these
subsectors. No studies were financed to assist privatization in ports although important
privatization was also achieved in ports. Few consultancies were undertaken to assist the
privatization process in electricity or secondary petrochemicals and no privatization has been
achieved to date in either sector. However, important technical assistance was provided for
privatization of natural gas and some important privatization was achieved in this subsector also,
although it was not originally included in the project. Little cross-sectoral analysis was carried
out and the achievements to strengthen the regulatory framework were limited. The Bank was
helpful to Mexico in finding expertise in highly specialized areas of the privatization process.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Regulatory Institutions. One of the objectives of the project was to develop a sound legal and
regulatory framework in support of privatization. While the legal basis for privatization exists in
most sectors except secondary petrochemicals where the 49% private sector limitation on private
sector ownership discouraged privatization, the regulatory framework is still relatively weak with
one regulatory agency lacking the independence it requires to function effectively to establish and
administer clear rules of the game without political interference. Only CRE appears to have a
degree of independence. It is a semi-autonomous body with its own law whose decisions cannot
- 7-



be changed by the Minister of Energy. Ports, railways and airports are regulated by Directorates
within SCT (Secretary of Communications and Transport). Accordingly, its decisions are subject
to the review and revision by the Secretary of Transport and Communications. As mentioned
above, studies were carried out under the project for a regulatory body which regulates ports,
roads, railways and airports. This may introduce a valuable cross-sectoral perspective but it
should be established outside the SCT in order to have the independence required to regulate the
sector effectively. This topic continues under discussion with the government. Finally, COFETEL
which regulates telecommunication is also within SCT and has lacked the independence required
for regulating such an important sector which involves the operations of many domestic and
international firms and international operations involving difficult sectoral issues to be resolved
with regulatory bodies from other nations. COFETEL has had difficulty resolving complicated
regulatory issues between Telmex and new operators in the long-distance market particularly. It
has not developed clear rules for setting interconnection fees and establishing pricing policies for
telecom services to prevent cross-subsidization and promote competition. Issues in this and
related areas are still causing problems in Mexico and with the regulatory bodies of other
countries. This topic continues as part of the Bank's policy dialogue with the government.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The main factors outside of government control which affected project implementation were the
reaction of the unions and of political opposition to the privatization of secondary petrochemicals.
Political sensitivity surrounding privatization of electricity also apparently convinced the
government to pull back from privatization in this important sector. Supply problems and a large
back-log of investment requirements in this sector will likely lead to privatization measures in the
near future. The Bank continues to be active in this dialogue.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The role of the CID as understood by the Bank during project preparation was to design the
privatization process and supervise its implementation through working groups related to each
sector ministry but reporting to it. In fact, the CID worked jointly with the sector ministries to
ensure that the norms for privatization were followed and that competition issues were adequately
addressed in the privatization process. Support for the CID through the cross sectoral activities
financed by the project included a focus on (i) legal and policy issues arising from the privatization
process that affect more than one sector; (ii) key regulatory issues including the rules governing
the award, amendment and revocation of concessions, broader regulatory approaches such as
application of anti-trust norms in each sector and principles governing the design and
establishment of autonomous regulatory institutions; and (iii) the overall business environment for
private participation in infrastructure and the longer term sustainability of private capital flows in
these sectors, e.g. taxation measures and granting and enforcing security interests.
Some of these issues were studied under the technical assistance provided in the
individual subsector studies but usually with a subsectoral rather than a cross sectoral focus.
A cross sectoral focus on the regulatory issues might have helped improve the design of
regulatory agencies established during project implementation and their ability to deal with
complicated regulatory issues such as tariff and competition issues.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
See 5.2 above.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Project costs and financing are shown in Annex 2. Because important parts of the technical
assistance were not carried out for electricity, secondary petrochemicals and cross-sectoral
assistance, or were financed with government resources, only $16.6 million was spent on the
project compared with $46 million as estimated at appraisal. Only $12.2 mnillion of the Bank loan
of $30 million was disbursed.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the benefits from privatization is highly likely in some of the sectors which
were privatized. In ports and railways particularly, the benefits from privatization are highly
positive both to the public and private sectors. For airports sustainability is likely. The first stage
of privatization was successful, but it remains to be seen how attractive the sale of shares in the
airport companies will be to private investors. Nevertheless, there is strong commitment on the
part of the government to complete the process. More important is the need to establish a strong
independent regulatory agency with clear and transparent rules to regulate the new airport
companies. It should be established before the sale of shares in the airport companies is made on
the stock market. One of the key matters to be addressed is the issue of cross-subsidization which
is inherent in creating airport companies which manage airports with diverse characteristics
(tourist, commercial, small, large, etc.).
The achievement and the sustainability of the privatization in telecommunications is also likely but
it depends to a large degree on the effectiveness and the independence of the regulatory agency.
To date there have been considerable difficulties between the incumbent Tehnex and new
operators related to the balancing of local and long distance rates and interconnection rates.
Clear rules for setting and negotiating these rates and for resolving conflicts have apparently not
been developed to resolve such issues. This needs to be done and the regulatory agency
strengthened and given greater autonomy.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
After the joint IDB/IFC/Bank mission in January 1995 to explore assistance options, and a
constitutional change permitting privatization of rail and satellite operations in that month, the
government requested a technical assistance loan for privatization in February. The Bank began
preparation of the project in February with a number of internal position papers including
background notes on telecommunications policy and a workshop in Washington, D.C. on power
sector reform options for CFE, Mexico's electric utility. Between February 27 and March 24,
1995, the Bank sent four missions to Mexico to discuss overall assistance with an emphasis on
telecommunications, structural options in railway privatization, a review of power tariffs and
-9-



investments, and a review of draft laws in telecom and railways. Bank work was intensive and
highly satisfactory. Staff with world-wide experience in privatization were involved as well as
staff with considerable expertise in transportation, energy and telecommunications. Economic
and sector work was of high quality and project preparation covered all important aspects such as
technical, economic, financial, procurement, institutional, environmental, and social issues.
Project appraisal took place at the end of March, 1995 and in addition to other matters involved a
broadening of power sector discussions, and secondary petrochemical and airport sector
discussions. Seven Bank staff were involved including a privatization specialist, and staff with
expertise in transport (2), telecommunications (2), petrochemicals and energy. The mission
concluded that the government was committed to the project but underestimated the potential
opposition to privatization from state enterprises, unions and some political elements. It also
overestimated the incentives for the sector ministries to establish independent regulatory bodies
for the newly privatized companies or concessionaires outside their control.
Appraisal was satisfactory. The major omission of the appraisal was to understand precisely the
collaborative roles of CID and the sector ministries. This complicated project design.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision was directed at operations of the ministries and the units within them focusing
on specific subsector privatization studies and issues. Accordingly, some 22 full or sector
specific supervision missions were carried out during 1995 and 1996 when the majority of the
studies were carried out and the privatizations begun. Beginning in 1997, supervision shifted to a
focus on energy privatization and a few full supervision missions to review overall project issues.
Supervision generally proceeded as follows: (i) meeting with line ministries to discuss strategic
considerations on the privatization process and the use of project funds; (ii) line ministries usually
published the privatization guidelines based on these discussions which the Bank accepted as
progress reports; and (iii) implementation of the actual privatizations. Line ministries usually
reported on the privatization process once it was complete. Through the project preparation and
supervision process, Bank staff provided considerable technical support to the government's
privatization program, both through advice on sectoral strategies and providing views on specific
project issues, but also in assisting in the procurement process to define appropriate terms of
reference for studies and in reviewing the selection process for such consultants. A QAG Rapid
Supervision Assessment evaluated supervision under this project as very effective.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance.-
Given the considerable sector work done during project preparation, the definition of issues to be
addressed by the project and the quality of supervision, overall Bank performance can be
considered satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The CID and the sector ministries worked closely with the Bank in preparing the project.
However, the loan was negotiated with NAFIN, the borrower and SHCP, within which the CID
was located. The CID believed that there was a strong government commitment to the
- 10-



privatization program covered by project. This commitment was further evidenced by the number
of legal changes approved during project preparation.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The government's implementation perfornance can be considered satisfactory. Although
privatization was impressive in transport, telecommunications and natural gas, the government
failed to overcome obstacles in the way of privatizing electricity and secondary petrochemicals,
two key sectors, the privatization of which is expected to yield large economic benefits. The legal
covenants in the loan documents were complied with, Bank procurement procedures were
followed and annual audit reports were submitted on a timely basis with clean audit opinions.
However, some external auditor recommendations to strengthen internal control procedures were
implemented slowly.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The CID was expected to be the implementing agency for the project. It functioned as such but
delegated day to day operations to sector ministries and all discussions were approved by the
CID. This may have led to less attention to the cross-sectoral studies. As discussed above, the
Bank continues this dialogue with the Government.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Taking into account the above factors, the overall rating for overall borrower performance can be
said to be satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Given the failure to implement some of the key parts of the privatization program, it is important
to ascertain the political commitment to the privatization program more precisely during project
preparation.
Given the collaborative relationship between the CID and the line ministries for privatization
implementation, it is important to understand this process precisely in order to design the project
taking into account the implications of this process.
Finally, because of the importance of the regulatory framework to the proper functioning of newly
privatized institutions, especially where markets are imperfect or monopoly conditions persist, it is
important to focus on regulatory strengthening, or the establishment of independent regulatory
bodies, before privatization occurs.

Representante Residente
Banco Mundial

Hago referencia el Prestamo 3937-ME contratado con el Banco Mundial en apoyo al Proyecto de
Asistencia Tecnica para la Privatizaci6n.
Sobre el particular y a petici6n de ese Organismo, por este conducto me permito realizar a usted
los siguientes comentarios generales sobre la ejecucion del prestamo, a efecto de que sean
considerados dentro del Reporte de Terminaci6n del Proyecto:
1.-   El Proyecto de Asistencia Tecnica para la Privatizaci6n se llev6 a cabo en terminos
generales conforme a lo previsto, en aquellas Areas en las cuales se ejecut6. No obstante
lo anterior, destaca el hecho de que mas del 50% del prestamo haya sido cancelado en
virtud de que no se Ilevaron acciones que nos permitieran reestructurar el mismo y poder
destinar dichos recursos hacia otros gastos que pudieran ser elegibles y que se enmarcaran
dentro de los objetivos del proyecto.
2.-   Esta falta de reestructuraci6n, las que tradicionalmente son coordinadas por el Agente
Financiero, no se dio en este proyecto, en virtud de que se mostr6 una carencia de una
efectiva coordinaci6n del mismo, ya que por sus funciones, la Comisi6n Intersecretarial
fue un 6rgano de decisi6n mas que una agencia coordinadora.
3.-   La supervisi6n del Banco se dio asimismo practicamente de manera directa con todas las
instituciones ejecutoras, aspecto que tambien orill6 a que la falta de coordinaci6n no
permitiera buscar usos adicionales a los recursos ya contratados y que no iban a poder ser
utilizados en el proyecto.
4.-   Se observ6 que la falta de techo presupuestal desfas6 en gran medida el desarrollo de la
ejecuci6n del proyecto, y por lo que respecta a actividades de puertos, las Administradoras
de Puertos Integrales (API's) no mostraron interes en el proyecto ya que el beneficiario de
los recursos del prestamo era el Gobierno Federal.

5.-    Se consider6 importante el apoyo del Banco Mundial en la sugerencia de consultores
intemacionales y en la elaboraci6n de los Terminos de Referencia, ademas, la aplicaci6n de
modelos de contratos distintos a los estandar fue calificada como innovadora ya que a las
Instituciones Financieras Nacionales e Internacionales contratadas, se les otorgaba una
comision de exito, adicionalmente a sus honorarios.
6.-    Se concluye que con objeto de haber logrado una 6ptima ejecuci6n del proyecto, debieran
definirse inicialmente las actividades y responsabilidades de las Instituciones involucradas
en la ejecucion del prestamo.  Particularmente en el caso especifico del CID, la
indefinici6n de sus responsabilidades interfiri6 en el proceso de los desembolsos del
prestamo.
Sin otro particular y en espera de su respuesta, quedo de usted.
Atentamente .
