MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
FOR A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES FOR AN
INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera, S.N. C. (NAFIN), with the guarantee of the
United Mexican States, equal to US$30 million, to help finance an infrastructure
privatization technical assistance project. The loan would be a fixed rate US dollar
single currency loan for up to 15 years.
2.    Background. Throughout the last decade privatization has been a key
component of structural reform policies in Mexico, which seek to enhance the
competitiveness of the economy. In the mid-1980s the Government complemented
macro-economic stabilization policy with structural reforms, including privatization,
to spur productivity growth. Sales of smaller state-enterprises dominated
implementation of the policy in the period 1986 to 1988, after which followed a large
scale privatization program of larger companies operating in competitive markets,
mainly manufacturing firms and banks. In 1990 the Government began selling firms
in sectors requiring economic regulation, most notably Telkfonos de Mexico S.A. de
C V. (TELMEX), the national telephony operator. Though the overall economic
outlook brightened, the difficulties of selling other infrastructure businesses without
greater attention to the legal and regulatory aspects became apparent. Consequently,
the expected program, comprising power plants, roads, airports and ports, slowed
significantly in 1993.
3.    The successful implementation of the country's structural reforms, along with
reduced interest rates paid on investment alternatives abroad, induced a surge in net
foreign capital inflows that averaged US$27 billion per year during 1991-93. Until
the end of 1994, these inflows enabled Mexico to run a large current account deficit,
which peaked at 8 percent of GDP in 1994. The capital inflows also caused the real
value of the peso to appreciate. Strong political conflicts that arose in 1994,
however, led to an abrupt slowing of these inflows, so that Mexico was forced to
finance its current account deficit through a loss of foreign reserves. When the
markets realized that the relative supply of pesos was growing too fast, panic selling
further depleted the foreign exchange reserves of Mexico in late December 1994 and
January 1995, and led to a major devaluation. Though the market appears to have
stabilized, the peso depreciated by about 77 percent, from about 3.45 per in
December 1994 to about 6.10 on July 21, 1995.



2
4.    In March 1995 the Government announced an austerity program to reestablish
trust in the economy and minimize the required macro-economic adjustment. The
main targets of the program are to: (i) achieve a primary budgetary surplus of 4.4
percent of GDP for 1995; (ii) limit net domestic credit creation to a maximum of
MexN$10 billion for 1995; (iii) achieve equilibrium in the current account; and (iv)
restructure MexN$65 billion of outstanding debt of the private sector, representing 13
percent of the total commercial bank loan portfolio. The program is backed by
unprecedented balance of payments support, announced to amount to some US$50
billion, from sources including the International Monatary Fund (IMF), US
Government, Bank for International Settlements (BIS), World Bank and Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB). As part of the program the Government has
announced its intention to accelerate the privatization of major state-owned
enterprises, mainly in infrastructure, with a view to enhance efficiency and improve
the competitiveness of the Mexican economy. The program includes a large number
of entities in telecommunications, energy and transport. Compared with other
programs in Latin America and other regions, this is one of the most extensive
privatization programs. The ambitious goal is to obtain sales revenues of US$6
billion in 1995 and US$6 to 8 billion in 1996.
5.    The Government is advancing at a very fast pace in preparing the various
sectors for privatization. The privatization of container terminals in four major ports
is the most advanced and the call for tenders was published in the Official Gazette on
February 23, 1995. Concessions for two major terminals were awarded on July 7,
1995. Deregulation of basic telephone services and rail privatization are being
pursued aggressively with basic laws already submitted to Congress in April 1995. In
a major departure from past policy, the Government also introduced a law on natural
gas deregulation in Congress in April 1995. Groundwork has started in the areas of
airports, roads, radio spectrum auctions, satellite privatization, power generation and
secondary petrochemicals. Now that the immediate efforts to put in place a macro-
economic stabilization program are no longer dominating the attention of top policy
makers, the pace of reform in infrastructure is accelerating further. In support of the
privatization process, however, a host of issues related to privatizing infrastructure
firms with natural monopoly characteristics need clarification and analysis, e.g.,
design of market structures and regulatory arrangements, concession design, public
procurement rules, contracting practices, rules for issuing government guarantees, and
the development of appropriate financial infrastructure for financing investments,
including means of securing credit, issuing insurance contracts, etc. Lack of clarity
about these matters has previously been a major obstacle for infrastructure
privatization and the conclusion of financeable deals.



3
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. This project is fully consistent with the
World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for Mexico for the period FY96-98,
which was discussed by the Board in June 1995. The Bank is supporting the
Government's program in the short term by providing assistance in three key areas:
(i) resolution of the macro-economic and financial crisis; (ii) strengthening of
programs to assist the poor and those who will be most affected by the crisis; and (iii)
acceleration of the program of infrastructure privatization. This project is the first
step in assistance for the privatization effort. In particular, the project supports the
longer-term objectives of furthering private sector development and improving
infrastructure services. Infrastructure bottlenecks and inefficient services have
contributed to the high cost of doing business and to low growth in recent years.
Privatization of key infrastructure services within an appropriate regulatory
framework will be an important step in the Bank's support for the Government's
longer term strategy of stimulating productivity and growth in Mexico.
7.    The Bank is well positioned to provide assistance to the Government in the
privatization of infrastructure. The Bank has substantial worldwide experience in
privatization, particularly in the areas of competition, industry and sector structure,
and legal and regulatory issues. In Mexico, the Bank has played an active role in
supporting the macroeconomic and sectoral reforms and has maintained an intensive
dialogue on infrastructure strategy drawing on its substantial knowledge of the major
sectoral issues and the key institutions. In power, the Bank has a longstanding
relationship with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), and supported the newly
created Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE). It also assisted the Government in
preparing the Electricity Law that was passed in 1992. In transport, the Bank recently
advised on a sector strategy and, prior to the onset of the crisis, was advising on
privatization options for railways with the Mexican National Railways (FNM) and on
ports with the Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT). In
telecommunications the Bank provided a Technical Assistance Loan to SCT in May
1990 (Ln. ME-3208) in support of the privatization of TELMEX and has maintained
an advisory relationship as part of project supervision. In addition, to support the
implementation of the Government's strategy, the project would be followed by new
Bank operations, in the form of loans or guarantees.
8.    Equally important, the Bank's participation in the program can enhance the
credibility of the Government's efforts. Investors are scrutinising closely the
Government's commitment to privatization and will assess carefully the legal and
regulatory framework, concession design, supply and offtake arrangements (e.g. in
power), and the transparency of the privatization process. Partial policy guarantees
imay be required in some cases. The Bank can be of assistance in all these areas.
Finally, the Bank has an important role to play in emphasizing the importance of
choosing sound market structures, providing for consistency among subsectoral
approaches and designing adequate regulatory systems. Experiences from other
countries suggest that, bec. e of the preoccupation with revenue generation, these



4
matters may be neglected in the early days of privatization. One of the Bank's crucial
roles, therefore, will be to work with the Government to ensure that the regulatory
framework, institutional capacities and processes that are essential to a private
infrastructure system, are dealt with now.
9.     Project Objectives. The project aims to: (i) help Government choose
structural options for sector reform; (ii) develop a sound legal and regulatory
framework in support of privatization; (iii) reduce, and if possible, eliminate
constraints to privatization in sectors covered by the loan; and (iv) provide support to
the privatization preparation process, through the Interministerial Commission on
Privatization (CID, para. 17).
10.   Project Description. Project activities would include: (i) hiring consultants
to assist in the analysis of sector structure, the development of strategic options,
policies and regulations; (ii) hiring consultants to design and participate in the
privatization process; (iii) financing participation in training programs and other
human resource development activities; and (iv) procurement of necessary software,
hardware and related equipment. The project is described fully in the Technical
Annex. The Project Implementation Plan, attached to the Technical Annex, provides
information on the expected output, forms of assistance, and timing of activities
financed by the project. Cost and disbursement estimates are provided in Schedules A
and B.
11.    Several impacts are expected from the project, depending on the requirements
in each sector: (i) design of sound market structures and appropriate regulations in
areas where firms retain natural monopoly characteristics; (ii) sectoral privatization
strategies (e.g. in power, satellites, ports, airports) and decisions on specific strategic
issues (e.g. railway concessions, radio spectrum auctions); (iii) new or revised legal
frameworks at both sector and cross-sectoral levels that provide an enabling
environment for private participation in infrastructure; (iv) a strengthened process for
privatization, including a robust program of information dissemination and consensus
building; and (v) new or strengthened regulatory agencies.
12.   Cross-sectoral assistance (13% of total project costs). Two types of assistance
would be provided. First, expert legal, financial and economic advisors would be
retained to help the CID ensure consistency among privatization approaches in the
various subsectors. Such consistency relates inter a/ia to foreign investment
regulations, rules governing concessions, application of anti-trust regulation, tax,
accounting and valuation issues, labor issues, treatment of debt restructuring and other
liabilities including pension liabilities, implications of environmental law, alternative
dispute resolution procedures, approaches to design and implementation of regulatory
institutions and financial regulations. Second, special studies and training programs
for the CID and staff of the regulatory agencies would be supported in the above
areas to develop effective and sustainable policy approaches.



5
13.   Electricity and Secondary Petrochemicals (33% of total project costs). For the
electricity sector, the loan would first support the development of restructuring and
privatization options that minimize the need for Government guarantees and maximize
the degree of effective competition in the power sector within parameters set by the
legal system. This would include design of an appropriate regulatory framework for
the power sector. Subsequently, financial, legal, engineering and management
consulting advisors would be funded to help implement the Government's chosen
strategy. Lastly, the loan would help with strengthening the regulatory institutions for
the power sector. To support secondary petrochemical privatization, the loan would
fund advisors for the development of a strategy along with required legal advisors and
technical consultants.
14.   Transport (31% of total project costs). In the ports sector, the loan would fund
implementation plans for further operating concessions, creation and implementation
of a regulatory system for terminals and port authorities, and assistance for furthering
the privatization preparation process. In the railway sector the loan would fund
preparation and implementation of a detailed restructuring plan, including an
inventory and valuation of existiig assets, environmental assessments and the
establishment of an adequate regulatory framework, followed by assistance in the
privatization preparation process including bid preparation, and the establishment of
regulatory institutions. In the airports sector, the loan would fund an inventory and
valuation of the airport authority's (ASA) assets and detailed privatization strategies
for specific airports. As in the other sectors, design and establishment of an
appropriate regulatory system would be supported.
15.   Telecommunications (17% of total project costs). Activities to be financed in
the telecommunications sector include: (i) for deregulation of basic telephone service,
expert assistance on competition policy, tariffs, and interconnection; (ii) in the area of
satellite operations, consultants to assist on strategic, policy, and regulatory matters,
and legal and financial advisers for preparing the sale; and (iii) for modernizing radio
spectrum management, consultants to help design the auction system (including
clarification of existing rights to the spectrum) and guidelines for implementation. A
second broad area of assistance would relate to improving the regulatory institutions.
16.   Project Financing. Estimated total project costs are US$46.0 million.
(Schedule A) They include: (i) cross sectoral support, US$6.0 million; (ii) power and
secondary petrochemicals sector, US$15.25 million; (iii) transport sector, US$14.35
million; (iv) telecommunications, US$7.7 million; and (v) price contingencies US$2.7
million. The Bank would provide US$30 million and the Government the remaining
US$16 million. Retroactive financing, in an amount not exceeding US$3 million,
would be available for expenditures made after April 1, 1995. A special account of
up to US$2 million would be maintained by the Borrower and the Executing Agency
at the Banco de Mexico (BANXICO) to facilitate payments under the loan.



6
17.   A fixed rate US dollars single currency loan is proposed in accordance with
the Government's request. The loan would have a repayment period of up to 15
years; and each semester's disbursements would have a maturity of 12 years from the
rate fixing date, including 3 years grace. The Government of Mexico is eligible for
single currencv loans. The proposed US$30 million loan represents 3 percent of the
FY96 lending program for Mexico (US$920 million).
18.   Project Implementation. The United Mexican States would be the Guarantor
for the loan made to NAFIN, a state-owned development bank (the Borrower).
Execution of the project would be undertaken by the newly established CID, which is
headed by the Secretary of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) and comprised of the
Secretaries of Commerce and Industrial Development (SECOFI), Control and
Administrative Development (SECODA), and Labor. The President of the Federal
Competition Commission is a permanent observer. Sector ministries and entities (e.g.
SCT) participate in the CID for matters pertaining to those sectors. The CID will
have a small secretariat and will be supported by entity-specific privatization
commissioners attached to the relevant line ministries.
19.   To support immediate needs for technical assistance, the Bank is providing
substantial direct support to help develop the overall strategy and sectoral policies,
and, in particular, assistance in the drafting of sound laws and regulations. This
assistance, which will continue throughout the project, has so far taken the form of
policy notes in response to requests by the authorities, draft terms of reference, the
organization of consultations with international experts in relevant areas, and
comments on draft documents the Government has submitted to Bank experts. Six
workshops on railways, power sector restructuring, regulatory policy, spectrum
auctions, telecommunications deregulation, satellite privatization have already been
organized.
20.   The Bank's assistance strategy is being coordinated with both IDB and the
IFC. This coordination began with an aide-memoire on privatization strategy which
was supported by all three institutions and issued on January 13, 1995 to the
Government at the end of a joint mission. The IDB is exploring ways to utilize its
Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) in support of the program. IFC is similarly
exploring ways to support the privatization process and to arrange financing and
securitization for new investment projects.
21.   Project Sustainability. By supporting both a comprehensive policy for the
privatization of major infrastructure sectors and the implementation of the
privatization process, the project will help the Government: (i) improve the
economy's competitiveness; and (ii) restructure its balance-sheet in support of macro-
economic stabilization. The project's emphasis on designing adequate regulatory
systems - a matter often neglected in the heat of privatization - is crucial for arriving
at sustainable policy solutions.



7
22.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. The design of this project draws
on the lessons learned from the experience of the Bank in the delivery of technical
assistance and in support of privatization to many countries, including Mexico. As
stated above (para. 7), technical assistance loans are currently being implemented, one
in telecommunications and the other in the financial sector. The design of the
program emphasizes support for sound early choices of market structure, adequate
cross-sectoral coordination, privatization strategy and the establishment of adequate
regulatory systems. These are all activities shown to be crucial for long-run success
and where the Bank has potentially the greatest impact. In later stages of the
privatization process assistance from investment banks and other technical advisors
will become more important. General lessons for technical assistance projects, of
course, also apply, i.e. the importance of Government commitment, a strong
implementing agency, a clearly defined program of work, and measurable project
outputs are all essential. Regular supervision, accompanied by a substantive policy
dialogue are also needed for success. The project has been designed with these lessons
clearly in mind.
23.   Environmental Aspects. The project is expected to have no adverse
environmental impact and is classified under category C. The loan will make
available financing for studies on environmental and resettlement issues to be prepared
as part of the privatization process in sectors where such plans are relevant.
24.   Program Objective Categories. The project supports private sector
development, and contributes to the institutional strengthening of regulatory
authorities in Mexico. It aims to raise efficiency and productivity of the economy,
and indirectly contribute to job creation, competitive industrial organization and
improved environmental conditions in several subsectors.
25.   Procurement. Two types of procurement would be undertaken through the
loan: (i) consultant services; and (ii) goods, primarily computer hardware and
software. As financial agent, NAFIN would act as the coordinator and adviser to the
CID, which would be responsible for all procurement activities under the loan.
Selection and appointment of consultants for studies, technical assistance and support
of project execution would be carried out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines:
Use of Consultants by the World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as
Executing Agency (August 1981). All contracts with lawyers or law firms will follow
specific Bank guidelines for their selection and appointment. Procurement of goods
would follow the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995). To the extent
feasible and practical, the procurement of goods would be done by grouping the
various items in bid packages estimated to cost US$350,000 equivalent or more.
Packages in this category would be required to follow International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be undertaken for goods estimated to cost more
than US$150,000 but less than US$350,000 using standardized bidding documents
agreed with the Bank. For quipment that cannot be grouped in packages valued at



8
US$100,000 or more, international and national slhopping procedures would be
followed by comparing price quotations received from at least three suppliers.
26.   Bank review of procurement procedures would be as follows: (i) for consulting
services, the Bank would conduct prior review for all contracts exceeding US$50,000
equivalent for individuals and US$100,000 equivalent for firms; and for procurement
of goods the Bank would review ex ante documentation pertaining to each ICB and
the first two NCBs; (iii) all other procurement documentation would be subject to ex
post review. This review process would result in a prior review of approximately 75
percent of all Bank financed contracts for goods and 90 percent of all Bank financed
contracts for consulting services, both expressed in value.
27.   Accounts and Audits. NAFIN and the executing agency would maintain
adequate records to reflect all expenditures made under the project, in accordance
with sound accounting practices. The accounts and statements of expenditures would
be audited each year by auditors satisfactory to the Bank, in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied. The audit report would be
submitted to the Bank not later than six months following the close of the fiscal year.
28.   Project Benefits. The project would enable the Government to improve
economy-wide productivity and competitiveness through more efficient delivery of key
infrastructure services. Additionally, the project will aid the privatization preparation
process, and assist the Government in making critical decisions about market
structure, consistency across sectors and the legal and regulatory framework. The
project will also raise revenues from the sale of assets, allowing the Government to
restructure its balance-sheet in support of macro-economic goals.
29.   Financial Benefits. The Government has selected a fixed rate US dollar
single currency loan to improve its overall liability management and reduce its risks.
It considers US dollars to be an appropriate currency for its debt management
strategy, and a fixed interest rate basis appropriate to diversify its interest rate risk,
given the large share of variable rate funding in its overall portfolio and its limited
access to fixed rate funding from other sources.
30.   Risks. The project faces several important risks. The first is that the
privatization program may be weakened in the face of opposition from unions, the
state owned enterprises themselves, private sector groups seeking to limit competition,
or other organized groups. The broad composition of the CID, however, and planned
activities (such as workshops, public relations campaigns, and briefings with the
domestic and international investors) will mitigate this risk. Continued macroeconomic
instability could also damage the program (e.g. by increasing country risk for
investors and by giving greater urgency to quick - though ultimately damaging -
dispositions of assets before adequate legal and regulatory structures are in place).
An unfavorable public reaction to the Government's economic program, or to the
privatization program itself, nay make it much more difficult to eventually effect the



9
sales or concessioning process. The Government's economic plan, which was
announced in March 1995, is currently succeeding in stabilizing the exchange rate.
The Government is also taking steps to improve its relations with international
investors by providing better access to central bank information and by undertaking
more frequent consultations, and is pursuing an active public information campaign.
31.   Agreements Reached: During negotiations the Bank and the Government
agreed to the following: (i) an initial workprogram for the CID, as contained in the
Technical Annex; (ii) arrangements for a project launch seminar, (iii) the content of
project's semi-annual review, including the impact indicators to be utilized in the
assessment of the project during the midterm and final reviews.
32.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
