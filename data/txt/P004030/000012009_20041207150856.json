This Initial Environmental Assessment aims to\n            identify the impacts of the project activities.\n            Environmental impacts in Phnom Penh Municipality are\n            negligible. In Sihanoukville Town and Siem Reap Province,\n            replanting program will take place during construction to\n            avoid erosion of the new fill slopes and increased siltation\n            of local waterways. All culverts will have sufficient\n            capacity to carry the runoff flows without constricting\n            channels and increasing flow speeds so that new erosion or\n            fish migration problems will not arise. During construction,\n            the impact of dust will be mitigated by spraying water onto\n            dry materials. Vehicles delivering materials to and from the\n            construction sites should be covered. To reduce air and\n            noise pollution, vehicles and machinery will be regularly\n            maintained. Trees planted along the roadsides and in\n            villages to replace the ones lost during construction will\n            have a tending and maintenance schedule prepard and\n            live-tree counts provided to the authorities concerned every\n            six months."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
