The Borrower further undertakes and warrants to the Association that, in the

measures, which are attributable to the discovery of artifacts or ordered as a result 
thereof, it shall be the responsibility of the Borrower, pursuant to paragraph 13 (a) 
of Schedule 4 to the Development Credit Agreement, to make adequate provision to cover 
the cost of such delays or disruptions, or penalties imposed on account thereof, other
