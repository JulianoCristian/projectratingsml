A Cambodian\n            nongovernmental organization (NGO) undertook a survey and\n            found out that about 1818 households would be affected by\n            the project and eligible for compensation, and that almost\n            700 structures would have to be removed during the project.\n            Compensation available are: compensation for loss of land\n            and assets; compensation for temporary loss of livelihood;\n            compensation for loss of community structures/facilities;\n            and a flat shifting allowance.
