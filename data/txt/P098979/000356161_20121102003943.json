This is a\n            level two restructuring to extend the closing date. The\n            extension of the closing dates is necessary to ensure that\n            the project continues to provide logistical support to the\n            continued implementation and completion of the second Iraq\n            Household and Socio-economic Survey (IHSES-2).

The\n            need for extension arises from the delays in forming a\n            government after the 2010 election, which slowed down the\n            functioning of the government, as well as security concerns\n            impacting on the ability to conduct field activities. This\n            will be the fourth and final extension of the closing date."}, "docdt": "2012-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
