Of\n            the five project development objectives indicators, three\n            were achieved, one was partially achieved, and one was not\n            achieved.

Significant lessons learned during the course of\n            project implementation were: 1) a fragile government working\n            in an unstable environment cannot be expected to produce\n            results quickly, particularly when public institutions are\n            weak; 2) having a Bank executed trust fund paired with a\n            recipient executed trust fund proved to be an extremely\n            constructive approach which might be replicated elsewhere;\n            3) building government capacity to collect data and do\n            policy analysis does not necessarily mean there are\n            meaningful results in terms of policy reform and poverty\n            reduction; and 4) if risks to development outcomes are very\n            high, having a long list of mitigation measures should not\n            be used to create an illusion that risks no longer exist."}, "docdt": "2014-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
