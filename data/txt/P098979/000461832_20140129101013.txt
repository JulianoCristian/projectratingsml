        improve the functioning of social safety nets; and
       assess the effect of economic policy options on both poverty and employment, including
        the impact of sequencing reforms and policies.

    I.      PROJECT	CONTEXT,	DEVELOPMENT	OBJECTIVES	AND	DESIGN	

1.1 	Context	at	Appraisal	

         Despite Iraq's rich resource endowment, poverty is widespread, and Iraq's human
development indicators have become among the lowest in the region. The recent history of
international sanctions, military invasion, and a factional civil war have further compounded the
problems of government administration in all areas. Iraq's living standards have declined.
Income per capita, which was around US$3,600 in the early 1980s, had fallen to about US$770
by 2001 with a slight increase to US$940 in 2005. At the time of preparing this project,
unemployment was at least 30 percent of the working age population and underemployment was
widespread. The Government estimated a national poverty rate of 23%, with poverty in rural
areas of 39% (2007).
       The National Development Strategy (NDS) was presented by the Transitional Iraqi
Government in July 2006 as the basis for social and economic reforms for the reconstruction of
Iraq and development of its economy. The NDS was organized around four pillars: (i)
strengthening the foundations of economic growth, (ii) revitalizing the private sector as the
engine of growth and job creation; (iii) improving the quality of life (access to clean water and
sanitation, high-quality medical care, affordable housing; investing in education; providing a
targeted safety net for the needy); and (iv) strengthening good governance and security. The
Government’s reform agenda includes the elimination of subsidies, employment generation and
the development of a targeted safety net.
       Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the donor community had provided assistance to the
Government of Iraq (GOI) on a range of data collection, data analysis and policy issues related to
poverty reduction, employment generation and safety net development. In many cases, however,
donors had contracted with the Iraqi statistical agencies to conduct surveys that the donors
designed and analyzed. This approach did not build capacity within official agencies, and
resulted in findings that were not well understood or trusted by the Iraqi government. In addition,
the period of sanctions meant that Iraqi authorities were cut off from the latest advances in the
conceptual understanding of poverty, and the technical methodologies related to poverty analysis
and poverty reduction.
       The Emergency Household Survey and Poverty Reduction Policies Project was intended
to help the GOI build capacity to do data gathering and poverty analysis, in order to provide a
firm foundation for reforms that would benefit the poor. The project helped the government
undertake the first ever comprehensive living standards survey, by collecting data on
expenditures, employment, and social conditions, as well as other non-monetary aspects of
poverty. This data would permit the updating of the consumer price index, the establishment of a
poverty line, and the development a targeting mechanism for an efficient safety net program. The
household survey would provide needed updates of previous surveys made by donor community.
More importantly, the project strengthened the ability of Iraqi Government agencies to design
and implement a regularly scheduled series of expenditure and living standard surveys in the
future.

       This project was funded under the multi-donor World Bank Multi-Donor Iraq Trust Fund
established in 2006, and consists of two complementary grants. The first is a recipient executed
grant for carrying out the objectives of the project by the Government, including implementation
of the expenditure survey, workshops, data analysis and dissemination. The second and smaller
grant, executed by the Bank on behalf of the recipient, provides technical assistance, advisory
services and training for the same objectives.
       The project is consistent with Iraq’s National Development Strategy and the World Bank's
country strategy as articulated in the Second Interim Strategy Note for Iraq (August 2005) to
help Iraq build efficient, inclusive, transparent, and accountable institutions. The Strategy argues
that building modern systems for data collection and dissemination is essential for providing
policymakers with reliable information on which to base their decisions. It endorses efforts of the
project to support a comprehensive household survey and related capacity building to help the
government collect data on poverty, understand the characteristics and causes of poverty, predict
the impact of economic policies on poverty and design a poverty-reduction strategy.
        The project led to more than six years of frequent and in depth interactions with the Iraqi
statistical organizations which includes CSO (Baghdad), KRSO (Erbil), and the governorate-
level statistical offices. The main focus of this series of activities had been technical assistance
and training designed to assist the Iraqi statistical institutions in design and implementation of
statistical surveys.


1.2 	Original	Project	Development	Objectives	and	Key	Indicators.	

 This project has been prepared in accordance with Emergency Recovery Assistance procedures
(Operational Policy 8.50). There is no Project Appraisal Document. The project is described in
the Technical Annex to Proposed Trust Fund Agreement (Report No. 35317, June 15 2006).


        Main PDO: The objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the ability of the GOI
        to make informed decisions towards reducing poverty, creating jobs and protecting the
        vulnerable.

        Specifically, the project would focus on three components:

        Component 1:
        1a. IHSES Subcomponent:
            a) Collect high quality data on household income, expenditure and living standards
               for all governorates.
            b) Strengthen capacity of Iraqi statistical bodies to conduct quality household
               surveys

        1b. Poverty Assessment Component:
            a) Increase knowledge of living standards and income and expenditure patterns of
               Iraqi households
            b) Strengthen capacity of MOPDC, MOF, MOLSA and other government entities to
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction                            p. 12


                    analyze household survey data.

           Component 2:
                  Poverty and Social Impact Analysis:
           a) Increase knowledge of the poverty and social impact of existing and proposed
              economic policies
           b) Strengthen capacity of MOPDC, MOF, MOLSA and other government entities to
              analyze the impact of economic policies on poverty and social welfare

           Component 3:
           GOI Strategy for Poverty Reduction, Employment Generation and Safety Net
           Development:
           a) Development of a poverty reduction, employment generation and safety net strategy
           b) Strengthen the capacity of policy makers to develop a comprehensive, information-
              based strategy

           Original Key Performance Indicators:1
           Component 1.
             a) Data sets and tabulation reports
             b) Statistical staff trained (including on the job training)
             c) Poverty assessment report and dissemination report (to policy makers and
                 researchers)
             d) Technical staff of various government entities trained (including on-the-job
                 training)
           Component 2
             a) Series of analytical studies (specific topics to be determined by the Project
                 Committee) and dissemination of analytical studies (to policy makers and
                 researchers).
             b) Technical and policy staff of various government entities trained (including on-the
                 job training).
           Component 3
             a) Strategy document , written by the Project Committee and dissemination of
                 strategy (including to the general public)
             b) Workshops and/or study tours on international experience.



1.3 	Revised	PDOs	and	Key	Indicators	

The project went through three restructurings. In 2008, additional trust funds in the amount of
$2.5 million were added to the project mostly to cover cost overruns due to inflation and
exchange rate changes, as well as the need to travel outside of the country to hold workshops due
to security concerns.2 In addition, the list of activities was expanded to include:
    a) Pro-poor budgetary planning;
1
    Trust Fund Agreement, June 2005, Annex 1 “Logical Framework and Key Performance Indicators”, p.21.
2
    This divided $0.4 million to the recipient (GOI) executed fund, and $2.1 million for the Bank executed fund.
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction            p. 13


    b) Capacity building on focus groups and qualitative methodologies;
    c) Communication; and
    d) Training on “smart data management.”

The project paper for the restructuring notes that the outcome indicators will be revised to
include:
     Analysis of IHSES appears in Government reports and impacts budget decisions;
     Qualitative research methods are implemented;
     A communications strategy is implemented;
     Lessons learned from the IHSES are applied to other surveys; and
     IHSES data and analysis is made publically available.

In 2010, additional grants of $1.5 million were added to each trust fund, bringing the total project
size to $12.1 million (at that time). These additional funds were allocated toward:

       Support for implementation of the PRS, including integration of the PRS into the budget
        process, coordination between the PRS and other national and sectoral strategies, and
        capacity building for implementing agencies to plan PRS-related activities using the
        results based methods.

       Support for monitoring the PRS, including developing a set of appropriate monitoring
        indicators, analysis, communication of analysis, and strategy modifications as needed.

       Support for poverty measurement, including financial and technical assistance for a
        second round of the Iraq Household Socio-Economic Survey, updating the poverty line,
        and analyzing poverty trends.

The second restructuring paper did not detail any changes in PDO indicators. However, the key
indicators have been subsequently revised to make them more in line with the first two
restructurings, and to reorder their importance. The current list of PDO indicators is not related
to the original components. The revised PDO indicators, and intermediate indicators, as per the
ISR of December 2012, are as follows:

            PDO Indicators:
        1. Governorates with high quality data on household income, expenditure and living
           standards
        2. IHSES Data used for Poverty Assessments and Social Impact Assessments
        3. Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) developed based on analysis of IHSES-1
        4. PRS priorities are integrated into the budget and PRS activities are implemented

It should be noted that the indicators on qualitative methods and communication strategy has
been deleted from the list. In addition, more emphasis is placed on integrating the PRS into the
budget process. ISRs from 2010 indicate, however, that a communication strategy had been
developed with technical assistance from the Bank’s Development Communication unit,
although it is not clear how much of it was being implemented.

A third restructuring in September 2012 further extended the closing date to June 30, 2013 and
added $1.0 million to the Bank executed trust fund, bringing the total project to $13.1 of trust
funds and $0.7 Government counterpart contribution.


1.4 Main	Beneficiaries	

The ultimate beneficiary of this project are the poor people of Iraq, who should experience
improved welfare from better focused government programs and more attention by the
Government to poverty issues. Secondary beneficiaries are staffs of the Ministry of Planning
(MOPDC), Central Statistics Office (CSO, formerly COSIT), and Kurdistan Regional Statistical
Office (KRSO) who will have enhanced capacity in household surveys, consumer price index
rebasing, poverty and social impact analysis, and poverty line construction, both from formal
training sessions and hands on experience. A significant number of workshops and conferences
have brought Iraqi officials in contact with World Bank staff and other experts in poverty
analysis from around the world (see Annex 6 for a description of some of the workshops). In
addition, with household surveys in place, government officials, academics and private sector
analysts will have greater capacity to do analysis of economic and social issues in Iraq.


1.5 Revised	Components	

Formally, there were no revisions to the components as originally expressed in the Trust Fund
Agreement. However, it is clear from the DO indicators, that the content and thrust of each
component was considerably adjusted. Component 2, Poverty and Social Impact Analysis, has
been downgraded and appears only as part of the work on the poverty assessment, and its output
has been downgraded from a series of studies, to just one study. Emphasis has shifted from
having the PRS and government agencies use the data of the household survey, to integrating the
poverty strategy into the budget.

II.     KEY	FACTORS	AFFECTING	IMPLEMENTATION	AND	OUTCOME	
        2.1		   Project	Preparation,	Design	and	Quality	at	Entry	

         The project built upon several training activities undertaken through the prior Second
         Capacity Building Project of the Iraq Trust Fund. Another prior TA project (P099084)
         included technical assistance and training during 2005-2007 to assist the Iraqi statistical
         organizations in the design and implementation of the proposed Iraq Household Socio-
         Economic Survey (IHSES), including the financing of the actual survey, additional
         training, and support for analytic work and dissemination, and was based on more than a
         year of in-depth and frequent interactions with the Iraqi statistical organizations. In
         addition, the prior TA project provided training and support to the inter-ministerial High
         Committee for Poverty Reduction for the development of a Poverty Reduction Strategy
         (PRS).

         Soundness of the background analysis. The extensive involvement of Bank staff in
         assisting the household survey work meant that the background to the project was well
         known. The project was designed to encourage the GOI team to do as much of the data
         collection, analysis and strategy development as possible in order to ensure
         maximum capacity development. The project recognized that after so many years of
         having been largely cut off from the international community, the GOI team could
         benefit from exposure to recently developed analytical techniques and from the
         experiences of other countries in solving problems of poverty, employment generation
         and safety nets. In the context of the proposed project, technical assistance from the
         Bank took a variety of forms including formal training (both inside and outside
         Iraq), on-the-job-training, and just-in-time advisory services.

         Assessment of the Project Design. The project design was somewhat complex, involving
         multiple ministries in Baghdad, as well in the Kurdistan region. The project involved
         inter-sectoral teams from both the GOI and the World Bank. Responsibility for poverty,
         employment and safety net falls under various government entities. Accordingly the
         project involved the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and
         Social Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and the Kurdish Regional
         Government. The project was managed by the Ministry of Planning in order to simplify
         implementation. The Iraq Central Statistical Organization (CSO), which comes under the
         Ministry of Planning, had primary responsibility for the implementation of the
         household survey. A Project Committee of staff from these and other entities was
         formed to ensure the analytical and strategic activities of the project were relevant to the
         various government entities.

         A Project Management Team (PMT) was formed to be responsible for the overall
         management, coordination and monitoring activities, as well as procurement,
         disbursement and financial management aspects. Throughout the project
         implementation, despite many institutional obstacles, the PMT staff directly involved in
         the project implementation and has demonstrated strong and constant commitment. PMT
         staff has regularly attended fiduciary, procurement, project management and other
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction                     p. 16


         relevant technical training. Coordination by the Ministry of Planning and CSO was more
         than adequate and proved not to be a problem. However, the project design assumed a
         level of institutional development in the public and financial sectors that fell short,
         leading to multiple problems in handling financial management, procurement and
         disbursement.

         In order to simplify administration and expedite progress on the products, the
         project had two sub-projects: (i) the development of the products was implemented by
         the GOI team through a GOI-Executed sub-project (TF 056441, $7.0 million); and (ii)
         the Bank support to the GOI team through technical assistance and training,
         implemented through a Bank-Executed sub-project (TF056442), $6.1 million.

         While prepared under the guidelines on emergency projects (O.P. 8.5) in accordance
         with the way Iraq projects were being prepared at that time, it is not clear that this
         project was an emergency operation. It took one year to prepare, and seven years to
         execute. It did not meet any critical short term need and did provide a rapid response.3 In
         fact, the word “emergency” seems to have been dropped from the title of the project
         after 2008.

         Adequacy of Government Commitment. The Government was, and remains, fully
         committed to the project and its objectives. The GOI staff were responsive to Bank
         requests, were active participants in training sessions, and helped to identify new
         training needs. The CSO is already planning additional surveys to provide up to date
         information on poverty and social conditions, and a revised Poverty Reduction Strategy
         (PRS) will be started in 2014.

         Assessment of Risks. The risks to the project were well known at the time of appraisal,
         and well described in the project document. Nevertheless, the assessment of risks at the
         time of appraisal was, in hindsight, unrealistic. Renewed violence broke out in 2006-
         2007 just as the survey work on the IHSES-1 began, delaying the implementation of the
         survey and reducing its quality (see Annex 7 for details). The security situation made
         financial management difficult. The completion of the second household survey (IHSES-
         2) was delayed for a year because of the delay in formation of the new government after
         the elections in 2011.

         The project was consistent with the goals of the 2005 Interim Strategy Note for Iraq,
         which states that the overall objective of the Bank is “…build efficient, transparent, and
         accountable institutions…”, including an improved social safety net.

         Quality at entry was not assessed by QAG.

	       2.2		    Implementation	

         The project was started in 2006, just as renewed violence engulfed the country. The

             3
              O.P. 8.5 has since been reissued as O.P. 8.0 “Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies” (March
             2007, Revised April 2013).
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction            p. 17


         initial expected completion date of June 2008 had to be eventually extended to June
         2013, including the restructuring to encompass a second survey. However, despite these
         problems, most project objectives were achieved. The first country-wide household
         survey since 1988 was started covering 18,000 households. The survey work took place
         over one year, with multiple interviews on consumption on a monthly, quarterly and
         annual basis, as well as time use. The World Bank provided training on topics on
         sampling, statistical analysis, questionnaire design, data entry, and work evaluation.

         As a result of the security situation, some sampling adjustments had to be made, and
         some areas dropped from the survey. These adjustments however, were amazingly small,
         considering the extent of violence and risks faced by staff and household interviewers
         (see Annex 7). Lessons learned from the IHSES-1 were used to a second survey in 2012
         (IHSES -2). In addition, methodological improvements to the poverty line construction
         were applied ex post to the 2007 data, which provided a historically comparable series
         tracking poverty in Iraq between the two periods. Some slowdown in project execution
         was due to Bank staff desire to insure that data produced were of high quality, and not
         rushed to publication. Given country circumstances, a smaller survey with a more
         limited questionnaire might have been more appropriate, but the scope of the survey was
         a decision made by CSO to preserve continuity with their previous survey methodology.

         The Government was successful in the production of a Poverty Reduction Strategy,
         based on the initial survey work. The 2007 surveys was the basis of the production of the
         first-ever poverty line for Iraq, as well as revising the weights for the Consumer Price
         Index. The PRS was adopted by the Parliament in 2010. However, delays in the
         formation of a new Government in 2010 delayed the implementation of the PRS in terms
         of integration of the PRS into the budget. While some resources had been allocated to
         “poverty projects,” this did not amount to a full integration of the PRS into the budget
         i.e. in which poverty could be a cross-cutting theme informing allocations across
         different sectors.

         Implementation of the project has been made difficult by the difficult political situation
         in the country, including unresolved autonomy issues between Baghdad and Kurdistan.
         Iraqi project staff were firmly committed to the project, but talented management staff
         were spread thin. While the expectation was that this was an emergency project in a
         post-conflict situation, in fact the project was implemented at a time of ongoing sectarian
         conflict, which at times took as many as 3,000 lives per month.

         Because of implementation problems, the closing date of the project was extended four
         times, from an initial date of September 2007, to September 2009, and then to June
         2010, September 2012, and finally to June 2013.

        2.3		   Monitoring	and	Evaluation.	

         Most of the indicators for project results were based on the attainment of certain goals,
         such as the completion of the household survey, analytical studies and the formulation of
         a Poverty Strategy. Only two of nine intermediate indicators had measurable data
         objectives. Monitoring of project progress occurred largely via Bank staff interaction
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction           p. 18


         with project staff during training sessions outside of Iraq in Beirut and Amman, with few
         missions to Baghdad itself. The project paper did not discuss monitoring and evaluation.

         The grant agreement of July 2006 states that the Government is responsible for
         producing quarterly project progress reports, reporting on progress in meeting the
         development objectives. However, none of these appear to have been received by the
         Bank. Quarterly reports on financial management have been done on a regular basis by
         the Fiduciary Management Agent (FMA).

         Progress updates on performance indicators are available in most, but not all, of the
         supervision reports since 2007. Papers on prior restructuring in 2008 and 2010 did not
         report on the results framework.

         The Government undertook its own evaluation in the project, and produced its own ICR.
         However, this draft ICR did not contain performance indicators nor did it give any
         quantitative evaluation of the impact of the project (see Annex 4).

        2.4		   Safeguard	and	Fiduciary	Compliance	

         There are no safeguard issues related to this project

         In terms of fiduciary compliance, however, there have been problems with financial
         management.

        The Bank engaged an independent firm to operate as a Fiscal Monitoring Agent (FMA)
        for the project. Its role was to verify and validate to the Bank the project’s financial
        management and procurement arrangements and internal controls of the implementing
        agencies. It also provided advisory services and technical support to the Iraqi
        government relating to the project’s financial management and procurement
        arrangements, as well as the generation of quarterly financial reports.

         However, financial management was rated as “Unsatisfactory” prior to 2008,
         “Moderately Unsatisfactory” between 2008 and 2011, and “Moderately Satisfactory”
         thereafter. The financial management of the project was difficult because of the
         unsettled security situation, weaknesses in the banking system, weaknesses in public
         sector financial management, and a project that required a large number of small
         payments to survey workers throughout 18 governorates the country. Most payments had
         to be made in cash, which led to problems of procuring and distributing sufficient Iraqi
         dinars. Initial external audits were late and qualified. Withdrawal applications for 300
         enumerators in 18 governorates had to be funneled through the PMT and then to the
         Bank. The initial size of the Government established project account proved too small,
         resulting in payment delays As a result of a lack of liquidity, field worker salaries were
         3-5 months in arrears, and many survey workers were threatening to stop work.

         Over the course of project execution steps were undertaken to improve to upgrade
         project management, install accountants in each governorate, and have a designed
         internal auditor in the PMT. In addition, controls were enhanced over the payment
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction                      p. 19


            authorization and execution process, and an advanced disbursement mechanism was
            introduced using a Designated Account. The scope for the fiduciary monitoring agent
            (FMA) was expanded, including pre-screening of withdrawal applications and
            monitoring payments made through the Designated Account.4 The Bank and the FMA
            assisted the PMT to improve financial management performance, particularly with
            tracing payments and providing monitoring sheets and other kinds of support.

            The Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs) and accounting records have been
            generally satisfactory. Recent audits have been up to date and unqualified. The last audit
            report will cover the period from January 1, 2013 to closing date (June 30, 2013) plus
            the four month grace period, due for submission by December 31, 2013.

            The project document rated procurement risk as high at the start of the project. This was
            based on
               o The lack of adequate procurement laws and regulations;
               o Limited experience of Government staff with Bank procedures;
               o Limited access by Bank procurement staff to supervise the project in the field;
               o Impact of security conditions impacting bid submission, implementation and
                  possible looting of goods procured.

        The project report identified a number of mitigation measures, but indeed, procurement
        proved to a difficult issue in the early days of the project. The first project supervision
        report (January 2007) rated it as “highly unsatisfactory,” but this was raised to
        “satisfactory” by July of 2007, and has been rated as satisfactory since then. Procurement
        was initially adversely affected by the lack of good Internet facilities and IT capacity in
        the Governorates. In addition, there was some confusion over what was eligible for
        reimbursement, and how reimbursement of field worker expenses would be made.

               2.5	        	Post‐Completion	Operation/	Next	Phase	

        Complementary work to this project was being provided by a $2.6 million technical
        assistance grant from the Iraq Trust Fund to a project (P122031) whose objective is assist
        in the rationalization of the Public Distribution System (PDS). The PDS is a large food
        distribution system, which is untargeted and wasteful, and absorbs 8 percent of
        government spending (more than on education). Proposals for reforms of the PDS will
        rely heavily on the data from IHSES-2. The objective was to carry out a full Poverty and
        Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) of various reform scenarios. Some initial PSIA work on
        the PDS reform issue was included in the 2010 poverty assessment, but reform efforts
        stalled during the project period.

        Nevertheless, there have been some encouraging developments since project closure. The
        High Committee for PDS Reform has endorsed a “smart card” pilot program. Key details
        remain to be figured out (and the project looks technologically challenging), but the basic
        elements are as follows: four banks (three state-owned and one private) will participate in
        the program; Mastercard will supply the linking technology, and World Food Program

          (WFP) will have an advisory role. A small pilot group of families and ration shops will
          be selected to receive the smart cards and registers, before rollout nationwide in 2015
          There will be an option to receive cash or rations embedded in the card. The data and
          analytical capacity supported by the project will be valuable in assessing the prospects for
          scale-up of the pilot.

          The training provided by the EHSPPR project has also enabled CSO to undertake a new
          household survey in 2013, without direct Bank assistance. The Government intends to do
          these smaller-scope surveys on an annual basis, and the more comprehensive living
          standards surveys (such as the one in 2012) every five years. The Bank is undertaking a
          new poverty assessment based on the 2012 data, which will be the basis for a revised
          PRS to be done by the Government.


III.      ASSESSMENT	OF	OUTCOMES	

              3.1 	Relevance	of	Design,	Objectives	and	Implementation	

       Rating: High

           Objectives: The relevance of the project’s objectives was high, both in terms of
           Government priorities and Bank strategy. Without good data, it would have been
           impossible to do an assessment of poverty and develop a poverty strategy. This project
           helped the GOI carry out the first comprehensive household survey that covered all parts
           of the country, and produced results judged by outside experts to be above average in
           quality. For the future, addressing poverty remains a high priority for the Government.
           The work of this project will lay the groundwork for a revised poverty assessment and
           updated Poverty Strategy. It will also help focus work on the reform of the PDS, which
           has the potential of leading to a major shift of government services toward the poor.

           Design: By helping Iraqis undertake their own survey, rather than finance consultants to
           do it for them, the project insured the maximum amount of learning and capacity
           building within the Government. Thus, the CSO now has the capacity to carry out
           surveys with minimal input from the Bank. The project also facilitated the interaction of
           Iraqi officials and academics with Bank and other outside experts, ending years of
           isolation as a result of two wars, an invasion, and civil unrest.

              3.2 Achievement	of	Project	Objectives	

       Rating: Substantial

           The main objective, for strengthening the ability of the GOI to make informed decisions
           toward reducing poverty, creating jobs, and protecting the vulnerable, has been broadly
           achieved. Government officials have received sufficient training to be able to undertake
           surveys, develop strategies, and do analysis of poverty issues.
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction                      p. 21


            As shown in table 1, the majority of progress indicators are graded as “fully achieved”,
            including those related to the carrying out of the household surveys, training of technical
            staff, creation of a poverty strategy, dissemination of the results of the surveys, and
            incorporation of lessons learned from the first survey into subsequent surveys. Short
            comings in the main development indicators were mostly in the area of integrating the
            poverty strategy into the budget, which was only partially accomplished, and
            shortcomings in the use the data for Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA). In the
            original document, the achievement of PSIA analysis was considered a major component
            of the project (the second of three), and was to have resulted in series of studies, or one
            large PSIA study with four components5. Overtime, it seems to have been downgraded
            to the status of analytical studies, none of which were done, despite substantial capacity
            building efforts. An annex in the poverty assessment did contain an analysis of the
            impact of reforms of the PDS, but subsequent supervision reports did not count this as
            one of the “analytical studies” that were completed.

             In terms of intermediate objectives, the PRS monitoring report was not produced, and
            the gender-poverty study was delayed. Furthermore, the agreement in 2008 providing
            $2.5 million of additional funds indicated that outcome indicators would be revised to
            include the implementation of qualitative research methods, and development of a
            communications strategy. Neither of these two items appears in the final set of
            intermediate objectives in the ISRs of 2012 and 2013. Likewise a major thrust of the
            restructuring of 2012 was to include funds for integration of the PRS into the budget, to
            coordinate the PRS with national and sector strategies, and to plan PRS-related activities
            using results-based methods. In fact, none of this took place.

        Nevertheless, the project outcomes are rated substantial, given the overall PDO which
        emphasized building capacity, and was fully achieved. In terms of DO indicators, the
        project fully met 3 out 5 project development goals, and partially achieved the two
        remaining (see Table 1). On intermediate indicators, the project fully achieved 7 of 9
        goals, and failed to achieve two.

        As a concrete example of enhanced capacity, it is worth noting that MOP has been able to
        produce its own analytical studies of poverty using techniques and data supported by the
        project. Significant studies (written in Arabic) include: Phenomena of Poverty in Iraq
        Through Analyzing Income, Expenditure, and the Public Distribution System; The
        Impact of Poverty from Gender Perspective; The Relationship Between Manpower
        Employment and Poverty in Iraq; Education, Higher Education and Poverty in Iraq;
        Poverty Phenomenon in Health; and, The Role of the Social Protection Net in
        Eliminating Poverty in Iraq. The studies were prepared by teams from the Data Analysis
        Unit (created by the project) along with academics and technicians.

          The Trust Fund agreement proposes one PSIA report with four components, and identifies the topics. The
        logical framework in the same document calls for a series of studies to be approved by the Project
        Committee.

3.3 Efficiency	

    Rating: Moderate

The joint project costs accelerated from an initial $6.6 million to $13.1 million, plus an
additional $700,000 of Iraqi counterpart. However, the project produced more than was
anticipated in some cases, for instance covering two household surveys instead of one. Country
conditions raised initial cost estimates, both due to exchange rate appreciation, inflation, and the
need to conduct workshops outside of the country. In addition, additional tasks were added to the
project over time expanding the scope of the work (without changing development objectives).

It is impossible to calculate a rate of return for this project. A counterfactual based on not having
the project would mean no household survey databank to support future policy reforms, no
poverty strategy, and government staff less able to do poverty analysis. The impact of this is
difficult to gauge since it is likely to be in the future. By way of comparison, a Bank project
supporting a household budget survey in Yemen, which faces similar capacity and security
challenges, envisages a total cost of around US$4.0 million with US$2.6 million coming from
trust funds. Allowing that the Iraq project has financed two surveys, one would not expect the
cost of two surveys to be double the cost of one survey, as some capacity built during the first
survey could be leveraged for the second. In any event, the cost does appear high compared to
the Yemen case. Among other factors, this appears related to the size of the sample in Iraq and
the length of the questionnaire: the fragile environment might have warranted a simplification in
both aspects, but GOI was keen to undertake a survey with this structure. Thus efficiency is hard
to judge, but is here rated at moderate.


3.4 	Justification	of	Overall	Outcome		

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project is rated high on relevance, substantial on efficacy and moderate on efficiency. The
project is rated moderately satisfactory overall.

The project achieved its overall objective to “…strengthen the ability of the GOI to make
informed decisions…”. Substantial efforts at staff training, including participation in household
surveys and writing the poverty strategy and poverty assessment, have raised the Government’s
ability to make informed decisions regarding poverty alleviation. There have been some
shortcomings in moving from data gathering to the policy making stage, but this is a work in
progress. A follow-on GOI self-financed project will use the results of this project to address the
problem of reforming the PDS, which will be a major political and social step. Inability to fully
reach all of the development outcomes as originally planned is more a function of the shifting
political/social/security situation in the country, although some of these problems could have
been foreseen.

    IV.      ASSESSMENT	OF	RISK	TO	DEVELOPMENT	OUTCOMES	

    Rating: Significant

    The main risk to development outcomes is the possibility that, given the shifting
    political/social environment, the Government will not use the knowledge gained from the
    poverty assessment and poverty strategy to implement reforms that lead to a material
    improvement in the welfare of the poor. These risks can be disaggregated into two parts:

        Capacity Building. Since the main DO was to strengthen the capacity of the Government
        to undertake analysis, it is likely that this will continue. At present, the CSO has the
        capacity to continue to undertake household surveys, and while this capacity might
        deteriorate over time, it is likely to remain strong, unless the Government makes a decision
        to cut financial resources in the budget for further work on data collection and poverty
        strategy formulation. The risk here is rated moderate.

        Pro-Poor Policies. The DO indicators go beyond the mere capacity building and include
        implementation of pro-poor policies and budget allocations. Already we have seen some
        reluctance to fully incorporate the findings of the PRS into the budget, and discussions on
        a major reform of the PDS are on-going, although some improvements have been made.
        The risk of this happening is rated as high.


    V.       BANK	AND	BORROWER	PERFORMANCE	

5.1		     Bank	Performance	

          a. Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The combination of the two trust funds ensured that there was sufficient training and
organization to carry out the survey and analysis work. The Bank has had considerable
experience with household surveys and poverty strategies, and the project drew on this expertise.
The major shortcoming of the appraisal was to underestimate the cost and time needed to carry
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction               p. 25


out the project, as well as the ability of the government to handle its fiduciary responsibilities, to
make payments to enumerators in a timely fashion, and to ensure financial oversight and
auditing. The risk assessment was very optimistic, and in hindsight the appraisal team might
have been more candid of these risks and taken better mitigation measures.

        b. Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Supervision by the Bank appears to be moderately satisfactory. Implementation problems appear
to have been quickly addressed. Given the difficult security situation, particularly in Baghdad,
most supervision efforts were undertaken through meetings with government officials during
capacity building workshops and conferences outside of Iraq, mostly in Amman, Beirut, and
Istanbul, or in the Iraqi Kurdistan capital of Erbil.

There were 11 ISRs written between 2007 and 2013. These ISRs vary in quality, and in many
cases the results indicators are absent or incomplete. The ratings of the last ISRs is extremely
high, given the circumstances (HS for DO, S for IP). Staff appear to have focused on the recent
achievements, which were substantial, and not on the shortfalls in implementation or relative to
the overall PDO, which were serious.

Supervision of the project undoubtedly would have benefitted from more on-site supervision by
Bank staff, which was not possible because of the dangerous security situation. Bank
performance also suffered from the project dragging out over seven years, and having three
TTLs.

Financial management problems plagued the early years of the project, due to inadequate
funding of the project account. Bank policy at the time did not permit Designated Accounts
being set up in Iraq. With the project threatening to come to a halt, the Bank waived this
prohibition, and a Designated Account was opened, and the liquidity problems were alleviated.
Financial management was initially rated as “highly unsatisfactory” at the beginning of the
project, and eventually raised to “satisfactory” by the close of the project.

        Overall Rating on Bank Performance: Moderately Satisfactory


5.2		 Borrower	Performance		

Rating: Satisfactory

The Government remained fully committed to the project during its duration. While the project
was implemented by various agencies, the Ministry of Planning provided overall direction, and
the CSO did most of the survey work. For purposes of this evaluation, we do not distinguish
between the Government and the Implementing Agency. The isolation of Iraq from the Bank and
the world over the previous decade meant that government officials were unfamiliar with Bank
requirements covering financial management, procurement and disbursement. As a result, the
project started slowly and problems emerged in these areas. audits were not done on a timely
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction                           p. 26


basis, and wage payments were in arrears The project account initially established by the
Government proved too small, given the delays in process withdrawal applications for
enumerators in 18 governorates, which had to be funneled through the PMT and then to the
Bank. As Government officials became familiar with Bank requirements and understood their
purpose, things moved more smoothly.

The CSO’s performance on the implementation of the household surveys was outstanding,
particularly considering the security situation, poor internet connections, and delays in wage
payments. The work in 2007 sampled 18,000 households across 18 governorates, using over 300
enumerators, with multiple household visits. The 2012 survey covered 25,000 households. Both
surveys were extensive in scope, and included information on employment, education, time use,
and other areas. Review of the results an expert consultant found the results to be above average
in quality. CSO staff was enthusiastic participants in training sessions and eager to learn and
adopt new techniques.

The Government has lagged behind in implementing, in a substantial way, the results of the
poverty strategy. While some additional allocations have been made for poverty projects, the
PRS has not been fully incorporated into the budget or national planning process. While
government staff indicated interest in PSIA training, and this was accomplished, it did not yield
the “series of studies” described in the project agreement6.


    VI.      LESSONS	LEARNED	

              The following lessons emerge from this project:

    A fragile government working in an unstable environment cannot be expected to
produce results quickly, particularly when public institutions are weak. The project would
have benefitted from a more careful assessment of the institutional capacity to undertake the
procurement, disbursement and financial management requirements meeting World Bank
standards. The surprising result was that the Government did have the capacity to organize a
large and intensive household survey during such unsettled times. Nonetheless, a survey with a
smaller sample size and shorter questionnaire could have been completed more quickly and at
lower cost. More focus on financial management capacity building at an earlier stage might also
have been appropriate.

        Having a Bank executed trust fund paired with a recipient executed trust fund
proved to be an extremely constructive approach which might be replicated elsewhere. It
allowed the Bank to respond to training needs rapidly, coordinate with various government
agencies and other donors, while leaving the Government in charge of carrying out the work and
doing the poverty analysis. Having a Bank-executed fund also made it easier for the Bank to
identify and provide expertise from outside of Iraq. However, it should be acknowledged that the
pairing of the TA with the recipient project slowed down both components, because the TA
delivery was linked to the actual workflow, which in turn was delayed by external events. An

 The Logical Framework in the Trust Fund Grant Proposal calls for a series of studies, whose composition will be
determined by the project committee, while the text refers to one PSIA covering four topics identified in the text.
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction          p. 27


alternative model would have been to frontload the TA, laying the groundwork for the project
components to be delivered as conditions permitted.

    Building government capacity to collect data and do policy analysis does not necessarily
mean there are meaningful results in terms of policy reform and poverty reduction. The
project seems to have spent considerable energy on the data gathering and poverty line
construction and strategy phases, but made little progress on actually improving Government
policies. The appraisal appears to have overestimated the ability and willingness of the
Government to enact policy reform, in part because the political situation proved more fragile
than had been expected.

    If risks to development outcomes are very high, having a long list of mitigation
measures should not be used to create an illusion that risks no longer exist. Some mitigation
measures, such as not allowing the use (initially) of a designated account, may have actually
increased the risk of project failure. The mitigation measures also assumed that this project
would be executed in a post-conflict environment, and not in the middle of renewed violence.
Nevertheless, the initial project paper did identify risks associated with weak government
capacity, political unrest, and the Bank’s inability to supervise, and identified mitigation
measures. The main risk was not identified: that the Government would collect and publish data
on poverty and social conditions, but do little or nothing to actually adopt policies to mitigate
poverty.

                Annex 2. Outputs by Original Components

Component 1: Preparation of Poverty Assessment Report and Data Sets7
The Government managed to carry out two household surveys, in 2007 and 2012, although only one was
envisaged in the original project agreement. The quality of the data is considered above average,
particularly in the 2012 survey. These were the first comprehensive household surveys of living standards
ever conducted in Iraq, and were undertaken at a time of a high level of conflict and violence. These
surveys consist of multiple visits to selected households over a one year period, in order to obtain
information on consumption patterns on an annual, monthly and weekly basis, including food rations
received. In addition, the surveys cover main socio-economic characteristic of the household, including
household composition, health status, use of health services, languages spoken, dwelling characteristics,
job search and employment, education and school attendance, and the use of time. The 2007 survey
covered 18,000 households, and had 3655 questions with each household being visited 24 times during
the year. The 2012 survey covered 25,000 households with a similar sized questionnaire.
The data have been used to update the CPI, which was essential to drawing up a poverty line. The data is
available to Government ministries and all Governorates. A Poverty Assessment published in 2010 based
on the 2007 data. The official poverty line adopted by Council of Ministers in 2010 and the poverty
headcount from the 2012 survey was officially released in June 2013. The staffs of the statistical agencies
have been strengthened through extensive training and technical assistance, and plans are underway to do
annual updating surveys as well as a full household survey every five years. Work has begun on poverty
mapping, which will be able to pinpoint poverty in terms of local areas. Training has been given to the
staffs of various Government ministries (Planning, Labor, Finance) on data quality control, survey design,
and the analysis and use of the survey data, as well as on poverty measurement and poverty line
construction.. The number of person-days of training (2464) was significantly higher than originally
projected in the project (1000). Training proved expensive because it had to take place outside of Iraq, but
this also made the training sessions popular as it gave government officials a break from the conflict and
violence at home.
Outputs: Two household surveys completed and disseminated; one poverty assessment completed; 2464
person-days of staff training.
Outcomes: Greater awareness of poverty issues and more in-depth knowledge of the location of the poor,
their characteristics; the depth of poverty.
Rating: Highly Satisfactory


Component 2: Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of Proposed Policy Areas (PSIA)
This component envisaged a series of studies analyzing the poverty and social impact of changes in
government programs, particularly the public distribution system for food (PDS), as well as training of
government staff on the methodology of doing PSIA studies. Other studies anticipated were of trade
policy, agricultural policy, privatization and employment focused growth. While the training was
undertaken and completed, little actual work on PSIA was done.

A study of the reform of the PDS was included as an annex in the poverty assessment, but this was done
by outside consultants and World Bank staff, not by the Government. The Poverty Assessment of 2010
does include a discussion of reform options for the PDS, including shifting to a cash basis, geographic
targeting, and means testing. This was also included in the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).Since the

PDS is a broad welfare program which distributes subsidized food to all Iraqis, the Government has
proven to be sensitive to the negative impact of any reform, even if it meant shifting to a more efficient
and better targeted system. Given that support for the Government is weak and fragile, it is not surprising
that interest in major policy reforms was limited. In addition, poor internal controls in the PDS and lack
of accountability provide opportunities for corruption, waste, diversion of resources, and poor quality
products.8
Outputs: One study done by outside consultants. No evidence of Government capacity in this area,
despite training.
Outcomes: None
Rating: Unsatisfactory


Component 3: Preparation of Poverty Reduction, Employment Generation and Safety Net
Strategy

A Poverty Reduction Strategy was drafted based in part on the 2007 household survey data, and
was formally adopted by the Government in 2009. The strategy focused on raising employment
incomes, improving health status of the poor, upgrading of education, improving the living
environment, more effective social protection systems, and reducing inequality between poor
men and women. In terms of implementation of the strategy, however, results have been spotty.
The Iraqi approach to this in the last two budgets has involved setting aside a dedicated amount
(now around US$500 million) which is dedicated to projects specified in the PRS and with some
component to be allocated based on poverty indicators, e.g. with the poorest provinces
according to the poverty line receiving an additional allocations. The deputy Prime Minister
heads the regular meetings of the PRS Higher Committee, which puts pressure on line ministries
and governorates to absorb PRS activities into annual plans and budgets. However, this is far
from a full integration of poverty with the budget, which would call for poverty to be a theme
threaded throughout the budget and informing allocations on all poverty reduction policies like
social safety net, education and health sectors etc.
As noted above, discussions of reforming the safety net system have been on-going, although
little has happened. While the Government did reduce the number of subsidized items from 10 to
five in 2012, the basic system remains intact. Corruption and inefficiencies in the system means
that costs are high and the quality of food delivered is low. Since most food is imported, the
effect of the system has been to discourage domestic production of such essential items such as
flour, sugar, cooking oil and rice. The Kurdistan Regional Government appears to be interested
in moving to a food coupon system, which would reduce waste and stimulate local production.
However, this proposal has not been approved by the national government.
There has been no strategy developed for employment generation, and unemployment remains high.
Outputs: A Poverty Reduction Strategy approved by Government. A poverty update has been delayed.
Outcomes: Some more, but limited, attention to poverty projects in the budget.

               Annex	4.	ICR	by	Government	

An ICR draft was prepared by Mr. Zeki A. Al-Jadir, Project Management Team Leader, assisted by PMT
members in September 2013. The “lessons learnt” and “next steps” sections are replicated below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lessons Learnt
   1- Poverty is multi-dimensional, not only economic dimensional it is extending from low levels of
       poor health and lack of education, to other "non- material" dimensions of well-being, including
       gender gaps, insecurity, powerlessness and social exclusion.
   2- A solid understanding of poverty allows prioritization of potential public interventions according
       to expected poverty impact. As well as understanding its characteristics and determinants is
       fundamental to determining appropriate public actions.
   3- The Ministry of Planning/ the Central Statistical Organization has gained positive advances in
       methodology and improvements in survey design, as well as increased capacity are evident.
   4- As noted, the Household Survey and Poverty Reduction Policies Project encouraged strong level
       of ownership which was a key contributor to the successful in implementation of the project.
   5- In fragile states, the design of emergency projects in conflict-affected situations should be very
       simple, manageable in scope and suitable to the context and should primary focus on outputs.
   6- We have to agree that these successive surveys allowed concerned candidates a great opportunity
       to learn hands-on steps about all steps in implementing surveys, analysis and reporting.
   7- In addition to the estimation of the national poverty line and the five year national poverty
       reduction strategy, as other off springs of the household survey 2007, the staff generated a
       number of reports both in house and in collaboration with academics on issues of housing,
       income, expenditure, education, ration system, agriculture, poverty and time use.
   8- The extent at which the indicators may have been used for the benefit of the poor is difficult to
       state but generally speaking, the areas of housing, education and health have certainly been
       affected by the shortages discovered as a result of the surveys. In addition, the result of such
       surveys remains influencing decision making for long time to come. In fact these effects are not
       expected to be seen so soon as the establishments of trends require more successive and
       systematic surveys.
   9- The standard documents used throughout the contracting process, especially of contracts valued
       bellow $USD 100,000 are very helpful because it is simple, clear, coherent           and         very
       practical in handling and solving problems. It was noted regarding contracts of more the $USD
       100,000, the vendors hesitate to submit their offers because of the complicated procedures and
       requirements have to be submitted according to the standard documents.
   10- The financial management is also very transparent and quick in all the aspects of procurement
       and disbursement process. Using of the TOKEN system was very helpful regarding time and cost.

Next Steps and Implementation
   1- The CSO intends to print a summary regarding the main outcomes of the 2012 survey in order to
       launch the data on September 26, 2013. The complete data tabulation will be printed by the CSO
       printing press before the end of this year to make it available for the users.
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction                      p. 35


    2- According to the Cabinet decree No. 409 dated November 24, 2009, the Ministry of Planning
       should make available a new Poverty Reduction Strategy for the coming five years before the end
       of 2013 in light of the conclusions of the Iraqi Household socio-economic Survey conducted in
       2012.
    3- Regarding future collaboration with the World Bank, the Minister of Planning wrote a letter to the
       Country Director at the World Bank dated January 20, 2013 requested continued technical
       support from the Bank to the Ministry of Planning and the Central Statistical Organization (CSO),
       for on-going work related to surveys and survey methodology, poverty measurement and
       analysis, revision of current poverty reduction strategy (PRS), and technical capacity building.
       The support of the World Bank has been invaluable and the Ministry looks forward to working
       closely to complete this work and bring these enormous efforts to meaningful fruition. At the
       same time, the CSO is also expanding the scope of its work and would like to continue the work
       with the World Bank on current and future activities, including the preparation of new PRS
       document based on the conclusions of 2012 socio-economic survey, the continuous survey for
       poverty monitoring and creating the first poverty map for Iraq.
    4- As the reform initiative of the Public Distribution System (PDS), was one of the outcomes of the
       Poverty Reduction Strategy aiming at effective social protection for the poor, the letter of request
       also included Bank's guidance on ensuring that there is no break in the activities of the PDS
       reform and rationalization which going on since 2011.
    5- Building on previous long and productive collaboration, the World Bank expressed in its letter
       dated February 13, 2013 its willingness to support the Ministry's ambitious and timely plan for
       the next years. These include the poverty mapping exercise, technical assistance for regular
       poverty monitoring surveys and the poverty and inclusion assessment which will form the basis
       for a new government strategy for poverty reduction.
       These activities form a fundamental part of the Bank's strategy in Iraq, after both sides entering
       into an agreement on Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) where the Government reimburses
       the World Bank for the costs incurred. This will enable the Bank to meet Government demand for
       its services and continue providing a higher level of support than what it can cover using its own
       limited resources.
    6- The donors of the Iraqi Trust Fund (ITF) already have come out in favor of extension of the ITF.
       The estimated undisbursed resources by the end of June 30, 2013 will be around USD 20 million.
       As the Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction Project, considered as High
       Satisfactory, it will be eligible to request resources out of the mentioned amount to conduct future
       activities. The Ministry of Planning is waiting for the WB to finalize mechanisms and procedures
       to manage for new grants9.

             June 2011 (N. Pontara)

              Iraq Household and Socioeconomic Survey (IHSES-2)

             -- The team supported the discussion with representatives of the Iraqi and Kurdish
             statistical agencies on the results of the pre-test exercise, the revision of the IHSES-2
             questionnaire, and the preparation of the piloting exercise of the survey.
             Progress Achieved. The team discussed the results of the pre-test report. The
             questionnaire was examined, section by section, focusing on big ticket items.
             Agreement was reached on the main changes to be introduced and follow-up work
             planned to streamline the health and food recall sections, align the migration section
             to the census questionnaire and the employment section to the existing employment
             and unemployment survey questionnaire. The IHSES-2 will go to the filed in
             October 2011.

             Next Steps. The next activities consist in training the interviewers and supervisors of
             the upcoming pilot survey (a workshop is planned in Beirut during July 23-30 for
             this purpose) as well as the data managers on data collection, data entry and
             fieldwork organization. The pilot survey will take place during late July-early
             August. A workshop to analyze the pilot data and construct the consumption
             aggregate has been scheduled for first half of September.

             Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)

             -- The team took stock and discussed the results of the TA delivered to date to
             support the implementation of the PRS; delivered comments on PRS implementation
             matrices submitted recently by line ministries; and discussed and agreed plans and
             activities to be undertaken in 2012 to build capacity on PRS implementation,
             monitoring and evaluation at the line ministry and governorate levels.

             Progress Achieved. The authorities informed the Bank team that following the
             approval of the PRS in 2009, its implementation has suffered severe delays notably
             due to the protracted time that was taken to form the current Government. A new
             impetus to the PRS implementation is beginning to form, however, and the Higher
             Committee for Poverty Reduction held regular meetings in the last 6 months. Letters
             have been sent to line ministries informing them of the importance of integrating
             PRS policies in their annual plans and focal points have been appointed. US$1.75 bn
             have been allocated to be used for poverty reduction activities, including for
             strengthening health care systems, building dwellings for the vulnerable segments of
             the Iraqi population, eliminate 'mud schools', support microfinance, and promote
             gender-oriented activities in rural areas. The authorities have requested the help of
             the Bank to support the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the PRS at the
             central (PRS Secretariat), line ministries and governorate levels. The TOR of the
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction              p. 37


             recently revamped PRS Secretariat has been also shared with the Bank team for
             information.

             Next Steps. The PRS TA modus operandi was discussed. It was agreed that an
             effective implementation of the PRS requires a greater focus on the budget
             mechanism and coordination between the federal government, Kurdistan Region, and
             provincial (governorates) and local (districts and sub-districts) levels. Capacity
             building activities will focus on strengthening the coordinating role of the PRS
             Secretariat, and the technical ability of focal points in line ministries and
             governorates to integrate effectively PRS activities in the annual plans that are
             submitted to the Ministry of Finance. Moreover, the PRS TA will focus on
             strengthening capacity to implement activities and projects on the ground, tackle the
             coordination challenges at all levels of government and develop capacity to monitor
             implementation and evaluate outcomes. The PRS Secretariat has also expressed
             interest in elaborating a PRS Progress Report. A workshop is planned in Beirut
             during July 18-21, 2011 to focus on capacity building for the PRS Secretariat and
             line ministries. A follow-up workshop will focus on Governorates and the local level
             after the summer.


             July 2011 (N. Pontara)

             Iraq PRS and IHSES2 (Beirut)

             Iraq Second Household and Socioeconomic Survey (IHSES2). Two workshops on
             the IHSES2 were held concurrently in Beirut during 23–30 July 2011 (special thanks
             to Mohammed Bakir, Juan Munoz and Beatriz Godoy). The first workshop focused
             on (36) fieldwork coordinators, the second on (12) data managers.

             The Fieldwork Coordinators Workshop. The main objectives of this workshop were
             to: (i) acquaint fieldwork coordinators with the preparations for the IHSES2 and the
             work conducted so far; (ii) train fieldwork coordinators on the questionnaire and
             instruction manual and get their inputs; (iii) discuss fieldwork related issues; and (iv)
             prepare for the implementation of the IHSES2 Pilot Survey. Day 1 sessions provided
             introductory background. During days 2 to 4 the questionnaire and the instructions
             manual were explained. As a training exercise, at the end of each part of the
             questionnaire, each participant filled it in by interviewing another participant. Based
             on the feedback of participants, the questionnaire and the instructions manual were
             revised. The revisions were presented and discussed during day 6. Days 7 and 8
             focused on sampling, fieldwork organization, supervision procedures, and
             organizational, financial and administrative issues. The data collected during the
             training exercise will be used to test the Data Entry Program (DEP) and to create raw
             data that will be used to further refine the DEP and test the syntax for producing the
             tabulations.

             The Data Management Workshop. The main objective of this workshop was to train
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction              p. 38


             the participants on the use of the DEP, with the aim that they train, later in Iraq, the
             interviewers who will participate in the Pilot Survey. The DEP was developed in
             LSD-2010, a data entry platform based in Visual Basic for Excel. The first days were
             devoted to teach the trainees on how to identify the different statistical objects
             observed in the IHSES2, called Record Types in the DEP, and defining them in the
             program. Subsequently, the team explained the steps to be followed to define the
             variables -- corresponding to questions in the questionnaire -- with their type, length
             and range. Participants developed the data entry screens for the first 5 sections of the
             questionnaire. The DEP was also installed on participants' laptops, so they could test
             it and learn more about its use. Though the fieldwork coordinators will not enter the
             data themselves, each data manager trainer worked closely with a group of 3 or 4
             fieldwork coordinators, showing them how to use the DEP and to get them
             acquainted with the program.

             Iraq Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The PRS activities consisted of a one day
             meeting with the PRS Secretariat and a 3-day workshop with Line Ministries.

             Meeting with the PRS Secretariat. This meeting took stock of progress achieved in
             the implementation of the PRS and the role of the PRS Secretariat. All ministries and
             institutions with responsibility to implement PRS activities have appointed PRS
             focal points. The PRS Secretariat has had several meetings with them in Baghdad.
             Ms. Najla Ali Murad, General Director of the PRS Secretariat, presented its
             revamped structure -- which consists of three divisions (Policies and Programs,
             Monitoring and Follow-up, and Documentation) -- and highlighted the need to
             recruit qualified personnel to adequately staff the Secretariat (job descriptions for the
             additional staff are being prepared). It was also agreed that a 'PRS Road Map' (a
             sort of PRS Progress Report) should be prepared by early 2012, and be used as a
             communication/advocacy/monitoring tools for both policy makers and international
             donors. The report should present the PRS structure and content; the institutional
             framework for its implementation; the progress achieved and challenges to date; the
             monitoring system; and the funding and financial mechanisms required for effective
             implementation. A consultant has been hired to help on the drafting of this report.

             Line Ministry Workshop. This workshop -- attended by 26 officials from 15
             ministries, the Parliament and civil society organizations -- aimed at refining the
             work on the PRS implementation matrices that started in early 2011 with the support
             of the PRS Secretariat and the World Bank team. Participants continued to work
             with the draft matrices, focusing on two PRS activities for each ministry. The results
             of the work were then presented and discussed in plenary, with a view to developing
             a common understanding of the required task. The team also discussed the main
             points of guidance for the continued preparation of these matrices, which are
             expected to be sent to the PRS Secretariat by end August. The team also
             brainstormed with participants on the budget implications of the PRS and discussed
             the main findings of a report on funding pathways in Iraq (i.e. central to local). This
             work will be refined in the coming weeks and integrated in the PRS Roadmap
             Report, referred to above, and the upcoming PER.

             _________________________________________________________________

             October - November 2011 (N. Pontara)

             Three workshops were held concurrently in Beirut between the 23rd of October and
             the 4th of November 2011. This work has sought to: finalize the capacity building
             activities to allow the IHSES2 to go to the field in early 2012; and brainstorm about
             the choice of poverty measurement (e.g. update vs. recalculation of the poverty line)
             once the IHSES2 data will be ready for analysis.

             The main results and next steps are summarized as follows:

             1. Workshop on Poverty Measurement Options (Leaders: Nobuo Yoshida,
             Nandini Krishnan, Giovanni Vecchi)

             Activities. The main objective of this workshop –- which was aimed at a selected
             group of policy makers and statisticians at CSO -- was to: (i) improve the logistics
             and survey instruments of the next IHSES2 by selectively analyzing the pilot survey
             data; and (ii) conduct a brainstorm on how to update the poverty estimates. The team
             discussed the way in which poverty estimates were conducted during IHSES1 and
             assessed it by comparing them with the methodology used in other countries. The
             international comparison was done using a database PRMPR has recently created.
             Moreover, the discussion focused on how to update the poverty line by listing and
             debating the pros and cons of various options to do so; and highlighting how easily
             comparability between the previous and new poverty rates can be lost. In response to
             requests from participants, a training session was also prepared to explain how to
             construct price indices using the data from the recently completed pilot survey.

             Next steps. Looking forward, with the survey in the field throughout the most part of
             2012, it will be important to: (i) identify a select group of Iraqi statistical officers
             (perhaps augmented by an economist) who will work closely on poverty
             measurement; and (ii) design the training for the estimation of poverty (based on the
             chosen option) and schedule its delivery. It will be also important to receive from the
             authorities the final data set of the recently completed IKN survey. As discussed
             during the workshop, it will be difficult to use the IKN data to produce poverty
             estimates that are comparable with those of the IHSES1-2, as the consumption
             aggregate is significantly different. The IKN data, however, could be used to produce
             other types of welfare estimates, such as, for instance, multidimensional poverty
             indices. A follow-up meeting with the UN in Iraq is warranted to discuss these
             issues. The team also clarified the composition of the Bank's team that will support
             the counterparts in the poverty analysis work.

             Fieldwork Coordinators Workshops (Leaders: Mohammed Bakir, Basil Al-
             Hussaini)
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction              p. 40


             Activities. This workshop included the Director General of Technical Affairs (CSO),
             Director of Living and Conditions (CSO), 15 Directors of CSO governorate offices,
             and 14 Central Supervisors. The main objectives of the master trainers’ workshop
             were to: (i) get feedback on the pilot survey implemented during September 2011;
             (ii) update the participants and get their feedback regarding the post pilot survey
             changes made in the data entry program (DEP), questionnaire, instructions manual
             and other IHSES2 instruments and methods; (iii) train the master trainers on training
             skills required for training the fieldwork interviewers; and (iv) discuss fieldwork
             requirements, coordination and other related issues. The bulk of the workshop’s
             sessions were dedicated to enhancing the master trainers’ skills for training the
             interviewers. This was done through role plays; each of the 15 Directors of Statistics
             offices and 14 Central Supervisors from CSO and KRSO was given the opportunity
             to act as a trainer and other participants as trainees. The performance of each trainer
             was assessed and ranked, in order to allow CSO to identify the best trainers for the
             actual training of interviewers and local supervisors.

             Next steps. Based on this training, the crucial activity –- before the survey goes to
             the field –- will be to conduct the training of fieldwork interviewers. Also, it will be
             important to finalize and print the Kurdish version of the questionnaire and fieldwork
             manual, the final testing and development of the DEP (see below), the finalization of
             the supervision forms, and the completion of the organizational and logistical
             activities needed for the fieldwork.

             Data Managers Workshop (Leaders: Juan Munoz, Beatriz Godoy)

             Activities. This workshop was divided in two parts: (i) training of the data managers;
             and (ii) training of the data entry program (DEP) trainers. Each part lasted about 1
             week. During the first part, an analysis of the DEP during the recently-completed
             pilot survey was done, receiving important input from the CSO Data Analysis Unit
             (DAU). During the second part, the team: (i) enhanced the DEP, implementing many
             of the ideas received from the DAU, plus other suggestions obtained from the
             IHSES2 management team; (ii) tested intensively the DEP in order to debug it; and
             (iii) designed the data transmission procedures. The data management team also
             trained six data entry trainers, using the questionnaire from the pilot survey.

             Next steps. The team recommended the following next steps: (i) prior to the
             interviewers training, hold a workshop in Iraq for the master trainers to update them
             with the final versions of the survey instruments and methods and with preparations
             for fieldwork; (ii) revise the instructions manual to incorporate post pilot survey
             revisions in the questionnaire and to include additional clarifications and definitions;
             (iii) intensify work on developing the DEP before the start of the fieldwork,
             including testing the program during the interviewers' training; (iv) continue the
             capacity building of the data managers, including holding a workshop led by Beatriz
             Godoy as soon as feasible; (v) data managers should get the same training as the
             interviewers including filling up questionnaires and entering their data, to help them
             get a better understanding of data collection and data entry processes during the
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction             p. 41


             actual fieldwork; (vi) provide the validation rules used in the data entry program to
             CSO, KRSO and the Bank team for information and feedback; and (vii) prepare a
             manual on using the data entry program to be utilized for training and distribution to
             all those involved in data entry.


             JANUARY 2012 (N. Pontara)

             Training on poverty measurement. The TA on the design and implementation of
             the second Iraq Household and Socio-Economic Survey (IHSES2) has been
             completed and the survey was launched on January 16, 2012. The IHSES2 will be in
             the field until the end of 2012 and data will be available for preliminary analysis on a
             quarterly basis. The Bank team has formulated a draft plan on poverty measurement
             training for the next 12 months focusing on: (i) the identification of a core group of
             Iraqi officials who will be trained on different poverty measurement techniques; (ii)
             methodological (and data) issues that characterize the estimation of poverty with
             IHSES2 data; (iii) a workshop plan for FY2012; and (iv) the links the Bank's
             capacity building activities and those of other donors (i.e., UN, notably IAU and
             UNFPA). The note is under discussion with the Iraqi authorities and will be finalized
             by early March. In a nutshell, the idea is to focus training activities on a limited
             number of people -- comprising selected members of the existing Data Analysis Unit
             (DAU) and ‘Poverty Line Committee’ that was created during the IHSES1 -- with
             the addition of economists, and experts engaged in fields such as health, education,
             housing, and social protection reform. If there is broader demand for such training in
             Iraq among a broader constituency of academics/policy think tanks, the team will
             consider delivering training tailored to such audiences.

             DECEMBER 2012 (N.Krishan and K. Carey)

             IHSES II Data preparation (Tara Vishwanath, Giovanni Vecchi, Beatriz
             Godoy, Hai-Anh Dang, Mohammed Bakir):

             As part of the workshop, there were detailed discussions on the current status of
             recent waves of IHSES II data and on protocols for checking and cleaning data that
             were being followed. As a result of the hard work and commitment of teams at the
             governorate and the central level, CSO has now shared IHSES II data for waves 1-19
             after a series of internal checks with the World Bank team. A few issues were
             nevertheless identified for further action by CSO and KRSO, in particular, ensuring
             that consistency checks and flags raised by the data entry program are followed, and
             that as new waves of data become available, they are cleaned and shared in a timely
             manner.

             Given the need to complete the work on poverty measurement and methodology
             within a strict timeline, the team discussed and developed a timeline for checking
             data quality, documenting all cleaning procedures, and sharing the full 24 waves of
             data. The World Bank team will develop and document the protocol for checking
             and verifying data; this will take the form of a STATA “do” file with each check and
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction              p. 42


             all changes documented. Priorities for this work include any data quality and
             verification issues that need to be transmitted back to CSO and KRSO for urgent
             action including field checks and data entry checks and a list of critical variables and
             modules for construction of the consumption aggregate. By early January, CSO and
             KRSO will share the final data for waves 1-19, and by early February, final data for
             the full 24 waves will be shared.

             During the workshop, insights from preliminary analysis of IHSES-II data (waves 1-
             12) and potential areas for discussion were also shared. Of particular importance was
             the need to explore the use of CPI data for conducting the price adjustments that are
             needed for poverty measurement. The team also devoted significant time to review
             the methodology deployed for IHSES-I and documented all the steps that were
             followed in a much simpler format, to enable replication by CSO and KRSO staff in
             the future, as well as to be able to ensure comparability in case of methodological
             changes.

              Stata and ADePT training (Sergio Olivieri, Nandini Krishnan)

             The team completed the first of a series of planned hands-on capacity building
             activities for DAU on the use of STATA and ADePT. During the first couple of
             days, the team introduced and presented general concepts about poverty
             measurement with some hands-on applications in STATA using Iraq Household and
             Socio-Economic Survey I. The following days were focused on the preparation of
             the micro-data for ADePT Poverty Module using STATA as well as interpretation of
             tables and graphs produced by ADePT software. The workshop consisted of
             technical discussions with participants and hands-on exercises in STATA and
             ADePT (See presentations and problem set attached below).

             The workshop was well appreciated by the 13 participants from CSO and KRSO's
             Data Analysis Units. The results of an evaluation sheet distributed at the end of the
             activity show very high levels of satisfaction. Questions and issues raised by seminar
             participants during the discussions will contribute positively to the improvement of
             future workshops. The Bank team emphasized that to ensure steady progress, it is
             critical that the composition of the DAU team remain exactly the same and that all
             participants continue to attend each and every session.

             Next steps . An audio conference will be held with the counterparts to discuss and
             develop a timeline for (a) Data delivery, (b) Dates for future workshops, (c)
             Preparation of CPI data. This is critical as the activities planned and all work on
             poverty measurement and trends need to be completed by June 30, 2013, when the
             Iraq Trust Fund and the project closes.

             With respect to STATA and ADePT training and capacity building, given that many
             members of DAU were new and had not benefitted from the earlier IHSES I training,
             progress was significant but slow. Therefore, it will be very important to ensure that
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction                p. 43


             training is as frequent as possible, and that at least 4 to 5 additional sessions take
             place.


             FEBRUARY 2013 (K. Carey and N. Krishnan):

             High Level PDS workshop: Excellent presentations were made by external speakers
             who were invited to share their country experiences ( India, Egypt, Mexico and
             USA). These presentations provoked very interesting discussions around how to
             manage reforms that are politically sensitive. Participants from Iraq were especially
             vocal about the difficulty of implementing big bang reforms like abolishing PDS for
             cash transfers that was recently tabled and reversed by the cabinet - something that
             we have all along discouraged them from doing, especially without a careful
             transition plan. There were excellent suggestions on the transition and
             implementation that were suggested in the presentations made by the experts. On the
             4th, there was a half day discussion around a concrete set of suggestions on the way
             forward for Iraq , which is reflected in our aide-memoire that has been transmitted to
             GoI. Essentially, we have suggested that they focus on examining leakages in the
             supply chain to improve the efficiency in the system, and piloting a few options like
             food coupon system, and testing the feasibility of "smart card" type delivery
             mechanisms to improve the transparency of the system of delivery. We
             recommended that these sorts of efforts would need to come before any discussion of
             cash transfers or targeting which are currently difficult and especially during the run
             up to elections. (This segment was led by Tara Vishwanath and Nandini Krishnan
             from the World Bank side, and Dr. Mehdi Al Alaq, Deputy Minister of Planning and
             Head of Iraq Central Statistics Organisation from GoI).

             Poverty monitoring through continuous surveys and poverty maps: GoI requested
             technical discussions around the design of high frequency/continuous surveys to
             support regular poverty monitoring. They first presented their motivation and
             objectives to conduct such an exercise. Since these are early days and they are still
             exploring ideas, we first presented the technical underpinnings of such an
             undertaking followed by country examples. We highlighted options that GoI could
             consider- ranging from examples where no additional surveys are conducted outside
             of the IHSES series every 4 years but relying on imputation techniques, to the gold
             standard where specific modules like consumption and other relevant ones from the
             IHSES are repeated annually, which will need enormous capacity for survey
             implementation and analysis. A good discussion ensued where there was
             convergence around examining simpler options like administering the Core Welfare
             Indicator surveys and using poverty mapping techniques to estimate poverty
             annually. GoI has agreed to carefully weigh different options before the next round
             of discussions in a month. The Bank will provide them with questionnaires from
             other countries that will serve as useful examples for their internal discussion.

             A discussion also ensued around the poverty mapping work that has been initiated
             through our technical assistance. Upon advice from us, the Government fielded a
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction             p. 44


             poverty mapping survey late last year, and data collection has just been completed.
             We discussed a rough plan for the production of the poverty map based on the
             availability of data for modelling purposes. We highlighted that the pre requisite for
             initiating the poverty map would be to first finalize the new poverty estimates from
             IHSES 2, which we expect to conclude by June 2013. ( This segment was led by
             Nobuo Yoshida, Tara Vishwanath and Nandini Krishnan)

             Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS): GoI's Director of PRS Ms Najla Murad presented
             progress and challenges facing the PRS. From the Bank's PRSP experience, the
             overarching challenge facing Iraq's PRS is inadequate integration with the budget:
             the PRS simply "tags" a small number of investment projects as poverty-reducing
             (up to a ceiling of about US$500 million) and assesses the PRS on the basis of
             implementation of those projects. While the PRS also contains some policy
             measures, the momentum behind them has more to do with the responsible
             counterparts (and separate Bank engagement) rather than through their specific
             association with the PRS (e.g. social safety nets).

             Despite the small scope of PRS investment projects, they do face implementation
             challenges similar to the overall capital budget and facilitated by the presence of
             Ministry of Finance Budget Director Ms Taif, there was an informative discussion
             about the steps being taken to improve delivery of the capital budget. One revealing
             example was provided when several participants noted that projects were seriously
             delayed because the responsible agency had failed to secure access to land on which
             the project would be built. Rather than viewing this as requiring more attention on
             resolving difficulties in access to land, the Ministry of Finance introduced a new
             procedure asking that implementing agencies document that they have access to land
             for a project before it would be approved.

             Of course, overall evaluation of the PRS should be driven by the results of the new
             household survey, and we expect that this will form a major component a
             reimbursable advisory request from the Ministry of Planning for the post-ITF period,
             as a detailed poverty assessment cannot be prepared within FY13. A district level
             poverty map, as discussed above, will greatly improve the ability of the PRS to target
             projects. Given the analytical richness that will be possible with the new household
             survey, the Ministry of Planning is considering revising the PRS and is open to
             considering various forms for the new PRS (i.e. they are not wedded to new chapters
             along the structure of the 2009 PRS). Our dialogue on this will emphasize (1) the
             ability of a rigorous poverty assessment to inform policies, project selection, and
             gender dimensions of poverty, (2) better integration of the strategy with the budget,
             and (3) scope for deconcentrated implementation to better draw on local information
             in project design and implementation.

             April 9-11- Capacity Building: Sergio Olivieri and Nandini Krishnan conducted a
             capacity building and training workshop on STATA (econometric software) for
             analysts from CSO and KRSO. Fifteen staff members participated in the three day
             training session. Sergio Olivieri introduced and presented general concepts about the
             use of matrices in STATA to easily create tables as outputs. The participants also
             worked through cleaning protocols, the identification of inconsistencies and errors
             and worked in groups to interpret do files. The dynamic of the workshop consisted in
             technical discussions with participants and hands-on exercises in STATA. The
             seminar was very well received by the audience. Evaluation results are attached
             below, as well as training materials. Questions and issues raised by seminar
             participants during the discussions will contribute positively to the improvement of
             future training session.

             April 12- 13 - Technical Assistance on elements of poverty measurement: The
             larger World Bank team held discussions with senior delegates from CSO and KRSO
             and other experts on several key topics building up to the eventual poverty estimates.
             These discussions covered:
             Descriptive analysis of spatial variation in patterns of food and non-food
             consumption: The team presented descriptive tables based on IHSES 2012 data that
             demonstrate significant differences in the patterns of consumption across
             governorates and emphasized the importance of being sensitive to patterns in data in
             making decisions about price adjustments
             Temporal and Spatial price adjustments: Alternative approaches to month-to-month
             adjustments and spatial deflation were presented. These included comparing CPI and
             survey-based unit value indices, as well as alternative formulations of price indices
             (Paasche, Fisher, Laspeyres). The following decisions were made based on the
             presentation of different scenarios and discussions: (i) To use official CPIs to adjust
             for temporal (within survey year) variation in prices; (ii) To use Paasche constructed
             based on survey unit values at the household level to adjust for price differences
             across space.
             Treatment of rations: The team suggested that improvements could be made in the
             treatment of rations (food items distributed through the Public Distribution System)
             along two dimensions: measurement of quantities and valuation. A decision was
             made to further experiment with different options, consult with other experts at the
             World Bank and outside, and propose a revised methodology
             Methodological improvements in estimating the flow of service from durables:
             Improvements in the IHSES 2 questionnaire allow for a better estimate of the flow of
             services from durable goods. It was agreed that the team would identify ways to
             make this new method compatible with 2007.

             Finally, at the request of the senior advisor to Ministry of Planning, Tara Vishwanath
             met with Minister of Planning, Kurdistan Region, on April 11 2013. The Minister
             was interested in the meeting to discuss the issues surrounding the PDS reform and
             more fundamentally on the challenge of "identifying the poor" and the technical
             issues surrounding this exercise. During the discussion, he was also keen to
ICR- Iraq: Emergency Household Survey and Policies for Poverty Reduction            p. 46


             understand methodologies surrounding "setting of the poverty line". Given the wide
             spatial differences in prices and standards of living across the 3 regions of Iraq,
             concerns remain, especially in Kurdistan, about whether the techniques applied for
             measurement are able to adequately address such regional differences. Tara invited
             the minister to the join the workshop on April 13, and a special session was included
             to discuss some of the concerns that he raised. Indeed, a lot of technical work we are
             undertaking with the 2012 data include a more detailed examination of such
             concerns.

             The presentations made during the workshop are available upon request.

             Annex	7.		Survey	Work	under	Difficult	Circumstances	

             The period October 2006 to end of 2007 was the peak of Iraqi's recent civil violence – nearly
             3000 confirmed causalities per month according to official figures. In many areas
             government offices were closed; markets were shut down, and kidnappings, bombings, and
             terrorist attacks occurred daily.

             Interviewers and supervisors of IHSES field teams had to be hired locally and be capable of
             navigating through unpredictable circumstances and pervasive suspicions about the motives
             and identities of any outsiders. Since Iraqi names frequently signal ethnic or tribal affiliation,
             many interviewers were detained and threatened. In some instances, multiple identity cards
             had to be issued (for example, omitting a middle name that indicated the interviewer's ethnic
             or sectarian background) so that interviewers could move from one neighborhood to the
             next.

             Fieldworkers frequently opted for old rental cars rather government vehicles, or they
             arranged taxi transportation so that they would be accompanied by well-known local drivers.
             In some areas, regional coordinators converted their homes to makeshift offices and the
             project installed an internet device to send the scanned questionnaires to the Central
             Operation Room and facilitate communication with the CSO main office in Baghdad.

             In situations where active violence flatly precluded interviewing – a siege in Al-Anbar, for
             example- interviewers waited out events locally, and then moved on to continue interviews
             as soon as the siege was lifted and then worked longer hours to make up for lost time.

             The cost of this work was tragically high. On August 2, 2007, Louay Haqqi, the Director of
             Operations of IHSES-I was brutally assassinated on his way to work. Umar, a field worker in
             Diala, was killed in a bomb explosion while doing his work. Despite these setbacks, the
             IHSES team recovered from their shock, fear, and grief and then went on to complete this
             extraordinary undertaking in their honor.

             Sometimes a team could not visit a cluster at the scheduled time because of unsafe
             security conditions. When this happened, that cluster was swapped with a randomly
             selected cluster scheduled for a later date. If none were considered secure, a sample
             point was randomly selected from among those that had been visited already, and a
             new group of six households (randomly selected) was visited. Remarkably, fewer
             than 2 percent of the original clusters (55 of 3,024) had to be replaced.
