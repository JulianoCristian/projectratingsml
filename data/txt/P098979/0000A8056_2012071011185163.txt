                         The objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the ability of the GOI to make informed decisions towards reducing poverty, creating jobs and protecting the
                         vulnerable. Specifically, the project would focus on strengthening the ability of Iraqi officials to:
                          #      collect and analyze data on poverty and unemployment;
                          #      develop information-based strategies to reduce poverty, generate employment, and improve the functioning of social safety nets; and
                          #      assess the effect of economic policy options on both poverty and employment, including the impact of sequencing reforms and policies.

                         based strategies to reduce poverty and generate employment.

                         After the development of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) in 2009-10, the emphasis has shifted towards focusing on its implementation/monitoring and keeping up-to date the
                         understanding of poverty in Iraq. There is a new impetus on the implementation of the PRS in Iraq, including through the allocation of budget resources to this task. The upcoming

                         PRS Roadmap will highlight the main progress made and challenges encountered in the implementation of the PRS to date. In general, an effective implementation of the PRS
                         requires:

                         #         a greater focus on the budget mechanism;
                         #         a coordination between the Federal Government and Kurdistan Region, Line Ministries and the Governorates Representatives and even the local (districts and sub-districts)
                         levels;
                         #         capacity building activities focused on strengthening the coordinating role of the PRS Secretariat, and the technical ability of Focal Points in line ministries and governorates
                         to integrate effectively PRS activities in the annual plans that are submitted to the Ministry of Finance;
                         #         PRS technical assistance focused on strengthening capacity to implement activities and projects on the ground, tackle the coordination challenges at all levels of
                         government and develop capacity to monitor implementation and evaluate outcomes;

                         The capacity building efforts on the implementation of the PRS have now been concluded, both at Ministry and Governorate level. The authorities have produced a comprehensive
                         set of PRS implementation matrices, covering the whole spectrum of the strategy. These work constitutes the backbone of the upcoming PRS Roadmap, due before the end of the
                         calendar year.

                         On the household survey front, the second Iraq Household and Socio-economic Survey (IHSES-2) was launched on January 16, 2012 and will be in the field until January 2013.
                         Following the completion of the survey, technical assistance activities will focus on supporting policy relevant analyses of the data, and the production of the (new) poverty estimates
                         and their determinants, which will feed into the formulation of of the second PRSP, in early 2013.
