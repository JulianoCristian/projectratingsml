                         The objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the ability of the GOI to make informed decisions towards reducing poverty, creating jobs and protecting the
                         vulnerable. Specifically, the project would focus on strengthening the ability of Iraqi officials to:
                          #      collect and analyze data on poverty and unemployment;
                          #      develop information-based strategies to reduce poverty, generate employment, and improve the functioning of social safety nets; and
                          #      assess the effect of economic policy options on both poverty and employment, including the impact of sequencing reforms and policies.

                         The project is proceeding towards an orderly closure on June 30, 2013. As planned during the final restructuring last year, the team concentrated its efforts on getting the 2012 socio-
                         economic household survey data to the stage where rigorous poverty analysis can be performed. This has been achieved and first results regarding a poverty headcount (nationally

                         continue under new technical assistance after the Iraq Trust Fund closes. A particular achievement has been to align some methodological changes for the 2012 analysis with new
                         calculations on the 2007 data, thus allowing consistent comparisons between them. The end result of this work will be a sound statistical basis for answering numerous questions
                         about the level and changes in the welfare of Iraqi households and the impact of government policies and shocks thereon. This will be the basis of a revised Poverty Reduction
