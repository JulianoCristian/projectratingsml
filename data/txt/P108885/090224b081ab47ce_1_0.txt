                         Implementation Status Overview
                         By the end of 2012, M&E data collected from 49 out of 66 completed research and extension packages under Component A showed that average yields from farmers adopting the
                         new farming technologies increased 17% and product values increased 34%; out of 23,149 farmers receiving training, 5,168 farmers already adopted the improved technologies over
                         an area of 2,677 ha. The improved farming technologies (i.e. GAP) have also reduced input costs and adverse environmental impacts by reducing uses of pesticides, chemicals,
                         water, and energy. Under Component B, data collected from 66 partnerships which have operated for more than 1 year (involving 6,292 participating farmers) showed that selling

                         prices from farmers participating in the productive partnerships for agribusinesses, on average, were 12% higher than those from farmers in the same areas but outside the
                         partnerships. Trading relations between the farmer organizations and the agribusinesses have generally been good. Under Component C, the 76 completed infrastructure schemes
                         are providing direct benefits to 31,113 farming households over 17,188 ha of farming area. Transportation time from production areas to local markets has been reduced about 70%,
                         transportation costs reduced 23%, and post-harvest losses reduced 34%. These M&E results showed that the project is on course of meeting its development objectives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project restructuring to include interventions for improving sustainable rice farming in the Mekong Delta (MKD) was completed in October 2012. Training for farmers in the MKD
                         began in November 2012 (the Winter-Spring rice crop). To enhance and sustain the project ’s interventions in the MKD, the government may wish to extend the closing date for
                         around one year to support a few additional rice crops in the MKD. The upcoming mission in April 2013 will discuss with MARD and concerned ministries about this possibility.
