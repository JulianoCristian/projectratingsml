{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Agriculture\n            Competitiveness Project for Vietnam were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: projects\n            designed to accommodate interventions in a wide range of\n            commodities, technologies, and value chains avoid the risk\n            of picking the wrong winners and enable considerable\n            flexibility in the face of changing market circumstances.\n            Facilitating increased private service provision, contract\n            farming, and more multi-dimensional public-private\n            collaborative initiatives in agriculture requires certain\n            types of experience and sets of soft skills which are not\n            readily available at the level of provincial (let alone\n            district) agricultural departments. Egalitarian distribution\n            of infrastructure upgrades is a natural response to social\n            and political pressures on government, yet this limits the\n            scope for synergies with other (technical, financial, etc.)\n            interventions related to agricultural value chains. Greater\n            impact may be achieved through the clustering of\n            interventions in certain locales - featuring high growth\n            potential or especially difficult circumstances. Some of the\n            most valuable results from interventions which demonstrate\n            and promote institutional or other innovations may be\n            difficult to gauge through traditional quantitative\n            indicators. Promoting complex relationships between farmer\n            organizations (FOs) and agribusiness companies should\n            normally be done in stages. Strong FOs provide the basis for\n            a more balanced partnership, in terms of negotiating prices\n            and other terms; and provide for a more efficient\n            implementation of project-related activities, including\n            communications, training, procurement, etc."}, "docdt": "2014-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
