                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project activities now have been largely completed. IDA disbursement continued increasing and reached 91.5% by the end of May 2014. The CIDA Grant already closed on
                         December 31, 2013 with the final disbursement of 97% (the undisbursed sum was around CAD 88,784). It is expected that by the end of the grace period for disbursement, IDA
                         disbursement will reach approximately 97% (there will be some US$1 million of un-disbursed funds; some of which has just been released by the central provinces after liquidating all
                         contracts). There are no major issues on fiduciary and safeguards compliance. The project is on course to meet all targets set for the various components in the Project Results
