Energy Conservation Program, which aims\n            at achieving annual savings, by the year 2010, in coal\n            equivalency, or a third of the total energy consumption in\n            Ukraine, through targeted investments. The components call\n            for: 1) Energy efficiency improvements in institutional\n            buildings, to include healthcare, educational, and cultural\n            buildings. The component will build heat meters, automate\n            substations, and include weather-stripping, and radiator\n            reflectors. Additionally, ceiling fans, faucet flow\n            restrictors, and hot water heat exchangers, will be\n            installed, along with riser balancing valves. 2) Technical\n            audits, to yield engineering estimates of the\n            buildings' present energy consumption, and provide\n            feasible retrofit actions for energy efficiency. Technical\n            designs for retrofit measures will be required, as well as\n            technical specifications for competitive bidding.\n            Substantial training will be provided. 3) Consulting\n            services for project management, to include monitoring and\n            evaluation, and, to develop training modules for energy\n            efficiency measures. An awareness campaign will be\n            developed, and training programs included. Consultants will\n            review regulations for social assistance support, and\n            strengthen communications, through computerization\n            provision. 4) Financial audits, to cover incremental audit costs."}, "docdt": "1999-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
