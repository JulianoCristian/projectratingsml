The\n            project design was simplified in order to minimize project\n            risks and improve the chances for a successful outcome in\n            the Ukrainian context which had been shown as quite\n            difficult for allowing speedy processing and implementation\n            of prior projects. The project required cooperation with a\n            number of other agencies, including the main heating utility\n            in Kiev, for ensuring the speedy commissioning and\n            successful operation of heat substations, but the\n            cooperation was less than optimal. Disbursement arrangements\n            for investment projects in Ukraine have been shown to slow\n            down project implementation and therefore urgently need to\n            be improved. Flexibility and adaptation to changes in the\n            project environment helped the Bank and the implementing\n            agency overcome impediments, improve the project\n            implementing arrangements and achieve the project\n            development objectives in a more effective way. Properly\n            maintained and operating heat substations and energy\n            measuring equipment is essential for ensuring that energy\n            savings will be continued in the future. When it was time to\n            operate the new heat substations in the project public\n            buildings, there were problems to receive adequate heat\n            because the main heat supplier in Kiev, Kievenergo,\n            restricted the flow rate and undersupplied heat to the new\n            heat substations by not supplying district heating water\n            with temperature levels that met the design temperature levels."}, "docdt": "2005-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
