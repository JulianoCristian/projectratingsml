No attention was paid to devices that measure hot and\n            cold water consumption, gas, or heating. The reason is\n            simple: during Soviet times, energy was so cheap that it\n            wasn't necessary to monitor its use. Since Ukraine\n            became a market economy and suddenly had to deal with abrupt\n            increases in the price of energy, the need arose to\n            radically change public consciousness regarding energy\n            efficiency. Given the low living standards of the\n            population, it was virtually impossible to raise prices for\n            communal services. So administrative and public institutions\n            - including schools, hospitals, kindergartens and the like -\n            took the lead. They needed to learn energy conservation\n            since previously control over the consumption of heating and\n            water in such places was almost nonexistent. The first\n            serious attempt to resolve this problem in Ukraine was made\n            in the City of Kyiv. The World Bank helped this endeavor\n            become reality through the Kyiv Public Buildings Energy\n            Efficiency Project (\"the Project\") over a period\n            of five years, from August 2000 to July 2005. The Kyiv City\n            State Administration (KCSA) and the Swedish International\n            Development Authority (SIDA) also took part in the project\n            on a partnership basis. The importance of the Project was\n            that its goals and tasks ran parallel to those outlined by\n            the State Complex Program for Energy Conservation, developed\n            by the Ukrainian government in 1996. The main goal of the\n            Project was to enhance the level of energy efficiency of\n            public buildings through technical improvements and a\n            rational pricing policy for heating. The Project was also\n            aimed at promoting the development of the local energy\n            conservation market and related service industries that only\n            began operating in Ukraine at that time."}, "docdt": "2006-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
