Lessons learned include: integrated delivery\n            of these services is highly relevant for Afghanistan, where\n            the coverage is poor and mortality among children is high\n            due to water-borne diseases. Scaling up these services is\n            equally important and urgent. However, in Afghanistan,\n            unless the capacity of Government and other institutions is\n            built to operate effectively and the decentralization\n            approach continues to be strengthened, scaling up will not\n            happen. Furthermore, the demonstrated success of\n            community-based maintenance systems under the project needs\n            to be consolidated and scaled up. When a country is\n            transiting from an emergency reconstruction phase to a\n            well-advanced development phase, the challenge is to balance\n            quick delivery of services and sustainability. Similarly, in\n            the case of the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF)\n            RWSSP, the challenge was to balance the conflict between\n            sustainability and the need to provide services quickly to\n            the provinces. Unless this transition is clearly\n            communicated by the Government, emergency reconstruction\n            will be given higher priority than sustainability. Delayed\n            project start-up could have been avoided if recruitment of\n            key staff, such as the project manager, had been done\n            upfront. The long lead time is important for countries whose\n            security situation is not stable. Risk is inherently high in\n            the post-conflict period in Afghanistan. Thus, Bank\n            management's expectations need to be adjusted in line\n            with what can be reasonably achieved through such process\n            oriented projects. Implementation procedures should be\n            simplified, flexible enough to accommodate operational\n            effectiveness of institutions and specific implementation needs."}, "docdt": "2010-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
