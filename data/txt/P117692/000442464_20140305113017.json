risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: development\n            policy operations (DPO) is an important instrument to\n            facilitate dialogue on structural reforms in combination\n            with macro advice, technical assistance, and investments\n            provided by complementary sector specific operations.\n            Providing continuous support for implementation of the\n            reform agenda is essential in an environment of low\n            government capacity. Ensuring availability of information on\n            a regular basis is important for monitoring progress towards\n            the program objectives. The indicators should be available\n            through the public domain (that is websites of national\n            statistical agency, ministry of finance, Central Bank, and\n            other government agencies). As this is not possible in case\n            of Tajikistan (and, likely in case of most low income\n            countries), the list of clearly defined indicators\n            (including information required for monitoring of the\n            adequacy of the macro-framework) with the frequency of their\n            reporting should be agreed with the Borrower as a part of\n            the negotiation package for each operation."}, "docdt": "2014-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
