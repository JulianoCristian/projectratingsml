Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
Key development issues 
 
Tajikistan has been badly affected by the 2008/09 global economic crisis.
 
The economy, which had 
been growing strongly during from 2000
–
08, grew by an estimated 3.4 percent in 2009, due to a sharp 
decline in remittances and a fall in exports of cotton and aluminum.  Remittances, which accounted for 
nearly 47 percent of gross national product (GDP) in 2008, declined in 2009 by nearly 31 percent from 
US$2.4 billion in 2008 to US$1.6 billion in 2009 (see Figure 1).  Exports of goods and services fell by 
18.3 percent, due to lower international prices of cotton and aluminum.  Revenues (excluding grants) 
diminished substantially from 2008 levels.  At the same time, expenditures rose to provide essential 
services to the population and to returning migrants who have lost their jobs abroad rose.  Budget support 
from development partners helped to make up the revenue shortfall, resulting in an overall fiscal deficit in 
2009 of 
–0.5.  While affected by the global economic downturn, Tajikistan’s performance was better than 
that of any other country in the region, and significantly exceeded expectations at the start of 2009.   
The macroeconomic situation remains satisfactory, according to a recent Bank economic 
assessment
.
An IMF mission in April 2010 found that performance under the program at end-December 
2009 was broadly satisfactory with seven out of eight quantitative performance criteria met, social 
spending broadly on track with pension arrears settled in December 2009, and good progress on structural 
reforms, including measures to strengthen governance at the National Bank of Tajikistan and completing 
the write-off of cotton debt.  For 2010, the government targets a modest widening of the overall fiscal 
deficit excluding externally financed investment to 1 percent of GDP in 2010, from 0.5 percent of GDP in 
2009.  This will allow further increases in social expenditures, including on health and education, while 
also allowing the government to progress with its public investment program (PIP).  Over the medium-

term, there is a need for fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt accumulated in response to the 
economic crisis and to accommodate the costs of recapitalizing the NBT.  The Bank is committed to 
helping the government maintain fiscal sustainability through budget support.  The Bank and the IMF are 
carrying out regular economic monitoring and advising the government on options for maintaining sound 
fiscal management in the current environment.   
To minimize the potentially negative impact on the economy of the global economic crisis, the 
authorities are pursuing macroeconomic policies aimed at maintaining external stability.
 
The 
authorities are targeting an overall deficit (excluding the PIP) of 1.0 percent of GDP in 2010, and plan to 
gradually reduce this to -0.5 by 2014.  To achieve the overall fiscal deficit target, the authorities are 
deferring domestically-financed capital spending for all but the highest priority projects.  
Access to 
concessional finance from donors 
would help the government expand fiscal expenditures without 
driving up inflation and domestic interest rates, both of which would blunt the benefits of expansionary 
fiscal policy.   
Tajikistan achieved substantial welfare improvements between 2003 and 2007.

However, 
Tajikistan remains a country with widespread poverty.  
The poverty headcount declined from 72 
percent in 2003 to 54 percent in 2007 (from 74 percent to 55 percent in rural areas, and from 69 percent to 
49 percent in urban areas), using the absolute poverty line derived from the 2007 Tajikistan Living 
Standards Survey.
2
Under this poverty line, about 1 million people escaped absolute poverty between 
2003 and 2007.  The incidence of extreme poverty declined from 42 percent in 2003 to 17 percent in 
2007.  The decline in extreme poverty has been more rapid in rural areas.  However, 75 percent of the 
poor in 2007 lived in rural areas (as did 71 percent of the extreme poor).  Subjective measures of welfare 
and the data on possession of durable goods also confirm that between 2003 and 2007 living standards in 
Tajikistan improved noticeably. 
 
The welfare improvements between 2003 and 2007 were related primarily to rising migration and 
remittances, and migration for temporary work abroad, has become one of the key strategies for 
households to cope with poverty.
 
In 2007 about 25 percent of households had at least one member 
working abroad.  Remittances from migrant workers account for as much as 35 percent of household 
income, and for an even larger percent of income of households in the lower deciles of the consumption 
distribution.  Some 96 percent of migrants travel to Russia, and of those, 55 percent work in the 
construction sector, and another 30 percent are employed in various low-skill jobs.  The expected 
reduction in migration and remittances due to the global economic downturn is therefore likely to have 
resulted in increased poverty levels, vulnerability, and income inequality (see box 1).   
Working poor make up a substantial proportion of people living in poverty.  
Half of the people 
working in Tajikistan are poor, a majority of whom work in agriculture.  Low labor incomes and high 
prevalence of temporary work arrangements, informality (no labor contract), and unpaid work are the 
main reasons there are so many working poor.  Some 58 percent of households headed by an agricultural 
laborer are poor and 16.3 percent are extreme poor, which is worse than the national average.  Households 
self employed in agriculture are not much better off; about 53 percent of such households are poor and 19 
percent are extremely poor.  The high rate of poverty among agricultural households is worrisome, given 
that agricultural accounts for 45 percent of domestic employment in Tajikistan.

Using the purchasing power poverty line US$2.15 per day, the poverty headcount declined from 64 percent in 
2003 to 41 percent in 2007.  The absolute poverty line derived in 2007 is equal to 139 somoni per month.

The proposed new series follows the successful completion in 2009 of the first programmatic series 
of three operations
.
Under the first series the government pursued a program of reforms aimed at 
increasing the competitiveness of the private sector, at strengthening public sector management, and at 
improving the delivery of services.  Despite setbacks and delays, the reform program resulted in 
measurable improvements in a number of areas.  Specifically, the regulatory burden to businesses of 
dealing with licenses and inspections fell, access to Tajikistan by air increased, the effectiveness of the 
government in Tajikistan improved, and the financial viability of Barki-Tajik and Tajik Gas increased and 
efficiency of energy services improved.  Reforms in the financing of health and education are also 
expected over time to result in greater efficiency in delivery of services.  Details of the reform program 
and its outcomes are presented in the March 2010 Implementation Completion and Results Report for the 
previous series.

Rationale for Bank involvement 
The Bank’s involvement in supporting the reform program will be valuable for several reasons.  
First, the Bank’s experience with implementing far-reaching reform programs in post-conflict 
countries, other countries of the former Soviet Union, and in Tajikistan itself, will help the 
government to articulate a reform program that is realistic and that will be effective in achieving 
its objectives.  This program draws heavily on the first DPL series. Second, the Bank’s 
experience in working in partnership with other development partners will help the government 
to mobilize technical and financial assistance to design and implement reforms which are 
necessary for post crisis recovery and growth.  Third, the Bank will be able to bring substantial 
financial resources to the effort, facilitating sound fiscal management. 
2. Proposed Objectives 
 
The development objectives of the proposed Fourth Programmatic Development Policy 
Operation are to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, s
upport reforms in 
the medium term aimed at promoting sustained economic recovery, growth, and poverty reduction
.
3. Preliminary Description 
 
The proposed programmatic development policy operations 4
–6
are central elements of the Bank’s 
Country Partnership Strategy, scheduled for presentation to the Bank’s Executive Board of Directors on 
May 25, 2010.
 
The strategic objectives of the draft CPS are: (a) reducing the negative impact of the crisis 
on poverty and vulnerability, and (b) paving the way for sustained post-crisis recovery and sustained 
development.  The proposed PDPO 4–6 will support both these objectives.  The first operation will help 
the government finance social expenditures to meet the needs of the poor and vulnerable.  The second and 
third operations will focus on supporting reforms in the medium term aimed at promoting sustained 
economic recovery, growth, and poverty reduction.  The reforms will complement the Bank’s ongoing 
and planned investment projects in public administration, public financial management, agriculture, 
energy, education, and health.  The development policy operation will serve as the Bank’s primary 
vehicle for engaging in policy dialogue with the government.  It will also help in furthering discussions 
with other development partners in how best to align support for the government’s development agenda.

4. Environment Aspects 
 
The conclusion of an environmental screening of the proposed reforms, undertaken as per the 
requirements of OP 8.60, is that the reforms are not likely to be significant from an 
environmental point of view.  The project raises no issues with respect to social safeguards.
