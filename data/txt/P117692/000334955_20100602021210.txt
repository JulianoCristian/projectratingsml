                           Window resources (US$25.4 million equivalent)
Operation Type             The proposed development policy grant is a programmatic series of three
                           single-tranche development policy operations.
Main policy areas          The proposed program is divided into three areas, each with several areas
                           of focus:
                           Policy area 1: Protecting Delivery of Basic Services within a
                           Sustainable Fiscal Framework
                             Maintaining or increasing budget allocation for health, education,
                                and social protection services
                           Policy area 2: Improving the Environment for Private Sector
                           Development:
                             Streamlining business regulations
                             Strengthening the financial sector
                             Modernizing aviation services
                             Reforming agriculture institutions

                             Enhancing transparency of state-owned enterprises
Key outcome indicators       Utilization of primary health centers in selected rayons is maintained
                                 at no less than 2008 levels
                             Efficiency of expenditure for education improves
                             The cost and time of starting a business and of dealing with
                                 construction permits declines
                             Access to formal financial services increases
                             Access to Tajikistan by air improves
                             Farmers gain control over farm management
                             Effectiveness of the government in Tajikistan improves
                             Transparency of budget formation and execution improved.
Program development        The development objectives of the proposed PDPG 4­6 are to protect
objectives and             basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the
contribution to Country    foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The proposed operation
Partnership Strategy       is a central element of the Country Partnership Strategy presented to the
                           Board in fiscal 2010.
Risks and risk             The implementation of the proposed reform program faces four major
mitigation                 risks related to (a) general macroeconomic risks, (b) risks related to poor
                           governance, (c) program specific risks, and (d) other structural risks. The
                           program contains measures to mitigate these risks.

                                    1.     INTRODUCTION

1.       The proposed operation is the first of a new programmatic series of three
development policy operations consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
approved by the Board on May 25, 2010. The development objectives of the proposed PDPG
4­6 are to protect basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation
for post-crisis recovery and growth. The series combines actions to mitigate the impact of the
economic crisis by protecting core spending on health, education, and social safety nets and to
continue with structural reforms. PDPG 4 focuses on protecting the gains made under PDPG 1­3
and hence includes budget allocations for the social sectors as prior actions. However, PDPG 5­6
will (flexibly, since the duration of crisis impact is not known) increasingly emphasize structural
reforms. Specifically, to protect basic services, PDPG 4 will support the ring-fencing of
expenditures for health, education, and social protection services at no less than 2009 levels.
PDPG 5 and 6 will support reforms to improve the efficiency and targeting of social expenditures.
To promote post-crisis recovery and growth, the series will support reforms to improve the
investment climate by reducing the regulatory burden on business, strengthen the financial sector,
liberalize the aviation sector to foster Tajikistan's links to the regional and global economies, and
restructure farmland and promote farmer control over management and agricultural
diversification. In addition, the series will continue the governance reforms initiated under the
previous series to enhance public sector effectiveness, strengthen public financial management,
and enhance accountability and performance of state-owned energy utilities. The first operation
under the new series will provide SDR 16.9 million, including SDR 5.7 million in Pilot Crisis
Response Window resources (US$25.4 million equivalent) in budget support. The second and
third operations will provide US$10 million equivalent each. Support for mitigation of the crisis
is complementary with crisis support provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
European Commission (EC), and the Asian Development Bank.

                               2.        COUNTRY CONTEXT

2.      Tajikistan is a small economy in Central Asia with 6.7 million inhabitants and a per
capita income of US$600 in 2008.1 The economy, which has been growing strongly (8.6 percent
annually from 2000­08) depends heavily on exports of cotton and hydroelectricity (including for
aluminum processing), and on growing remittances of migrants.

3.      Tajikistan's economy performed strongly in the decade following the end of the civil
war. Following the end to a prolonged civil war that started in 1991 shortly after independence
from the Soviet Union and ended in mid-1997, the government followed a sound macroeconomic
policy and pursued a program of structural reforms aimed at reducing the role of the state in the
economy and stimulating private sector investment. The reforms succeeded in stabilizing the

                                                 1
economy. Macroeconomic performance was characterized by declining inflation (from 30­40
percent during 1998­2001 to 6­7 percent during 2004­05), fiscal balance, much reduced external
debt, and a manageable current account deficit. The policy reforms--in combination with the
restarting of production at farms and factories idled during the war--resulted in real GDP growth
of an average of nearly 9 percent between 2000 and 2008.

4.       Growth has been driven largely by a favorable external environment, including
strong growth in Russia resulting in rising demand for Tajik labor which in turn led to
growth in remittances. Growth has also resulted from recovery in capacity utilization,
primarily in agriculture. Government responded appropriately to the opportunities offered by
Russia's growth, forging an agreement with Russia to allow visa-free access to that country for
Tajik workers. The sound macroeconomic management and strong growth was accompanied by
greater diversification of the economy as reflected in a decline in the combined share of
aluminum and cotton in total value added (to about 78 percent in 2007 from about 85 percent in
2004). Nevertheless, Tajikistan remains highly exposed to external developments, including
shifts in global prices of key exports (aluminum and cotton) and imports (oil and gas), and
changes in the labor market in Russia.

5.       As gains related to recovery from the civil conflict are exhausted, sustaining growth
will require deeper reforms, increased private investment, and greater integration with the
regional and global economies. Without deeper reforms, Tajikistan is not likely to be able to
sustain the high growth rates that prevailed during most of the past ten years. Tajikistan has the
least diversified economy of any low-income country outside of Sub-Saharan African. Exports of
aluminum and of cotton comprise about 78 percent of the country's exports, which is the least
diversified export sector of any country in the region aside from Turkmenistan. The heavy
reliance on remittances and aluminum processing as a source of foreign exchange is not only
unsustainable, but also underscores Tajikistan's vulnerability to shocks in foreign labor markets.
A sudden drop in remittance could have serious consequences for its macroeconomic stability, as
has been demonstrated by the recent global crisis (see Box 1 and Figure 1). Despite strong
growth in the past decade, Tajikistan remains a low saving and investment economy. Gross
capital formation as a share of GDP is very low by international standards.

6.      Structural reforms have not been deep enough to stimulate private sector
investment, which is essential to diversify the economy and to create jobs. Private sector
investment has remained at a low 6 percent of GDP since the early 2000s. Despite reducing the
burden of licenses and inspections on businesses, Tajikistan remains a relatively unattractive
country in which to invest in comparison with other countries. Since both domestic savings and
the government's capacity to borrow are low, Tajikistan will have to attract foreign direct
investment for investment capital.

7.      Tajikistan is weakly integrated into the global economy. Export earnings have been
stagnant during 2000­09 and are concentrated in just two sectors: processing of raw aluminum
(essentially, an export of hydroelectricity), and cotton. High transportation costs, a weak
financial sector, and burdensome trade-related regulations all contribute to low global and
regional integration. The landlocked position of the state and the problems with rail traffic
through neighboring countries also plays a role.

8.      Macroeconomic management deteriorated significantly in 2007. The authorities
revealed in October 2007 that the National Bank of Tajikistan (the central bank) had guaranteed
or pledged nearly all the country's reserves as collateral for loans ostensibly for cotton financing.
In addition, the NBT provided domestic credits equivalent to about 8 percent of GDP to Kredit


                                                 2
Invest, thereby expanding the supply of base money almost threefold. Inflation accelerated to
almost 20 percent at the end of 2007. Trade and current account deficits and public debt rose
sharply. The increase in inflation and widening of the trade deficit are attributable to both supply
side shocks (higher fuel and food prices) and the very strong growth of aggregate demand which
has been fuelled by expansionary monetary policies. External debt distress reemerged due to
heavy external borrowing and the aforementioned loan guarantees, putting pressure on fiscal
management.

            Box 1: Trends in Remittances and Their Impact on Macroeconomic Indicators

Labor migration and associated remittances to Tajikistan have become an important and integral part of
growth, poverty reduction, and development in Tajikistan. Remittance flows to Tajikistan rose by a factor
of 5 between 2004­2008, overtaking exports and foreign direct investments by many times. The value of
remittances was 17 times that of total foreign direct investment in 2009. Remittances exceeded the value of
exports by 300 percent in 2008, and by over 200 percent 2009.

Driven largely by the booming Russian economy, remittances grew at a staggering 60 percent year before
peaking in 2008 at a US$2.3 billion or over 46 percent of the country's GDP. However, in 2009
remittances fell by over 30 percent from 2008 levels to about US$1.6 billion (or around 33 percent of the
GDP) as a result of the global slowdown that affected Russia particularly severely.

Remittances have been critical to Tajikistan's recent economic growth and reduction in the number of
people living in poverty. Remittances finance primarily consumption, so effect on poverty is substantial.
Remittance-fueled consumption has led to rising imports, which reached US$2.8 billion by 2009 or over 60
percent of GDP. They have also contributed to revenues, due to the value added taxes imposed on imports.
While down in 2009, remittances proved to be critical in mitigating the impact of the global crisis on
Tajikistan, providing much needed foreign exchange and slowing depreciation of the national currency.

The importance of remittances to Tajikistan's economy should not distract the authorities from urgent
reforms to attract more private sector investment--and jobs--to the country. The PDPG 4­6 includes a
number of measures achieve this objective.

9.      To tackle the impending macroeconomic crisis, the authorities in late 2007
requested the IMF to establish a new program. The Fund agreed on a Staff Monitored
Program in May 2008 that provided the authorities with an opportunity to build a track record in
support of a request for a new financial arrangement with the Fund. The aim of the program was
to reestablish the credibility of the authorities by addressing the governance and management
problems at the NBT and to provide a framework for macroeconomic stability. The program was

successfully completed in 2009 and a new arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility put
into place.

10.      Macroeconomic indicators strengthened in 2008. Inflation receded significantly,
helped by the recent decline in international food and fuel prices. The trade deficit declined and
the balance of payments registered a surplus because of slowing demand for consumer goods,
falling prices of imported fuel and food, and improved fiscal and monetary policies.

11.     Tajikistan achieved substantial welfare improvements between 2003 and 2007, but
poverty remains widespread. 2 The poverty headcount declined from 72 percent in 2003 to 54
percent in 2007 (from 74 percent to 55 percent in rural areas, and from 69 percent to 49 percent in
urban areas), using the absolute poverty line derived from the 2007 Tajikistan Living Standards
Survey.3 Under this poverty line, about 1 million people escaped absolute poverty between 2003
and 2007. The incidence of extreme poverty declined from 42 percent in 2003 to 17 percent in
2007. The decline in extreme poverty has been more rapid in rural areas. However, 75 percent of
the poor in 2007 still lived in rural areas (as did 71 percent of the extreme poor). Subjective
measures of welfare and the data on possession of durable goods also confirm that between 2003
and 2007 living standards in Tajikistan improved noticeably.

12.      The welfare improvements between 2003 and 2007 were related primarily to rising
migration and remittances. Migration for temporary work abroad has become one of the key
strategies for households to cope with poverty. In 2007 about 25 percent of households had at
least one member working abroad. Remittances from migrant workers account for as much as 35
percent of household income, and for an even larger percent of income of households in the lower
deciles of the consumption distribution. Some 96 percent of migrants travel to Russia, and of

  Using the purchasing power poverty line US$2.15 per day, the poverty headcount declined from 64
percent in 2003 to 41 percent in 2007. The absolute poverty line derived in 2007 is equal to 139 somoni
per month.

those, 55 percent work in the construction sector and another 30 percent are employed in various
low-skill jobs. The expected reduction in migration and remittances due to the global economic
downturn is therefore likely to have resulted in increased poverty levels, vulnerability, and
income inequality.

13.     Working poor make up a substantial proportion of people living in poverty. Half of
the people working in Tajikistan are poor, a majority of whom work in agriculture. Low labor
incomes and high prevalence of temporary work arrangements, informality (no labor contract),
and unpaid work are the main reasons there are so many working poor. Some 58 percent of
households headed by an agricultural laborer are poor and 16.3 percent are extreme poor, which
is worse than the national average. Households self employed in agriculture are not much better
off; about 53 percent of such households are poor and 19 percent are extremely poor. The high
rate of poverty among agricultural households is worrisome, given that about 45 percent of
people working in Tajikistan are employed in agriculture.4

14.      Food insecurity continues to be a problem for many households. At the time the
household survey was undertaken in October­November 2007, about 24 percent of respondents
reported that their intake of food was inadequate. Among the poorest quintile, 44 percent stated
that they did not have enough food. This finding is alarming, given that seasonal access to food is
relatively high in October and November, and reaches its lows February through April.

15.     Social indicators (primary and secondary school enrollment rates, infant mortality,
maternal mortality ratio, and child malnutrition), have improved following post-
independence declines, but are again at risk of deterioration. Tajikistan is the only country in
Europe and Central Asian Region unlikely to achieve most of its Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs).5 The combination of external shocks and long-term structural issues are putting
pressure on the government to raise expenditures to safeguard recent gains in social welfare and
to promote growth.

                             B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

16.        Tajikistan has been badly affected by the 2008/09 global economic crisis. The
economy, which had been growing strongly during from 2000­08, grew by an estimated 3.4
percent in 2009, due to a sharp decline in remittances and a fall in exports of cotton and
aluminum. Remittances, which reached an amount equivalent to nearly 47 percent of gross
national product (GDP) in 2008, declined in 2009 by nearly 31 percent from US$2.4 billion in
2008 to US$1.6 billion in 2009 (see figure 1). Exports of goods and services fell by 18.3 percent,
due to lower international prices of cotton and aluminum. Revenues (excluding grants)
diminished substantially from 2008 levels. At the same time, expenditures rose to provide
essential services to the population and to returning migrants who lost their jobs abroad rose.
Budget support from development partners helped to make up the revenue shortfall, resulting in
an overall fiscal deficit in 2009 of 0.5. While affected by the global economic downturn,
Tajikistan's performance was better than that of all other countries in the region aside from
Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and significantly exceeded expectations at the start of 2009.

     According to official statistics in Tajikistan published by Goskomstat, in 2008 agriculture accounted
for 67 percent of employment.

17.       Private savings declined sharply while public savings remained stable. Private
savings, which had been growing steadily, from 2.4 percent of GDP in 2006 to 6.0 percent of
GDP in 2008, fell to 1.0 in 2009 due to the decline in employment and remittances. Public
savings remained stable at about 8 percent of GDP over the same period. As the global economy
recovers and employment picks up, private savings are projected to rise to 5.7 percent of GDP by
2013. Public savings are expected to decline to 6 percent of GDP by 2012.

18.        Following successful completion at the staff level of the combined first and second
reviews, the government has agreed with the IMF at the staff level on its 2010 program
under the three-year Extended Credit Facility. The IMF's Executive Board is scheduled to
consider on June 7, 2010 the authorities' request for the completion of the first and second
review. The primary objectives of the program are to (a) safeguard macroeconomic and balance
of payments stability while allowing for rising social spending needs, (b) lay the foundation for
medium-term growth and ensure that there is no build-up of external debt; and (c) accelerate
structural reforms, including by strengthening governance of public sector institutions and by
enhancing the role of the private sector. Upon approval, SDR 39.2 (about US$57.8 million) will
be made available to Tajikistan. This would bring the total disbursement under the arrangement
so far to SDR 65.3 million (about US$97.7 million). The Bank is collaborating closely with the
Fund to ensure that the crisis support of each complements that of the other.

19.       The macroeconomic situation remains satisfactory, according to a recent Bank
economic assessment. An IMF mission in April 2010 found that performance under the program
at end-December 2009 was broadly satisfactory with six out of eight quantitative performance
criteria met, social spending broadly on track with pension arrears settled in December 2009, and
good progress on structural reforms, including measures to strengthen governance at the NBT and
completing the write-off of cotton debt. For 2010, the government targets a modest widening of
the overall fiscal deficit excluding externally financed investment to 1 percent of GDP in 2010,
from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2009. This will allow further increases in social expenditures,
including on health and education, while also allowing the government to progress with its public
investment program (PIP). Over the medium-term, there is a need for fiscal consolidation to
reduce public debt accumulated in response to the economic crisis and to accommodate the costs
of recapitalizing the NBT. The Bank is committed to helping the government maintain fiscal
sustainability through budget support. The Bank and the IMF are carrying out regular economic
monitoring and advising the government on options for maintaining sound fiscal management
during the current economic crisis.

20.        GDP is projected to grow by 4 percent in 2010. Following a steep decline,
remittances are again growing, increasing by 14 percent during January/February 2010 over the
same period in 2009. In addition, exports grew by 42 percent year-on-year in January/February.
Electricity supply was much more reliable in the first months of 2010 than in 2009, and industry
is growing again for the first time in over a year.

21.        Inflation averaged 6.5 percent in 2009 compared with the 2008 average of 20.4
percent. The trade deficit declined in 2009 to 38.7 percent of GDP from 53.2 percent of GDP in
2008, due to the global declines in prices of imported fuel and food, to reduced domestic demand,
and to a currency depreciation aimed at making Tajikistan's exports more competitive. The
overall fiscal deficit (excluding externally-financed investment) widened to 0.5 from a surplus of
1.4 percent of GDP in 2008. Tax revenue collection strengthened in the second half of the year,
and exceeded revised post crisis projections for 2009 as a whole, but amounted to only 17.6
percent of GDP, 1.2 percentage points lower than in 2008. This was complemented by additional
budget support from the Asian Development Bank, EC, and the World Bank. However,


                                                6
expenditures, particularly for social services, rose even more strongly than revenues, resulting in
the fiscal deficit. Disbursements of concessional external financing for public investment
projects were as planned, leading to an overall fiscal deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP, down slightly
from the 2008 level of 5.5 percent of GDP.

22.        To minimize the potentially negative impact of the global economic crisis, the
authorities are pursuing macroeconomic policies aimed at maintaining external stability.
The authorities are targeting an overall deficit (excluding the PIP) of 1.0 percent of GDP in 2010,
and plan to gradually reduce this to 0.5 by 2014. To achieve the overall fiscal deficit target, the
authorities are deferring domestically-financed capital spending for all but the highest priority
projects. Access to concessional finance from donors would help the government expand fiscal
expenditures without driving up inflation and domestic interest rates, both of which would blunt
the benefits of an expansionary fiscal policy.

             Box 2: Poverty and Macroeconomic Impact of Roghun Financing Campaign

In December 2009, the authorities announced the sale of 25 percent of the state-owned enterprise
Roghun hydropower plant to the public (US$350 million or 6.5 percent of 2010 GDP). The
government regards the project as vital to ensure a constant supply of energy to serve the entire country. In
January alone, the campaign raised US$150 million (3 percent of GDP, more than the 2009 income tax),
but subscriptions have since slowed.

The government's Roghun campaign was not poverty neutral. Using data from the 2007 Tajikistan
living standards Survey, the Bank team concluded that the poverty headcount rate may increase by 2.2
percentage points in 2010 on account of the equity financing campaign, while the incidence of extreme
poverty may rise by 0.8 percentage points. The following assumptions were made under the baseline
scenario: (a) the government collects 1 billion somoni by the end of 2010, (b) 59 percent of this amount
will be financed by the households; (c) households contribute to the Roghun project an equal proportion of
their consumption.

The impact on poverty is sensitive to contributions by households' consumption levels; the higher the
contributions from the top quintiles the lower the poverty impact. If the households from highest
consumption quintile contribute 64 percent of total capital raised by households then the national poverty
rate increases only 1.3 percent. However, if all households contributed equally, the national poverty
headcount increases 2.7 percent.

The IMF estimated that the Roghun fundraising campaign had a negative impact on macroeconomic
performance. Consequently, the IMF projection on 2010 real GDP growth was lowered from 5 to 4
percent. In addition, the IMF highlighted a key shortcoming of the campaign related to funds being are
raised in somoni, whereas the project had an estimated US$500­800 million in foreign exchange needs.
Thus, the campaign closes the fiscal financing gap, but does not address the external financing needs.

In mid-April, the IMF mission reached a staff-level agreement with the Tajik authorities on their
2010 program, based on government agreement to stop active advertising of the Roghun equity sales
scheme and to limit the subscriptions to low levels. The government's willingness to undertake an
external audit of the Roghun project's financial statements and to provide regular reports to the public on
the use of funds also helped in reaching agreement with the IMF. The IMF also expects the government to
cooperate with the World Bank on the Roghun project, in particular the ongoing techno-economic, social,
and environmental impact assessments.

23.        The authorities have adopted a flexible exchange rate regime, which has
facilitated external adjustment and returned the current account deficit to a more
sustainable level. The exchange rate depreciated by 22 percent between January and July 2009



                                                     7
and has since stabilized. With a flexible exchange rate, the current account deficit declined to
about 7.3 percent of GDP in 2009, from 7.7 percent in 2008. International reserves grew to 1.4
months of imports in 2009, up from 1.1 month of imports in 2008. Assistance from the IMF is
expected to strengthen the country's balance of payments position and build international reserves
to reach 1.8 months of imports by 2012.

24.        The authorities are concerned about vulnerabilities in the banking system. A
number of banks faced severe funding problems towards the end of 2008 due to some large firms
drawing down their deposits, reductions in trade credits, and declines in advances for remittances.
Nonperforming loans have steadily risen in 2008­10 due to two factors. First, the global
economic downturn has lowered domestic and international demand for the output and services of
Tajik firms. Second, the Ministry of Finance credit lines to banks for lending to agriculture
(primarily cotton), which historically have a poor loan repayment record, have performed poorly,
with a significant amount now in arrears. The large depreciation of the somoni has also put
pressure on banks, because debtors with U.S. dollar-denominated loans (about 56 percent of
outstanding loans) do not necessarily have foreign exchange income, and some are unable to
service their loans. Falling remittances in 2009 also made it difficult for households and small
businesses to service their loans. As a result, bank balance sheets have deteriorated and liquidity
has been constrained. In response, most banks have started to raise deposit rates and constrained
credit growth. In addition, the NBT has provided liquidity loans, mainly in somoni. In response
to a request from the NBT, the World Bank is providing technical assistance on crisis
management and contingency planning, as well as a legal framework for bank resolution.
However, weaknesses also remain in the regulatory framework, in bank supervision, and in
enforcement of prudential norms. To help limit the risk of a banking crisis in Tajikistan, the
authorities need to further strengthen the regulatory requirements, intensify supervision, and
enforce prudential requirements. They also need to have plans in place to move swiftly and
boldly to stem potential contagion in case of a bank failure. The priorities are to improve the
liquidity position of the banks and to curb the impairment of their assets.

                 C. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

25.        Tajikistan's medium-term outlook depends on external developments and on
policy reforms to improve the investment climate and address governance concerns. Real
GDP growth is expected to rebound in line with global trends and can return to the high levels of
the recent past if the government undertakes reforms to strengthen the investment climate and to
improve public sector performance. The measures being pursued for sound macroeconomic
management will help. Reforms being undertaken to ensure the soundness of the financial sector
will assist in broadening access to services, including for agricultural finance. Better managing
existing energy infrastructure in addition to new investments to eliminate periodic energy
shortages and expand access will improve the investment climate and encourage entrepreneurs to
produce goods for the domestic and external markets. Measures to promote the diversification of
the rural economy--including through an efficient and fair resolution to the cotton debt, further
restructuring of farms into independent family and individual units, and issuing land use
certificates to secure the rights of rural land users--will assist in unlocking Tajikistan's potential
of non-cotton agriculture and the many related agribusinesses ranging from storage to processing
to transportation. Improving the governance of all state owned enterprises has the potential to
greatly enhance the public finances.

26.       Tajikistan's growth prospects for the medium term depend on further
diversification of agricultural output and exports. Tajikistan's high dependence on a few



                                                  8
     export products and on remittances makes it highly vulnerable to external shocks. Further
     diversifying the economy will require reforms that promote private sector investment, including
     reducing the regulatory burden on business, improving access to finance, and allowing farmers
     the freedom to choose which crops to grow and where to market them (non-cotton agriculture
     increased its share in total exports from essentially nil in 2004 to 4 percent in 2007, while cotton's
     share fell from 21 percent to 17 percent over the same period). Fostering private sector
     investment will lead to greater productivity in the economy and to more diverse exports, essential
     to generate growth in the future.

     27.       Tajikistan's medium-term fiscal outlook is tight. The scope for further reduction in
     expenditures is limited if Tajikistan is to both maintain social expenditures and reinvigorate
     growth through investments in infrastructure and energy. Including the public investment
     program, the deficit is expected to be maintained at about 5.0 percent of GDP during 2011­13 to
     accommodate investments in infrastructure, especially energy. Excluding the public investment
     program the fiscal deficit is expected to average about 1.0 percent of GDP over the same period
     (see Table 1).

at least US$116 million in 2010 and at least US$209 million in 2011. The IMF under the
Extended Credit Facility provided financial support of US$40 million in 2009 and projects
disbursement of US$57.8 million in 2010. The financing needs for the budget are expected to be
met through budget support from other donors, including the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, and the EC. With this, Tajikistan's external position remains vulnerable to a
worsening of the external environment.

29.         Tajikistan remains at high risk of debt distress. The joint IMF-World Bank debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted in 2009 and a DSA update in March 2010 carried out by
Fund staff show that Tajikistan's risk of debt distress remains high. However, the revised DSA
shows improved debt sustainability when including remittances in the calculations of the debt
indicators, with only the extreme shock scenario breaching the respective thresholds. Still,
Tajikistan remains at high risk of debt distress, given that in a DSA without remittances, there are
prolonged breaches of the policy thresholds. In particular, debt-to-export ratio significantly
exceeds the threshold throughout the projected period, and debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the
threshold during 2014­2019, albeit marginally. In addition, in 2009, debt service-to-exports
indicator breaches the threshold, because of a one-time early repayment of past contingent
liabilities by the NBT. See annex 6 for details of the DSA update.

30.        Compared to the previous DSA, debt indicators (without remittances) have
worsened. The worsening is due mainly to additional external borrowing to finance Roghun, as
well as a lower discount rate applied in the DSA. Other effects come from downward revision to
growth projections, and further domestic currency depreciation.6 Alternative scenarios and stress
tests demonstrate additional vulnerabilities of debt outlook to lower GDP growth, real exchange
rate shocks, and non-concessional or new concessional borrowing. It should be noted, however,
that in the absence of a feasibility study for the Roghun hydropower plant, conservative estimates
of Roghun's impact on growth have been used in this DSA. These estimates will likely be
revised upward once the feasibility study, currently being undertaken by the World Bank, is
completed. This underscores the need for the government to exercise extreme caution in
incurring new debt, to carefully vet new large-scale investment projects, and to ensure the
efficient utilization of external resources. Sound macroeconomic policies and acceleration of
structural reforms would also be essential to maintain debt sustainability by enhancing growth
potential and safeguarding external stability.

31.       On balance Tajikistan's macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for
purposes of the proposed operation but vulnerable to policy mistakes. While Tajikistan
remains vulnerable to external shocks and to policy mistakes, the authorities have maintained a
sound macroeconomic framework since 2007 when a domestic economic crisis followed by the
global economic downturn posed serious risks to economic stability. Macroeconomic indicators
now indicate that an economic recovery is underway, which is likely to strengthen with continued
good macroeconomic management and a further strengthening in the global economy.




6
    Compared to last DSA, the discount rate was revised downwards from 5 to 4 percent to reflect new
global financial conditions.

           Box 3: Governance in Tajikistan: Challenges and Efforts to Improve Outcomes
Governance challenges

The legacy of the civil war in Tajikistan includes a complex political economy that has constrained public
sector performance, private sector investment, and social development. In the initial years, the main
priority of the government was to consolidate peace, and to gain the support of various political groups.
Little progress was made in undertaking the fundamental reforms to redefine the role of the state from
central planner and operator of productive activities to that of policymaker, regulator, and facilitator of
private sector investment. Moreover, few efforts were made to ensure that constitutionally independent
institutions of accountability, such as the judiciary and the parliament, have the capacity to perform their
accountability functions. Civil society organizations, the media, and other nongovernmental entities are
also unable to effectively act as institutions of accountability, strengthening the checks and balances in
society and on government performance. Governance in the financial sector is also weak and banking
supervision falls well below international standards. State involvement in productive enterprises has
resulted in waste, appropriation of public funds for private gain, and inefficient and outmoded industries.
Such involvement also creates obstacles for private sector investment.

This has led to poor governance outcomes in Tajikistan. Tajikistan compares poorly with other countries
of the region on accountability, control of corruption, government effectiveness, and regulatory quality
according to the Governance Research Indicator Country Snapshot of the World Bank Institute. Tajikistan
also scores poorly in other major surveys of governance, including Transparency International's Corruption
Perceptions Index, the Global Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) transition indicators dataset. Moreover, surveys undertaken
by local firms show corruption to be a problem. For example, about 60 percent of people surveyed in the
2006 survey on corruption in Tajikistan undertaken by the government and the United Nations
Development Program, said that corruption was a major problem in Tajikistan.

Government's efforts to improve governance

The government is taking action to strengthen governance both to attract private sector investment for
growth and to improve the delivery of public services. Important reforms to streamline the licensing,
inspection, and permitting regimes are expected to improve the climate for business. Restructuring the
government administration and reforming pay and incentives is aimed at promoting a more professional
civil service. Strengthening of public financial management--including enactment of a new public
procurement law, strengthening of internal audit, reform of the tax administration, and improvements in the
budget process--should increase public accountability and transparency, and, coupled with other reforms,
are expected to result in improved service delivery. Separation of the policymaking from regulatory
functions in the aviation and energy sectors, and privatization of most state-owned enterprises are expected
to improve transparency and accountability in key sectors of the economy. Implementation of a
comprehensive strategy to strengthen the financial sector will help to create a better governed financial
sector.

Support of the Bank Group and of other development partners for improved governance

The Bank Group and other development are helping to improve governance in many ways. The IFC is
helping to reform the inspections, taxation, and permitting regimes. The Public Sector Reform Project
(fiscal 2006) is supporting government efforts to restructure the public administration, improve incentives
for civil servants, and reform the management of the civil service. The Public Financial Management
Reform Project (fiscal 2009) is supporting reforms of financial management, procurement, budgeting,
auditing, and debt management. The programmatic public expenditure review and two public expenditure
tracking surveys (one for health and one for education)--have provided the basis for further dialogue on
the issues. The Cotton Sector Modernization Project (fiscal 2007), Land Cadastre Project (fiscal 2005), and
Energy Loss Reduction Project (fiscal 2005) Bank are helping to improve the transparency and
accountability of major sectors of the economy. The Bank's aviation sector study and cotton sector review
have highlighted the problems of governance in these sectors and recommended reforms that are now being



                                                    11
implemented. The Community and Basic Health Project (fiscal 2006), and its Education Modernization
Project (fiscal 2003) is helping to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of basic public
services. A grant from the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative Trust Fund has
helped to the government to prepare a medium-term strategy and time-bound action plan to implement the
high-priority recommendations of the financial sector assessment program. The assessment was carried out
jointly by the Bank and the IMF in 2007­08 and has informed the government of what needs to be done to
improve governance of bank and non-bank financial institutions.

Other development partners are also working to improve governance in Tajikistan. Switzerland and the
U.S. are helping with the licensing, inspections, and permitting regimes. Switzerland is collaborating with
the Bank to help design an independent external audit function for Tajikistan. The EC, the Asian
Development Bank, and the U.K. are supporting the implementation of aspects of the government's public
administration reform strategy and actions to strengthen public financial management. The French
government and EBRD are helping to improve the safety and performance of the aviation sector. The
Asian Development Bank, Sweden, Switzerland, the EC, the U.K., and the U.S. are involved with
improving the management of health and education services. Additional information on Bank operations
and analytical work aimed at improving governance is presented in annex 4.

Support of the PDPG programmatic series for improved governance

The PDPG 4­6 series supports governance reforms in a broad range of areas. Reforms of the permitting
regime will reduce the demands for irregular payments. Implementation of the financial management
improvement program at Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas are expected to bring transparency to their
operations. Reforming agricultural institutions, and especially strengthening rights to land, will enable
farmers to make production and marketing decision without interference from local officials. Reforms to
restructure the public service and to improve the compensation policies for civil servants and for health and
education workers will reduce the opportunities and incentives for bribes. Strengthening the budget
process, procurement, and internal and external audit will help to ensure that public resources are used as
intended. Finally, reforms of the policies determining how health, education, and social protection services
are financed and delivered will reduce the misuse of public funds and improve the services.




        3. TAJIKISTAN'S THIRD POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY AND
                         PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

32.    In February 2010 the government formally approved its Third Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS 3) for 2010­2012. Building on the first PRS for 2002­05 and the second PRS for
2007­09, the PRS 3 operationalizes the country's long-term development vision laid out in the
National Development Strategy for 2006­2015.

33.     The overarching PRS 3 objective is to promote sustainable strong economic growth
and improvements in the living standards of the population, especially of vulnerable groups.
To this end, it highlights the importance of prudent macroeconomic management, improving the
effectiveness of public spending, and strengthening the investment climate. A substantial share
of the budget is allocated for delivery of health, education, and social protection services to
ensure that the poor and vulnerable benefit from public spending. The PRS 3 will strengthen
governance of the NBT and of state owned enterprises. It will continue with reforms to improve
the efficiency of the public sector administration and to strengthen public procurement and
financial management systems. This includes adopting a competitive and affordable civil service
wage system. It will take steps to enhance the investment climate and stimulate private
investment, including by eliminating unnecessary permits, strengthening property rights,
eliminating the role of the state in agricultural decision making, and developing hydro energy



                                                     12
potential and improving other infrastructure services. The PRS 3 also gives strong emphasis to
promoting rural development, which is essential to reduce poverty. Measures include securing
access to land-use rights for small farmers, promoting equal access to land by both men and
women, enhancing agricultural research and training, and strengthening access to financial
services. The proposed PDPG 4­6 series supports reforms in each of these areas.

34.      The process of preparing the PRS 3 was participatory in spirit, but the coordination
of work varied by thematic areas. Sector working groups, comprising government officials,
civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and development partners all contributed
to the PRS 3. A coordinating group was established to oversee the process of drafting and
consultations. Regional consultations were held in the provinces. The participatory process
resulted in the government giving a higher priority to investment in health and education in the
PRS 3 than had been the case in the earlier PRSs. It also led the government to maintain a strong
focus in the PRS 3 on improving governance in the public administration and in state-owned
enterprises and on strengthening public procurement and financial management systems. Further,
it led to a renewed commitment to reduce involvement of the state in economic activities to
promote private sector development.

             4. BANK SUPPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                  A. LINKAGES TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

35.     The proposed programmatic development policy operations 4­6 are central
elements of the Bank's recently approved Country Partnership Strategy. The strategic
objectives of the CPS are: (a) reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and
vulnerability, and (b) paving the way for sustained post-crisis recovery and sustained
development. The proposed PDPG 4­6 will support both these objectives. The first operation
will help the government finance health, education, and social protection expenditures to mitigate
the impact of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable. Thus, it is also consistent with the
Pilot Crisis Response Window's objective of protecting core spending in countries affected by the
global financial crisis. The second and third operations will focus on supporting reforms in the
medium term aimed at promoting sustained economic recovery, growth, and poverty reduction.
The reforms will complement the Bank's ongoing and planned investment projects in public
administration, public financial management, agriculture, energy, education, and health. The
development policy operation will serve as the Bank's primary vehicle for engaging in policy
dialogue with the government. It will also help in furthering discussions with other development
partners in how best to align support for the government's development agenda.

                  B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

36.      The Bank and the IMF are collaborating closely to help the government strengthen
its macroeconomic management. The Bank and the Fund are closely coordinating their policy
dialogue and their support programs to help the authorities mitigate the impact of the economic
crisis. They have consulted regularly in defining structural benchmarks of the Fund's 2008 Staff
Monitored Program and the follow-on Extended Credit Facility and prior actions of the Bank's
PDPGs to ensure that both organizations define programs that complement and reinforce the
others. The Bank routinely participates in the Fund's missions; the Fund's resident representative
participates in the Bank's briefings related to the preparation of the PDPGs. Satisfactory progress
in achieving the targets and benchmarks of the Extended Credit Facility is a prerequisite for the



                                                13
Bank to process each development policy operation. In general, the Bank takes the lead and
provides background information for the IMF program in private sector development, enterprise
reforms, agriculture sector issues, and regulatory reforms (see details in annex 4). The Bank and
the Fund share responsibility in public sector management, budget planning and execution, and
financial sector reform. The Fund and the Bank cooperate on fiscal policies, which require close
cooperation with the Bank's investment programs. The Fund leads in tax reform and in revenue
and expenditure management. In these areas the Bank takes into account the Fund's policy
recommendations and ensures consistency between them and its own measures.

37.      The Bank is coordinating closely with other development partners in Tajikistan.
The major development partners, including the World Bank, have prepared an aid coordination
strategy, which was finalized in late 2009. This seeks to ensure that to the extent possible
development partners align their assistance to help the government mitigate the impact of the
global economic crisis on the poor and to help it achieve its PRS objectives. The joint aid
coordination strategy is based on the principles of one strategy, one coordination mechanism, and
one results framework. In addition, the development partners maintain a regular dialogue through
the donor coordination council, with a rotating chair (currently held by DFID). The members of
the council, which meets twice a month, discuss developments in Tajikistan, exchange
experience, and share information on current and planned interventions. The establishment of
this forum has greatly improved coordination of development partner support in the country.

38.      Development partners are providing technical assistance, policy advice, and
financial support in support of the proposed PDPG 4­6 reform program. For example,
USAID is assisting with some of the key financial sector reforms and is helping with the
streamlining of the business regulations. The Asian Development Bank and the EC are
supporting the implementation of agriculture sector reforms, including supporting establishment
of privately-led agriculture finance schemes. The Bank, the EC, DFID, and USAID are working
closely to support the government's reform program in the areas of public sector reform and
public financial management. The Bank, USAID, and UNICEF are all supporting reforms of the
health and education sectors. The EC is collaborating with the Bank to help the government
improve the targeting and administration of the country's social protection system. The French
government and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are financing
improvements in Dushanbe's international airport.

39.     Stronger partnerships with non-OECD donors are being pursued. Non-OECD
development partners--including China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kazakhstan--are
becoming increasingly important financiers of development projects in Tajikistan, especially of
energy and roads of regional importance. Most of the non-OECD donors are interested in
strengthening their collaboration with other development partners in areas of common concern.
For example, the Bank and the IMF are discussing issues of long-term debt sustainability with the
Chinese development partners. The current macroeconomic crisis highlights the importance of
such collaboration. The Bank and other development partners will discuss specific areas of
mutual interest, such as infrastructure development and regional integration.

                     C. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

40.     The proposed series PDPG 4-6 supports policy reforms that are critical to the
success of ongoing and planned Bank-financed investment and technical assistance
operations. The proposed series supports adoption of policies critical for reform of basic service
delivery, public administration, public financial management, agriculture, social protection,



                                               14
education, and health sectors--all areas of ongoing or forthcoming Bank-supported projects.
Reforms to improve the investment climate and to redefine the role of the state in the economy
complements support of the IFC to promote private sector development. Annex 3 shows the links
between PDPG policy actions and other investment operations.

                                    D. LESSONS LEARNED

41.     The design of the proposed operation reflects several lessons from implementation
of the PDPG 1­3, other operations in Tajikistan, and policy-based loans in other countries.
These include:

       Achieving development results is possible if Bank support is designed on the basis of
       a good understanding of Tajikistan's political economy. Extensive experience
       demonstrates that government ownership of the reform program is the single most
       important criterion for success. The reform program of the PDPG 4­6 series has been
       designed in close collaboration with relevant ministries and with the Executive Office of
       the President, and reflects government commitment to reducing the burden of regulations
       on businesses, on strengthening the financial sector, and on promoting rural growth,
       among others. The program does not include reforms--such as actions to enhance
       transparency of Talco--which the Bank team believes may have potentially high impact,
       but for which government commitment is currently uncertain. The dialogue in these
       areas will continue through other instruments, such as analytical work, technical
       assistance, and capacity building activities. Once the government agrees, reforms in
       these areas will be supported.

       A mix of development policy lending and investment operations can be effective in
       supporting development outcomes in post-conflict and fragile states, such as
       Tajikistan. Development policy loans are an effective instrument in middle-income
       countries with good capacity to design and implement reforms. However, the instrument
       has also proven effective in Tajikistan as a vehicle for focused policy dialogue on a range
       of structural issues and to encourage implementation of reforms, as demonstrated by the
       substantial results of the PDPG 1­3 series. The PDPG 1­3 series also served to enhance
       policy coordination within the government, by bringing the decision makers across
       government into common meetings to discuss the rationale for each of the reform areas,
       progress in implementation, and the expected benefits of reform. The new series is
       expected to equally effective in promoting policy dialogue and in furthering policy
       coordination within the government.

       Keeping the program flexible ensures that it reflects a realistic assessment of the
       likely depth and pace of change. An important lesson from PDPG 1­3 is that the pace
       of change in Tajikistan is slower than at first expected due to the institutional legacy left
       at independence from the ex-Soviet Union. Tajikistan had limited experience with
       market-based approaches, having depended on subsidies from the Soviet Union for a
       substantial portion of its budget and having had a guaranteed market for cotton and other
       key products. The country also has significant capacity weaknesses. The new series
       therefore comprises a set of important but realistic reform actions. A substantial
       proportion of reforms follow on and deepen reforms of PDPG 1­3, including those
       related to streamlining the regulatory environment, creating a more efficient aviation
       sector, strengthening the public administration, and deepening reforms of public financial
       management.



                                               15
   Providing technical support for implementation of the reform agenda is essential.
   As with the PDPG 1­3 series, the new series will mobilize substantial technical
   assistance, expert advice, and training to enable the government to complete each step of
   a reform agenda. For example, the PDPG team has called on assistance from the Swiss to
   complete the process of establishing and making fully functional an independent external
   audit authority. It has identified help from the EC, DFID, and USAID for public sector
   reform and for improvements of public financial management. And it is working closely
   with the EC to help the government develop a mechanism to improve the targeting and
   administration of social assistance programs.

   Creating effective partnerships with the IMF and other donors in designing the
   proposed program increasing the likelihood of success. Substantial progress was
   made under the PDPG 1­3 with development partner coordination, with the Bank
   regularly consulting with other development partners on a wide variety of issues. This
   has led to a greater division of labor among partners and reduced and the burden on
   government of uncoordinated development partner efforts. Coordination will be further
   deepened in the context of the new series. The Bank and the IMF consulted closely on
   the design and implementation of the Extended Credit Facility and of the PDPG 4­6
   program to ensure the quality and effectiveness of their dialogue on macro issues.
   Moreover, the Bank team worked closely with the IMF team to ensure the IMF integrated
   the Bank's priorities (selectively increasing public sector wages and protecting social
   expenditures) in its discussions with the authorities on the design of its support under the
   Fund's program.

   Basing the reform program on a strong foundation of analytical work and piloting
   innovative approaches can help stakeholders better understand what will work in
   Tajikistan. The forthcoming Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) has revealed
   some of the key constraints to growth in Tajikistan, including a recent weakening of
   macroeconomic management, a poor institutional environment for private investors,
   high-cost and unreliable energy services, expensive transportation services, institutional
   constraints in agriculture, and weak human capital. The program contains actions to
   address each of these constraints (see chapter 4). Sector specific analytical work has
   contributed to the design of several policy areas. For example, the actions to streamline
   business regulation are based on IFC's "Business Environment in Tajikistan as seen by
   Small and Medium Enterprises 2006 and 2009," the "Assessment of Implementation of
   Inspections and Licensing Reforms in Tajikistan" completed by Jacobs & Associates as
   part of the PDPG 1­3 review, and IFC/World Bank's Doing Business. The reforms of
   the public administration and of public financial management are based on analytical
   work carried out to prepare the Bank supported Public Sector Reform Project and the
   Modernizing Public Financial Management Project. The reforms of education and health
   have been based on findings of pilots stating at the rayon level. For other examples, see
   section E, below. Reforms in policy areas for which analytical work is planned (such as
   in social protection) will be defined only after such work has been done. The operation
   will also support piloting of new approaches in areas where further work is needed to
   understand what works and what does not.




                                           16
                                 E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

42.     The proposed PDPG 4­6 draws on the recent poverty assessment for its design. The
November 2009 poverty assessment has deepened understanding of poverty and its dynamics,
and has influenced the focus of the operation on protecting basic services and on reforming
agricultural institutions. Planned technical assistance will help the government improve its
targeting and administration of the system of social assistance.

43.      Several studies have enhanced understanding of the constraints to growth and the
measures needed to address them. Findings of background studies for the forthcoming CEM
(expected to be finalized in 2010) and the private sector development strategy (2007) have
identified the key constraints to growth and priority measures to address them, including reforms
of the energy sector, of state-owned enterprises, of agriculture, and of the business regulatory
environment.7 An assessment of implementation of inspections and licensing reforms (July 2009)
recommended a regulatory guillotine to cleanup existing administrative procedures affecting
business, such as permits. A joint 2009 IMF-Bank Financial Assessment Program has identified
priority measures to strengthen the financial sector, and a grant from the Financial Sector Reform
and Strengthening Trust Fund (FIRST) is financing technical assistance to further refine the next
set of reforms. An aviation sector note has laid out reforms required to modernize Tajikistan's
aviation sector, essential to foster provision of better quality, higher frequency, and lower cost
aviation services.

44.     A number of technical assessments underpin reforms of the public sector. A fiscal
policy analysis (June 2009), a 2008 public and civil service wage note, and a 2005 remittances
note have informed the measures required for macroeconomic stability. A programmatic public
expenditure review is supporting Tajikistan's first public expenditure and financial accountability
(PEFA) review, analyzing the country's prospects for achieving the MDGs and long-term growth,
and providing support for the introduction of the medium-term expenditure framework. Two
public expenditure tracking surveys, one for health and one for education, are promoting
transparency and efficiency of expenditure in these sectors. Drawing on the results of the
surveys, health and education sector fiduciary capacity assessments are identifying the measures
required to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending on these services. A
country environmental analysis (2008) has specified policy and capacity reforms to improve
environmental management. The design of this operation also reflects the findings of the March
2010 Implementation Completion Report of PDPG 1­3. Annex 3 presents the linkages between
Bank's analytical and advisory work and the reform actions of the proposed operation.

                                   5. PROPOSED OPERATION

                               A. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION

45.     Programmatic approach. This is the first of a proposed programmatic series of three
development policy operations in support of the government's PRS 3 and consistent with the
recently approved CPS. The development objectives of the proposed PDPG 4­6 are to protect


7
     Background papers for the country economic memorandum have been prepared on macroeconomic
stability, agriculture, private sector, energy, migration, trade and connectivity, and growth diagnostics.
These have already influenced the design of the recently approved CPS and the new series of programmatic
development policy operations.


                                                   17
basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis
recovery and growth.

46.     The proposed new series follows the completion in 2009 of the first programmatic
series of three operations. Under the first series the government pursued a program of reforms
aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the private sector, at strengthening public sector
management, and at improving the delivery of services. Despite setbacks and delays, the reform
program resulted in improvements in a number of areas. Specifically, the regulatory burden to
businesses of dealing with licenses and inspections fell, access to Tajikistan by air increased, the
effectiveness of the government in Tajikistan improved, and the financial viability of Barki-Tajik
and Tajiktransgas increased and efficiency of energy services improved. Reforms in the
financing of health and education are also expected over time to result in greater efficiency in
delivery of services. Details of the reform program and its outcomes are presented in the March
2010 Implementation Completion and Results Report for the previous series.8

increase expenditures for basic social services and a deepening of the government's reform
program that was initiated under the previous operation to support economic growth. They
are presented in Table 3 below.

48.      Several criteria have been applied in selecting prior actions and indicative triggers.
First, they address the key constraints to Tajikistan's long-term growth, identified in the
forthcoming CEM. These constraints are (a) a recent weakening of macroeconomic management;
(b) a poor institutional environment for private investors, characterized by overly complex and
non-transparent regulations; (c) high-cost and unreliable energy services; (d) expensive
transportation services for accessing domestic and external markets; (e) restrictions on freedom of
farmers to choose what to produce and where to market it, which is preventing a transfer of
resources to more profitable activities; and (f) weak human capital. These constraints are
heightened by a general weakness of governance, transparency, and accountability that
characterize Tajikistan. In addition to these criteria, good practice in designing PDPGs requires
(a) strong government ownership of the reform agenda, (b) the existence of a sound sector
strategy behind which all development partners can align support, (c) a solid analytical basis for
moving forward, and (d) availability of technical assistance from the Bank or other development
partners to help design and implement the reform program. Benchmarks, triggers for PDPG 5,
proposed actions for PDPG 6, and expected outcomes are presented in Annex 2.

                             Box 4: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
The proposed operation is based on the Tajikistan PRS 3. It also responds to several government sector
strategies, including the national strategy for education development, the public administration reform
strategy, an investment climate assessment, an aviation sector note, an energy utility reform review, and an
agricultural development strategy. All ministries and agencies undertaking policy reforms presented in the
policy matrix have participated in periodic workshops to discuss and agree on the objectives of reforms,
current status, and next steps.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The PDPG program is summarized in an agreed policy matrix in annex 2. The matrix contains both policy
actions and indicators of expected outcomes. The State Advisor for Economic Policy in the Executive Office
of the President is responsible for monitoring progress with the agreed reform program and for coordinating
the actions of the other agencies and ministries involved. The Bank consults regularly with other
development partners in Tajikistan to ensure that aid is as effective as possible.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The accountability framework is based on recent Bank analytical work, including a study of macroeconomic
management, a public expenditure and institutional review, a country procurement assessment report, and a
country financial accountability assessment. Two public expenditure tracking surveys, one for health and
one for education, and several poverty and social impact studies are also contributing to the accountability
framework.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The proposed PDPG 4 operation contains only eight prior actions. All are part of the agreed framework set
out in the policy matrix.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
Progress reviews of the policy actions in specific areas and of the operation as a whole will be held regularly
with government officials from ministries and agencies participating in the project. These reviews will allow
the Bank to update the matrix on the basis of actual and expected performance and to communicate to the
government what is essential to enable the approval of the operation. Predictability is further strengthened
through the use of a policy matrix containing agreed reforms of a series of three annual operations--each of
which furthers the reforms supported by the previous operation.

49.     Benefits of the operations. The first major benefit of the proposed operations will be to
help the government stabilize the fiscal framework while maintaining or increasing delivery of
essential social services. This will assist in preserving human capital during a severe economic
slowdown. The second major benefit will be to help the government address the key constraints
to long-term growth, thereby laying the foundation for a sustainable resumption of growth once
the global economy stabilizes.

50.       Expected impacts of the operation. Adoption of reforms to banking legislation is
expected to stabilize the country's financial institutions. Implementation at Barki Tajik and at
Tajiktransgas of the financial management improvement program is expected to improve
governance at both the utilities and over the longer term to reduce the cost and improve the
reliability of electricity services. Adoption of an aviation sector policy liberalizing the sector is
expected to lower the costs of transportation and strengthen Tajikistan's links to regional and
global markets. Writing-off cotton sector debt and issuing land use certificates will shift control
of agricultural production and marketing decisions to farmers from central and local authorities,
facilitating the shift of resources from cotton to more profitable crops. Reducing the burden of
permits on businesses will reduce the time and cost of starting and operating a business,
consolidate and extend the gains from the licensing reform already completed, and remove a key
disincentive to business growth. See table 3 for a summary of the proposed prior actions.

                                        B. POLICY AREAS

51.     Prerequisite for the PDPG 4­6 series: maintaining macroeconomic stability. The
government is committed to protect expenditures for social services while maintaining a
sustainable fiscal deficit during 2009­12. The Bank is helping the government maintain fiscal
sustainability through budget support. The Bank and the IMF are monitoring fiscal performance
and advising the government on options for maintaining sound fiscal management in the current
environment.

Policy Area 1: Protecting Delivery of Basic Services within a Sustainable Fiscal Framework

52.     Tajikistan experienced a significant deterioration of key indicators of education and
health following independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. This was due to the
loss of budgetary resources and disruptions in supply chains that accompanied the civil war.
With the restoration of peace, the government with support of the development partners initiated
reforms to improve access to health, education, and social protection services, and social
indicators have improved.

53.     The global economic crisis is putting significant pressure on Tajikistan's fiscal
framework, making it difficult for the government to maintain expenditures for social
services. Over the medium term, much can be done to promote the efficient use of available
resources, enabling the government to improve access to and quality of services with a limited
budget.




                                                 22
        a.      Protecting the gains in access to health services

54.      Health indicators have improved in recent years, but much more progress is needed
for them to reach acceptable levels. Improved maternal health services, combined with a
reduction in poverty, contributed to a significant decline in infant mortality (from 75 per 1,000
live births in 2000 to 56 in 2007). Similarly, child mortality declined from 93 to 68 per 1,000 live
births. However, these mortality rates are still above regional averages. Health indicators will
not improve until resources for health services rise and available resources are used more
effectively.

55.     The government is implementing its 2005 national health financing strategy. Under
PDPG 1­3, it introduced wage reforms aimed at improving incentives for primary health care
workers and piloted the basic benefits package and per capita allocation of the primary health
budget. However, much more needs to be done to improve efficiency in resource use and to
achieve better health outcomes. The government has prepared a comprehensive health sector
strategy that specifies the priority actions for the next few years.

56.      The proposed PDPG 4 will support protection of primary health expenditure. The
government is committed to maintaining or increasing the share of the central government budget
allocated to health services. Health services accounted for 6.3 percent of the budget (excluding
the public investment program) in 2007, 6.9 percent in 2008, and 6.1 percent in 2009. Health
services are expected to account for 6.5 percent of the central government budget in 2010. The
Bank is monitoring the preparation and execution of the budget to ensure that these commitments
are met.

57.      The proposed PDPG 5­6 will promote reforms to improve the efficiency and
equitable allocation of resources for health. Once the economy is firmly recovering and the
fiscal situation improving, the series will shift emphasis to supporting reforms aimed at reducing
current overcapacity in the hospital sector and reforming health financing. The PDPG 5 will
support the adoption by the government of the health sector master plan consistent with the new
health sector strategy.

58.       PDPG 6 will support the issuance of a government instruction to implement
masterplan phase 1 actions in at least in one oblast. Actions are likely to include the
restructuring of health facilities in one oblast with closure of redundant departments in health
facilities, and the allocation of public investment budget for health infrastructure based on the
master plan. In the longer-run, the reforms are expected to result in reduction of overcapacity in
hospitals, a decline in the share of total health spending (from patients and public sources)
allocated to hospitals, and an increase in the share spent on primary health facilities.

59.      PDPG 6 will also support the issuance of a government regulation to create oblast
level pooling, in at least one oblast. Depending on their socioeconomic situation and population
size, rayons have different revenue raising capacity to finance their health facilities. The
government aims to address this unequal allocation of health funds through consolidation of
public health spending on an oblast level. Pooling will include the consolidation of public funds
for health from rayons, oblast, and central sources, and the signing of contracts by the oblast
health department with primary health care providers and with hospitals that are needed, as
identified in the health sector master plan. As a result of higher-level pooling, primary health
care facilities will be paid the same capitation base rate, which is expected to improve their
financial situation. At the same time, pooling will entail a switch at hospital level from input


                                                23
based financing--which has contributed to inefficiencies in the sector--to an output based
financing scheme through employing a case-based mechanism. The Bank is providing technical
assistance to the government in health financing and supporting structural reforms through the
Community and Basic Health Project. The Bank is partnering with several development partners
in this endeavor, including the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies,
and bilateral partners including USAID and Germany's KfW development bank.

60.     Expected results. At the end of the programmatic series, utilization of primary health
centers in pilot rayons will have been maintained at no less than 2008 levels (baseline: primary
health center per capita visit rates 2008: Nurek 1.3; Spitamen 1.9; Sarband 2.9. Source:
administrative data from rayons).

        b.      Protecting the gains in access to education

61.     School enrollment rates increased at all levels of education between 2000 and 2009.
According to the latest living standards measurement survey, gross pre-primary enrollment
increased from 73 percent of eligible children to over 90 percent, net primary enrollment rose
from 96 to 99 percent, net secondary enrollment went up from 71 to 80 percent, and gross tertiary
enrollment expanded from 14 to 18 percent. The primary completion rate rose from 95 percent in
2000 to 99 percent in 2008. However, much more is needed to improve educational outcomes.

62.      The government is implementing the National Strategy for Education Development
2006­15 and its strategic action plan. Under the previous PDPG series, the government
gradually rolled out the per capita financing scheme. A 2009 midterm review of the Fast Track
Initiative Catalytic Grant found this reform to be one of the most successful of those supported
under the grant. The scheme will be extended to the entire country by 2010. The midterm review
team found that per capita financing is leading to efficiency gains. For example, the student to
teacher ratio increased from 19 to 20, the teacher to teacher load (stavka) ratio declined from 1.46
to 1.34, and the student to stavka ratio increased from 13.2 to 15. In parallel, the share of
schools' budgets spent on wages is declining, freeing resources for improving the quality of
education.

63.     The proposed PDPG 4 will support an increase in the proportion of the budget
allocated to education and an expansion of the per capita financing scheme. Education
accounted for 18.8 percent of the central government budget in 2007, 18.0 percent in 2008, and
17.8 percent in 2009. In 2010 it is expected to reach 17.9 percent. The PDPG 4 will also support
the expansion and full implementation of per capita financing. This will include a review of and
revision of legislation to ensure that per capita financing is well established in the law governing
education financing and budgeting. Partners in the effort include the United Nations Children's
Fund, the Asian Development Bank, German Technical Cooperation, and USAID.

64.      PDPG 5 will support submission to parliament amendments to legal documents to
accommodate national implementation of per capita financing in general education. This
will strengthen the legal basis for per capita financing. PDPG 6 will support the preparation and
adoption of a new education strategy and sector plan aimed at enhancing equity and access to a
quality and relevant education.

65.    Expected results. At the end of the programmatic series, resources for education will be
used more efficiently (measured by increasing student to teaching load ratio and by maintenance

2008/09; Target 75­85 percent in 2011/12. Source: Ministry of Education).


                                                24
        b.      Maintaining an adequate social protection system

66.     The government operates a relatively large contribution-based pension system and
supplements this with non-contributory social pensions for poor households. The government
also operates two relatively small social assistance programs: electricity and gas compensation for
poor and vulnerable categories of households, and conditional cash payments to poor households
to encourage them to enroll their children in school. Moreover, the government delivers some
one-time benefits to poor households and delivers an array of benefits in kind to several
categories of citizens.

67.     PDPG 4 will support protection of social protection expenditure. Spending on
various social protection schemes (excluding PIP, but including pensions) accounted for 16.2
percent of the central government budget in 2007, 13.8 percent in 2008, and 20 percent in 2009.
The EC is partnering with the Bank to strengthen Tajikistan's system of social protection.

68.      The PDPG 5 will support the issuance of a resolution by the government to
introduce improved targeting of social assistance in at least two rayons. As a next step, the
PDPG 6 will support government approval of an action plan to scale up an improved social
assistance program nationwide. Comparison of 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2009 data from the living
standards measurement survey shows that the pro-poor targeting of social assistance schemes has
improved slightly over the years. However, the effectiveness of targeting of Tajikistan's social
assistance programs does not compare favorably with that of other countries (see Figure 2).
Indeed, based on preliminary results from the 2009 living standards measurement survey,
Tajikistan delivers only 23 percent of their social assistance benefits to the poorest 20 percent
(quintile) of households. A well-performing social assistance program delivers most of its
resources to this group. In addition, 2009 survey data suggests that about 30 percent of the
country's total social assistance leaked to the richest 40 percent of the population. These statistics
show the magnitude of the vast inefficiencies in Tajikistan social assistance scheme and signals
significant inclusion errors when non-poor are included in social assistance programs. With very
modest social protection and social assistance benefits comprising just around 3 percent of the
income of the poorest 20 percent of households, addressing deficiencies in targeting the poor
becomes even more paramount. Priority complementary areas of reform to support the
overarching objective of improving targeting include more efficient administration of social
services, rationalization of benefit schemes, and revision of the pension system to ensure that it
provides a secure income in old age. The government is currently undertaking several studies
with the support of development partners to identify options for reform.

69.     Expected results. At the end of the programmatic series, targeting of social assistance
will have improved (measured by increasing the proportion of social assistance reaching the
bottom quintile. Baseline (2009, preliminary data)): 23 percent, target: (2012) 30 percent.

Policy Area 2: Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development

70.     Overview. Despite progress during the past few years, Tajikistan's environment for
private sector development remains poor. As highlighted in the forthcoming CEM, future
growth will be highly dependent on increases in private investment (which has been stagnant in
recent years), unlike the recent past when GDP growth resulted mainly by a post-conflict
recovery of consumption, production, and investment, and from growth in remittances. Specific
sectors with high growth potential include non-cotton agriculture and agro-processing (to meet
domestic, but especially export demand), and exploiting hydro-power (if revenues are used
properly). Light manufacturing also offer potential. The above thus calls for a policy agenda to



                                                    26
improve the climate for private investment and trade, for easing transportation of goods and
people within and across borders, and for enhancing incentives for farmers to choose crops that
are profitable for them.

71.      Much more is needed to make Tajikistan an attractive place to invest and do
business. Complicated administrative regulations raise the cost and time of starting, operating,
and closing a business. The legal framework is inadequate, and the capacity to implement and
enforce applicable laws is weak. The combination of complex regulations and weak legal
protection encourages small businesses to remain small, rather than grow and attract rent-seeking
from government officials. Tajikistan's financial system is underdeveloped, inefficient, and
shallow, and has limited capacity to serve the needs of business and households. Weak
governance, low transparency, and poor service quality in banks lower public confidence and
limit deposits, thus raising the cost of funding. Underdevelopment of the insurance, leasing, and
capital markets limit alternative sources of financing and risk management. Further, high interest
rate spreads, short loan duration, widespread practices of insider/related lending, and low branch
density discourage the private sector from seeking financing from the banking sector. As a
double landlocked country, Tajikistan is exceptionally dependent on efficient, reliable aviation
services to link to external goods and labor markets. However, the country has only recently
embarked on fundamental reforms required to create a competitive aviation sector. Agriculture
offers considerable potential to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.
Yet, an overemphasis on cotton production at the expense of other crops, a poor institutional
framework, and slow progress in establishing farmers' rights to land have held back agriculture's
potential.

        a.      Reducing the burden of regulations on business

72.     The government has streamlined the licensing and inspections systems. The
government in the mid 2000s adopted legislation and regulations to reduce the burden of licenses
and inspections on business and initiated implementation of the new framework. In 2008 it
undertook a review of the implementation of the law, which revealed deficiencies in
implementation. The government addressed these in early 2009 under support of the previous
operation. The sustained effort to rationalize licensing and inspections, along with other reforms,
resulted in Tajikistan being named one of the top ten performers in IFC's Doing Business 2010.
This is an impressive achievement. Tajikistan's rank improved from 159 of 181 countries in
2009 to 152 of 183 countries in 2010.

73.      In July 2009, the government launched "200 Days of Reform" with the aim of
further improving the business environment and making Tajikistan more attractive to
private investors. This identified streamlining the permits system and facilitating access to the
licenses, permits, and other documents required to start a business as key next steps in the reform
process. Government statistics on business registration reveal that growth in the number of legal
entities in Tajikistan is sluggish compared to the strong rates of growth of enterprises operated by
individual entrepreneurs. The burden of permits, along with taxation and other regulatory
procedures, is much higher on legal entities than on individual entrepreneurs. The average small
and medium company (legal entity) spent US$458 on all permits in 2007, four times the cost in
2005. Using data from its survey of small and medium enterprises carried out in 2008, IFC
calculates that the average small and medium company (legal entity) spent 6.2 percent of its
profits on permits (and an additional 4 percent on licenses) in 2007.

74.   The process of review and elimination of permits through a permits guillotine
approach was officially launched through Resolution 305 on May 28, 2009. To implement


                                                27
and monitor the guillotine process, the government has established a permits review commission,
comprising officials from the Executive Office of the President, business associations, and
technical experts (including members of the IFC Business Enabling Environment Project team as
technical experts) that is headed by the first deputy prime minister of Tajikistan. In February
2010, the commission reviewed the justifications for various permits and decided to eliminate all
but 90 permits. The commission's decision document (protokolnoye reshenye), approved by the
acting chairman of the permits review commission, which the deputy prime minister signed in
April, obligates the members of the commission to monitor implementation of the decision. The
decision document lists the 90 permits approved and the 101 permits rejected out of those that
were submitted to the commission.

75.     The decision of the permits review commission will be incorporated into an
instruction from the head of the Executive Office of the President to implement the
commission's decisions; this instruction is expected by end-May 2010. In addition 416
permits were found to be applied in law and practice, but no justifications were submitted to the
permits review commission, so they will be considered no longer valid once the new law is
passed. A new permits law has been drafted incorporating the full recommendation of the
permits review commission, and is expected to be submitted to the Executive Office of the
President in May 2010. Once the Executive Office and the cabinet approve the draft, the
government will submit it to parliament for approval. Its enactment will for the first time
will provide a unified legal framework regulating permits in Tajikistan.

76.     A one-stop-shop is now operational. The government has established a one-stop-shop
in 50 of the country's 68 tax inspectorates (including Dushanbe) to enable entrepreneurs to
receive the information, forms, and other services they need to start a business.

77.      The proposed PDPG 4 will support reform of the permits system and further
implementation of the one-stop-shop. The operation will support implementation of the agreed
guillotine process to eliminate unnecessary permits, removing a disincentive to enterprise growth.
It will also support implementation of specific measures aimed at reducing the time and cost of
obtaining construction permits. The IFC and USAID will be partners with IDA in this reform
area. The operation will in addition support the further strengthening of the one-stop-shop. The
EC will partner with the Bank in this area.

78.     The proposed PDPG 5­6 will continue to deepen the reforms aimed at reducing the
regulatory burden on business. As a prior action, the PDPG 5 will support the submission to
parliament of a new permits law that codifies the decision of the permits commission and that
regulates the procedures for introducing new permits. The permits review commission and the
permits law will institute a regulatory impact assessment applicable to permits. This would
require that each new legislation proposed include an analysis of the expected impact on the
private sector and to gather private sector input; application of regulatory impact assessment in
many countries has served to limit unnecessary regulation of the sector and resulted in significant
savings to the private sector and mobilization of business investment. As a benchmark, PDPG 5
will support the establishment of a publicly available registry of valid permits. PDPG 5­6 will
also assist with the further strengthening of the one-stop-shop, in partnership with the EC.
Indicatively, PDPG 6 is expected to support the regulatory impact assessment of key laws
applicable to the private sector (number and which laws to be further defined at a later date).

79.      Expected results. At the end of the programmatic series, the total cost (direct and
indirect) of acquiring permits will be reduced (from 1,588 somoni in 2009 survey to 1,300 in
2011 survey. Source: IFC small and medium enterprise surveys). In addition, the cost and time


                                                28
of dealing with construction permits will decline (from 250 days in 2010 to 230 in 2013. Source:
Doing Business surveys).

                            Reducing the Burden of Regulations on Business
    PDPG 4: Prior actions
     The Recipient issued instructions Number 633 of March 7, 2009, Number 305 of May 28, 2009,
       Number 3 of March 1, 2010, and Number 4258 of April 23, 2010, approving the list of the ninety-one
       (91) permits retained by the Recipient's Permits Commission, while the rest are revoked.
    PDPG 5: Indicative triggers
     The government submits to parliament a new permits law to (a) codify the reduced list of permits
       applicable in Tajikistan as a result of the permits commission recommendation, and (b) regulate the
       procedures for introduction of new permits.
    PDPG 6: Proposed Actions
     The government undertakes regulatory impact analysis of key laws applicable to the private sector to
       further reduce constraints to private sector activity (number and which laws to be further defined at a
       later date).

           b.       Strengthening the financial sector

80.     The government is implementing high-priority recommendations of the Financial
Sector Assessment Program supported by the Bank Group and IMF to address weaknesses
in the legal and regulatory framework and in NBT. Specific measures include adoption of
new legislation and governance improvements in NBT. The authorities have also prepared, with
assistance from a grant from the FIRST Trust Fund, a medium-term (2009­2013) financial sector
strategy and time-bound action plan to implement other key recommendations.

81.      The proposed PDPG 4 will support key reforms in the first year of the action plan.
The action plan represents a comprehensive, prioritized, sequenced approach to develop a
stronger, more stable financial sector that can operate more efficiently and broaden and deepen its
financial services. The action plan starts with building the legal foundations that are a prerequisite
for stability and growth. While some legal and regulatory work will continue throughout the
period of the action plan, emphasis in subsequent years is on institutional strengthening, capacity
building, product and service development, and financial infrastructure development, all of which
require the existence and enforcement of a sound legal framework to function properly. Hence,
PDPG 4 will support the implementation of key first-year legal and regulatory actions, including
submission to parliament for approval of a revised banking law and of amendments to NBT law.9
It will also assist the issuance by the NBT of revised versions of key regulations and instructions
in line with the new or amended laws. These legal and regulatory changes will among other
things (a) strengthen prudential norms (for example, with respect to insider lending and large
exposure limits); (b) strengthen NBT's authority to take preemptive and remedial actions on
banks that are not meeting their prudential obligations and make such actions more transparent
and predictable; (c) strengthen NBT's authority to require stronger credit appraisal standards, risk
management, and governance in commercial banks; (d) restore NBT's authority to grant and
revoke bank licenses; (e) strengthen NBT's independence and improve NBT governance; and (f)
enable NBT to conduct consolidated supervision. Several development partners are supporting
elements of the financial sector action plan.


9
    The support of PDPG 4 to amend the NBT law (which was completed in July 2009 with support from
a World Bank-administered grant from the FIRST trust Fund) should not be confused with the IMF
program's support to further revise the NBT law beginning at the end of 2010.


                                                       29
82.     PDPG 5­6 will continue to support reforms laid out in the government's financial
sector development strategy and action plan. PDPG 5 will support implementation of key
elements of the second year of the financial sector action plan, including at a minimum: (a)
submit revised deposit insurance law to parliament, and (b) issue and enforce a regulation on a
process for a prompt remedial action framework for commercial banks. The operation may also
support implementation of a market-driven, private sector-led, financing mechanism for
agriculture, depending on the outcome of discussions with the government, development partners,
and other stakeholders. The PDPG 6 will include implementation of key elements of the third
year of the financial sector action plan, including at a minimum: (a) strengthen consumer
protection regulation and supervision of banks, and (b) strengthen the legal and institutional
environment for secured transactions.

83.     Expected results. At the end of the programmatic series, stability of, access to, depth of,
and efficiency of the financial system are expected to improve. Specifically:

          Access to formal financial services increases (accounts in banks and microfinance
          organizations rise. Baselines (2008 for bank accounts and 2009 for microfinance
          accounts): 210,378 bank accounts and 381 microfinance accounts. Targets (2012): bank
          accounts 250,000, microfinance accounts 1,000).
          Financial system becomes deeper Measured by:
           Increase in non-directed private sector credit. Baseline (2008) 14 percent of GDP.
           Target (2012) 18 percent, 10 and
           Increase in deposits. Baseline (2008): 11 percent of GDP. Target (2012) 14% of
           GDP.
          Financial system becomes more efficient (interest rate spread between lending rate and
          average deposit rate falls. Baseline (2008) 18 percent in somoni and 17 percent in US$.
          Target (2012): 14 percent in somoni; 14 percent in US$).

10        Note that these figures can be skewed by the ostensibly "private" lending to cotton (through Kredit Invest or through
the Ministry of Finance credit lines). Including such cotton lending, the figure is 25 percent in 2008; but the result focuses on the
non-directed lending by private financial institutions, and this is only 14 percent of GDP in 2008.

                                Strengthening the Financial Sector
PDPG 4: Prior actions
 The Recipient through Decree of the National Bank, Number 110, dated April 26, 2010, approved the
   financial sector development strategy and action plan, in addition to:

    Submitting to Parliament for approval a draft Banking Law, Number 524, dated May 19, 2009,
        including submitting to Parliament amendments to the Law on the National Bank, Number 383, dated
        December 14, 1996; and
         Issuing revised versions of key regulations and instructions in line with new Banking Law
        instructions, namely, Number 524, dated May 19, 2009, and amending the Law on the National Bank
        related to Government instruction Number 548, dated August 25, 2009.
PDPG 5: Triggers
 Key elements of the financial sector development action plan implemented in line with the timetable and
   acceptable to IDA, including at a minimum: (a) submit revised deposit insurance law to parliament, and (b)
   issue and enforce a regulation on a process for a prompt remedial action framework for commercial banks.
PDPG 6: Proposed actions
 Key elements of the financial sector development action plan implemented in line with the timetable and
   acceptable to IDA, including at a minimum: (a) strengthen consumer protection regulation and supervision
   of banks, and (b) strengthen the legal and institutional environment for secured transactions.

        c.       Modernizing aviation services

84.      Good progress has been made since June 2006 with aviation sector reforms. The
government recognizes the need to reform the aviation sector to reduce the cost and increase the
convenience of air travel.11 Under the previous programmatic series, the government separated
the functions of policy-making, technical regulations, and accident investigation, with the aim of
increasing the transparency and performance of operations. It also unbundled Tajik State
Airlines, creating six new companies, one to operate the state owned airline, one to operate air
traffic control, and four to operate the nation's airports. In addition, the government allowed
several foreign airlines and a new private Tajik carrier to operate new flights, expanding choices
for consumers. These reforms contributed to a nearly 100 percent increase in passenger traffic
(both domestic and international) between 2006 and 2008.

85.     The next step in aviation sector reform is to adopt a national aviation policy aimed
at ensuring that the aviation services are able to make their maximum contribution to the
nation's economic development. The government in mid-2009 under assistance of a PHRD
grant drafted a policy addressing issues such as aviation safety (including funding of air traffic
control and the safety regulator), aviation security to ensure that flights and facilities are secure
from acts of terrorism, aviation taxation, the extent open skies will be permitted, private sector
participation in provision of aviation services, airport infrastructure planning and development for
the medium and long term, consumer protection, and environmental policy. The government
approved the national aviation policy in March 2010. The French government and the EBRD,
who are financing improvements in airport infrastructure and facilities, are coordinating their
support with that of the Bank to maximize the effectiveness of policy dialogue in encouraging
reform. The IFC is also considering investing in the airport facilities and welcomes the new
policy.




11
  The World Bank is supporting aviation sector reforms, because other development partners (the Asian
Development Bank and the EBRD) are supporting reforms of road and rail transportation.


                                                   31
86.      The proposed PDPG 4 will support adoption of the national aviation policy. The
policy explicitly (a) allows progressively increased access to international airlines in terms of
routes and frequency capacity; (b) removes any restrictions on air cargo in terms of aircraft types,
size, frequency, uplift or discharge ( as long as technically feasible); (c) ensures equal treatment
at the airports for all carriers in terms of pricing, fueling, and other services; and (d) improves air
safety through adequate funding and strengthened licensing certification, monitoring compliance
and inspection.

87.     The proposed PDPG 5­6 will support measures to implement the new aviation
policy. The next two operations in the series will support measures to implement the aviation
policy, laid out in a time-bound action plan. They include actions to strengthen the technical
regulation and accident and incident investigation functions, to reform institutions, and improve
operations of both of the airports and of air traffic control service. The Riga International Airport
has agreed to provide training and technical assistance to staff of Dushanbe Airport Company
aimed at upgrading services. In addition, the government is also seeking financial and technical
assistance to improve the operation of air traffic control service.

88.     Expected results. At the end of the programmatic series, Tajikistan is expected to be
better connected to regional and international markets, measured by the number of flights (from
175 in 2009 to 250 in 2012), the number of passengers rises (from 1.35 million in 2008 to 1.8 in
2012).

                                      Modernizing Aviation Services
PDPG 4: Prior actions
 The Recipient has adopted a resolution dated May 3, 2010 Number 229 setting forth an aviation sector
   policy aimed at liberalizing Tajikistan's aviation market.
PDPG 5: Indicative triggers
 The government issues a government order, satisfactory to IDA, assigning technical regulation
   function to an autonomous body, independent from any form of policy making influence, and
   assigning the functions of investigation of accidents and incidents to a new body with complete
   independence from the technical regulator or the Ministry of Transport and Communication.12
PDPG 6: Proposed actions
 The government develops and adopts a framework, satisfactory to IDA, dealing with the protection of
   users, technical action plan strengthening competition of service providers and the mechanism for
   setting and adjusting user charges in aviation.

           d.       Reforming agricultural institutions

89.     The government recognizes that its previous focus on cotton production limited the
potential of other agricultural products. It is now revising its approach to promote the
development of agriculture in general. The past overemphasis on the cotton subsector resulted
in the waste of hundreds of millions of dollars, the indebtedness of thousands of small farmers,
the weakening of the financial system (banks were directed to lend to cotton farmers, regardless
of farmers' ability to repay), and the ossification of agricultural institutions. The crisis of 2007
revealed the failure of the approach, and in 2008 the government started to institute far-ranging
agricultural reforms. It has implemented resolution 111, which grants farmers' the right to
choose which crops to grow and where to market them, in non-cotton growing areas and in many
cotton growing districts. As a result, some 35 percent of farmers in a 2008 survey report that they
have freedom to make independent production and marketing decisions, up from 14 percent in

12
     Specific actions to be determined during appraisal.


                                                      32
2007. To further implement "freedom to farm," the government adopted in May 2009 a cotton
debt resolution strategy aimed at relieving small farmers of debt and at freeing resources for
investment in new crops and rural enterprises. In July, it issued a resolution setting forth general
reforms for the agricultural sector, including specific directions for cotton debt write off. A
working group for cotton debt resolution was established in August 2009 and the specific
procedures for debt write off defined. Some 6,900 debt write-off certificates equivalent to
US$424 million had been issued to farmers and investors by end-December. This write-off of
debt is freeing resources for investment in new crops and rural enterprises. To accelerate
farmland restructuring--a major element of the incentive framework for agriculture involving
reorganizing collective and state farms into family farms--the government is issuing land use
certificates to family farms in accordance with standards and targets agreed under the Bank-
financed Land Registration and Cadastral System for Sustainable Agriculture Project (LRCSP).

90.      These measures have already stimulated agricultural diversification and growth.
This is demonstrated by the large contribution of wheat in 2008 to the country's GDP. The
government plans during the coming years to continue its agricultural reforms, by fully
implementing the cotton debt resolution strategy, accelerating the process of farmland
restructuring, and other measures.

91.      The PDPG 4 operation will support as prior actions several measures to improve the
incentive framework for rural growth. It will support the issuance of debt-write-off certificates
to all eligible farmers, a process that was completed at end December 2009. The PDPG 4 will
also support acceleration of farmland restructuring as reflected through issuance of land use
certificates to family farms in accordance with agreed standards and targets.13 Securing famers'
rights to land is essential to improve incentives to invest in agriculture, which in the medium term
will help to raise productivity of agriculture, while lowering its risk through diversification. It
will also indirectly contribute to strengthening of the rule of law, to deepening of the financial
system (land can be used as collateral for loans), and to poverty reduction. Partners include the
Asian Development Bank, USAID (small holder legal rights), and several bilateral donors.

92.      The proposed PDPG 5­6 will support deepening of reforms in agricultural
institutions. These operations will support the acceleration of farmland restructuring as indicated
by additional issuance of land use certificates to family farms in accordance with the standards
agreed under the LRCSP. While the target number of certificates under the LRCSP is 37,500 by
end of 2011, the target number for the PDPG 5­6 will be higher. This acceleration will result
from reforms of government procedures and policies in order to increase efficiency and lower


13
     "Agreed standards" refer to farmland restructuring to individual and family farms with no more than
25 adult shareholders per farm. In addition, it is based on the understanding that the government will make
every effort to ensure that farmland restructuring is undertaken through a process which is socially
inclusive, is transparent, is regarded as fair by local inhabitants and reflects good conflict management
practice, takes into account current land use (rather than prescribed land use based on out of date maps or
government instructions) and is increasingly efficient. For PDPG4, the target number of land use
certificates would be the target specified for the Land Registration and Cadastral System for Sustainable
Agriculture Project. (LRCSP), as it corresponds to the date of the end of PDPG 6. The agreed target for
PDPG 5 is the cumulative results target for LRCSP (27,000 as of March 31, 2011) plus a cumulative total
of 3,000 resulting from policy reforms (a total of 30,000 between January 1 2007 and March 31, 2011 in
both LRCSP and non-LRCSP areas), and quarterly reports describing progress with addressing policy and
institutional reforms related to the acceleration of farmland restructuring. The agreed target for PDPG 6 is
the cumulative target number for LRCSP results plus a cumulative total of 27,500 resulting from policy
reforms (a cumulative total of 65,000 from LRCSP and non-LRCSP areas).


                                                    33
unit costs, and from scaling up the approach in both project and non-project areas.14 The reforms
will enable existing LRCSP and government resources to be better utilized and thereby increase
the levels of certificate issuance above what would have taken place without the reforms. The
PDPG 5 and PDPG 6 operations would also reinforce the implementation freedom to farm
policies.

93.      In addition PDPG 5 and PDPG 6 will increase the viability and sustainability of
irrigation investments by supporting as a benchmark adoption and application of improved
site selection criteria.15 In Tajikistan secure land tenure for family farms is a precondition for
well functioning water user groups, and farmer control over farm management is a precondition
for optimizing the agricultural productivity of irrigated areas. PDPG 5 and PDPG 6 will also
include as a benchmark measures to improve the enabling environment for agriculture by
developing an action plan to reform policies (for example, trade, taxation, rural finance
regulation) to increase the access of farmers to inputs, financing , advisory services and markets.
The development of the action plan will build on upcoming analysis, including that which is
planned for the rural investment climate study. The PDPG series will reinforce the IMF program
and the July 2, 2009 government resolution on measures to support agriculture. Partners include
the Asian Development Bank, the EC, USAID, DFID, and several other donors including
nongovernmental organizations.

94.     Expected results. By the end of the three year program, farmers will gain control over
farm management, as indicated by the proportion of farmers who perceive that they can take
independent production and marketing decisions. Baseline (2008) 35 percent according to a 2008
survey. Target (2011) is 75 percent based on a survey to be carried out in 2011 under the
LRCSP. Additional surveys are likely to be supported under the USAID Land Reform Project
and the Russian Trust Fund Technical Assistance Project on Role of Government in Agriculture
Sector Development.




14
     Such reforms may include (a) simplification and decentralization of farmland restructuring in order to
eliminate some steps, streamline others, and reduce the time spent on review and approvals, (b)
establishment and monitoring of performance standards which specify time limits, accuracy levels, social
inclusion and other considerations, (c) introduction of performance pay arrangements to increase
productivity of staff and contractors, (d) curtailing policy disincentives to potential applicants (e.g., social
tax, tree purchase requirements), and (e) expansion of the area where land use certificates are provided at
no cost to recipients through a process of systematic (as opposed to sporadic) farmland restructuring. The
Government will provide quarterly reports describing progress with addressing policy and institutional
reforms related to the acceleration of farmland restructuring. The Government will provide quarterly
reports describing progress with addressing policy and institutional reforms related to the acceleration of
farmland restructuring.
15
     Site selection criteria would include confirmation that at least 70 percent of each irrigation command
area proposed to benefit from irrigation investment is comprised of farms held by individuals or families
who have their own land use certificates and who perceive that they can take production and marketing
decisions free of government intervention.

 The Recipient has issued land use certificates in accordance with the agreed standards and targets as
   set forth in the Decree, Number 374, dated July 2, 2009
 The Recipient has completed issuance of 6,930 debt write off certificates equivalent to US$423.6
   million for farmers under the tripartite Kredit Invest credit scheme by end of December 2009 as set
   forth in the letter from the National Bank of Tajikistan, Number 02t-07/18125, dated April 30, 2010,
   and specified in the Government the Decree Number 663, dated May 30, 2009.
PDPG 5: Indicative triggers
 The government issues land use certificates in accordance with agreed standards (farms with no more
   than 25 shareholders) and targets (cumulative total of 30,000 since January 1, 2007 from project and
   non-project activities).
 The government adopts improved site selection criteria (requiring family farms with secure land use
   rights and freedom to make production and marketing decisions) for irrigation command areas.
PDPG 6: Proposed action
 The government issues land use certificates in accordance with agreed standards (farms with no more
   than 25 shareholders) and targets (cumulative total of 65,000 since January 1, 2007 from project and
   non-project activities).
 The government approves and initiates implementation of action plan to reform policies for example,
   trade, taxation, rural finance regulation) to increase access of farmers to inputs, financing, advisory
   services, and markets.

Policy Area 3: Strengthening Government Effectiveness

95.      Overview. Government effectiveness in Tajikistan is low. The 2008 World
Governance Indicators rank Tajikistan in the 15th percentile in the world on both voice and
accountability, rule of law, and control of corruption, which is significantly below averages for
the region and for low-income countries.16 Capacity for public sector management remains low,
with high turnover of skilled public servants due to unattractive salaries and benefits. Public
financial management is underdeveloped. Corporate governance of state-owned enterprises
remains a serious concern, with weak management of Barki Tajik contributing to annual winter
electricity shortages and lack of transparency in the operations of Talco and Talco Management
giving rise to suspicions of misuse of funds.  

           a.     Strengthening capacity of government institutions

96.      The government has taken steps to strengthen public sector performance. With
support of the previous operation and of the Public Sector Reform Project, the government in
2007 reviewed and streamlined the structure of central public administration to eliminate
excessive fragmentation of institutions and clarify mandates. Civil service reforms have been
initiated, including efforts to introduce competitive recruitment and pay linked to job
descriptions. A functional review of the administration and delivery of social services has led to
the amendment of key legislation and institutional improvements in priority sectors (for example,
streamlining education service delivery and financing, piloting patient fees in health care
institutions, and introducing policy-based budgeting). Service delivery standards have been
designed and institutional changes needed to improve the quality of social services have been
initiated. However, much more is needed to achieve a noticeable improvement in public sector
performance.

97.      The proposed PDPG 4 will deepen reforms already underway. As a benchmark, the
PDPG 4 will support the introduction in 2010 of a civil service salary grid that links
compensation to levels of responsibility, experience, and complexity of work in five pilot
ministries or agencies in the central government, subject to availability of funds. With the
support of the IDA-financed Public Sector Reform Project, the government has undertaken the
preparatory work required to introduce the salary grid, including approving the revised
classification of civil servants and developing the structure of the salary grid that closely reflects
the current pay levels. This grid has been developed in a close cooperation of the core
government institutions, including the Executive Office of the President, the Civil Service
Department, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. Once fully
in use, the new pay system based on the salary grid is expected to lead to greater transparency in
setting pay level and ease of pay administration. It will also underpin the future automation of the
administration of civil service remuneration through a payroll module. Partners with the Bank in
addressing public service reforms include the EC.

98.     The proposed PDPG 5­6 will continue support for implementation of the public
sector reforms. PDPG 5 will support as a prior action the introduction in the civil service of the
performance appraisal system, which is currently under preparation. It will also assist with
several activities aimed at improving the effectiveness of the public administration. PDPG 6 will
support as prior actions (a) introduction of the new salary grid in all central government entities
and (b) enactment of a law on public administration.

99.     Expected results. By the end of the three year program, Tajikistan's standing in indices
of public sector performance are expected to improve over 2008 levels (measured by Tajikistan's
score in the annual Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum. Baseline: 3.7
in 2008, target: 4.5 by 2012).

                      Strengthening Capacity of Government Institutions
PDPG 5: Indicative triggers
 The government puts into practice performance appraisal system in civil service.
PDPG 6: Indicative triggers
 The government introduces new salary grid introduced in all central government entities.
 The government submits law on public administration to parliament.

        b.       Promoting transparent public financial management

100.     The government is strengthening public financial management. Under support of the
previous operation, the government promulgated a new procurement law, issued implementing
regulations, adopted standard bidding documents, and established procurement departments in six
key government entities. It also adopted in March 2007 a public internal financial control
strategy and started to implement a decentralized internal audit approach and methodology. In
November 2007 the parliament approved amendments to the law on public finances, which cover
the key budget organizations, managerial accountability, and the internal control and audit
function. In addition, the government agreed on a model for an independent external audit body,
and initiated work on the drafting of legislation to establish it. The government is now embarking
on further reforms with support of the Bank-financed Public Financial Management Project,
approved in May 2009. Partners with the Bank in strengthening public financial management
include the IMF, EC, DFID, and USAID.




                                                  36
101.     The proposed PDPG 4 will lay the ground for future reforms of public financial
management. As a benchmark, the PDPG 4 will support the introduction of a new budget
classification, including administrative classification, for preparation of the 2011 budget.

102.     The proposed PDPG 5­6 will support measures to further strengthen public
financial management. PDPG 5 will support the finalization of the draft external audit law and
its submission to the government for consultation and approval. The Swiss State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs is funding the preparation of the external audit law. The Bank will continue
providing advisory support to the government, especially towards development of legal and
institutional structure for the external audit function, outreach, and capacity building. PDPG 5
will also support implementation and approval of a fully developed chart of accounts for public
institutions. PDPG 6 will support the execution of the state budget based on new budget
classification and chart of accounts. It will also support the establishment of the external audit
function once the draft law is approved, expected in late 2009.

103.    Expected results. By the end of the three year program, the transparency of budget
execution is expected to have improved as measured by financial statements on budget
implementation being aligned with the IMF's Government Financial Statistics manual 2001 and
consolidated budget execution reports being posted online.

   audit body.
 State budget executed based on new budget classification and chart of accounts.

        c.      Enhancing transparency of state-owned enterprises

104.     The government has introduced measures to strengthen governance of the largest
state-owned enterprises. Under support of the previous operation, the government started to
implement international financial reporting standards at Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas. This
multi-year effort will enable the energy utilities to improve their internal controls and
management of their fixed assets and revenues. The government has also steadily increased
electricity tariffs in line with an agreed schedule, with the aim of achieving full cost recovery by
2010. The tariff reforms have enabled the government to reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit from
around US$271 million percent in 2005 to US$185 million in 2008. However, aside from
undertaking an audit of Talco's financial statements, the government has made little progress in
improving the corporate governance of the country's most important state-owned enterprise.

105.    PDPG 4 will support a measure to improve the transparency of state-owned
enterprises. As a benchmark, the operation will support continued implementation of the
financial management improvement program at the two energy utilities. Specifically, the utilities
will maintain appropriate institutional structures, including the financial management
improvement program working groups, and procure all the related consultants services and the
necessary hardware and software.

106.     The PDPG 5­6 will support measures to improve governance of Tajikistan's energy
utilities. The proposed operation will continue to support implementation at Barki Tajik and at


                                                37
Tajiktransgas of the financial management improvement program (including migration to an
international financial reporting system) in line with the agreement specified in the Energy Loss
Reduction Project and the January 2006 memorandum of understanding. In addition, it will
support publishing the financial reports prepared in compliance with International Financial
Reporting Standards and audited in accordance with International Standards on Audit.

107.    Expected results. By the end of the programmatic series:

        Financial viability of Barki-Tajik and Tajiktransgas increases (measured by increase
        in cash collection ratio to the billed consumption).
         Barki Tajik baseline (2009): 71.8 percent. Target (2012): 92 percent.
         Tajiktransgas baseline (2009): close to 100 percent. Target (2012): close to 100
           percent.
        Efficiency of energy sector improves (measured by a decline in total losses).
         Barki Tajik baseline (2009): 13.1 percent. Target (2012): 11 percent.
         Tajiktransgas baseline (2009): 14.6 percent. Target (2012): 12 percent.

                             6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

108.    Poverty and social impact of this operation is likely to be positive. An objective of
the proposed operation is to protect delivery of basic services: health, education, and social
protection. This will directly benefit poor and vulnerable people, by ensuring their access to
services does not decline as a result of a budget revenue shortfall. In the medium term,
strengthening farmers' rights to land and freeing them of cotton sector debt is likely to lead to
greater agricultural profitability and lower rural poverty. A stronger financial sector will benefit
the poor by expanding access to affordable financial services. More reliable and lower cost
energy services will help promote growth--essential for poverty reduction. In addition,
provisions to ensure that low-income Tajiks have access to a basic minimum level of service at
affordable rates will directly benefit the poor. Adoption of a modern aviation policy will improve
access and reduce the cost of transport for low-income migrants. A reduced burden of regulation
on business will stimulate private investment, required for growth and job creation. Finally,
better public financial management will result in the less waste of public funds.




                                                   38
109.     In general, reforms supported by the proposed operation are expected to stimulate
economic growth and reduce poverty. For example, farmers are expected to face stronger
incentives to produce crops that can be produced and marketed profitably. Resource allocation
within the energy sector and across the economy is expected to improve through cost recovery
tariff reform and more effective management of the existing energy infrastructure. The private
sector will benefit from the aviation sector reforms as they will reduce the cost of transportation,
stimulate investment and improve profitability of enterprises. In addition, the reforms are
expected to improve consumers' welfare and promote the free movement of labor. The poor will
be assured of access to health, education, and social protection services, essential to maintain and
enhance their ability to contribute to economic growth once global conditions improve.

110.    Consultations and outreach are being conducted on the proposed operation to
ensure that it reflects the views of a broad range of stakeholders. Discussions are held
regularly in Dushanbe with government officials across ministries and agencies, other
development partners, and the private sector on the overall reform program. These will continue
as preparation of the proposed PDPG 4­6 series proceeds. It is expected that additional PSIAs
will be defined and carried out in key areas of reform in consultation with the government during
the course of this operation.

                                 B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

111.    The conclusion of an environmental screening of the proposed reforms, undertaken
as per the requirements of OP 8.60, is that the reforms are not likely to be significant from
an environmental point of view. Details of the analysis for each reform area follow.

        Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic stability is necessary for
        economic growth and poverty reduction, which may indirectly generate environmental
        benefits by encouraging the adoption of modern technologies which use resources more
        efficiently than those they replace.

        Reforming permits. Reform of permits in general will facilitate business entry and
        growth and reduce costs for businesses. This will result in uncertain environmental
        impacts, depending on the sectors that attract new investment, and the availability and
        cost-effectiveness of new technology. The reforms may be positive for the environment
        if they attract businesses into the formal sector, since formal businesses are more likely to
        comply with environmental policies. In time, streamlining of specific environmental
        permitting rules will be necessary to ensure positive environmental outcomes from the
        reform process.

        Aviation sector reform. The proposed operation seeks to improve efficiency and enhance
        competition in aviation. Although increased competition is expected to raise the number
        of flights between Tajikistan and other countries, this is expected to lead to adoption of
        more fuel-efficient, less noisy aircraft by the Tajik State Airline, with an overall benign
        impact on the environment. The operation does not support investment in airports, which
        is being supported by other development partners. The environmental oversight for this
        activity is with the Committee on Environment Protection under the Government of
        Tajikistan.

        Reforming agricultural institutions. The proposed operation aims to strengthen farmers'
        control over agricultural decisions. This will have only indirect, if any, impacts on the



                                                39
        environment. An increase in the profitability of agriculture may lead to bringing more
        land under production, to greater use of agricultural chemicals, or to more intensive use
        of water resources. The task team is aware of the risks and is coordinating actively with
        ongoing Bank projects, including the Land Cadastre Project and the Ferghana Valley
        Development Project to monitor and mitigate the potential environmental impacts arising
        from agricultural production and to strengthen capacity of the government to address
        related environmental issues.

        Energy sector reform. Much of the forest loss in Tajikistan is due to lack of access to
        energy supply in remote rural areas. In the long term a more efficient energy sector is
        expected to reduce these pressures. Main reforms in energy sector involve institutional
        strengthening and transparency measures. The proposed operation does not support any
        investment operation for constructing new dams. Environmental impact assessments of
        future energy investments will be carried out under the projects that support them.

        Reforming public sector management. The operation will support implementation of
        reforms of public sector management aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness
        of the public service and the delivery of health and education services. These reforms are
        not expected to have any impact on the environment. Efforts will be made in the future
        through these reforms to improve the efficiency and accountability of environmental
        agencies.

112.     As a newly independent country emerging from a civil war, neither awareness of
environmental issues nor institutional capacity to address them are well developed in
Tajikistan. This is now changing. Tajikistan's PRS 3 recognizes water pollution, soil
degradation, water pollution, deforestation, and biodiversity conservation as environmental
priorities and proposes a range of measures to address them. Tajikistan is an active party to
several United Nations conventions and has prepared a National Strategy for Combating
Desertification (2002), and a National Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan (2003). The
country has also adopted environmental laws and regulations, including a requirement that
environmental impact assessments are conducted for all new economic activities. The Recipient
also imposes fees and fines on all major polluters. This function is implemented by the
Committee on Environment Protection under the Government of Tajikistan.

113.     Capacity is being strengthened through a number of Bank-supported projects. The
government is strengthening its the capacity to assess and mitigate environmental impacts of
economic activities through training and hands-on experience. The Bank, through four ongoing
rural development projects, is strengthening the local line departments by supporting the
upgrading of their national and local level analytical laboratories and training their staff with
internationally-recruited environmental and natural resource protection specialists. The Bank has
also assisted the government in holding conferences and workshops on natural resource and
environmental management and in disseminating their proceedings to the public. Additional
measures to strengthen the government's institutional capacity for environmental management
will be addressed through the Bank's country program and programs of other development
partners.

114.     Opportunities for mainstreaming environmental issues in government policies and
programs, and additional measures to strengthen capacity for environmental management
have been identified through a country environmental analysis. With support of a multidonor
trust fund, the government undertook a country environmental analysis in 2007/08. This was
aimed at deepening the understanding of the country's major environmental challenges, and


                                               40
assessing capacity within the country (both public and nongovernment) for sound environmental
management. The findings of the analysis are guiding support of the Bank and other
development partners to strengthen capacity in Tajikistan for sound environmental management.
Currently Bank's climate change trust fund work is helping define technical assistance needs.

                  C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

115.     Amount and tranching. The proposed operation is the first of three programmatic
single-tranche operations. It provides an IDA grant in the amount of US$25.4 million equivalent.
Funds would be available upon effectiveness, expected in during the first half of fiscal 2010.

116.    Executing agency. The Ministry of Finance is the executing agency. The Executive
Office of the President is the implementing agency, and the State Advisor of the President of
Tajikistan for Economic Policy is responsible for coordinating actions among the ministries and
agencies involved, and for monitoring and reporting on progress. The Office of the Prime
Minister will provide overall guidance and oversight. The Executive Office of the President will
be responsible for implementing the public sector reforms. The agencies and line ministries
involved (NBT, agriculture, energy, and transportation, and labor) are accountable for
implementing the reforms under their responsibility. The State Committee for Investments and
State Property Management will be responsible for overseeing specific policy actions related to
streamlining of business regulation.

117.     Monitoring and evaluation. Bank staff will continuously monitor implementation of
the reforms specified in the program matrix of the proposed operation to ensure that progress
towards outcomes is made during the three year program. The program documents for the second
and third operation will report on progress with implementation. Country capacity for monitoring
is to be strengthened through the ongoing Bank-supported Statistical Capacity Building Project.
The proposed PDPG 4­6 will draw on government data and indicators of the PRS 3 to the extent
possible in monitoring results. DFID, the EC, and the Asian Development Bank are also
providing support to strengthen capacity for statistics and monitoring and evaluation. An
implementation completion report will be issued within six months following the closing date of
the three-year PDPG 4­6.

                                   D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

118.    The country's public financial accountability is weak. The 2004 country public
financial accountability assessment and the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) showed, among other aspects: (a) poor systems of public
accountability and weak mechanisms for public sector transparency, (b) weak internal control
systems and internal audit function, (c) weak institutional capacity to implement some of the
budget reforms being undertaken, (d) fragmented budgets and poor cash management, (e) lack of
transparency in state-owned enterprises, and (f) weak capacity within the legislative bodies to
provide effective oversight over the working of the government. The Public Finance
Management Modernization Project, financed by IDA, is already addressing many of the
weaknesses, including modernization of the treasury system and introduction of public sector
accounting standards.

119.    Tajikistan has made substantial progress since then in various aspects of the public
financial management. For example, the organic budget system has been thoroughly revised,
the budget classification system has been changed, the treasury system has been modernized by


                                              41
introducing automation, a treasury single account has been established, quarterly budget
execution reports are now routinely prepared, and external audits have become more timely. In
addition, through a grant of the Institutional Development Fund, Tajikistan has enacted a modern
public procurement law. However, the restructuring of the government that took place following
the elections of November 2006 undermined the independence of the external audit institution
and weakened the effectiveness of public external auditing. The Bank and other development
partners have since then provided advisory support to the government on establishing an
independent external audit function. The Executive Office of the President has approved a
strategy and plan of action for establishment of an independent external audit function. The
strategy and action plan are currently being implemented by a working group appointed by a
presidential order in July 2009.

120.    Capacity to implement good policies needs to be developed. The adoption of good
policies is not enough to improve performance. Capacity is also needed. The government is
implementing the Public Financial Management Modernization Project. This together with the
Public Sector Reform Project is expected to strengthen capacity to implement improved systems
of public financial management systems. The 2007 PEFA provides a baseline for measuring
progress with reforms in public financial management. A three year programmatic public
expenditure review (completed in 2008) led by the Bank in close collaboration with key donors
(EC and DFID) is assisting government in addressing institutional and capacity constraints related
to introducing the medium-term expenditure framework and improving budget efficiency. A
Report on Observance of Standards and Codes issued in January 2007 is helping the government
to reform the accounting and auditing legislation and practices in the country. Strengthening of
the fiduciary aspects of the education sector under the Fast Track Initiative is assisting in
improving systems in education and, ultimately, across the government. Despite the progress,
fiduciary risk will need to be monitored closely on a continuous basis.

121.     NBT governance requires further strengthening. The IMF's May 2010 update of the
safeguards assessment of the NBT confirmed that safeguard risks are high. The safeguards
assessment noted that, although initial steps have been taken to address the risks identified by the
special audit on cotton sector financing, considerable weaknesses remain in key functions.
Accounting of financial information is still fragmented. The internal audit mechanism is weak
and does not cover certain core operations. Due to the `silo' organizational structure, inadequate
controls over financial reporting and a complete absence of any oversight bodies, and basic
access to broad and complete information remains restricted. Consequently, data and operational
integrity continue to lack transparency and remain a concern. Restoring the credibility of the
central bank and building the required capacity in key functions, such as internal audit and
financial reporting will require more time. The safeguards assessment also made long-term
recommendations, which the authorities have incorporated in the NBT action plan under their
IMF supported program. The audit of the NBT's financial statements for the year ending April
2009 has been completed and the reports published on the NBT's website. In addition, the audit
of the net international for end-June 2009 was completed and the report is also available on the
NBT's website, while that for end-December 2009 is being finalized. The NBT has not initiated
quarterly internal audits because of capacity constraints. Instead, the NBT plans to hire an
external firm to provide internal audit coverage of the activities within the international relations
department, which inherently carries the highest operational and financial risk. The authorities
also developed a recapitalization strategy for the NBT with IMF assistance, and the NBT's cotton
debt department was closed in June 2009.

                               E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

122.    Disbursement. The Recipient is the Republic of Tajikistan. The proceeds of the Grant
will be disbursed in one single tranche upon effectiveness of the Financing Agreement. The
Recipient will open and maintain a separate foreign currency deposit account (in US dollars) at
the NBT, as part of the official foreign exchange reserve. At the request of the Ministry of
Finance, the Association will deposit the proceeds of the IDA Grant into the foreign currency
deposit account. Disbursement of the Grant will be in line with the Association's procedures for
development policy lending. The government will utilize the proceeds of the Grant in foreign
currency for either foreign debt servicing or for crediting the local currency equivalent into the
deposit account for financing budget expenses. If the Grant proceeds are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Association will require the Recipient to
refund the amount directly to IDA, in which case IDA will cancel an equivalent amount of the
Grant.

123.    Reporting and auditing arrangements. Through the Ministry of Finance, the Republic
of Tajikistan will provide confirmation of the amounts withdrawn and/or transferred from the
deposit accounts, including bank account numbers, date and names of beneficiaries, and ensure
that the proceeds of the Grant are not used for ineligible expenditures defined in the IDA
"negative list" as agreed during negotiations and specified in the Financing Agreement. The final
statement on the utilization of the proceeds of the foreign currency, showing the total amount
deposited into the deposit account and the transactions from this account to the ultimate
beneficiaries' accounts will be independently audited in accordance with terms of reference
agreed with IDA and by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit of the deposit
account is to be conducted once at the end of the fiscal year following utilization of the final
balance in the deposit account. The audit report will be submitted to the association not later than
four months after the end of the fiscal year.

                               F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION


124.    Successful implementation of the medium-term reform program faces four
main risks, for which mitigation measures have been identified. These are general
macroeconomic risks, risks related to poor governance and corruption, program
specific risks, and other structural risks.

        General macroeconomic risks. First, overall macroeconomic management may
        deteriorate due to a stalled global recovery which could lead a reversal to the recent
        improvements. A fall in remittances or exports, a decline in revenues, a depreciation of
        the exchange rate, or a reduction in personal incomes could pressure the government to
        borrow or increase its fiscal deficit. Second, the asset quality of the banking sector
        deteriorated rapidly during the financial crisis and the possibility of a banking crisis
        cannot be excluded. Third, political or economic instability in neighboring countries
        poses a significant risk to Tajikistan. Such instability could lead to closures of borders or
        disruption of trade and challenge the benefit of investing in hydropower intended for
        export. Apart from pursuing suitable economic policies to diversify its exports, as an
        active member of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, Tajikistan is
        addressing some of these trade and transportation issues through regional cooperation
        efforts. However, periodic border tensions are not uncommon.




                                                43
   Risks related to poor governance. Tajikistan's public financial management system is
   characterized by poor internal controls, lack of transparency, weak governance, low
   capacity, poor cash management and budget execution, all of which undermine efforts to
   enforce fiscal discipline. During implementation, fiduciary risks will be mitigated by: (a)
   creating a dedicated foreign currency account into which Bank funds will be disbursed,
   (b) regular reporting on the use of funds disbursed, and (c) requiring an independent audit
   on the use of funds provided under the proposed operation. In addition, the following
   actions will be required in order to realize longer term progress in public financial
   management: (a) commitment by the authorities to implement key recommendations of
   the 2007 PEFA, the Country Procurement Assessment Report, and IMF reports; (b)
   satisfactory implementation of the Public Sector Reform Project, and the Public Financial
   Management Modernization Project. Progress in strengthening the public financial
   management will be assessed through the IMF fiscal transparency Reports on Observance
   of Standards and Codes (completed in January 2007), and a fiduciary update conducted
   by the Bank in fiscal 2008. A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes on
   accounting and auditing, completed in early 2009, has further deepened understanding of
   the current situation and recommended measures for reform. The 2007 PEFA is
   providing baseline data against which to benchmark Tajikistan against other countries
   and to measure progress in the area of public financial management. The Bank will
   support opportunities for candid dialogue between the government and other stakeholders
   on the issues, and will support civil society's efforts to be able to better track and monitor
   the use of government funds. The Bank sees closer collaboration with donor partners as
   key to moving this agenda forward.

   Program-specific risks. Tajikistan's institutions remain very weak and vulnerable to
   capture by special interests. Stakeholders who benefit from the current institutional
   arrangements are likely to resist reforms that will leave them worse off. Although no
   signs of protest are currently apparent, people who may be worse off from the farmland
   restructuring or changes in the management of irrigation may block reforms. The
   president's overwhelming majority in the February 2010 polls, however, strengthens his
   mandate to implement the reform program. Nonetheless the Bank will continue to
   support reforms by improving and expanding its efforts at communications, emphasizing
   the costs of continuing with the economic status quo, and the long-term benefits of
   reforms. Better dissemination of the findings of Bank-supported analytical work will be
   an important vehicle of this enhanced communications effort, but it will also involve
   proactive efforts, with assistance from the external affairs units in the country office and
   in headquarters. The Bank will regularly monitor progress and actively engage in
   dialogue with government and with the opposition. It will continue to coordinate closely
   with other development partners to monitor and respond to political developments.

   Structural reform risks. The PDPG series supports a program of reforms agreed upon
   with the government which are important but not always central to structural
   strengthening. More difficult areas such as TALCO, Roghun construction, cotton sector
   policies, and judicial reform are outside the scope of this program. However, there is
   complementarity between PDPG supported reforms and the above highlighted
   problematic areas. It is expected that progress under the PDPG series will facilitate more
   attention to these high risk and sensitive reforms areas. Once the government agrees,
   reforms in these areas will be supported. However, if the risks related to the above areas
   materialize in the medium term, it could lead to an unstable environment and spillover
   into other sectors, possibly undermining the PDPG 4­6 reform program.

H.E. Mr. Robert Zoellick
President
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20433

Mr. President,

        I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you and World Bank Group for your
continuous support provided to the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan in implementation
of social and economic and institutional reforms.

        This letter on development policies (hereinafter referred to as LDP) is submitted to
inform of the progress and recent changes in social and economic situation in Tajikistan and
relevant actions for the following mid-term perspective. It is based on the fundamental strategic
documents of the Republic of Tajikistan, including the National Development Strategy up to
2015 (hereinafter referred to as NDS), World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (hereinafter
referred to as CPS) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2010-1012 (hereinafter referred to
as PRSP).

        Overall vision of the state within the strategic development of the country in a long
term perspective is reflected in the NDS and the CPS, while PRSP is a mechanism for
implementation of the NDS objectives and tasks in a medium term perspective. In addition, the
LDP is also drafted based on sector strategic documents such as Public Administration Reform
Strategy (2006), the National Education Sector Development Strategy (NEDS) and National
Health Sector Development Strategy (NHDS) which are presently being implemented under
support of development partners.

        Under CPS for 2010-2013, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan closely
cooperates with World Bank in the context of the Programmatic Development Policy Financing
(hereafter referred to as PDPF) to implement reforms and development of social sector, top
sectors of economy including energy, agriculture, transport infrastructure, aviation, which also
covers issues of improvement of public administration efficiency and promotion of
entrepreneurial activity.

         PDPF actions are aimed at ensuring a sustainable economic development, public sector
reform, private sector development as well as improving quality of provision of public services
in social area. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan continues to show its commitment
to implement these reforms under PDPF, which is proved by success achieved in implementing
three previous tranches of this program, as well as ongoing discussion of the reform program
under the fourth tranche.




                                                45
     I. CRISIS IMPLICATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF MACROECOMOMIC
                               SITUATION

        Progress achieved within a number of structural and institutional reforms during
previous years have been combined with active efforts of the Government aimed at sustainable
economic growth and reduction of the population poverty level. In particularly, GDP growth
averaged 8.6% in 2000-2008, population poverty level decreased from 64% in 2003 up to 47%
in 2009. High level of economic growth could be mostly referred to the ongoing structural
reforms, improvement of environment for private sector development, increase of agricultural
product export, energy sector development as well as growth of volumes of remittances from
labor migrants amounted 2.4 billions of US Dollars as of the end of 2008.

        Economic growth indicators of the Republic of Tajikistan in 2008 were quite high:
despite of severe winter of 2007-2008 the economic growth remained at the level of 8% per
year mainly due to the development of agriculture non-cotton sector and construction. Domestic
demand was mainly stimulated by the remittance that accounted at 51% of GDP at that period.
The state budget has had surplus at the level of 1.5 % of GDP, excluding Public Investment
Program (hereinafter referred as PIP). However, signs of the negative impact of the global
financial and economic crisis have become evident by end of 2008, when the level of remittance
declined substantially and the commercial banks faced liquidity problems.

         Macroeconomic situation started to deteriorate: economic growth for the first 4 months
of 2009 comprised only 2.9 % of GDP, slowdown of the economic growth rate was mainly due
to the slowdown of industrial production rate (decline by 8.1% in Q1of 2009 and by 12% in the
first 4 month of the respective year). During Q1of the previous year export and import declined
by 41% and 11% respectively (the country didn't get about $224 million. only due to reduction
of cotton and aluminum export), volume of remittances dropped by 31% from $2.4 billion in
2008 to $1.6 billion in 2009, the state budget did not collect around 12% of traditional taxes due
to a rapid decline in imports and domestic production. And, moreover, the national currency
depreciated by 25% against US dollar. As a result, the Government has rapidly took measures
to develop a short-term policy to maintain macroeconomic stability during crisis by means of:
a) a balanced fiscal management targeted at inserting relevant amendments to the Law of the
RT on State Budget for 2009 and introduction of anti-crisis budget, b) coordination of fiscal
policy and other measure related to macroeconomic management and, c) ensuring social
protection system of the most vulnerable population groups and maintaining the same level of
employment under the condition of returning labor migrants.

         Adopted in April 2009 the Anti-Crisis Action Plan includes short-term and medium-
term measures in monetary, fiscal, real and social areas of the economy. As a result, high
attention was paid to short-term measures without infringing the reform program for medium-
term and long-term periods. At a later stage, however, there were organized further
consultations at the level of Sector Working Groups on development of a medium-term
development program, what at the end resulted in adoption of PRSP for 2010-2012 in February
2010 and CPS for 2010-2013. Besides, the Government has successfully maintained the
stability of the national currency and full control of the budget deficit through increasing tax
revenue collections and decreasing the debt servicing amount upon external debt restructuring,
as well as increased trade operations on traditional goods and services and development of
domestic non-cotton production in agriculture.

        Despite the difficulties related to the need of mitigating the implications of the global
financial and economic crisis, there was made a timely decision to increase budget expenditures
for social sectors, including for promotion of investment projects and creation of job


                                                46
opportunities within the country. Besides, the actual economic indicators of the Republic of
Tajikistan during crisis were optimistic compared to majority of the CIS countries and allowed
to reach the real GDP growth at 3.4% along with reducing inflation to 6.5% and trade deficit
from 53,2% of GDP in 2008 to 38.7% of GDP by the end of 2009 due to the reduced internal
demand, reduction of world prices for imported energy resources and food products, as well as
depreciation of the national currency which has led in is turn to an increase of export of goods
and services.

        Furthermore, external debt indicators have been significantly improved compared to
previous years as a result of reduction of external debt and positive trend of GDP growth in the
previous years. In particularly, the share of external debt of the Republic of Tajikistan reduced
to a floor level of 33,5% in 2009, while the official reserve funds of the Government of the
Republic of Tajikistan can cover 1.4 months of import of goods and services in 2010. As an
example, the data for the previous year suggests that the same indicator comprised less than 1
month of import of goods and services. However, we acknowledge that low growth rate can
increase the risk of external debt sustainability driven by increase of external borrowing.
Besides, Tajikistan is still vulnerable against external factors determined by the fact that the
prevailing portion of export proceeds comes to aluminum, cotton, energy and labor migrant
remittances. National economy largely depends on import of energy resource and food products
from neighboring countries in the region which also increases the risk of Tajikistan's economic
dependence and vulnerability against external factors which can impact economic development
as a whole.

         To mitigate the risks described above, the Government in line with the increase of
budget financing for social sectors and economic activity intends to continue conducting
institutional reforms in all sectors of economy to extend the use of domestic capacity not only to
ensure high economic growth but reduce poverty level. Public administration reform program
and promotion of private investments in private sector can contribute to the achievement of a
sustainable economic growth in medium term. Besides, additional investments in energy
projects as well as more effective energy infrastructure management in the country can as a
result address the challenge of energy deficiencies in winter time and develop entrepreneurial
activity by expanding production and sale of goods and services both at domestic market and
abroad. In particular, state budget deficit is assumed at the level of 5% of GDP in 2011-2014
including PIP, in order to use the additional investments in infrastructure, energy and transport.
State budget deficit for 2010 is expected at the level of 1% of GDP excluding PIP due to the
possible increase of allocation for social needs and infrastructure projects.

         Particularly in 2007 ­ 2009, the Government has successfully implemented important
reforms measures agreed under the PDPF. We are ready to continue the process of deepening of
reforms in the context of the agreed action program, the implementation of which is planned to
take place within the mid-term perspective. It is planned to implement a number of practical
actions within the PDPF targeted at private sector development and promotion of flow of
foreign investments, as well as improvement of public administration system, and efficiency of
the delivered public services, especially in social sectors.

       II. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT CLIMATE
                             FACILITATION

         Creation of more favorable investment climate and private sector development are the
priority directions of the country. The current activities of the Government with support of
international organizations and donor community are in line with agreed action for private
sector development in PRSP for 2010-2012, including implementation of measures to minimize


                                                47
interference of government structures into business activity and elimination of barriers to enter
the local markets.

          Notwithstanding the international acknowledgement of the Republic of Tajikistan as
one of the top ten reformers in the world based on the Doing Business Report of the World
Bank and International Finance Corporation, the Government of Tajikistan has identified some
priority areas to achieve further substantive progress in the coming years. In particular, the
sector priorities to stimulate entrepreneurial activity and improve financial effectiveness are
energy, transport infrastructure, agriculture, processing of agricultural products and consumer
goods industry. The above mentioned sectors need a favorable investment climate and
conditions for doing business, constant energy supply, goods transportation within the country
and abroad, as well as building of trust of the population to the banking system and domestic
financial market among population in general. Besides, mining and extractive industry (coal,
oil, gas, etc.) can also become a key factor for economic development, because the main tools
facilitating private sector development in the Republic of Tajikistan in the long-term
perspective are the accession to the Extracting Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI),
formulation of the extractive industry sector strategy, analysis of the legal framework in this
area and consultative participation of IFC in bidding process for silver mining Bolshoi
Konimansur. All these actions are implemented under the facilitation of the World Bank

        In addition, recently the audit of financial statements of TALCO was completed and the
results are to be published soon. Based on the results, the Government will continue
implementing institutional reforms targeted to improve efficiency of the financial activity and to
enhance transparency of the state owned enterprises in general.

        The Government priority medium-term measures on institutional component of the
private sector development include streamlining of the registration process of businesses,
improvement of efficiency of customs and tax procedures, as well as streamlining and
regulating licensing processes, inspections of economic entities and permissions to carry out
business activity. Besides, active measures are being undertaken to bring consistency and
harmonize the existing legislation and normative and legal acts to ensure availability of
effective and transparent environment for entrepreneurial activity.

        Licensing, permits and inspections of businesses

         Since 2004 and after adoption of the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan On Licensing
the total number of types of activities subject to inspections by regulating bodies was reduced
from 1500 to 113. Under PDPF 3, the Government made amendments and established the
relevant regulatory framework for practical implementation of this law. Besides, key licensing
ministries and agencies have issued internal decrees to implement laws and bylaws regulating
licensing activity. This, in its turn, ensures maximal clarity among entrepreneurs and regulating
bodies and also excludes any opportunity to violate the requirements of licensing of
entrepreneurial activity. In the future the Government will ensure conduction of a close
monitoring of the observance practice of newly adopted laws in the area of inspections and
licensing to ensure their diligent and effective management by the State Committee on
Investments and State Property Management under the donor support.

        Moreover, in 2009 there was approved a Decree of the President of the Republic of
Tajikistan on Introduction and Monitoring of the "Guillotine" Process for revision of all the
existing permits. There were identified 607 permits in the country. Justifications, however, were
provided by regulating bodies only for 191 permits. As a result, 90 types of permitting
documents were acknowledged as justified for elimination in accordance with the selection


                                                48
criteria, and 101 permits for entrepreneurial activity didn't meet the criteria for revision. The
next step within the context of this reform is the Parliament's endorsement of the new law on
permits system that will for the first time provide a unified legal framework regulating the
permits in the Republic of Tajikistan (in accordance with the Presidential Decree of the
Republic of Tajikistan as of March 7, 2009 #633) and establish a unified order for issuance of
permits, including such simplified procedures of permits issuance, like "silent consent",
"declared responsibility" and "self-assessment" what will significantly decrease entrepreneurs'
costs for receipt of all the necessary permits.

         End of 2009 there was launched `One Stop Shop' mechanism to provide opportunities
for local entrepreneurs to get information, different forms and other services required for
registration and start of his/her business. As of today, One Stop Shop mechanism has been
implemented in 50 out of 68 tax office in the country.

         Besides, on March 26, 2009 there was adopted the Law of the RT on Credit History
fostering establishment of a first credit bureau (in April 2010). The activity of this Bureau will
have a positive impact on improvement of creditors' rights and interests, creation of conditions
for reduction of credit issuance time, as well as to reduce expenditures of financial institutions,
aimed at investigating the possibility of credit repayment by the borrowing entity. In order to
protect state interests, the new law is targeted to protect the banks from bankruptcy, minimize
the risks, and attract foreign investors to the banking and private sector.

        Development of Agriculture and increase of productivity

        After adoption of the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan On Competition and Restriction
of Monopoly Activity at Commodity Markets" in 2006 and relevant amendments to the law in
March 2007, we expect that improved rules for competition and increased level of productivity
in agriculture will create a fair competition among dekhkan farms (farms) and ensure
sustainable growth of this sector in medium term respective.

         The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan with its Cotton Sector Restructuring
Strategy (hereafter referred to as CSRS) has taken a number of crucial measures to address the
challenge of debts of cotton farmers engaged into production and selling of cotton, including the
adoption and implementation of the Cotton Debt Resolution Strategy and facilitation of
development of alternative types (none cotton) of agricultural crops. In particular, the Working
Group that is in charge of controlling the debt write off in cotton sector, was established in July
2009 and received specific procedures for debt write off. As a result of the measures taken,
there were issued 8 724 debts write off certificates equivalent to $549mln. to the farmers and
investors by beginning 2010. These actions in the medium-term perspective shall lead to
increase of productivity, fair distribution of income in the cotton sector, and release of financial
resources of dehkan farms for the purpose of investments to non-cotton agriproducts for further
diversification. It is remarkable that this is already being justified by increase of crops and fruits
in the structure of GDP of the Republic of Tajikistan in 2008 and 2009.

         Another priority of the Government in agriculture sector is restructuring of agricultural
lands by issuance of land use certificates for dehkan farmers in accordance with agreed targets
and standards. Provision of rights to land is a fundamental issue in the context of improvement
of private investment perspectives into agriculture, what will, in its turn allow increasing
productivity and reducing risks through diversifications. According to the decision taken on this
issue, it is expected to issue 37500 land certificates by the end of 2011 and speeding up the
process agriculture land restructuring. Thus, more than 65000 farmers will get rights for land
receiving the land certificates and more than 15000 cotton farms would be relieved from debts.


                                                  49
          However, we realize that universal use of advantages of these innovations will require
time and efforts to be allocated both by farmers and other stakeholders. The Ministry of
Agriculture closely cooperates with the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade to
introduce more flexibility and increase competition in this area as well as considers options for
facilitation of growth through production and selling, including for export purposes, of high-
yielding non-cotton plants of agricultural section what as a result can lead towards increasing of
agriculture share in the overall structure of the country' GDP.

        Energy Sector Reform

         Development of energy sector has been acknowledged as the priority strategic direction
of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan in the long-term perspective. Within the
framework of the agreements reached with international financial institutions, after signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding on a Strategy for Further Development of this Sector in 2006,
the Government implements actions on introduction of a new tariff policy, separation of policy-
making and profit-making functions and revision of the current energy compensation
mechanism for the vulnerable groups of population to protect them from increase of tariffs for
electricity.

         All mentioned above actions under the new tariff policy aim to achieve, first of all, self-
repayment and profitability of the energy sector and, in particularly, of JSHC "Barki Tojik" and
OJSC "Tojiktransgas" after their relevant separation from the Ministry of Energy based on the
Decree of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan issued in March, 2006 . New tariff policy
foresees gradual increase of prices for energy consumption up to the level of 2.1 US cents for 1
kw/h (prices of 2003). We are planning to implement corrective actions in this direction taking
into the situation at the regional energy market. However it should be noted that similar increase
of tariffs for gas consumption in 2008-2010 was caused, first of all, by increase of prices for gas
imported from Uzbekistan.

         Irrespective of the tangible impact of the global financial and economic crisis, state
budget size of financing to compensate costs of vulnerable population has increased in nominal
value by 12% in 2009 in comparison to the previous year due to the increase of prices for
electricity and gas consumption. This compensation mechanism will be applied up to the end of
2010 taking into account the changes of the internal tariff policy.

         The Government has also made efforts to introduce International Financial Reporting
Standards in JSHC "Barki Tojik" and OJSC "Tojiktransgas" under support of the World Bank
Energy Loss Reduction Project. In addition, in 2008 there was conducted an independent audit
of financial and management activities of "Barki Tojik" and "Tojik Gas" by international
auditing companies under support of donor community for further improvement of transparency
and addressing current structural issues in energy sector. Audit results were presented to all
interested stakeholders.

        Beginning 2010 the Government has launched a campaign to attract resources and
voluntary contributions of the population of the Republic of Tajikistan to buy shares of OJSC
Roghun HPP and to maintain financing of relevant repair and continuation of construction
works. In accordance with the agreement achieved with the World Bank and the IMF, the
constructions works at Roghun HPP will continue taking into consideration the results of the
Feasibility Study (FS) and Social and Environmental Impact Assessment of the Project (SEIA).
Ten international companies expressed their interest to participate in the tender process for



                                                 50
conduction of FS and SEIA. Tender for FS and SEIA is expected to take place beginning of
June this year.

        Aviation Sector Reform

         The Government has achieved significant progress in the past years implementing
aviation sector reforms. Taking into account the necessity to reduce costs of the air
transportation and airlines as well as to improve competition and transparency of the aviation
sector, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan has taken steps towards restructuring of
the sector and separating the functions of ground services provision to passengers (airport), air-
traffic control and air transportation (airlines) end of 2008. Separation of balances and financial
activity was completed beginning 2009 and all relevant laws and by-laws were developed and
adopted in a timely manner.

         It should be also noted that in the past years the Government separated the policy
making function from those of technical regulation and investigation of accidents in the aviation
sector. The State Unitary Aviation Enterprise (SUAE) "Tajik Air" and the Department for Civil
Aviation of the Ministry of Transport and Communication have demonstrated their commitment
to the conducted reform activities and are considered to be key bodies involved in the reform
process in this sector. In addition, the Government has also authorized to have regular civil air
flights of several international airlines, including private local airline "Somon Air". This
allowed increasing opportunities for clients and citizens of the country in choosing air routes
and companies and developed a fair competition and relevant decrease of prices for air tickets.
As a result the number of clients using national and international air services increased by 37%
in 2007 in comparison to the previous year (from 0,8 million. - 1,2 million. persons).

       In addition, under support of international financial institutions the Government of the
Republic of Tajikistan has adopted the National Aviation Sector Policy in May 2010 that
includes the issues on increasing passengers' aviation safety, taxation, involvement of the
private sector, planning of airport and aerodrome infrastructure, on the territory of the country
as well as issues on policy development on protection of consumers and compliance with the
recognized international environmental standards. Donor community supports the Government
of the Republic of Tajikistan by providing technical assistance, financial resources and advisory
support for development of aviation infrastructure, ensuring of a competitive environment in the
aviation sector and also by provision of new equipment and communication facilities for the
relevant air terminals.

        As a result Tajikistan will have more air connections with regional and international
markets ­ due to an obvious increase of number of flights ­ from 175 in 2009 to anticipated 250
by the end of 2012. Moreover, there is expected an increase of passengers from 1.35mln in 2008
to 1.8 million. in 2012.

         However, we recognize that reforms in this area will require much more efforts under
support of the donor community to address the current issues of airport management policy,
liberalization of prices, air transportation management, international airlines certification as
well as development of the aviation infrastructure.

            III. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE SECTOR REFORMS

         In the context of market economy development and establishment of respective public
institutions to improve quality of services, Tajikistan is consistent with the NDS and PRS strategic
priorities. The key focus is hence made on implementation of various initiatives on improvement of


                                                 51
public administration system; modernization of resources distribution system by increasing linkages
between medium-term and long-term Government programs and improving of the budget planning
system; increasing effective usage of budget resources in social block; as well as increasing
transparency in budget management and increasing the wage bill size for the workers of the social
sectors. We recognize the importance of priority actions envisaged to reform wage system in the civil
service, enhance horizontal link between civil service institutions and introducing related amendments
into the current legislation to ensure proper implementation of existing and planned reforms. We are
also expressing our gratitude to the international community and to the World Bank in particularly for
the technical assistance and consultative support provided in implementation of the relevant reforms in
the area of public administration and finance.

        Public Administration Reform

Ever since public administration reform strategy was adopted in March, 2006, the Government has
been taking several significant policy measures towards reforming the wage system, public
administration and public finance administration systems. The policy measures also included:

         Effectiveness of the new law of the Republic of Tajikistan "On civil law" (March 13, 2007)
that provides for separation of civil service positions into: political and administrative, recruitment of
civil servants based on the competitive basis, enhanced competences of heads of human resource
departments and units and motivation mechanisms for the merits. To fulfill implementation of the
provisions of the law on civil service, Civil Service Department in 2008-2009 has developed and
adopted a number of by-laws.

        Number of civil servants was reduced through modification of support staff and taking in out
of the civil service structure. Competitive selection process is introduced for recruitment and
promotion of staff. Since April, 2007, vacancies in public service have been filled as per new
recruitment rules and bidding results. Methodological supporting documents on development of job
descriptions have been prepared in accordance with international practice. In the first part of 2009,
Government instructed the ministries and agencies to bring job descriptions of their staff in accordance
with the new methodological recommendations.

         Establishment of the computerized Register of public posts in civil service that has been
developed based on new job classification of civil service under eight categories as well as its
approval, thus providing a foundation for further promotion of wage reform. Significant progress was
achieved in preparation to introduction of the new wage system based on the pay roll that has to
integrate fully all surcharges and allowances remained into the post pay thus increasing the
transparency of wage system. In this regard, piloting of new pay roll is planned for October 2010,
while its full implementation will be done by the end of 2011. At the same time implementation of the
action-plan on introduction of the new pay roll depends on availability of the relevant budget
resources.

        Introduction of the new remuneration system in 2010 in five central agencies, including three
line ministries, the Executive Office of the President and the Civil Service Department, and rolling up
of the new remuneration system to all entities of the public administration in 2011. Moreover,
accelerated increase of the wage fund for the primary healthcare employees compared with employees
of other healthcare level will be implemented to strengthen the primary healthcare. During 2006-2008,
the Government had been increasing salaries for primary medical care personnel (including nurses) at a
higher rate that for other medical staff.

       Development and approval by the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan of a Concept on
Organization of the System of Public Administration, which integrated both the provisions of the


                                                52
Public Administration Reform Strategy (PARS) and key recommendations of the horizontal functional
review (approved early in 2007). According to the Action Plan on Implementation of the Concept
(approved by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan on May 29, 2009), a law on
organization of public administration is being drafted. This law will establish the legal basis for the
institutional system of public administration, enabling to strengthen continuity, efficiency and
accountability of the public administration in the medium term.

        The Strategy of Public Financial Management for 2009-2018 was approved by the Ordinance
of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. To implement the Strategy, the Ministry of Finance
has developed and approved an Action Plan for 2009-2011.

        The Register of positions of healthcare employees has been developed. The purpose of the
Register is to create a basis for developing a new remuneration system in the health sector. The new
Register lists all core and auxiliary positions in the healthcare system, including primary and secondary
healthcare. The Register helped create a grading system based on position categories, which enables
introduce the principle of equal pay for equal (volume of) work in the healthcare sector. The Ministry
of Health has drafted a Regulation on a new pay system in the healthcare sector, which is currently
being coordinated with relevant ministries and agencies.

         Establishment of a fully automated Register of State Positions of the Civil Service is planned
to be finalized during the coming three years.

        As a follow up measure, the Government intends to review, or develop if necessary a legal and
regulatory framework of public administration structure to make sure that functional sharing is
properly exercised and effective public administration is delivered. In this context concurrent activities
are implemented in coordination with the Working Group specifically set up to deal with developing
and implementing the public administration structure concept.

        Modernization of the Public Finance Management System

        Over the past several years the Government has achieved significant results in implementing
budget reform aimed at increasing effectiveness of public finance management. These results are
consistent with the outcomes of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment
(hereafter referred to as PEFA), conducted by the WB in 2007. However, we acknowledge that we
need to do a lot more for further improvement of effectiveness of public expenditures and for
improving quality of public services.

         Specifically, the Government is promoting implementation of the second phase of policy based
budgeting. This work is linked, first of all, with an opportunity to equip line ministries and agencies
with policy management tools for their respective sectors, as well as for planning a package of budget
resources for a medium-term perspective. Presently, the Government's efforts towards extending the
project coverage (all of the social sector block and infrastructure sectors) are supported by a number of
international donor organizations.

        Since the beginning of this year a new administrative segment of budget classification has been
introduced at the republican level budget. This Administrative Classification allows to formulate state
budget at the level of programs and organizations within a fully automated Treasury system. Starting
from 2011, it is planned to expand the introduction of Administrative Classification in the state budget
nationwide. Moreover, a Unified Chart of Accounts will be integrated with the Economic
Classification before end of 2010.




                                                53
         In addition to that, in March 2007 the Government Resolution adopted Public Internal
Financial Control Strategy for further improvement of internal public finance control. During 2007-
2008 there were adopted relevant amendment to the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan on Public
Finance and there was established a Department in the Ministry of Finance responsible for setting of
internal audit standards and methodology in public sector. Apart from that, the existing Department for
Revisions and Control was reorganized into the Department of Internal Financial Audit under the
Ministry of Finance in accordance with the approved Strategy. Overall, this strategy is designed to
promote development of legal and institutional standards and build up Government's capacities in the
area of internal audit.

        By the end of 2007 the Government set up a Working Group, and developed a Strategy and an
Action Plan for establishment of a function and a body of an independent external audit in the
Republic of Tajikistan. As a basis for development of the Strategy and the Action Plan there were
taken thee recommendations reflected in the institutional development plan developed under the
partnership project for establishment of partner relations between the Public Financial Control Body of
Tajikistan and the Supreme Audit Institute of the Great Britain. Presently, the Government finalizes the
process of approving legal and institutional frameworks which will become the basis for
implementation of the Law on External Audit.

        Allocations of budget resources and medium-term expenditure planning

        The Government is in close contact with the international donor community to harmonize
development of policy measures with public expenditures. The Ministry of Finance, for instance, has
ensured a correlation between the Public Investment Program (PIP), which presents foreign grant- and
credit-based financing, and the Annual State Budget approved in accordance with the Law of the
Republic of Tajikistan on State Budget. Apart from that, there was ensured the linkage of the PIP and
the Centralised State Investment Programme (CSIP) with the priorities and actions of the third PRS for
2010-2012 and with other strategic sector-level programs. This work has been done with the extended
support from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.

        Besides, annual update and adoption of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework Document
for a 3 year-period and its inter linkage with the annual budget cycle facilitates effective allocation of
resources within sectors and between social and economic sectors. While the adoption of a 3-year
budget program was not possible in 2009 due to dynamic changes in conjunctures of the domestic
economy, the Ministry of Finance is planning to develop and adopt the respective program in June
2010, before the formal start of negotiations and adopting of the state budget for the next year.

         In order to protect budget allocations for social sectors and any other mandatory budget items
(such as wage bill, pensions, compensations, subsidies to poor regions), the Government has taken
actions to coordinate the minimum budget allocation for social sectors regardless of external or internal
factors that can affect the volume of tax revenues and respectively the aggregate volume of the
country's state budget. Thus, in accordance with the agreements with the IMF and the WB, the amount
of budget allocations for social sectors in 2010 will be maintained minimum at the level of the previous
year. Particularly, budget allocation for education sector shall comprise not less than 17.8% of the state
budget; for health not less than 6.1% of the state budget and for social protection of population not less
than 20% of the state budget.

         Also, first attempts were made towards enhancing transparency and integrity of the budget
system through publishing of Financial Statements of the Ministry of Finance on State Budget
Execution of the Republic of Tajikistan every six months, and strengthening of capacity of support
staff of the relevant ministries and agencies involved into revenue/expenditure projections and into
oversight over state budget execution across regions, districts and respective sectors.


                                                54
        Education Sector Reforms

         Government's efforts aimed at improving the quality of education sector services, and
enhancing efficiency of sector allocations are fully in line with strategic goals reflected in NDS, PRS,
and NSED. Hence, under the program on improving efficiency of limited financial resources in the
education sector, per capita financing mechanism has been proposed to be introduced nationwide
starting Q1 2010. In particular, it was identified that per capita mechanism increases efficiency of
financing in the education sector overall. In parallel, share of school budgets allocated to wage bills is
objectively declining releasing finance resource for improvement of quality of education.

         In addition to improvement effectiveness of budget allocations, the Government under support
of the international donor community contributes to the efforts of educational institutions to increase
the quality of their education services. It should be underlined that quality of education and its
compliance with the modern requirements of socioeconomic realities are the top tasks of the
Government within the medium-term perspective. In particular, a new credit system is being actively
implemented in some higher education institutions of the Republic of Tajikistan and the new
curriculum is being introduced in secondary schools and higher educational institutions under the
Ministry of Education initiative and under support of interested donors. Besides, the Government
conducted school mapping throughout the whole country (to secure a state data management system in
education), the outcomes of which will be disclosed in June 2010 and will serve an analytical basis for
improving level of capacity of the Ministry in developing policies, investment plans and school
infrastructure rationalization. In this regards, as well as a result of per capita mechanism introduction
we are expressing our special gratitude to the World Bank for the implementation of project activities
and technical assistance in education sector.

         It is remarkable that the state budget for 2009 pursuant to the Law of the Republic of
Tajikistan on State Budget exceeds almost in two times the similar sector budget of the previous year.
Moreover, education sector comprises approximately 17.8 % of the total state budget, excluding PIP,
what defines it as one of the sectors of highest priority, which needs significant investments into its
infrastructure and human capital development.

        In the nearest future it is expected that the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Tajikistan
with donor support will introduce a new payroll and carrier development system based on the level of
responsibility and qualification of the education sector employees. Moreover, the Ministry of
Education has been piloting MTEF for the third year and discusses together with the Ministry of
Finance budget applications of educational institutions for the next fiscal year within the framework of
adopted resolutions and internal regulations of two ministries.

        Besides, the Ministry of Education is presently revising the NSED with the expected
presentation of final version of the Strategy to the public and donor community in the first half of
2011.

        Health Sector Reforms

       Health sector is affected by a number of fundamental problems that are treated by the
Government as priority tasks in the context of improving financing system of health facilities, and
enhancing of effectiveness of sector functioning in general.

        Government's efforts are primarily aimed at implementing measures, approved by the Health
Sector Funding Strategy, including: 1) creation of an institutional structure of a "single payer" in health
system; 2) pulling up of public finance sources to secure a package of guaranteed medical services


                                                 55
(basic benefit package); 3) development and implementation of a compensation mechanism for a new
supplier of health-care services; 4) decrease of informal fees in public health system and introducing of
formal co-financing; and 5) reorganization of health services delivery system and fair distribution of
financial resources in health sector.

         The Government takes actions towards improving the primary health care system through
implementation of a per capita financing mechanism nationwide, re-introducing of basic benefit
package, introduction of a new wage grid system for health care workers and rationalization of the
health facilities. Besides, improvement of public health services together with reduction of poverty
level promoted significant infant mortality indicator decline (from 75 cases per 1000 newborns in 2000
to 56 in 2008). Thus, the infant mortality also decreased from 93 to 68 cases per 1000 births. However,
we admit that these indicators are still below average regional indicators, and that there further
improvement might become complicated without respective budget and donor financing as well as
quality improvement of provided public services at risk.

         Moreover, based on the results of analytical analysis prepared by the Ministry of Health and by
international donor organizations the reform of health sector financing, further pilot implementation of
the basic benefit package and functional rationalization of health facilities will continue. In accordance
with the health sector reform measures proposed to take place in the medium-term perspective, a new
Health Sector Development Strategy will be adopted in the nearest future in close cooperation with the
donors.
         The Government is extending its appreciation to the international community and donor
organizations for their continuous support of the on-going reforms in public health sector through
active participation in implementation of above measures, and also for financing specific projects
aimed at improving health services and increasing effectiveness of allocated resources.

CONCLUSIONS

         Taking into account the current social and economic reforms being conducted in industrial
sectors of the economy, and initiatives aimed at improving country's investment climate and private
sector development, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan is firmly committed to continue
implementing respective critical reforms to promote a sustainable economic growth and improvement
of quality of the public services.

        In this context, the World Bank support of the actions of the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan in implementation of the reforms will be significant through approval of the Programmatic
Development Policy Financing.

        We hope for further fruitful cooperation with the World Bank in implementation of the above
reform agenda.

is a precondition for well functioning water user groups, and farmer control over farm management is a precondition for optimizing the agricultural productivity of irrigated areas.

Partnership in Tajikistan's Development Strategy

1.      The Bank's Country Partnership Strategy discussed by the Bank's Board of Executive
Directors on May 25, 2010, aims at reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and
vulnerability, and paving the way for sustained post-crisis recovery and sustained development.
It supports the implementation of Tajikistan's Third Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2010­2012
that was formally approved by the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan in February 2010.

2.      Tajikistan has been badly affected by the 2008/09 global economic crisis. The economy,
which had been growing strongly during from 2000­08, grew by an estimated 3.4 percent in
2009, due to a sharp decline in remittances and a fall in exports of cotton and aluminum.
Remittances, which accounted for nearly 47 percent of gross national product (GDP) in 2008,
declined in 2009 by nearly 31 percent from US$2.4 billion in 2008 to US$1.6 billion in 2009 (see
Figure 1). Exports of goods and services fell by 18.3 percent, due to lower international prices of
cotton and aluminum. Revenues (excluding grants) diminished substantially from 2008 levels.
At the same time, expenditures rose to provide essential services to the population and to
returning migrants who have lost their jobs abroad rose. Budget support from development
partners helped to make up the revenue shortfall, resulting in an overall fiscal deficit in 2009 of ­
0.5. While affected by the global economic downturn, Tajikistan's performance was better than
that of any other country in the region, and significantly exceeded expectations at the start of
2009.

3.      To restore growth to the previous robust levels, Tajikistan now needs to undertake much
deeper structural reforms to improve the business climate, strengthen the financial sector,
promote agricultural diversification, enhance transparency and governance of large state-owned
enterprises, better public financial management, and strengthen regional trade. Growth in non-
cotton agriculture and related agribusinesses following institutional reforms, a restoration of the
inflow of remittances as the Russian economy recovers, increased trade with other countries in
the region and the world, and carefully sequenced investments in hydropower infrastructure have
the potential to support strong growth over the long term.

4.       The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Tajikistan in enhancing macroeconomic stability.
The Fund has encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal consolidation, maintain a
restrictive monetary policy, and manage debt prudently to enhance its sustainability.

5.       The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural issues, including
reforms aimed at reducing poverty, promoting agricultural diversification and growth,
encouraging private sector investment, building public sector capacity, creating transparent public
financial management, and improving governance. The Bank has been supporting policy
dialogue through policy based lending. Following the successful completion of the first series of
Programmatic Development Policy Operations (PDPG) in 2009, the Bank is preparing a new
series of three operations with the first expected to be presented to the Bank's Board for approval
in June 2010. The development objectives of the programmatic series are to protect basic



                                                 83
services within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery
and growth. The series is providing support for reforms to improve the investment climate and to
improve public sector effectiveness.

6.       The development policy operations complement support of investment projects and
technical assistance in health, education, municipal infrastructure, energy, agriculture and rural
development, public financial management, and public sector reform. The Bank in collaboration
with other development partners also undertakes analytical work to provide the basis for policy
dialogue and for investment operations. The November 2009 poverty assessment has deepened
understanding of poverty and its dynamics, and has influenced the focus of the operation on
protecting basic services and on reforming agricultural institutions. Findings of background
studies for the forthcoming Country Economic Memorandum (expected to be finalized in 2010)
and the private sector development strategy (2007) have identified the key constraints to growth
and priority measures to address them, including reforms of the energy sector, of state-owned
enterprises, of agriculture, and of the business regulatory environment.22 An assessment of
implementation of inspections and licensing reforms (July 2009) recommended a regulatory
guillotine to cleanup existing administrative procedures affecting business, such as permits. A
joint 2009 IMF-Bank Financial Assessment Program has identified priority measures to
strengthen the financial sector, and a grant from the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening
Trust Fund is financing technical assistance to further refine the next set of reforms. An aviation
sector note has laid out reforms required to modernize Tajikistan's aviation sector, essential to
foster provision of better quality, higher frequency, and lower cost aviation services. A fiscal
policy analysis (June 2009), a 2008 public and civil service wage note, and a 2005 remittances
note have informed the measures required for macroeconomic stability. A programmatic public
expenditure review is supporting Tajikistan's first public expenditure and financial accountability
(PEFA) review, analyzing the country's prospects for achieving the MDGs and long-term growth,
and providing support for the introduction of the medium-term expenditure framework. Two
public expenditure tracking surveys, one for health and one for education, are promoting
transparency and efficiency of expenditure in these sectors. Drawing on the results of the
surveys, health and education sector fiduciary capacity assessments are identifying the measures
required to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending on these services. A
country environmental analysis (2008) has specified policy and capacity reforms to improve
environmental management.

     Background papers for the country economic memorandum have been prepared on macroeconomic
stability, agriculture, private sector, energy, migration, trade and connectivity, and growth diagnostics.
These have already influenced the design of the recently approved CPS and of new series of programmatic
development policy operations.

World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas

Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is little direct IMF involvement

7.       Areas in which the Bank leads and there is little direct IMF involvement include the
social sectors, infrastructure, and environmental management. In the social sphere, the Bank has
carried out regular poverty assessments to monitor poverty and develop programs to alleviate
poverty, the most recent of which was issued in November 2009. Under the Strengthening
National Statistics System Project, data collection of a new living standards survey was
completed in 2009; analysis of the results is underway.

8.        In education, the Bank is providing policy advice and investment resources. The
ongoing Education Modernization Project (fiscal 2003) aims to upgrade the basic education
system by supporting reforms in education financing and management, curriculum and textbooks
development; teacher training and student assessment improvement, and upgrading school
facilities. Tajikistan has also received grant funding from the Education for All Fast Track
Initiative catalytic fund, administered by the Bank. Key issues in education, apart from
infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity building, are pay reform, and education financing
reform, and implementation of measures to improve efficiency of resource use. Assistance to this
sector will continue through the PDPG, a multi-donor education investment program, and the
Public Sector Reform Program. The Bank is also helping with wage reform in education through
the PDPG. Jointly with the UNICEF the Bank assists the government in the overall national
education strategy formulation.

9.       In health, the Bank is helping the government to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of delivery--both of which are aimed at ensuring the poor access to a basic level of
services. Through the Community and Basic Health Project and the PDPG, the Bank is helping
to strengthen the institutional capability (both at the center and district levels) to carry out health
care reforms, to improve the system for budgeting and spending for basic health services, and pay
reform. It is also supporting programs to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other
communicable diseases. The Avian Fluenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and
Response is minimizing the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza infection and other
zoonoses posed to humans and poultry; and preparing for control and respond to influenza
pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.

10.      With regard to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services for the population as a whole and especially the poor. The Dushanbe Water
Supply Project is helping the Dushanbe municipality and the local water company to address the
most critical deficiencies of water supply services. The Pamir Private Power Project is
supporting improvements in reliability of electricity supply in the Gorno Badakshan region with
participation of the private sector. The Energy Loss Reduction Project is helping to reduce
commercial losses and improve the financial viability of the power and gas sectors. The Bank
has also been leading policy dialogue (under the PDPG) on increasing efficiency/viability to
ensure long-term growth prospects of the energy sector. The Municipal Infrastructure Project is
providing support to improve urban infrastructure in big towns.

11.      In agriculture, the Bank is concentrating on restructuring farmland, rehabilitating
irrigation and drainage infrastructure, and reforming the cotton sector. The PDPG is leading the
dialogue on farmland restructuring and cotton debt resolution. The Land Registration and
Cadastre Project is assisting the government with the issuance of land certificates, and
establishment of a modern cadastre system. The Ferghana Valley Project aims to increase water


                                                  86
supply and efficiency of irrigation systems in the Ferghana Valley, and develop institutional
capacity in land and water resources management. The Cotton Sector Recovery Project is
helping to improve the livelihoods of cotton farmers and to create conditions for sustainable
growth of cotton production in selected, low-income areas. The Community Agriculture and
Watershed Management Project is improving agricultural livelihoods and sustainable land
management in upland areas.

12.      The Bank is supporting measures to improve environmental management and to deal
with natural disasters through all its investment projects. A 2008 Country Environmental
Analysis has highlighted the country's most severe environmental issues and proposed measures
to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for addressing them.

13.    The Bank also supported the government in coping with emergencies. The Energy
Emergency Project assisted the government in implementing an Energy Emergency Mitigation
Action Plan to address the energy crisis in 2008 due to the harshest winter in 25 years. Through
the Global Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund, the Emergency Food Security and Seed
Imports Project and Community and Basic Health Project Additional Financing assisted the
government in mitigating the impacts of food prices crisis in 2008.

Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF program

14.     The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the PDPG series. Institution
building and technical assistance in support of PDPG structural reforms come from several
sources, including the Public Sector Reform Program, the Education Modernization Project, the
Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Grant, and the Community and Basic Health Project.

15.     The Bank and the Fund both support private sector development, including in the areas
of financial transparency and improvements in the regulatory framework. The Bank is preparing
a Country Economic Memorandum to identify the key constraints to growth and propose
solutions to overcome them. The Bank Group has also undertaken investment climate
assessments, small and medium enterprise surveys, and agriculture sector reviews to deepen
understanding of issues affecting performance in specific areas. Tajikistan has participated in
Doing Business surveys and in Business Environment and Enterprise Performance surveys since
the mid-2000s. These provide insight into trends within Tajikistan to improve the business
environment and show how Tajikistan is performing relative to other countries of the region. The
Bank has supported the preparation of the government's private sector development strategy,
which is now under implementation with support of an Institutional Development Fund grant.

16.      Regulatory reforms include (a) changing role of anti-monopoly agency and further
strengthening its capacity, (b) improving the inspection regime for businesses; and (c)
streamlining the licensing and permitting systems. In addition, under the PDPG, the Bank is
assisting with reforms aimed at fostering competitive, convenient, and safe aviation services. It
has supported the preparation and adoption of the national aviation sector policy. Previously, it
assisted with separating in aviation the functions of policymaking, technical regulation, and
accident investigation, with the aim of increasing the transparency and performance of operations.
It is has also helped with the restructuring the Tajik Air Company aimed at creating separate
entities to operate the airport, airline, and air traffic control system. This aviation sector reforms
are expected to increase the competitiveness of Tajikistan's aviation sector, with benefits for
economic growth and poverty reduction.




                                                 87
17.      While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the private
sector, the IMF has also a strong interest in these areas, since many of these reforms are critical to
achieving macroeconomic stabilization and enhancing growth. Accordingly, the two institutions
maintain an active dialogue with each other on these matters to ensure good coordination of
interventions.

Areas of shared responsibility

18.      The Bank and the Fund are working jointly in the following four main areas (supported
by the Bank's PDPG, grants, and several investment operations, and the Fund's Extended Credit
Facility):

        Public sector management. The Bank has provided technical support to the government
        to develop a comprehensive public administration reform strategy. It includes policy
        actions in public administration reforms aimed at redefining the role of the state in line
        with the market economy needs, reorganizing key ministries, strengthening the internal
        control and audit function, and supporting the pay reform. The Bank is involved in civil
        service reform while the Fund is providing technical assistance in support of tax and
        customs administration and treasury management.

        Public financial management. Both institutions work on providing support for a
        treasury, adoption of new law on public finances introducing modern budgetary
        procedures and improved fiscal management, and switching from norm-based costing
        and allocation of expenditures to per capita based financing in education and health
        sectors. The Bank will continue to provide technical support and mobilize donor funds to
        implement the medium-term budget framework. The Bank will also continue to support
        reform of public financial management through the PDPG, Institutional Development
        Fund grants, and the Public Financial Management Modernization Program.

        Financial sector reforms. This area includes the acceleration of financial sector
        restructuring and closure of weak banks, a new regulatory framework for the
        establishment of non-bank intermediaries, and significant changes in the tax code making
        tax authorities' access to bank accounts conditional on a court authorization. In terms of
        banking supervision, the IMF is monitoring the closure and merger of banks that do not
        satisfy prudential requirements. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (the country's
        first), carried out jointly by the Bank and the Fund, was discussed with the authorities in
        late 2007. The Bank is administering a grant from the FIRST trust fund to support
        implementation of the assessment's recommendations, especially reforms at the National
        Bank of Tajikistan.

        Utilities reform. The Fund included in its program supported under the Extended Term
        Facility a structural benchmark on preparing and releasing to the public external audits of
        the financial statements of Talco, the state-owned aluminum company, and Talco
        Management. The Bank is providing financial assistance to help Barki Tajik and
        Tajiktransgas to improve its financial management. It is also assisting repair the
        electricity and gas transmission system, to import the energy needed to meet periodic
        winter shortfalls, and to help implement the Energy Emergency Action Mitigation Plan.
        The Bank-supported Energy Loss Reduction Project is supporting implementation of
        reforms.

        Debt sustainability analysis: The Bank and the IMF have started carrying out joint debt
        sustainability analyses (DSA). The most recent update was prepared in March 2010.

Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank program

19.     The Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall envelope for public
expenditures. The Bank's work in key sectors, such as health, education and infrastructure,
necessitates close cooperation.

20.     In the budgetary area, the Fund is taking the lead on tax reforms and budget preparation
and execution. The IMF also leads the dialogue on polices to rationalize and contain
expenditures in the public sector. These include policies regarding wage setting in both the
public service, and defining the ceiling for public investment expenditures. In these areas, the
Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF and ensures that its own policy
advice is consistent with the Fund's.

Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement

21.     The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary policies,
tax policy, external trade policies, and issues involving economic and financial statistics. The
Bank-financed Strengthening National Statistics System Project is improving Tajikistan's
capacity to collect, analyze, and disseminate key information required for evidence-based
decision-making.

IDA funding

22.      The indicative IDA15 allocation for Tajikistan is projected to be about US$86.6 million
(SDR 55.9 million), about 13 percent lower, in absolute terms, than under IDA14 (SDR 64.6
million). About US$30 million of the IDA 15 envelope was allocated in fiscal 2009. The
remaining allocation (about US$57 million) will finance operations in fiscal 2010 and 2011.
More than half the IDA 15 allocation will support the PDPG, and the remainder will be
distributed across investment activities. Trust funds, which will nearly match the IDA allocation
in fiscal 2010­11, will continue to play an important role in supporting the Bank's program. In
addition to these resources, Tajikistan will receive additional funding equivalent to US$23.4
million (SDR 15.3 million) in fiscal 2010 from the IDA Crisis Window to address the impacts of
the global crisis and it may be eligible to access IDA regional funds and IBRD enclave loans for
infrastructure that promises to deliver high returns. The fiscal 2010 IDA allocation to Tajikistan
will be 100 percent grant. Tajikistan's eligibility for grants is determined based on the annual
debt sustainability analyses.

                     Annex 6: Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)--an Update

This update by Fund staff incorporates new developments since the DSA prepared at the time of the
2009 Article IV consultation and Tajikistan's request for access under the ECF (EBS/09/43), and
reflects the latest guidance on preparing DSAs (SM/10/16). The update shows that when remittances
are taken into account as foreign exchange inflows, the vulnerability indicators are substantially
lower than previously assessed and remain below their respective thresholds. However, this does not
change Tajikistan's rating of being at high risk of debt distress, which is based on indicators that do
not account for remittances.

                           I.         Main Changes Since the Previous DSA

1.     The main changes regarding the macroeconomic outlook and assumptions since the
previous DSA include:

        Lower GDP growth to reflect the impact of the global crisis (by a half percentage point);

        External borrowing on concessional terms to finance $560 million in foreign exchange needs
        during 2011-14 for the Roghun HPP construction at IDA terms;

        Augmented access under the Fund's Extended Credit Facility (ECF) from 90 to 120 percent
        of quota, resulting in additional disbursements of SDR26.1 million.23

2.      This update also incorporates remittances as a foreign exchange inflow comparable to
exports, in line with the revised DSA guidelines (SM/10/16). In Tajikistan, remittances mainly
from Russia, have proved to be a fairly stable and significant source of income, averaging 30­40
percent of GDP over the past years. Under these circumstances, remittances can be included in the
denominators of debt burden indicators, following the modified DSA methodology.

                                II.     External Debt---Risk Assessment

The revised DSA shows improved debt sustainability when including remittances in the calculations
of the debt indicators, with only the extreme shock scenario breaching the respective thresholds. Still,
Tajikistan remains at high risk of debt distress, given that in a DSA without remittances, there are
prolonged breaches of the policy thresholds24

3.      External debt ratios remain below the policy thresholds when remittances included into
the denominators of the modified debt burden ratios (Figure 1). Compared to the original DSA
(without remittances), the modified DSA (with remittances) shows that the debt ratios under the
baseline scenario remain under the policy thresholds, and that breaches occur only under the most
extreme shocks and under high investment-low growth scenario for debt-to-GDP plus remittances
ratio.




23
   In addition, Tajikistan received equivalent of US$128 million as part of the new SDR allocation to IMF
members, but used only about US$17 million in 2009 to retire expensive external debt.
24
   DSA with (without) remittances refers to DSA, in which remittances are incorporated (not incorporated) in
denominators of debt burden indicators.

                                                    91
4.      However, Tajikistan's risk of debt distress remains high because of significant and
prolonged breaches of thresholds under the baseline scenarios and stress tests in the DSA
without remittances (Figure 2). In particular, the debt-to-export ratio significantly exceeds the
threshold throughout the projected period, and the debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the threshold during
2014-2019, albeit only marginally.

5.      Compared to the previous DSA, the debt indicators in the DSA without remittances
have worsened, in part reflecting revised external financing needs for the Roghun hydropower
project while making very conservative assumptions with respect to the project's impact on
growth. The worsening is mainly due to additional external borrowing to finance Roghun, as well as
a lower discount rate applied in the DSA. Other effects come from downward revision to growth
projections, and further domestic currency depreciation.25 Alternative scenarios and stress tests
demonstrate additional vulnerabilities of debt outlook to lower GDP growth, real exchange rate
shocks, and non-concessional or new concessional borrowing. In the absence of a feasibility study
for Roghun HPP, conservative estimates of Roghun's impact on growth have been used in this DSA.
These estimates will likely be revised upward once the feasibility study, currently undertaken by the
World Bank, is completed.

6.      With respect to the proposed ECF augmentation from 90 to 120 percent of quota, the
DSA suggests that no serious additional risks to debt sustainability arise. Within the DSA
framework, the reason is that the ECF is provided currently on highly concessional terms. More
generally, given that the authorities are committed to using the Fund disbursements to build reserves,
the ECF leaves the country's net wealth position unchanged. Furthermore, in the absence of
additional Fund financing, the BOP risks increase with potentially serious negative effects on growth.

                                             III.     Public Debt

7.       The DSA demonstrates that public debt is sustainable, however risks could increase if
fiscal deficits are not contained and/or growth dividends from high investments do not
materialize (Figure 3). Both baseline scenario and a scenario incorporating additional debt issuance
to implement the cotton debt resolution strategy show that public debt remains sustainable. Under the
cotton debt resolution strategy, the government is expected to compensate commercial banks and the
NBT for losses incurred as a result of financing of the cotton sector. The public DSA's cotton debt
resolution scenario reflects the extreme case that assumes that government securities amounting to
10 percent of GDP--the upper bound of the expected bond release--are issued at the refinancing rate
of the National Bank of Tajikistan, and that there is no fiscal policy response.26 Under low growth
and/or fixed primary balance scenarios public debt is unsustainable. The later highlights the risk
associated with insufficient fiscal consolidations compared to that assumed in the baseline scenario.




25
    Compared to last DSA, the discount rate was revised downwards from 5 to 4 percent to reflect new global
financial conditions.
26
    The actual costs, including recurrent interest costs, are likely to be much lower, as suggested by the recent
MCM mission. Part of the above mentioned cotton debt on banks' balance sheets have already been replaced by
government bonds carrying 2 percent interest rate--i.e. much lower rate than assumed in the DSA.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and  = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
            assuming
(implicitlyan offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

(i) facilitate external adjustment through exchange rate flexibility, while providing for sufficient
fiscal resources to meet growing social spending needs; (ii) follow up on the recommendations
from the special audit of the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) to strengthen NBT governance;
and (iii) continue with structural reforms and the public investment program--financed by grants
or concessional external borrowing--to strengthen Tajikistan's growth potential.

2.       Performance under the program in 2009 was broadly satisfactory, but delays in
completing the safeguards assessment led to the first and the second reviews being
combined. The authorities have requested waivers for nonobservance of two performance
criteria on grounds that the breaches were minor and temporary, and that remedial actions are
being taken.

3.       Even with current access under the Extended Credit Facility, Tajikistan is faced
with a balance-of-payments financing need of about US$116 million in 2010. Tajikistan's
external position remains vulnerable as reserves are low (about 1.1 months of imports at end-
200928) and fragility in the banking sector--which is vulnerable to sudden large exchange rate
movements--is high. In addition, intermittent disruptions of trade flows via Uzbekistan could
weigh on exports and growth. In this context, the authorities have requested an augmentation of
access under the Extended Credit Facility to US$166 million (SDR 104 million, 120 percent of
quota) on the basis of a revised assessment of balance of payments needs. The additional
financing would be used to strengthen reserves. Projected IMF disbursements in 2010 will
amount to about US$60 million. Remaining external financing needs are expected to be met with
budget support from donors. The IMF's Executive Board is expected to discuss the combined
first and second reviews, the request for waivers, and augmentation of access on June 7, 2010.


4.      Tajikistan coped with the challenges of 2009 relatively well. Despite severe external
shocks, real GDP growth was slightly higher than originally projected, though disposable

Facility.

   This is including SDR allocation of US$128 million in the third quarter of 2009, most of which is saved.

income declined. Due in large part to the drop in international commodity prices, domestic
inflation fell into the single digits for the first time in three years. Ongoing reforms in the
agriculture sector that allowed diversification from cotton to foodstuffs, and the flexible
exchange rate regime facilitated external adjustment by shifting demand toward domestic
resources. Consequently, the current account balance improved marginally in 2009,
allowing for a modest accumulation of central bank reserves. The outlook for 2010 is
cautiously optimistic, with remittances and exports expected to recover.

5.       Staff supports the 2010 overall fiscal deficit target of 1 percent of GDP,29 but
encourages the authorities to seize opportunities to further strengthen social services. The
fiscal program seeks to balance social and capital spending, while allowing for a modest
widening of the overall deficit. However, staff is concerned that expenditure restraint in such
areas as maintenance may not be sustainable and could lead to a degradation of public
infrastructure. As such, the authorities should consider options to raise the revenue take over the
medium term to ensure that they have sufficient resources to pursue their policy objectives in a
sustainable manner.

6.       The authorities should proceed with care on the Roghun project, paying close
attention to social, macroeconomic, and debt sustainability implications. The equity
campaign that began in January 2010 to finance the Roghun project has had adverse social
consequences. Through April, the campaign raised almost 4 percent of 2009 GDP which were
saved mainly as deposits with the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) and commercial banks. As
such, the campaign more than offset the authorities' intention for a continued fiscal stimulus, and
implies a fiscal adjustment in the order of 2 percent of GDP. Staff estimates that this will dampen
GDP growth by up to one percentage point. Staff also notes that the equity campaign which
raises funds in somoni does not address the project's foreign exchange needs.

7.      Staff welcomes the phasing out of the campaign and calls upon the authorities not to
repeat such an effort in 2011 or beyond. In their 2010 program, the authorities have agreed
to low and declining nominal ceilings for equity sales through the remainder of 2010. By
containing equity sales to purely voluntary ones, these low ceilings should prevent any
further adverse social or macroeconomic impact of the campaign. In general, the priority
the authorities give to addressing Tajikistan's energy deficit and exploiting its hydropower
potential is understandable. However, any final decision on the project needs to await the
outcome of the techno-economic, social, and environmental assessments, which will take
account of the regional implications. If these are positive, staff encourages the authorities to
work closely with the World Bank to establish an international consortium to finance the
Roghun project, within the constraints imposed by the need for debt sustainability.

8.      Monetary and exchange rate policy are appropriate, but financial sector pressures
need to be addressed urgently. Given Tajikistan's external vulnerabilities, the NBT needs to
continue building international reserves. Reserve money is an appropriate nominal anchor for
monetary policy, and should not be compromised by extending liquidity loans to address
structural weaknesses in the banking sector. These weaknesses result from directed lending in the
past, continued lax lending practices, insufficient provisioning for impaired assets, and persistent

29
     This measure of the deficit excludes externally financed investment.

                                                      104
violations of prudential standards. The NBT needs to step up its enforcement of such standards
and require banks to prepare credible strategies to repair their balance sheets. The ministry of
finance should proceed with the issuance of government bonds to compensate banks for losses
incurred as a result of their involvement in cotton financing as prescribed by the cotton debt
resolution strategy.

9.      The authorities rightly put emphasis on structural reforms to strengthen
governance at the NBT and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, progress in both areas
has been slower than hoped for. Staff welcomes the completion of the external audit of the
financial statement of the NBT for the year ending April 2009, and expects the safeguards
assessment to be completed shortly. It encourages the authorities to move swiftly on
implementing the policy recommendations. Steps to improve governance at the NBT are prior
actions for the completion of the first and second reviews under the Extended Credit Facility. In
the area of state owned enterprises, staffing of the monitoring unit in the ministry of finance
needs to be completed, and the external audits of key state owned enterprises such as Talco
should be finalized and published in a timely fashion. Moreover, the authorities should seek to
ensure that all income generated from onshore activities in aluminum production is subject to
domestic taxation, not least given the country's limited fiscal resources.
