Programmatic Development\n            Policy Grant (PDPG) Program for Tajikistan is the first of a\n            new programmatic series of three development policy\n            operations consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy\n            (CPS) approved by the Board on May 25, 2010. The development\n            objectives of the PDPG 4-6 are to protect basic services\n            within a sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the\n            foundation for post-crisis recovery and growth. The series\n            combines actions to mitigate the impact of the economic\n            crisis by protecting core spending on health, education, and\n            social safety nets and to continue with structural reforms.\n            PDPG 4 focuses on protecting the gains made under PDPG 1-3\n            and hence includes budget allocations for the social sectors\n            as prior actions. However, PDPG 5-6 will (flexibly, since\n            the duration of crisis impact is not known) increasingly\n            emphasize structural reforms. Specifically, to protect basic\n            services, PDPG 4 will support the ring-fencing of\n            expenditures for health, education, and social protection\n            services at no less than 2009 levels. PDPG 5 and 6 will\n            support reforms to improve the efficiency and targeting of\n            social expenditures. To promote post-crisis recovery and\n            growth, the series will support reforms to improve the\n            investment climate by reducing the regulatory burden on\n            business, strengthen the financial sector, and liberalize\n            the aviation sector to foster Tajikistan's links to the\n            regional and global economies, and restructure farmland and\n            promote farmer control over management and agricultural\n            diversification. In addition, the series will continue the\n            governance reforms initiated under the previous series to\n            enhance public sector effectiveness, strengthen public\n            financial management, and enhance accountability and\n            performance of state-owned energy utilities. The first\n            operation under the new series will provide SDR 16.9\n            million, including SDR 5.7 million in Pilot Crisis Response\n            Window resources (US$25.4 million equivalent) in budget\n            support. The second and third operations will provide US$10\n            million equivalent each. Support for mitigation of the\n            crisis is complementary with crisis support provided by the\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Commission\n            (EC), and the Asian Development Bank."}, "docdt": "2010-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
