facility\n            at Morogoro from a maximum of 18.5 million kg cured leaf per\n            annum to some 41 million kg, of which 36 million kg will be\n            mechanically processed. This expansion will be carried out\n            in two stages, the first comprising additions and\n            improvements to the existing processing line through\n            purchase of equipment, machinery and quality control devices\n            and secondly, installation of a completely new processing\n            line. A survey to determine timing, scale and location of\n            any further investment in processing plant will be provided\n            for in the project. The project will also include technical\n            assistance and training and will provide for improved\n            storage facilities at Morogoro and a new office and export\n            storage in Dar es Salaam. Construction of roads, water\n            supply facilities, offices, railroad sidings and other basic\n            infrastructure at Morogoro will also be provided for."}, "docdt": "1976-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
