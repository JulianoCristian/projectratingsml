This expansion will be carried out\n            in two stages, the first comprising additions and\n            improvements to the existing processing line through\n            purchase of equipment, machinery and quality control devices\n            and secondly, installation of a completely new processing\n            line. A survey to determine timing, scale and location of\n            any further investment in processing plant will be provided\n            for in the project. The project will also include technical\n            assistance and training and will provide for improved\n            storage facilities at Morogoro and a new office and export\n            storage in Dar es Salaam.
