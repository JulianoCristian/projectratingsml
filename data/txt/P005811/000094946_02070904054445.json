Project sustainability is unlikely. Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances were rated\n            unsatisfactory. Despite the fact that the project was\n            negatively affected by factors not under the Borrower's\n            control and that the project's reform and development\n            objectives remian valid, the project produced several\n            important lessons: Administrative reform projects require\n            close supervision and continuous dialogue and adaptability.\n            Staff development and training must be carried out in the\n            context of a strategic plan that takes into account both\n            institutional needs and the career enhancement of the\n            individuals concerned. The capacity for project management\n            needs to be assured during the project design phase and\n            should be operational at the onset of project\n            implementation. Beenficiary institutions need to be involved\n            in project implementation. Supervision missions should\n            include staff--especially local field office staff--with\n            language abilities. Physical assets should be managed and\n            properly maintained through a systematic inventory control\n            system. Sound financial management and internal controls are\n            critical for curbing corruption and fund mismanageement.\n            Both internal and external audit functions are needed"}, "docdt": "2002-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
