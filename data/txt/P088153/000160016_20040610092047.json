National Highways Rehabilitation\n            and Maintenance Project (rep. no. 17195) and has the\n            following specific objectives: a) Preserve the condition of\n            vital road assets. b) Strengthen road sector management\n            through carrying out a renewal program of the National\n            Highway Directorate (DNV) to revitalize its role. There are\n            four project components. Component 1 expands the National\n            Highways Directorate's CREMA Program, which supports\n            rehabilitation and maintenance of nonconcessioned primary\n            road network through performance based contracts. Component\n            2 finances bridge restoration and construction management.\n            Component 3 enhances road safety. Component 4 supports\n            institutional Renewal of the DNV to consolidate its\n            transformation into a results- oriented organization\n            accountable for specific outputs."}, "docdt": "2004-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
