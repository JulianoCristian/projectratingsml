The overall purpose of the program is to gradually consolidate an efficient road network management strategy,
bringing about the necessary resources to preserve the national road network in the long term. This is a key
condition towards increasing the competitiveness of the economy and supporting a sustainable path of economic
growth and poverty reduction. The proposed project builds on the achievements o f the ongoing Bank-assisted 4295-
AR National Highways Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project and would have the following specific objectives:
   a.  Preserve the condition of vital road assets, through the gradual expansion of performance-based contracts for
       the rehabilitation and maintenance o f the non-concessioned primary paved network;
   b. Strengthen road sector management through carrying out a renewal program of DNV to revitalize its role in
       the sector by: (i)reinforcing its human resource base, (ii)    consolidating its transformation into a results-
       oriented organization accountable for specific outputs; (iii)introducing a systematic approach to bridge
       management and (iv) enhancing road safety.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues

1.        Context. Argentina's economy rebounded strongly in 2003, after the deepest political and
economic crisis in generations, and the upturn has continued into 2004. The Ministry of Economy
and Production (MOEP) has revised the official projection of GDP growth for the current year from
4.0 percent to 5.5 percent. This follows an upward revision of the 2003 growth outcome at 8.7
percent. Industrialproduction roseby 14.1 percent inthe first quarter of 2004 over the same periodin
2003; at the same time the construction industry index increased by 34 percent during the same
period. Improvements inconsumer and business confidence have driven private sector projections of
2004 GDP growth to 6.5 percent or more. As of March2004, the 12-monthCPIinflation rate stood at
2.3 percent. Fiscal performance i s on track, and the government expects to exceed the primary
surplus target of 3 percent of GDP for 2004. Through March, the Federal Government registered a
primary surplus equal to 1.1 percent of projected GDP, mainly as a result of better-than-anticipated
revenues. Expenditures are also rising, but at a much slower rate, with higher transfers to the
provinces andmunicipalities accounting for the lion's share of the increase.

2.        The recovery has startedhaving a positive impact on living standards as shown by the steady
improvement inkey social indicators since the crisis year of 2002. However, the improvement starts
from a very low base and large segments of the Argentine population continue to face great hardship.
The unemployment rate has declined from the levels reached during the crisis to about 14.5 percent
currently. Inparallel, real wages in the private sector have been trending upward, although still well
below pre-crisis levels. The combined impact of higher employment and real wages has begun to
make a dent in the poverty rate, which shot up to levels of more than 50 percent during 2002.
Nevertheless, the percentage of Argentines living in poverty remains above the Latin American
average of 44 percent, underscoringthe difficult social conditions still confrontingthe country.

3.        The Government of Argentina (GOA)i s currently focusing on mitigating the aftermath of the
prolonged recession and crisis period through a strategy that emphasizes sustainable growth within a
framework of social equity. Within a context of renewed emphasis on territorial development, the
Government is promoting increased infrastructure investment as a means of addressing potential
bottlenecks to sustaining economic recovery, fostering productivity and competitiveness, and
promoting regional growth convergence and reduced inequality. The objective is to restore public
and private investment to levels that are at least commensurate with the authorities' medium-term
growth projections of some 3 percent per annum.                           The Government's focus on infrastructure
investment is supportedby solid evidence showing that: (i)                    infrastructure i s an important determinant
of economic growth', (ii)        inequality declines with higher level of infrastructure quality and quantity2,
and (iii)   proper access to infrastructure, facilitates development of small and medium size enterprises
(SMEs)which play acritical roleinjob creation3.


 The elasticity of GDP with respect to infrastructure stocks in Argentina has been estimated to be 0.23 (Fay and Yepes, 2003). An
  increase inthe quality andquantity of infrastructurestock in Argentinato bring the country to the levels of CostaRica could result in
  an increaseof GDP growth of 1.3% per annum, while an increase in the stock of infrastructureto put Argentina at the level of Korea
  couldcauseadifference inGDP growthof 3% per annum(Severn, Calderon2002).
  Income inequality (as measured by a Gini coefficient or income shares) declines with higher infrastructure quality and quantity
  (Sevem, Calderon, 2004). The mainreasons are: (i) poorer individualsandunderdevelopedareas get connectedto the core economic
  activities, thus allowing them to access additional productive opportunities (Estache, 2000); and (ii)    infrastructure development
  reduces productionandtransactioncosts (Gannon and Liu, 1997). InArgentina, upgradinginfrastructureto the level of CostaRicaor
  Koreacouldhelpto reducethe Gini coefficientby, respectively0.03 and0.06.
  Argentine SMEs account for about 69-79 percentof employment. (World Bank ReportNo. 22830-AR, August 2002).


                                                                  1

4.       The devaluation of the peso introduced substantial competitive advantagesto Argentine export
products. To facilitate the sustainability of the growth of exports and economic recovery in general, a
reduction in the country's structurally high logistics costs is required so as to avoid neutralizing the
competitive gains brought about by the devaluation.                         Logistic costs in Argentina represent an
estimated 27 cents of every dollar exported, compared to 7 cents in the OECD4. Removing this
barrier, of which the main determinant is transport costs, is of paramount importance to secure the
growth of productive enterprises and, more importantly, to foster their development in marginal
regions with highunemployment and poor transport connectivity.

5.       The challenge is that, after a prolonged recession, investments in the transport sector have
been limited, and basic maintenance has been cut down with priority given to those assets with higher
levels of demand (those connecting areas with higher economic activity and therefore higher income).
This trend has accentuated regional income disparities by discouraging productive activities in the
marginal areas with entrenched pockets of poverty. Significant resources are needed to rehabilitate
transport infrastructure that was neglectedbut is crucial to foster productivity across the country and
to reduce regional disparities.

6.       Transport Sector Main Zssues. Argentina's transport sector i s at a major cross road in its
process of modernization, and the GOA'Sagenda in the next years is to: (i) those structural          address
weaknesses hindering transport efficiency and economic competitiveness; and (ii)                                     improve the
institutional framework and the governance of a sector that i s still experiencing important adjustments
to the interactions between the public and private actors inthe sector.

7.       Among the structural issues, the GOA i s committed to: (i)                         reviewing the development of
intermodal transport by pursuing an improvement of the interface of ports and railways, a major
problem in city- ports, particularly Buenos Aires and Rosario; (ii)                     re-assessingthe economic role of
the railway system, including the support of the network serving the North-East of the country (i.e.
the Belgrano Railways), and tailoring government policies to advance objectives of regional
integration and equity within a framework of workable federal/provincial arrangements that
encourages local participation and fiscal discipline; and (iii)                    establishing a sound system of road
financing through a combination of direct and indirect user fees and ensuring an adequate balance
between the maintenance of the existing capital stock in regions with different levels of development
andthe expansion of the network to support the growth ineconomic activity.

8.       At the institutional level, the GOA'Schallenge includes: (i)                        fine-tuning the freight railway
modernization through the structural review and renegotiation of the existing contracts and the
improvement of the regulatory framework; (ii)                completing the transfer to local authorities of key port
and urban transport responsibilities; and (iii)              strengthening the capacity of the National Highways
Directorate (DNV) to carry out its functions as a modern road agency within a new paradigm,
focusing on sector performance and client satisfaction. Because of the overwhelming importance of
the road sector in the transport sector in Argentina, the proposed project focuses on its physical and
institutional priorities.

9.       In its effort to improve competitiveness, Argentina needs to. compensate for a series of
structural conditions that entail high transport costs (uni-directional freight flows, fairly large
distances with low traffic densities, a strong element of seasonality, and lack of intermodal


  Logistics costs are becoming increasingly relevant to international trade given the significant reduction in trade tariffs worldwide
  over the last decade.



                                                                 2

integration), not only enhancingthe quality of its transport infrastructure, but increasing the efficiency
in the provision of transport services and eliminating avoidable costs that emerge from sub-optimal
policy makingand/or weak institutional frameworks.

10.      Road Sector. Concentrating nearly 80% of total freight volume movements, the road sector i s
the dominant mode of transport in the country. Argentina has a relatively extensive road network
managedby Government which consists o f (i)                    an estimated 39,000 kmof national roads (31,000 km
paved) managedby DNV; and (ii) 195,000 km of provincial roads under the jurisdiction of 23
                                              about
Provincial Road Directorates (DPV) which serve as main collectors and connectors between the
national network andproductive regions.

11.      The national road network system, built in its great majority more than 20 years ago,
represents assets that are valued at about US$ 7 billion equivalent. About 80% of the paved network
consists of flexible structures with granular base, and the remainder consists mainly of soil-cement
and occasionally bituminous macadam. There are about 2,100 bridges on the national highway system
representing a total length of nearly 70 km of which 85% percent is more than 20 years old and has
not received adequate maintenance over the last 15 years. Traffic volumes cover a wide range, from
less than 500 vehicles per day up to 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles per day on the most heavily trafficked
interurban corridors.

12.      The major expansion of the road network was funded through earmarked taxes (on fuels, tires,
lubricants and vehicle registration and sales taxes), allocated to DNV and the existing DPV's.
However, growing fiscal pressures forced GOAto divert the road sector funds to meet other needs
until finally, as part of the economic policy reform initiated in the late ~O'S,revenues from taxes on
petroleum, tires and lubricants were transferred directly to the Treasury and the earmarking of
revenues from taxes on vehicle registration fees and sales was removed.                                       Earmarked revenue
assignments to DNV were eliminated leaving the sector subject to budgetary allocations from the
general Treasury. Continued fiscal crises and deficient management policies led to under-funding and
deterioration of road assets to the point that, in 1990, Argentina ended up with the lowest share of
paved roads in good condition among upper-middle income countries. A survey carried out in 1992
confirmed that only 44% of the national paved network was in good condition (IRI<4), with a high
35% of roads incritical or poor condition.

13.      About 9,000 km of the highest trafficked interurban roads (more than 2,500 vehicles per day)
were concessioned to the private sector in the early 1990s. A new entity (OCCOVI) was created to
assume all decision-making responsibilities and to handle the inter-urban road concession contracts,
even though the road network continued to be under DNV's jurisdiction. Furthermore, the
maintenance of some 10,000 km of the non-concessioned paved network was managed through
performance-based contracts (CREMA5) introduced for the first time in the country in 1995. The
remaining 12,000 kmof the non-concessionedpaved network was contracted out for a 10-year period
under a non-tolled system (COT for its name in Spanish, Construir, Operur y Trunsferir), or
maintained, subject to the availability of resources, through: (i)                         agreements with the DPV's; (ii)
output-based routine maintenance contracts called ludmonth; or (iii)                             force-account activities under
the responsibility of DNV.



 CREMA (Contrato de Recuperacih y Mantenimiento) is a performance-basedcontract that requires a contractor to rehabilitate (in
 some percentage of its length) and maintain (in its total length) a network for a total of five years. Rehabilitation works are to be
 carried during the first 18 months, while maintenance activities are undertaken through out the contract period.          The contract i s
 designedto ensure that the contractor maintains the network for the full length of the contract under a specified level of service.



                                                                  3

14.        In2003, the interurban concessionsexpired and new Operational and Maintenance concession
contracts were awarded for a much shorter period (5 years), assigning the responsibility to the
Government for the financing and execution of rehabilitation and upgrading works. The latter i s a
novel feature that has not been fully tested, and will require DNV's strong leadership to avoid
potential conflicts between concessionairesand construction firms.

15.        The CREMA system proved to be extremely effective during the last ten years in the
Argentine case, enabling the Government to continuously maintain the network even during critical
periods of the economic crisis. The system is being replicated with changes elsewhere. As a result of
the crisis, the CREMA contracts were extendedup to two years to prevent the further deterioration of
the network while a new bidding program was launched. Today, most of said contracts are expiring
and DNV i s embarking on a major program to take care of these networks and the remaining portion
that has never been under the system. After seven years, some of the roads previously, or still, under
the CREMA system need new rehabilitation works (mainly those kilometers not rehabilitated under
the previous contracts). The paved non-concessionednetwork, which was not covered by CREMA,
currently inpoor condition, requires major interventions andcontinued maintenance.

16.        Today, as a result of the combination of road concessions and improved management of the
non-concessionednetwork through implementation of the CREMA system, the average condition of
the road network has improved considerably. The proportion of paved roads in fair or poor condition
(with IRI>4) has dropped to about 20%.                               On the concessioned network, that percentage is
insignificant. On the non-concessionedportion, the proportionof roads with IRb4 i s still inthe order
of 29%, particularly concentratedon areas that have not been covered under the CREMA system.

17.       Road Sector Financing: Between 1993 and 2000, DNV's annual budget allocations ranged
between US$450 million and US$650 million6, distributed among investment expenditures (52%),
debt service (38%), personnel, administrative costs and others (10%). Average annual allocations for
rehabilitation and maintenance activities between 2000 and 2003 has been US$143 million, whereas
economic evaluations using the HDM model suggests that in order to preserve the entire non-
concessioned paved network in a sustainable good to fair condition, future annual investment
allocations should be at a level of about US$16,000 per kmper year or about US$350million. During
the past five years, resources assignedto CREMA representedan average yearly allocation of US$93
million indicating a significant financial gap, which needs to be overcome to arrest the backlog of
deferred maintenance.

18.        In2001, the GOAattemptedto foster anew roadfinancing strategy with the idea of expanding
private participation through different private/public arrangements. At that time the GOAapproved a
surcharge on diesel7 to support the creation of a Transport Infrastructure Trust Fund (Fondo
Fiduciario del Gasoil) initially intendedto: (i)                  finance during the first two years the debt accumulated
related to the concessionsexpiring in 2003 (an therefore avoid extending them), and (ii)                         finance with
the revenue stream from year 2003 onwards new road investments through its main component, the
SISVIAL (which received 80% of total proceeds). The remaining20% was allocated to the SISTRAN
aimed at financing the railway sector. However, the SISVIAL mechanism was never established.
The Transport Infrastructure Trust Fund had its allocation rules modified five times in the space of
12 months by a series of Decrees and Ministerial Resolutions, incorporating new beneficiaries and


 Inthe economiccrises, budgetallocationshavedroppedto the level of US$200 million. Following the crisis in2001, DNV suffered a
 strong budget restraint, showing signs of partial recovery only by 2004, when budget trends began readjustingto historical values.
 Undertheseperiods, investmentfor rehabilitationand maintenancefaced important shortcuts.
 Initially beinga specific tax of $0.05 per liter of diesel but later modified to an ad valorem 18.5%.


                                                                      4

changing its institutional location. At the end, after the outstanding debt obligations with the previous
concessionaireswere eliminated, the funds were increasing1 assignedto finance subsidies to national
and provincial bus operators, and urban transport services . Investment decision-making regarding
                                                                          B
this Fund (administered by the UCOFIN -Unidad de Coordinaci6n de Fideicomisos de
Infraestructura) i s housedin the Ministry of Economy, out of the control of DNV, and requires joint
resolutions from the Ministerof FederalPlanning Public Investment and Services and the Minister of
Economy. This governance arrangement raise doubts about the reliability and sufficiency of road
sector financing, albeit being an important and stable source of funding approvedby law for transport.

19.      Government's new strategy for the road sector: The new administration's vision for the
future includes: (i)       operating and maintaining high traffic highways through toll road concessions,
assigning planning and execution responsibilities for upgradinghehabilitation investments (within
those corridors) to the government (OCCOVI and DNV); (ii)                      consolidating a long-term maintenance
strategy for the non-concessioned paved national road network (22,000 km) through a program
designedto gradually expand the CREMA system; (iii)                  elevating the status of DNV's role as a driving
force in the sector, in particular, re-orienting its capacity towards strategic planning for the primary
road network (including the concessioned portion) and promoting a more coherent vision for the
entire road network across other government jurisdictions; (iv) prioritizing investments in bridge
rehabilitation and modernizing its bridge management strategy; and (v) improving road safety. The
broader strategy to link the road sector with other infrastructure sub-sectorsi s expectedto be reflected
in the "Strategic Planfor Territorial Development" the elements of which are being developed, The
GOAhas requested the Bank to support this program, as a first step towards implementing its
transport sector agenda.

20.      The proposed program will support the government's strategy of addressing the needs on the
paved non-concessionedportion of the road network, where the bulk of rehabilitation investments are
considered to be most necessary. The program will break up the vicious cycle of postponing
interventions in the poorer, less developed parts of the country. The program also aims at expanding
the CREMA system, to most of the non-concessionedpaved network so that during the period 2004-
2010 the coverage of the CREMA system reaches some 19,243 km (out of the 22,000 km)9.The
successful implementation of this ambitious program will imply investments of some US$841 million
(with an expected financing requirement of US$400 million). This requires a revitalized DNV to
perform more as a results-oriented organization with efficient managerial tools to plan required
interventions on a timely basis. The program has been designed taking into account the following
considerations: (i)      most CREMA contracts financed under the national Highways Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project supported by Loan 4295-AR are coming to an end between 2004 and 2005,
leaving DNV with the challenge of launching a new phase of CREMA which includes new bids, and
financing said network promptly to avoid its deterioration; (ii)                DNV will assume the financial burden
of all contracts that remain in execution once Loan 4295 is closed; (iii)                          expanding the CREMA
system to networks previously not under CREMA demands important rehabilitation works even if
those works are concentratedinroads with lower traffic density; (iv) the expansion has been designed
under a realistic budget restriction, thus foreseeing different levels of rehabilitation interventions
among networks; (iv) the strategy, while adequate to preserve the capital stock of the main highways
of the country at an acceptablelevel of serviceability, might be insufficient to address the demands of
a continuous high level of economic growth and as such, the possibility of necessary additional
interventions may be triggered by the Government.

*  Over the years, the allocation to the SISVIAL was reduced to 60% increasing the participation of the SISTRAN to 40% and more
   recently, changedagainto 50%-50%, to maintain a growing subsidy scheme to transport service operators(passengers and cargo).
   The remainingportion i s to be managedthrough two-year ad-measurement type contracts and COT.

21.     Rationale and Issues to be Addressed To bring about this vision, there are some specific
issues that are closely intertwined and needto be addressedsimultaneously:

    Gradually moving towards a steady-state condition of the road network. Currently, the road
   network requires important periodic maintenance and rehabilitation interventions to upgrade its
   overall condition and overcome the backlog of deferred maintenance. This implies higher
   financial requirements than those under a steady-state scenario where the network deterioration
   reaches a relatively constant level year after year and future interventions can be anticipated and
   reasonably taken care of with a given level of resources. Expanding the CREMA system i s a step
   in this direction but implies securing the necessary funds to rehabilitate segments that have not
   received interventions in the last years, implementing adequate planning strategies to anticipate
   future requirements, and elaborating efficient work programs that are aligned with existing
   budgets.

   Putting in place adequate road financing strategies to guarantee the sustainability of the road
    sector within a givenfiscal framework. A key pressing need is to design and implement a sound
    system for the financing of the road network in which resource allocation is based on cost-
    effective policies according to agreed and coherent priorities. Ideally, predictable and dependable
    sources of funding available to the sector, such as those accumulated in the Transport
    Infrastructure Trust Fund, should be redirectedtowards the maintenance of the network, while the
    approval of new construction works reflects the treasury budget allocations within a given fiscal
    space. Currently, the GOA i s considering using the Transport Trust Fund to: (i)finance
    upgradingh-ehabilitationworks agreed under the recently awarded concession contracts, and (ii)
    complement budgetary allocations to expand DNV's CREMA program, at least during a transition
    period while the steady-state situation i s achieved. DNV plays an essential role in the execution
    of these two tasks, but to ensure an adequate performance in the fulfillment of its obligations,
    stable and timely funding i s crucial.

    From a macroeconomic perspective, extra-budgetary funds are regarded as problematic because
    they limit the required flexibility to optimally allocate scarce resources among competing needs
    and may not follow the same scrutiny and accountability standards as the general budget.
    However, from a microeconomic perspective, a fund comprising user charges, that follows well
    accepted and strongly advisable "user pays" principles, reduces the vulnerability of the flow of




                                                      6

  funds due to fiscal downturns". Inany case, if the GOAdecides that this financing mechanism'is
  to continue playing an important role inthe sector, more transparentandbetter rules governing the
  allocation of funds and mechanisms to ensure accountability are required. Also, suitable
  governance arrangements are neededto ensure that funds are effectively protected andused. The
  project would finance a study to analyze the above-mentioned issues, examining the different
  sources of funds available to the sector, recommending ways to optimally allocate them and
  proposing alternatives to ensure the financial stability of the road sector inthe long run.

  Overcoming the institutional weakening that has undermined the authority of the road agency and
  induced the adoption of ad-hoc policies, such as carving away from the scope of the DNV
  responsibilities regarding: (i)          decision-making for the works on the concession network and
  consequentlyhaving an unclear distribution of responsibilities betweenDNV and OCCOVI; or (ii)
  decisions on the allocation of resources from the Transport Trust Fund(with increaseduncertainty
  resulting from frequent changes in the principles and rules defining the allocation of resources).
  The DNV needs to be invigorated to regain its muscle within the sector, become the strategic
  planner of the primary road network and consolidate its transformation into a client-oriented
  organization. The successful institutional renovation of the road agency requires transformations
  based on basic principles of efficiency, transparency and accountability with the following
  overarching goals:

  i. Increase Transparency through: (i)              the development of a system that clearly establishes what
       i s being achieved, at what cost, and how that cost compares with internationally accepted
       benchmarks; (ii)        the validation of the information through credible auditing measures and
       disseminate that information widely; (iii) establishment of clear links between sources and
                                                            the
       uses of funds, on the basis of technical parametersrelatingthe cost of providinga certain level
       of serviceto aparticular network.
  ii. Create Accountability for Outcomesemphasizing the fulfillment of promises andenforcement
       of performance. Establish a clear system of incentives for performance improvements and
       target-oriented programs.
  iii. Improve Mechanisms for Establishing Investment Priorities through the promotion of an
       integrated vision of the road network, basedupon objective planningcriteria.

  Strengthen institutional coordination in order to achieve the integration of the road networks
  under all jurisdictions to achieve an effective reduction of transport costs and an increase in the
  productivity and competitiveness of local products in international markets. Given the nature of
  the economic activity in the country there is a structural need to integrate key transport networks
  among different jurisdictions to effectively connect ports and the main production and
  consumption centers. To this end, it is essential to devote time and resource-consuming efforts to
  prepare coordinated road development plans based on unified national objectives. This issue
  would be addressedunder the umbrella of the Strategic Plan for Territorial Development, ("Plan
  de Ordenamiento Territorial Estratdgico") which i s being prepared by the SOP, and would be
  supportedunder the proposedprogram.

  Improving road safety standards. Argentina's road network faces a serious problem with poor
  road safety records, revealing a road crash fatality rate (deaths per population) three times greater
  than the current rate of best practice countries (Sweden, United Kingdom and the Netherlands).
  Even in aregional comparison, Argentina heads the rankingfor Latin American countries, with an

  Institutionsfor Efficiency andEquity of PublicExpenditures", September10, 2003.

    average rate of 20 deaths per day, 1,377 life losses in 2003, 120,000 injuries or disabilities per
    year and 11 deaths per 100 million kilometers traveled. Fatality rates for L A C region will, by
    2020, increase at least by 50%, if road safety measures are not taken urgently, so unless
    significant measures are taken, the trend in Argentina will deteriorate significantly. Without
    decisive action, it is estimatedthat Argentina could, by year 2020, present a fatality rate at least 10
    times greater than the rate of best practice countries in Europe, strongly aggravating a
    development disparity.

    Gradually bring up and align the condition of the bridges to a condition commensurate with
    better roads. At present, the system of bridges in Argentina i s in a serious state of disrepair. The
    rather limited interventions that take place each year are selectedon an ad-hoc basis, with a strong
    reliance on visual methods and personnel with a strong institutional memory. DNV i s now
    planning, with Bank support, the development and implementation of a Bridge Management
    System to systematically follow up on bridge conditions and allocate scarce resources based on
    soundtechnical and economic criteria.

2. Rationale for BankInvolvement

22.     The World Bank has played a key role in the road sector in Argentina, reducing the
rehabilitation and maintenancebacklog on both the national and provincial networks and supporting
institutionaltransformation processes to improve road management and enable rationalization of road
expenditures in the country. In particular, through Loans 3611-AR and 4295-AR the Bank assisted
DNV in the pioneer initiative to develop and implement multiyear performance-based contracts for
rehabilitation and maintenance of road networks -the so-called CREMA contracts, establishing clear
and transparent rules in its design and awarding, and providing stable flows of funds even during
severe fiscal crises. Through Loan 4093-AR the Bank has supported the development of more
efficient provincial road programs, gradually transferring maintenance execution to private
contractors or to local road users and consortia, and strengthening the environmental management
capabilities of the DPVs. Bank involvement in this project would further improve the results achieved
so far by:

    0   Supporting the expansion of CREMA contracts on roads that, due to fiscal restrictions, have
        not been adequately maintained and require high initial rehabilitation investments as a means
        to support a strategyinwhich a steady state condition would gradually be reached.
    0   Promoting a policy dialogue to improve the financial sustainability of the roadsector.
    0   Rationalizing highway expenditures and programs basedon technical and economic criteria by
        emphasizing maintenance and improving cost recovery, increasing transparency and
        accountability.
    0   Supporting DNV's renewal process as a user-oriented agency with clear goals, integrated
        information systems and strategic planning tools, systematic use of performance management
        systems, and ability to plan, contract out andmonitor road operations.
    0   Bringing worldwide knowledge and best practices to prepare a large-scale initiative on road
        safety.
    0   Insertingthe road sector planning within aterritorial development framework.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

23.     The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on April 15, 2004, seeks to
reduce the extent and severity of poverty in Argentina by focusing on: (i)promoting sustained



                                                    8

economic growth with equity; (ii) inclusion; and (iii)
                                      social                  improved governance. It emphasizes that
one of the building blocks for sustained economic growth i s maintaining and improving key
infrastructure assets that facilitate regional development andthe inclusion of Argentina ina globalized
economy.

24.     The overall and specific objectives of this project are consistentwith the above pillarssince, as
was mentioned before, maintaining and improving the road network i s a means to foster regional
productivity and competitiveness, and hence supporting the path towards sustainedeconomic growth.
At the same time, the project will seek to expand the CREMA system to produce a fairer balance in
program coverage, by targeting poorer regions and provinces with lower levels of economic activity,
whose road network end up neglected at times of tight fiscal constraints. It is estimated that 50% of
the poorest provinces (measured by GGP per capita) concentrate more than 47% of proposed
investments and 46% of coverage. Finally, initiatives to increase governance, accountability and
transparency in the road sector are being considered in the project through the institutional renewal
component.

25.     Expanding the CREMA program to other regions of the country would help to decrease
disparities in terms of transport investment, favoring poorer areas that are less economically active,
fostering regional productivity via the reduction of logistic costs between potentially productive areas,
consumption areas and mainports (facilitating access to markets).

26.      In particular, the proposed project would benefit people in rural and low-income areas
through: (i) the reduction of time and travel costs, (ii) employment opportunities (4,000 newjobs
                                                        new
in 5 years), since many of the rehabilitation and maintenance activities require unskilled labor for
carrying out the works and for the production of materials, (iii)        increased competitiveness and
development of labor generating productive activities (e.g SMEs), and (iv) improved access to basic
services.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

27.     The Bank's investment lending support for the proposed program would be through a two-
phasedAdaptable Program Loan (APL). The first phase-the proposed project-, will be executed over
a period of four years. The choice of an APL would allow greater flexibility in program execution to
gradually achieve the consolidation of an efficient road network managementframework and a steady
state condition of the national roadnetwork inline with the economic recovery of the country, and an
adequate sequencing of institutionaldevelopment actions to gradually transform DNV into a results-
oriented agency. Thus, the proposed phasing would concentrate government's efforts during the first
stage in consolidating the institutional foundations and a long term financing strategy for the sector,
reinforcing the sustainability of the program in the long run, while retaining flexibility during the
second phase. In the latter phase the program will introduce additional interventions needed to
confront the transportation effects of sustained levels of economic activity on certain portions of the
road network, some of which are difficult to anticipate at this stage or can not be accommodated
within current budget constrains. Performance during the first phase will be the key determinant in
triggering the secondloan.

28.     The programconsists of four components (Annex 4):




                                                     9

   A road rehabilitationand maintenance component, which expands the CREMA system to
   achieve a total coverage of about 19,243 km of national roads during the period 2004-2010. This
   i s complemented with the rehabilitation of some 1,799 km through two-year unit price contracts
   through what i s called "Sistema Modular".
   A bridge management component introducing a systematic approach to bridge rehabilitation
   and maintenance, andaddressingthe urgent needs of 30 highpriority bridges inthe country.
   A roadsafety component,which would support the implementationof recommendedactions that
   evolved from a Road Safety technical assistance financed by the Bank (under Loan 3611-AR).
   The main sub-components are: (i)a large-scale pilot initiative integrating engineering,
   enforcement and education measures over 4 pilot corridors, with the overarching objectives of
   demonstrating the effectiveness of an integrated, results-focused road safety program and helping
   create the knowledge, experience and commitment required to roll it out successfully throughout
   the rest of the country; and (ii)selectedroad safety engineering interventions on identifiedcritical
   spots of the road network across the country, targeting areas with high concentrations of crash
   fatalities, mainly near urban centers
   An institutional renewal component, which consists of technical assistance, equipment and
   training of staff needed to: (i)develop and implement a human resources plan to rebuild DNV's
   technical and institutional capacity within its new envisioned role as strategic planner of the road
   network performing under a results-oriented framework; (ii)facilitate DNV's technological
   modernization to increaseits productivity and strengthenits planning, supervision, and monitoring
   capabilities; (iii)streamline time consuming administrative processes to achieve efficiency gains
   in the internal management of the entity; (iv) design transparency mechanisms to disseminate
   DNV's administrative, operational and financial performance, generalizing the use of performance
   indicators to enhance accountability, utilizing users feedback to monitor performance and control
   results, and constructing performance and user satisfaction indicators that help visualize the
   achieved results; (v) strengthen DNV's capacity for addressing environmental issues throughout
   the project cycles; (vi) analyze options for ensuring long term financial sustainability in the road
   sector and     stable flows of funds for road maintenance and (vii) develop the road sector
   contribution to the strategic plan for territorial development.

29.     The proposedAPL is structured according to the following characteristics:

e  ProgramDuration:The programdescribed above will be implementedbetween September2004
   and September 2010. The APL will comprise two phases that will each be implemented over the
   period of 4 years or less. Structured as a vertical APL supporting a long-term investment program
   of US$841.2 million (of which US$400 i s expected to be Bank financed), the first phase will
   beginin September 2004, and the second is expected to begin during 2006 upon achievement of
   identified triggers, overlapping in time with APLl as new interventions are ready to be
   implementedby the Government.

0  Phases: The APLl (with a total cost of US$ 308.1 million, of which US$200 million are Bank
   financed) will outline the global program, setting out the frameworks required for project
   continuity in the long-run. The project will support inter alia: (i)the expansion of the CREMA
   system; (ii)  works on five bridges and the implementation of a Bridge Management System
   (BMS), (iii) design of the road safety pilot initiative setting out the institutional arrangements
                 the
   required for its launching, and (iv) the design and implementation of selected actions within
   DNV's institutional renewal program. A large proportion of resources assignedto the APL 1will
   be disbursed over the first 18 months, to help GOAabsorb the initial burden resulting from




                                                     10

  launching a comprehensive expansion of the CREMA contractsrequiring important rehabilitation
  works.

  The APL 2 (including a loan of US$200 million) builds on the institutional developments of APL
  1 and the consolidation of a sustainable financial strategy for the program. The APL2 would
  enable: (i)  the completion of CREMA contracts initiatedin APL1; (ii) on about 20 bridges
                                                                                    works
  prioritized through the Bridge Management System developed during APLl; (iii)the
  implementation and measurement of results of the pilot road safety initiative, as well as some 25
  road safety interventions in critical spots of the network; (iv) and the completion of the
  institutional renewal process.         The APL2 would also allow the GOA to trigger further
  rehabilitation interventions consistent with higher economic growth scenarios, to overcome
  bottlenecks that could arise inthose segments that having been designedunder a budget restriction
  foresaw lower levels of rehabilitation interventions. In this second phase, the GOAwill finance
  with its own resources CREMA networks supported under the National Highways (Loan 4295-
  AR), including the completion of on-going contracts and new contracts as well, and the
  introduction of new contracts under the so called Modular system, which altogether with the
  Bank-funded portionof the programwill expand maintenancecoverage to the entire roadnetwork.

  Global cost sharing for the APL program will result inthe order of 48% (Bank)-52% (GOA).

0 Institutional Responsibiiities: The National Directorate of Highways (DNV) will have overall
  responsibility for meeting the program's goals and objectives. Local counterpart funds will
  proceed either from the Treasury General Budget and/or the Transport FiduciaryFund(See Annex
  6 for further information on the overall financing strategy).

0 Triggers: Triggers for the second phase of the APL are summarized in the table below. A
  progress report for the first phase would have to be submittedsix months prior to the launching of
  the secondphase andwill serve as abasis to determine readinessfor APL 2.

  Inline with the above discussion, the set of triggers chosen to move into the secondphase will
  ensure: (i) achievement of substantial progress in the implementation of APLl including the
                the

    condition and its management; and (ii)     the development of a road financing and management
    strategies necessary to support and enhance the long term sustainability of an expanded national
    road program. Incase the last trigger is partially met, Bank Management may consider continuing
    support (at a reduced level) of the second phase of the road rehabilitation and maintenance
    component to meet existing commitments. In this case, Bank Management would submit the
    secondphaseAPL for Boardapproval.

2. Project development objectives and key indicators

30.     The overall purpose of the program is to gradually consolidate an efficient road network
managementstrategy, bringingabout the necessaryresourcesto preserve the national road network in
the long term. This i s a key condition towards increasing the competitiveness of the economy and
supporting a sustainable path of economic growth and poverty reduction. The proposed project builds
on the achievements of the ongoing Bank-assisted 4295-AR National Highways Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project and would have the following specific objectives:

  a. Preserve the condition of vital road assets, through the gradual expansion of performance-based
       contracts for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the non-concessioned primary paved
       network;

  b. Strengthen road sector management through carrying out a renewal program of DNV to
       revitalize its role in the sector by: (i)
                                              reinforcing its human resource base, (ii)
                                                                                      consolidating its
       transformation into a results-oriented organization accountable for specific outputs; (iii)
       introducing a systematic approachto bridge managementand (iv) enhancing roadsafety.

31.      Achievement of Project Development Objectives will be confirmed through the following key
indicators: (i)percentage of paved non-concessioned network under CREMA system; (iii)
implementation of a bridge management system; (iv) DNV having effectively developed actions
under the InstitutionalRenewalAction Plan.

3. Project components

32.      Component 1     -  Rehabilitation and Maintenance through performance based contracts
(Estimated cost US$286.1 million of which US$182.8 million would be financed by the Bank
Loan).The Bank would support the expansion of DNV's CREMA Program, providingfinance for the
implementation of CREMA contracts on 8,188 km of roads (65% of which are entering the program
for the first time and require important rehabilitation interventions representing on average 82% of
total costs), while DNV will continue financing CREMA contracts under execution, as well as new
ones, to complete a total of 16,725 kmunder performance-based contracts.

33.      Component2 - Bridge Restoration and construction management (Estimatedcost US$lO.7
million of which US$7.5 million would be financed by the Bank Loan). Given recent budgetary
restrictions, DNV has not been able to properly take care of its bridges and has only performed
emergency interventions on specific points. The project will finance works on five bridges pre
selected by DNV due to their critical status and urgent need of intervention. Works would include
construction, reconstruction, replacement, widening and rehabilitation activities, all to be carried out
within the existing right-of-way. A comprehensive bridge management tool to systematically




                                                    12

prioritize bridge interventions will be implemented, and engineering designs for future bridge
restoration projects prioritized through said tool will be financed.

34.       Component3- Road Safety (Estimatedcost US$5.8 million of which US$4.4 million would
befinanced by the Bank Loan). The project will: (i)     design the road safety pilot initiative and set out
the institutional arrangements required for its launching. This includes designing a system to monitor
and evaluate the impacts, defining impact indicators and baseline measurements, designing
educational and communication campaigns, finalizing engineering designs and begin upgrading
works in the proposed corridors; and (ii)     finance road safety engineering interventions (including
engineering designs) on identifiedcritical spots of the road network across the country, targeting areas
with highconcentrations of crashfatalities, mainly nearurbancenters.

35.      Component 4- Institutional Renewal (Estimated cost US$3.5 million of which US$3.3
million would befinanced by the Bank Loan). The project would finance technical assistanceto: (i)
identify DNV's needs in terms of humanresources, and implement a short-run strengthening plan; (ii)
facilitate DNV's technological modernization; (iii)streamline time consuming administrative
processes, (iv) strengthen DNV's capacity for addressing environmental issues; (v) analyze options
for ensuring long term financial sustainability in the road sector and stable flows of funds for road
maintenance, and (vi) strengthen the PCUto assistDNV inthe carrying out of the Project. The project
would also finance technical assistance through the execution of Twinning Arrangements between
DNV and foreign roads agencyhes with consolidated experience to: (i) a long-term human
                                                                             design
resources action plan; and (ii)  design transparency mechanisms to disseminate DNV's performance,
generalizing the use of performance indicators to enhance accountability, constructing performance
and user satisfaction indicators that help visualize the achieved results, and preparing a code of ethics
for DNV.

4. Lessonslearned and reflectedinthe project design

36.      Cost Overruns/Delaysin implementation.Prior to the introduction of the CREMA system of
contracting road maintenance, the highway projects with traditional unit price contracts financed by
the Bank in Argentina were generally flawed with the problems of substantial cost overruns and
considerable delays in implementation. Apart from the bursts of high inflation and rapid devaluation
that aggravated the delays and cost problems, these were mostly due to inadequate and untimely
designs, the ad-measurement type of contracting, and the shortages of counterpart funds. The lump-
sumprice and fixed-term CREMA systemusedover the last 7 years inArgentina combined with the
requirement made to contractors to prepare detailed engineering designs before initiating the works,
has shown that there has been no cost overrun except for the unpredictable variation orders due to
unforeseen circumstances which altogether representedless than 4% increase in costs over the life of
the contracts. The proposedproject replicates this successfulexperience. Delays indisbursementsfor
this project should be minimal since most of the CREMA contracts, will have been tendered and
awardedduringthis calendar year or at the beginning of the next one.

37.      Long-term road rehabilitation and maintenance commitments. Historically, due to
Government's efforts to contain public expenditures in order to achieve economic stabilization,
resources allocated to road rehabilitation and maintenance projects were subject to disruptive "stop-
and-go" type of implementation, which resulted from wide variations inbudget allocations. Under the
CREMA contracts, the long-term payment obligations become legally binding on the Government
and as a result, the budgetary process has given these contracts a higher priority than other
expenditures. Also, such contracts between the Government and private operators that involve



                                                    13

financial risks for the operator appear to be given priority inbudgetary allocations incountries that are
seeking a broader role for the private sector and may be the way to secure a more adequate and more
reliable funding mechanism for highway maintenance. The experience has demonstrated that
CREMA contracts are assigned a higher priority in budgetary allocations than traditional methods for
executing maintenance(ad-measurementtype of contracts or force-account).

38.     Lessons learned from previous projects design. Based on previous experiences, a few
modifications have been introduced to the new CREMA contracts, to include for instance, some road
safety measures as compulsory works (horizontal and vertical signaling, protection barriers,
upgrading urban crossways and intersections) and requiring contractors to prepare detailed
environmental managementplans.

39.     Design and implementation of the institutional component. It is generally recognized that
Borrowers and Executing Agencies, in most Bank-financed projects, tend to give higher priority to
physical investments than to the institutional component, which often fall short of achieving their
objectives. This has been particularly true for two previous and on-going highway projects. InLoan
3611-AR (1993-1998), project amendments successively reduced project funding for studies,
consultants and training from US$ 30 million to US$ 12 million, due to reluctance by DNV to utilize
these funds for Technical Assistance and also due to reduced government ownership of this
component. Likewise, under the on-going 4295-AR loan, even a much reduced allocation of US$ 13
million that was earmarked for training, seminars, staff exchange programs and studies has barely
been used (nine months away from the closing date, only US$ 500,000 have been disbursed). The
proposedproject reflects this lessonby allocating US$ 3.5 million to this component, focusing on few
critical achievable goals.    Most of these funds will be used for the institutional renewal and
empowerment of DNV, an objective for which the executing agency and the Executive have strong
incentives. Also, following a wide consultation it i s found that a twinning arrangement with a foreign
road agency is envisaged as a plausible alternative to a consulting firm to implement some of the
proposed activities.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

40.     Lending Instrument.       A Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) project design was initially
considered. Under such approach, the Bank would provide support to the new administration's
national roads strategy, financing the proposed investment programs either on the concessioned or
non-concessionedportion of the network. Consideration was given to finance a slice of the annual
budget complementing the budget resources and those from the Transport Trust Fund, on the basis of
previously defined sector targets and objectives. This alternative would require an agreement on
sector wide fiduciary arrangements covering a wide range of activities of DNV including new
construction, maintenance and administration.          This project design option was not selected
considering that it would require a lengthy assessment process of governance, administration and
accounting characteristics of the Transport Trust Fund to be prepared before appraisal which would
not make it possible to complete the assessment in the available time. The team also considered a
Standard Investment Loan to support the entire program. This approach would commit a large
amount of funds from the outset, removing some of the incentives (e.g. sequencing of institutional
strengthening actions) and the flexibility to accommodatethe additional interventions that would arise
underalternative economic recovery scenarios.

41.     Other Contractual Arrangements for Road Management. The chosen alternative of
expanding the CREMA system within the non-concessioned paved network with full managerial and



                                                    14

operational responsibility transferred to the private sector is supported by the successful outcome of
said method of contracting in Argentina over the last 10 years and worldwide. A concession
alternative, with toll-collection, does not appear feasible because of the relatively low traffic volume
that uses that network (on average less than 1000 vehicledday) and the potentially high toll rates that
would have been necessary in order to make the concession attractive to the private sector. The other
alternative of transferring the maintenance management of the non-concessioned network to the
provincial authorities was not considered feasible at this stage due to the uneven institutional and
financial capacity of the provincial highway departments as well as to their inability to perform as
efficiently as the private sector.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

42.    Executing Agencies. The Ministry of Economy and Production will be the representative of
the Argentine Republic (the Borrower). The project's executing agency will be DNV and proceeds of
the loan will be transferred on a grant basis to DNV pursuant to the terms of a separate subsidiary

43.    Project Management. The project will be managedby line staff of DNV complemented by the
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), which was establishedwithin DNV for implementation of the 3611-
AR and 4295-AR loans. The PCU will remain incharge of coordinating project activities. The PCU
has a proven track record in managing projects for the World Bank and the IDB, having acquired
expertise in procurement, disbursements, environmental and social guidelines, and auditing
requirements.     With full implementation of those measures presented in Annex 7 (Financial
Management Action Plan) and Annex 8 (Procurement Action Plan), DNV would have in place
enhancedarrangements to meet the Bank's fiduciary and procurement requirements for the proposed
project. The incremental project costs of the unit will be financed under the project.

2. Monitoringand evaluationof outcomeshesults

44.     Project progress reports would be preparedby DNV on a semiannual basis and submitted for
the Bank's review and comments. Said reports will focus on results achieved, and will include a list
of activities carried out during the previous period including: (i) CREMA contracts under execution,
rehabilitation and maintenancetargets achieved, and the results of the previous survey regarding road
condition. The progress will be monitored against performance indicators based on HDMevaluations
of the network; (ii)  bridge rehabilitation works completed; (iii) taken under the road safety
                                                                    actions
strategy and results achieved; (iv) progress made in the implementation of the institutional renewal
component and evidence of highroad user satisfaction.

3. Sustainability

45.     Project sustainability in the long-run depends on the implementation of cost-effective
solutions to maintain the network so as to reach a steady-state condition where annual needs become
manageable; transforming DNV into a high performance organization with increased accountability
for outcomes; ensuring stable roadsector funding; and institutionalizing a culture of road safety.

46.    The project would pursue sustainability mainly through a comprehensive asset management
programthat will: (i)  further key institutional reforms inDNV to make the organization more efficient

develop an integrated approach to road safety; (v) explore mechanisms to enhance road sector
financing in the long run; and (vi) assist in the development of the strategic plan for territorial
development. Through the institutional renewal component, the project would assist the Secretariat of
Public Works and DNV in devising transparent and effective mechanisms to ensure accountability in
the ways funds are allocated into different programs. A study on road sector financing issues will be
financed, to analyze among other aspects, the best options for ensuring a stable flow of funds for road
maintenance.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicandfinancial analyses:
Cost benefit NPV=US$ 1,008 million; ERR= 45.0 %

47.     DNV performed a project level economic evaluation of each CREMA contract, with updated
road condition and traffic data, with the objective o f (a) identifying sections to be maintained and
sections in which some kind of rehabilitation work is economically justified; (b) computing the net
benefits of possible project alternatives; and (c) ensuring that all investments yield a rate of return of
at least 12%. DNV performed the economic evaluation of each bridge restoration investment by
estimating savings on vehicle operating costs and passenger time cost due to eliminating travel



                                                    17

restrictions under the without project scenario, and estimating savings on bridge maintenance costs
due to the bridge improvements.

48.      Based on network data supplied by DNV, the Bank mission performed a network level
economic evaluation of the entire non-concessionednetwork managedby DNV, with the objective of
assessingall DNV rehabilitation and maintenanceprograms, inwhich the main benefits are savings in
road user costs. Net benefits were evaluated using the Highway Development and Management
Model (HDM-4), which simulates life cycle conditions and costs and provides economic decision
criteria for multiple road design andmaintenancealternatives.

49.      The economic evaluation of the DNV rehabilitation and maintenance programs yields a net
present value, at 12% discount rate, of US$963 million and an economic rate of return of 45.5%. The
economic evaluation of the bridge restoration program yields a net present value of US$ 45.1 million
and an economic rate of return of 38.1%. The overall project net present value i s US$ 1,008 million
with an overall economic rateof returnof 45.0%.

50.      Under a worst-case scenario of benefits dropping to 80% of the current level and a 20%
increase incosts, the project still yields significant benefits, representedby an economic rate of return
of 34.3%, which indicates that there is limitedrisk of the project being uneconomical. The analysis of
switching values of critical items indicates that to yield a net present value equal to zero, investment
costs needto be multipliedby 3.95 or benefits dividedby 4.

2. Technical

51.      The design of the rehabilitation program was based on sound technical criteria and is in line
with current international standards. The maintenance and rehabilitation strategies were selected with
due consideration being given to the main factors that affect pavement performance: surface
condition, structural strength, traffic characteristics and climatic conditions. Sections that will be
subject to routine maintenance alone are those that currently exhibit good riding quality with little
surface defects as well as sufficient structural capacity and are, generally speaking, traveled by low to
mediumtraffic. They are not expectedto show inthe short to medium term signs of distress and high
roughness values that would warrant excessive repairs or strengthening within the next 5 to 7 years.
Sections that will receive asphalt concrete overlays in thickness ranging from 3 to 10 cm have
currently a weak structural capacity associated with severe surface distress and relatively high
roughness values. The overlays have been designed to substantially enhance their structural strength
and to provide good riding quality over the next 10 to 15 years. The project also incorporates a
number of safety features basedon the recommendations from a Technical Assistance financed under
Loan 3611-AR and bridge rehabilitation works that have been designed on proven highway
engineering practice and experience.

3. Fiduciary

52.      Financial management and procurement assessments of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
and the DNV have been performed to assess its capability to effectively manage and implement the
National Highways Asset Management Project.             Taking into consideration DNV's considerable
experience in Bank financed projects, main conclusions so far indicate that DNV has the required
institutional capacity and the human resources required for the project administration. Some
opportunities for improvement both in financial management and procurement matters have been
identified but with full implementation of the Action Plan agreed with the Government and presented



                                                     18

in Annexes 7 and 8, DNV would have in place adequate arrangements to meet the Bank's fiduciary
requirements for the proposedproject. The schedule for implementing said action plan was agreed at
negotiations.

4. Social

53.      Impacts of road rehabilitation and maintenance operations on the local population i s expected
to be minimal, as most of the network under CREMA operations affect well established inter-urban
highways passing through sparsely populated areas. The project entails rehabilitation works on the
road network and construction works on two bridges, both to be carried out only within the existing
right-of-way. No resettlementis expectedand no social safeguardpolicy would be triggered.

5. Environment

54.      The proposed National Highway Asset Management Project establishes sound elements to
ensure an adequate management of rehabilitation and maintenance activities on the main road
network of the country, through the inclusion of the environmental and social dimension within the
project's cycle to assure the environmental and social sustainability of the project.

55.      The project has been qualified as "Category B", following the Operational Policy of the
World Bank [OPBP 4.011. This categorization arises because the works will be developed along
existing roads, without altering their physical conditions, their potential risks are easily identifiable,
mitigation actions are available, and an adequate social and environmental unit within DNV i s in
place. The environmental assessment of the project focused on four main areas: (a) environmental
evaluation of projects that would be financed by the Bank during the first year of project
implementation; (b) capacity assessment of the environmental unit of DNV; (c) revision of existing
mechanisms and tools to carry out environmental activities; and (d) compliance with environmental
legislation. The results of said assessment indicate that the project i s viable and complies with the
Bank's SafeguardPolicies.

traffic volumes on two-lane ruralhighways generally range between 500 and 3,000 vehicles per day.

Between 1990 and 1995, traffic growth rates on the main corridors were in the order of 8 to 13% per
annum but fell thereafter to about 3 to 5%. A typical traffic composition on the national highway

3. Network Surface Condition and Maintenance Management Modalities

For decades, fiscal crisis and poor managementledto under-funding and deterioration of Argentina's
infrastructure in general, and its road networks in particular. In 1990, available data indicated that
Argentina had the lowest share of paved roads in good condition among upper-middle income
countries. A survey carried out in 1992 confirmed that the national paved network was in excellent
condition only over 44% of its length (with an IRI<3) and had a high 35% of roads incritical or poor
condition.

The first action taken in 1991by the Government to alleviate the situation was to concession nearly
9,000 km of the paved network with the highest volumes of traffic (generally exceeding 2,500
vehicles/day). Altogether 18 concession contracts, representing about 20 corridors, were awarded to
the private sector for a period of 12 years and their up-keep has been financed essentially by road
users tolls. Inparallel, a loan from the World Bank was approved to finance, for the first time, high
priority rehabilitation and maintenance works on the non-concessioned paved network. The Bank-
financed project also helped DNV gradually contract out routine maintenance on that network and
pioneer a successful mechanism for contracting for a period of five years an output-based routine
maintenance program (Mmonth) and a combined performance-based Rehabilitation and
Maintenance system ((2.R.E.M.A). Such systems, put in operation between 1995 and 1997, covered
nearly 14,400 kmand comprised about 77 sub networks and contracts. Force-account activities were
therefore drastically reduced to mere emergency operations covering a length of about 5,000 km or
13% of the total network, while the remaining 2,000 km were maintained under contract agreements
with the ProvincialRoadsDepartments.

With the substantial improvements that occurred in the macro-economic situation of the country
between 1990 and 2000, the condition of the national road network improved considerably, thanks to
the concessionprogram on the one hand, and on the other, to the rehabilitation works and contracted
maintenancecarriedout under the Bank-financed Sixth and Seventh Highway Project (1991-1999). A
survey conducted at the end of 2002 shows that the proportionof paved roads in good condition (with
an International Roughness Index IRI< 4) has increasedto about 80% while the proportionin poor to
bad condition (with an IRI > 5) had been reduced to 5%.                  On the concessioned network, that
percentage in bad condition is currently insignificant, while on the non-concessioned paved network
the proportion of roads in fair to poor condition (with IRI> 4) i s still in the order of 29% (of which
8% have an IRI>5) (Fig. 5 and 6).

The total amount of investments made between 1991 and 2002 by the concessionaires to rehabilitate
and eliminate the backlog on the 9,000 km under their responsibility represented about US$2.4
billion, equivalent to a rather high US$ 22,000 per km per year. At the end of the concession
contracts, in October 2003, and as a result of that effort, the average annual maintenanceexpenditure
required on that network has fallen to about US$ 5,000 per km per year. On the non-concessioned
portion of the network under DNV's responsibility and including the 7,331 kmof unpaved roads, the
volume of capital expenditures made during the same period amounted to about US$ 4.7 billion,
representing about US$ 13,000 per kmper year. With the former concessionprogram having come to
term in October 2003, the Government has recently started a renewed round of concessions contracts
using different modalities: the new concessionaires are responsible only for the routine maintenance
operations activities over a period of 5 years, while the Government takes care of the rehabilitation
works.

Economic evaluations using the Bank's Highway Development & Maintenance Model (HDM-4)
indicate that in order to preserve, under the C.R.E.M.A system, the entire non-concessionednetwork
(about 22,000 km) in a sustainable good to fair condition, future annual allocations should remain at a
level of about US$ 300 million to US$400 million, i.e. about US$ 16,000 per km per year (US$ 330
million for capital overlay expenditures and US$ 80 million for recurrent maintenance).              An
additional amount of US$ 35 million i s to be allowed: (i) the maintenance of the unpaved network
                                                            for
(US$ 23 million) and (ii) the up-keep of the concessioned626 km long non-tolled COT network
                            for
(US$ 12 million). This sub-network called Construct/Operate/Transfer was contracted in 1995 to two
Firmsfor a 10-yearperiod.

4. DNV's HistoricalBudget Allocations and Work force.

Historical budget allocations for DNV over the last 20 years are shown in Fig. 7. Prior to 1990,
DNV's resources were earmarked from a fuel tax, but as of 1990, the Emergency Law that was
enacted eliminated that assigned funding mechanism and DNV started receiving funds from the
general budget. Between 1990 and 2000 and apart from relatively low allocations made in the period
1991-92, it can be seen that DNV's allocated budgets have been rather stable, ranging between US$
450 million andUS$650million annually.

excluding also the financial resources needed to service the debt and to continue upgrading and
paving the unpaved network as well as to increase the capacity of high- traffic segments on the non-
concessioned paved network, a minimum amount of about US$ 350 million are necessary to finance
CREMA contracts that would cover 19,244 kmof the non-concessionednetwork.

5. Road Safety

Road accident surveys carried out recently show that road fatality rates are relatively high in
Argentina, about 20 deaths per 100,000 population and nearly 13 per 10,000 vehicles, akin to rates
observed in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and Chile.        As a comparison, corresponding figures in
developed countries where comprehensive road safety strategies have been implemented are in the
range of 10to 15 and 1to 3 respectively. Available data also indicate that there has been a consistent
increase inthe total number of accidents since 1990, from 118,000 to almost 185,000 in 1995 giving
an annual rate of increase of nearly 10%. The rate of increase in the number of fatalities between
1985 and 2003 i s estimated to be in the order of 14%, similar to the overall rate of increase of
casualties. DNV i s committed to tackle this problem: the previous Bank-financed Sixth highway
project helped carry out a comprehensive study on road safety, and the proposed program for 2004-
2010 will incorporate an important road safety component. Institutionally, Argentina does not have an
agency leading road safety efforts, accountable for outcomes in this arena, and consequently lacks
sustainable and consistent road safety strategies or programs. The role of prevention-based
enforcement and education campaigns in improving road safety standards has been overlooked, and
funding of road safety initiatives has been weak or inexistent. However there is a strong platform of
actors, ranging from civil society, to private and public sector, willing to push the issue into the
agenda.

6. Bridge Network

There are about 2,100 bridges on the national highway system (on average, one bridge every 18 km)
that represent a total length of nearly 70 km. The actual condition of the bridge network i s yet to be
ascertained but considering the small little investments that have been allocated to its maintenance
and replacement over the last 15 years, a significant proportion are today in dire need of major
rehabilitation, including widening. A Bridge Management System based on an extensive inventory

and survey, is much needed and it i s DNV's intention to conduct that study during the proposed
project and to start implementinga comprehensivebridge rehabilitation program based on the results
and recommendations of the ManagementSystem Study.

            ARGENTINA: AR NATIONAL HIGHWAYASSET MANAGEMENT

The program comprises four components, namely: (i) rehabilitation and routine maintenance
                                                       the
of the non-concessioned paved national network over its total length of about 21,042 km; (ii)  the
restoration andor reconstruction of high priority bridge structures located on the national
highway system; (E)road safety interventions aimed at reducing accidents costs along identified
critical corridors and black spots of the national highway network; (iv) the institutional capacity
building of Vialidad Nacional (DNV) covering technical assistance, studies, training, twinning
arrangements andequipment to strengthenthe organizational capabilities of that Institution.

The Bank's support for the implementation of the above programwould be through atwo-phased
APL, each to be implemented over a period of four years or less. The fist phaseof the program

Component 1:Rehabilitation and maintenancethrough performance based contracts

Expansion of CREMAcontracts under the Proposed Project, which includes:

  i. Works that will be tendered and awarded between May and September 2004 to be
      financed by loan andcounterpart funds, through 27 individualcontracts, covering distinct
      sub-networks of a total length of about 4,628 km.

  ii. Works that will be tendered and awarded between November 2004 and April 2005 to be
      financed by loan and counterpart funds, through 21individual contracts, covering distinct
      sub-networks of a total lengthof about 3,560 km

      These two groups of networks include rehabilitation and maintenance activities under: (i)
      roads that were not part of the CREMA system previously (about 65%); and (ii)      roads
      that were not rehabilitated under previously executed CREMA contracts or received less
      than optimum maintenance in the past two years (due to the need to extend those
      CREMA contracts for two more years when initially designed for five), requiring capital
     expenditures to overcome the backlog of deferred maintenance. This network will be
      rehabilitated over approximately 6,000 km i.e., 66% of its total length, most probably
      between September 2004 and December 2006, while routine maintenance activities will
     be carried out during the 5-year period contracts. The total cost of this sub-component is
      estimatedto be in the order of US$ 247 million, 82% of which corresponds to the capital
     investment expenditures for rehabilitation works (the Bank's cost-sharing under this


                                              30

       component would be 74%). The rehabilitation works will consist mostly of asphalt
       concrete overlays ranging in thickness from 3 cm to 8 cm with a weighted average
       thickness of 4.8 cm and are expected to prolong the life of the pavements for another 10
       to 15 years. The proposed program will be carried out through 48 individual contracts, of
       an approximately equal amount of US$ 10 million each, covering distinct sub-networks
       having an average length in the order of 160 km. The program will enable the overall
       quality and structural integrity of that network to be preserved and improved and to
        maintain a good level of riding quality equivalent to between 3 and 3.5 International
       Roughness Index (IRI)throughout the next five years. Also in the future, only periodic
       maintenance consisting of thin bituminous carpets (between 3 to 4 cm) will be needed
       every 5 to 10 years in order to maintain a satisfactory and similar level of service, at a
        lower financial cost.

Works tendered and awardedbetweenNovember 2004 and February 2005, through 35 contracts,
will be financed with local funds exclusively. That network of a total length of 6,254 km will
also be attended under the same performance-based contract system, except that rehabilitation
works will be more limited due to budget constraints. Unlike the previously describedCREMAs
(under parts iand ii)that aimed at rehabilitating between 40% and 80% of their total length, at a
cost of between 75% and 82% of their total cost, this subcomponent will only rehabilitate about
2,056 kmi.e. 30% of its total length at a cost not exceeding 60% of its total cost. Compared with
the previous 48 CREMA contracts soon to be tendered, that cost between US$ 1l,OOO/km/year
and US$ 13,000 M y e a r , this 35 CREMA contracts will cost between US$5,000 and US$7,000
per kmper year. Rehabilitation works will mainly consist of thin asphalt overlays of about 3 cm
in thickness or of slurry seals. Most of this network is part of the CREMA contracts that were
executed between 1997 and 2004. Therefore, although the smaller scale of interventions i s
expectedto be sufficient to help maintain areasonablelevel of service duringthe next five years,
that will be translated in average IRISvalues of between 3.5 and 4, the GOAi s contemplating the
possibility of triggering during the APL2 further rehabilitation interventions to address the
demandsof acontinuous high levelof economic growth.

These networks will be prioritizedbasedon traffic levels, roadinfrastructure condition indicators
and the ratio resulting from the comparison of the Net Present Value of said particular works
over the cost of said particular works. A1projects should prove economic feasibility based on an
economic rate of return of at least 12%.

Program 's Additional Scope. DNV's expansion program includes the continuation o f (i)
currently on-going and new CREMA contracts for approximately 4,802 km to be financed with
local funds for a total amount duringthe period 2006-2010 and 1,799 kmof works financed with
local funds, through a contract- maintenance system called Sistema Modular that will be let to
the private sector. The difference with the CREMAS is that it will be an ad-measurementtype of
contracts with items activities and unit rates, to be executed over a 2-year- period. Activities on
that network will essentially consist in recurrent maintenance operations with localized
improvements at critical spots, the total unit cost of which will be in the order of US$ 2,700 per
km per year. Although much improvement in the riding quality or structural integrity of that
network i s not expected, due to the limited resources that will be allocated duringthe next years,




                                                 31

the recurrent and sustainedmaintenanceoperations will prevent excessivedeterioration to occur,
pendingthe availability of additional resourcesinthe near future.

Component 2: Bridge Restoration and Construction Management

DNV's bridge restoration strategy aims to guarantee safe and homogeneous transit conditions
along the main road corridors of the network, minimizing disruptions and speed or traffic
restrictions causedby capacity limitations. So far, DNV has slatedabout 65 bridges for attention
to gradually achieve such objective.          Those that are more urgently needed along priority
corridors lacking the minimum functional (too narrow) and structural (low bearing capacity)
requirements to allow safe transit are going to be addressedunder the project (5 bridges). Works
will involve either widening of the deck from 6 to about 8 meters (in 3 bridges), or total
replacement and construction with appropriate access embankments and pavements within the
existing right-of-way (2 bridges). All the bridges contemplated under this program, carry
relatively high traffic (more than 1,000 veldday), are located at critical spots along the national
highway system and often constitute the only access to important communities and/or other
business or production facilities.

Also, during project implementation, a comprehensive bridge managementtool to systematically
prioritize bridge interventions and identify cost-effective solutions would be adopted and
implemented through the proposed project. The program for the subsequent years will be
adjustedbasedon said bridge management system, which will determine the type of works to be
performed basedon cost-benefit analysis. This tool would support the objective of strengthening
DNV's strategic planningcapacities. The project would finance detailed engineering designs for
bridges to be implemented thereafter resulting from the prioritization exercise.

Component 3: Road Safety

Followingrecommendationsformulated on the Road Safety Technical Assistance financed under
Loan 3611-AR, DNV presented a proposal to develop an action plan to improve road safety
conditions in the country. Said proposals are to be implemented through the proposed Program
which comprises two main sub-components: (i)a large-scale strategy through which
engineering, enforcement, education and monitoring activities would be implemented on 4 pilot
road corridors, and (ii) road safety engineering interventions on identifiedblack spots of the road
network across the country, targeting areas with the highest concentrations of crash fatalities,
mainly near urbancenters.

(a) Large-scale Pilot Strategy: The overarching objective of implementing a broad approach
would be to demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated, results-focused road safety program
and help create the knowledge, experience and commitment required to roll it out successfully
throughout the rest of the country. The actions beingconsidered include:


    e    Engineering activities' concentrated along the selected corridors, to upgrade safety
         standards including: roadway edge widening and marking, placing ruble strips along
         roadsides, building roadside obstacle shields, horizontal markings, improving urban

        crossings, increasing size and quality of signs. DNV has preselected three corridors of
        approximately 200 km each and one corridor of 30 km (in which shoulder paving i s
        contemplated) as ideal safety pilot candidates based on: (i) of accidents, injuries
                                                                      number
        and fatalities, (ii) volume, and (iii)
                            traffic                    mortality index. Said corridors are to be
        analyzed jointly with other sectors (Health, Education) to explore comparative
        advantages and possible ways of participating in said corridors before confirming the
        final selection.

        Enforcement activities to target speeding, drink-driving, non-wearing of safety belts and
        helmets, commercial vehicle safety, etc. Formal agreements between DNV and the
        Provincial Police Force (along the corridors) or `Gendarmeria Nacional' are being
        considered. Through this component DNV would finance the required equipment and
        training courses to the police (or Gendarmeria) to monitor and ensure compliance with
        safety standards andrules along the pilot corridors.

        Education and communication strategy, through the development of school-based
        education resources and campaigns implemented along the highway corridor and/or
        urban centers near said corridor. The project would finance activities to upgrade current
        road safety educational practices at schools through arrangements with public and private
        education organizations, working in close partnership with the Ministry of Education and
        relatedNGOs.

        Monitoring and evaluation, to ensure that the road safety component i s fully monitored
        and comprehensive data is available for rigorous ex-post evaluations of results achieved.
        In order to do so, available accident Baseline Data is to be compared to: (i)     ex-post
        annual data in said corridors once the safety measures are in place, and (ii)     similar
        `control' corridors data that would not be subject to the road safety component
        implemented. Ex post evaluation and the availability of reliable data are essential in the
        creation of public awareness on the preventability of traffic accidents.

A partnership with the health sector is being established, specifically to link with the VIGIA
injury surveillance project financed under Loan AR-4516, and to align the improvement of road
safety outcomes with the achievement of healthsector injury prevention goals. Aligning selected
corridors with sentinel sites implemented under VIGIA project could prove extremely useful
when evaluating the impact of this component, for sentinel sites keep strict record of patients
entering emergency and specify causes of their admission, including traffic accidents.

Inthe absence of a higher-level road safety agency, the Presidency of the Cabinet of Ministers,
together with Ministry of Federal Planning, will play a coordinating role across sectors to
organize activities that go beyond the normal span of DNV (regarding enforcement, education
and health related activities). An overarching goal of the project would be to induce the decision
of appointing a high-level agency to lead road safety efforts in the country, accountable for
outcomes in this arena. In the meantime, a special committee structure for the duration of the
project, with membership invitedfrom all relevant partners would need to be established.




                                                33

The Project would embrace:

         Technical assistance or twinning arrangements to: (i)design the road safety pilot
         initiative including the design of a system to monitor and evaluate the impacts, defining
         impact indicators and baseline measurements, designing educational and communication
         campaigns, establishing the necessary institutional agreements, finalizing engineering
         designs and
         Works in the proposedcorridors

(b) Road Safety Works Plan: DNV has prioritized a series of engineering activities on black
spots along the road network across the country, concentrated near urban centers where the
accident rate is very high and the local population is among the primary victims (20% of total
fatalities in the country are concentratedon 2% of the roadnetwork, near urban areas). Basedon
current accident information DNV has identified about 35 interventions to be financed under the
proposedProgram.

The Project would embrace:

         Works in6 intersections and horizontal road demarcation inapproximately 310km.

Component 4: Institutional Renewal

Under this component, the Programwould include the following activities:

    Development and implementation of a Human Resources Plan to rebuild DNV's technical
    and institutional capacity within its new envisioned role as strategic planner of the road
    network performingunder a results-oriented framework, including:

         a. Detailed diagnosis of the current state of the staff platform of the DNV and definition
              of short runand longrunHuman ResourcesProgram, includinginter-alia:

                  v. Development of a remuneration policy consistent with the objectives of
                      reprofesionalization and quality management.
                  vi, Development of a system of incentives that enables to strengthenprofessional
                      careers, guaranteeinglabor stability for DNV employees.

         b. Implementation of short term actions according to the proposals that emerges from
              (a), including:

    c. Implementation of long-term actions according to the proposals that emerges from
       (a).

Development and implementation of a Technological Modernization strategy to increase
DNV's productivity and strengthen its planning, supervision, and monitoring capabilities,
including:

AR and 4295-AR loans will remain in charge of coordinating project activities. The PCU has
experience managing projects for the World Bank and the IDB, in particular regarding
procurement, disbursements, environmental and social guidelines, and auditing requirements.
The PCU will be headed by a General Coordinator and assisted by other adequate professional
staff with expertise in engineering, administrative, procurement and financial matters, through
out project implementation.


FinancialManagement

A financial management assessment of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and Direccio'n
Nacional de Vialidad (DNV) has been performed to assess its capability to effectively manage
and implement the National Highways Asset Management Project. Taking into consideration
DNV's considerable experience inBank financed projects, main conclusions indicate that DNV
has the required institutional capacity and the human resources required for the project
administration. Some opportunities for improvement in financial management matters have been
identified but with full implementation of the Action Plan agreed with the Government and
presented in Annex 7, DNV would have in place adequate arrangements to meet the Bank's
fiduciary requirements for the proposedproject.

Procurementactivities

The PCU will carry out procurement activities. The PCU structure comprises six (6) positions.
Two (2) of its technical staff provide procurement support to DNV. The PCU will appoint a
PCU General Coordinator, and hire a Procurement specialist, to strengthen its current capacity.
An Operational Manual is being prepared and will include among others, the project
procurement procedures and a methodology to adjust prices for each CREMA contract. The
PCU will also up-datethe Procurement Information System.


ProceduresfollowedbyDNVto programrequiredbudgetallocations

The allocation of budgetary resources for DNV, follow a process that begins early each year, in
which, based on the estimation of existing commitments and future work programs, a first
budgetary proposal is prepared. Acting as a decentralized organism under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Planning, Public Investment and Services, DNV raises said request for funds through
the Secretariat of Public Works, which reunites information from all other areas under its
jurisdiction and then submits a consolidated request for the sector to the Finance Secretariat
(Secretaria de Hacienda), within the Ministry of Economy and Production.




                                               41

Under the current budgetary exercise for year 2005, DNV estimated requirements to implement
the proposed investment programs were sent to the Secretariat of Public Works in May 7, 2004
discriminated by source of financing. The information covers a multi annual provision,
containing the requirements for the next three fiscal exercises. Said provisions are revised on a
yearly basis by the Ministry of Economy and Production, to be adjusted according to real budget
execution (disbursements).

Based on the information received, the Finance Secretariat (Secretaria de Hacienda) defines
`ceilings' per Ministry, establishing maximum amounts assignable per category of expenditure
andper source. Once the Ministry of Planning, Public Investment and Services gains knowledge
on these ceilings, it reassigns the budget among its various dependants. When DNV receives
information on the budgetceilings imposed on each category and source, it proceedsto adjust its
budget requests per specific projects, making them compatible with the defined ceilings and
producing an `Anteproyectode Presupuesto ',that should be completed by July 30th.

These procedures are standard and apply to all projects, independently of the financing source.
Therefore, in cases in which resources come from the Infrastructure Fiduciary Fund (UCOFIN),
the exact same process must be followed. Projects to be financed under said source (Source 14-
Internal Transfers) are also contained within the budget approved by Congress. However,
according to the Government regulations, in order to enable the use of UCOFIN resources, the
enactment of a National Decree is needed allocating the resources to each specific project. Once
said Decree is signed, DNV should be able to authorize disbursement for certificates presented
under said projects, following the same internalcontrol procedures. This process is followed for
each order of pay (or work certificate) sent by DNV to UCOFIN with a report on the judicial
service of the organism. The registers for this modality of payment are also included in the
NationalFinancial InformationSystem (SIDIF).

IfBorrowerdecidestoassignUCOFINfundsasprojectcounterpartfunds,thenaNational
Decree would be required according with national regulations. In such case, once the projects to
be financed with this source are registeredinUCOFIN, a specific disbursement procedure would
needto be agreed so as to ensurethat the counterpart payments for eligible expenditures are paid
by UCOFIN prior to disbursingBank's funds for the eligible share of expenditures. Counterpart
funds required for project implementation would be available regardlessof the source.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
           ARGENTINA: AR NATIONAL HIGHWAY ASSET MANAGEMENT

A review of the capability of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and DNV to effectively
manageand implement the Highway Asset Management Project was performed. The information
below results from the assessment conducted over the PCU and relevant administrative
proceduresof DNV.

The evaluation takes into account that the PCU was already establishedunder the Bank- funded
NationalHighways Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project financed by the Loan 4295 (US$450
million dollars- Approved 1998 - Active) and the closed Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Sector Project (US$340 million dollars -Approved 1993-Closed 2000).

The total program cost is US$ 841 million dollars and a total project cost of US$308.1 million.
Bank financing of the project involves a loan for US$200 million. An additional US$200million
i s expectedto finance the secondphaseof the program.

Fieldwork included discussionswith PCU key financial managementstaff as well as the analysis
of the integrated accounting system, internal controls and compliance systems.

DNV has the required institutional capacity and the human resources to administer the project.
However, certain issues raised by the external auditors in the above mentioned projects show
some opportunities for improvement in financial management matters. These matters are being
taken into account in the design of this project and specific measures have been agreed to
mitigate them. A detailed Action Plan has been agreed with the GOA. The schedule for its
implementation was agreedduringnegotiations.

The action plan includes the following steps: i)Prepare the Administrative section of the
Operational Manual, including the internal control system to be implemented; ii)Create separate
budget line/s in the DNV budget to keep track of project execution; iii)Adapt the existing
financial information system to project requirements (adjust chart of accounts); iv) Agree on
FMRs format for monitoring and evaluation purposes; v) Prepare the terms of reference for the
external auditing process which includes the requirement for interim reports. The action plan i s
part of the financial management assessment included in this document. Most of the previous
mentioned conditions will be fulfilled by effectiveness with the presentation of the
Administrative section.of the Operative Manual that will include: i)Chart of Accounts and
internal controls; ii)the FMR formats; iii)the terms of reference for carrying out the Project
audits; iv) the Project disbursement procedures and the procurement plan for part A1 of the
project.

Uses of Funds

All uses of funds will be processed in the DNV budget execution system (SIDIF OD - Sistema
Integrado de Informaci6n Financiera - Organism0 Descentralizado) and in PCU project
accounting system, supportedby documentary evidence for the related works, goods and services
procured inline with Bank guidelines for the project.



                                                43

Executing Agency and the Project

The financial management arrangements including: accounting, budgeting, internal control,
external auditing, financial monitoring reports preparation and disbursement will be under the
FMdepartmentof DNV.Projectaccountingwill alsobekeptby the PCU.

The proposed arrangements on organization were found acceptable, and DNV has provided
evidence of the assignment of skilled staff to the financial management, however, the PCUneeds
more staff andDNV needs to adopt an Operational Manual.

Financial Management Information System

The PCU will maintain the accounts for the project in its own accounting system with the chart
of accounts reflectingthe categories and components of the project. Also, PCUwill maintain an
adequate asset register for the project. The accrual basis will be used for internal reporting and
the FMRsthat will be prepared.

The Public Sector Accounting standards in Argentina will be followed. The public sector
accounting rules are comprehensive and consistent with public international standards. Said
standards are set by the Contaduria Generalde la Naci6n (CGN).

DNV will prepare the following Financial Monitoring Reports: (i)a summary of uses and
sources of funds and a statement of uses by project activity; (ii)procurement monitoringreports,
and (iii) output monitoring reports, all in accordance with formats to be included in the
Operational Manual to be presented upon at effectiveness. Additionally, PCU will be responsible
of project accounting, timely submission of the Financial Management Reports -FMRs and to
prepare annual project financial statements in line with the Bank requirements. DNV will be
responsible for the financial management of the project, including Flow of Funds, keeping of
supporting documentations, and proper payments registration in its own SIDIF system. Annual
audits will cover all these aspects of project implementation. The FMRs will be submitted
semiannually to the Bank. The physical progress indicators will be consulted with the TTL to
ensure the usefulness of the FMR inthe overall project supervision.

Special Account: The Borrower will open a Special Account in dollars in the Banco de la
Naci6n Argentina to be used to receive Loan proceeds. Said account will be managedby DNV.
DNV may use also direct payments in other money than argentine pesos out of Argentina or
direct payments in pesos within Argentina to pay contractors. The authorized allocation will
cover up to four months of local currency operations. As expenditures are incurred, funds will be
converted to local currency and depositedin a DNV account within the Cuenta Unica del Tesoro
(CUT), account under the control of the DNV. DNV use the Cuenta Unica del Tesoro (CUT) to
channel its funds through the NationalTreasury System (Tesoreria de la Nacibn). The proposed
maximum authorized allocation for this operation i s 30 million dollars. This amount exceeds the
10% of the first APL phase of the Loan, but that ceiling is needed due to the short period to
disburse the Loan proceeds. The authorized allocation has been approved by LOA as provided
in OPBP 12.20. Additional measures have been taken to monitor Special Account use as the
interim audit report and monthly submission of justification of expenditures with Special
Account reconciliation. The minimum amount for withdrawal applications and SOE thresholds
will be agreedduringnegotiations.

As well as NationalTreasury allocations, counterpart funding arrangementsmay include, the use
of funds from the Transport Infrastructure Trust Fund (fiduciary fund financed by a specific
diesel oil tax, and administered by UCOFIN). In such case, according to the Government
regulations, the enactment of a National Decree would be needed to allocate the required
resources to each specific project to be financed. Whenever a project's counterpart fund is to be
financed with said source, DNV would send the request of payment to UCOFIN and wait until
receiving the documentation of UCOFIN payments, prior to disburse Bank's funds for the
eligible share of expenditures.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs): Disbursements will be made based on traditional
Statementsof Expenditures (SOEs) and Direct Withdrawal Applications (DWAs) as well. Inthe
case of the latter, disbursements will be made based on full documentation for all expenditures
made under contracts requiring prior review by the Bank, and contracts whose value will be
raised above the prior review limits as a result of amendments. All consolidated SOEs
documentation will be maintained by DNV for post-review and audit purposes for up to one year
after the final withdrawal from the loan. Reimbursement requestsshould be sent to the Bank on a
monthlybasis.

Replenishment:Applications for replenishment would be submitted on a monthly basis or when
one third of the funds of the Special Account have been withdrawn. Replenishments, up to the
Authorized Allocation(s) will be made initially based on Applications for Withdrawals (Form
1903) accompanied with the supporting and other documentation specified in the Disbursement
Handbook. The project will request access to Bank's Client Connection web page to get the 1903
Form from the web and to perform on a periodic basis the reconciliation process between their
bank account and the resourcesreceivedfrom the different sources.



                                               45

Project Financial Statement Audit Arrangements: The project financial statements will be
audited by the Argentine Supreme Audit Institution (AGN) under acceptable audit Terms of
Reference prepared in line with Bank Guidelines. The audit would cover all funding and
expenditures reported in the project financial statements. The audit period will be the calendar
year. The annual audit report shall be received no later than June 30 of each year. The audit
terms of reference will comprise the annual audit report and an interimsemiannual report, which
will cover procurement, Internal Control and Special Account reconciliation. The first interim
report will cover untilSeptember 2004.

RiskAnalysis

DNV will implement the project using its own financial management systems, which are those
used by the National Government, thereby mainstreaming project operations and sharing the
same risk than the Public Financial Management SysteminArgentina.

However, the evidence collected from previous Bank financed projects implemented by DNV,
where sources of funds has been mixed and Bank funds used for local share of expenditures,
shows that DNV has problems implementing projects with specific sources of funds different
than from the National Treasury.

It can only be concluded that DNV capacity for project implementation with multilateral
financing control i s weak and therefore the project's inherent risk is high. As a risk mitigation
measure, specific budget identification for this project within DNV's budget has been agreed.
This allows track project execution inSIDIF andhasbeen requiredby alegal covenant.

The Argentine CFAA indicates that overall control of public finances could be considered
moderate.

The core system in the Central Administration can provide reliable and relevant information on
income, uses and the financial position, and are subject to the audit of AGN providing a good
control framework. Within DNV some opportunities for improvement of the Internal Control
Framework havebeenidentifiedand steps to addressthese agreedto put inplace.

The overall risk assigned to the project is average. The proposed mitigation measures and
supervision plan are designedto handlethe risks identified.

Conclusion:

On the basis of the assessment performed, the financial management team concludes that upon
completion of the proposed action plan the project financial management arrangements would
satisfy the Bank minimumfinancial management requirements.

A.      GeneralAspects

Advance contracting

The loan would finance 27 performance-based contracts for the rehabilitation and maintenance
of paved roads (known as CREMA contracts) bid by DNV before Loan signature under ICB
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The Bank has prior reviewed all the bidding documents and
the corresponding recommendations for award that have been produced as of the date of this
document and would continue doing so in order to make sure that all of them are acceptable to
the Bank.

Contractingafter loansigning

Procurement to be undertaken after loan signature would be carried out in accordance with the
World Bank's "Guidelines: ProcurementUnder IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004;
and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated
May 2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The general description of
various items under different expenditure categoriesi s includedbelow and inAttachment 1. For
each contract to be financed by the Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant
selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements,and
time frame are agreedbetween the Borrower andthe Bank project team inthe ProcurementPlan.
The Procurement Plan will be updatedat least annually or as required to reflect the actual project
implementation needs and improvements ininstitutionalcapacity.

a) Procurement of Works: Works procured after Loan signature would include 21 CREMA
    contracts (four of them procured using the method of lots under two separate bidding
    processes, which results in a total of 19 bidding processes), roads safety interventions and
    bridge restoration contracts. Pre-qualification would be followed for contracts estimated to
    cost US$10 million or more. ICB procedures would be followed for contracts estimated to
    cost US$5 million or more. NCB procedures might be followed for contracts estimated to
    cost less than US$5 million. Shopping procedures might be followed for contracts estimated
    to cost less than US$350,000. The procurement would be done using the Bank's Standard
    BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD satisfactory to the Bank. A price
    adjustment methodology for CREMA contracts to be procured after Loan signing would be
    included in the Project Operational Manual. During negotiations it would be agreed that the
    existing CREMA bidding documents would be revised in order to adjust them to the 2004
    Procurement Guidelines, to include the revised price adjustment methodology and to reflect
    agreement on various procurement issues on which final agreement has not yet reached with
    DNV (Le., the price of the bidding documents and the mechanisms for resolution of
    conflicts).

b) Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include Road Safety, IT
    and Communications equipment. ICB procedures would be followed for contracts estimated

B. Assessmentof the Agency's Capacity to Implement Procurement

The Borrower's National Highways Directorate (DNV), will carry out procurement activities
with the support of a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). The PCU structure comprises six (6)
positions. Two (2) of its technical staff provide procurement support to DNV.

An assessment of the capacity of the PCU to implement procurement actions for the project has
been carried out by AndrCs Mac Gaul, Procurement Specialist (LCOPR) on April 20, 2004. The
assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project andthe interaction
betweenthe PCU and DNV.

The overall project risk for procurement i s AVERAGE. The fact that the prior review thresholds
applicable to the on-going Loan (AR 4295) correspond to AVERAGE Risk has been of
fundamental importance at the time of assessing the Riskof the new operation as AVERAGE.

Some opportunities for improvement in terms of procurement have been identified taking into
account that: (a) there have been some complaints during the implementation of previous
projects; (b) DNV has been considered a challenging agency to work with in terms of
procurement related matters; (c) DNV does not have an Operational Manual and there is room
for improvement in procurement planning, (d) the PCU General Coordinator has not been
appointed and an additional procurement expert i s needed; (e) the Procurement Information
System needs to be updated and (f) DNV has not submitted yet to the Bank any request for no-
objection to final price-adjustments of CREMA contracts that were on-going at the time of the
devaluation..

Specific counteractive measures that have been agreed to enhance the project's procurement
performance are:

       On or before May 24, 2005: DNV to present a final EstimatedList of Contracts under the
       Project, a final ProcurementPlan for the first 18 months of project implementation
       On or before July 15, 2004: DNV to present for Bank consideration its proposal on
       conflict resolution mechanisms
       On or before July 30, 2004: DNV to present for Bank consideration the proposed revised
       CREMA samplebidding documents to use the methods of lots;
       On or before November 30, 2004: DNV to: adapt the procurement information system so
       as to reflect changes inducedby the devaluation of the peso.
       At Effectiveness: DNV to adopt an Operational Manual acceptable to the Bank, which
       should include the Project procurement procedures; and the methodology to adjust the
       price of new CREMA contracts (ICB) to be procuredunder the proposed loanusing price
       adjustment formulas on a monthly basis, all of them acceptableto the Bank.
       At Project Launch: DNV key managers should attend the project launch to be delivered
       by the Bank.
       During Project Implementation:         DNV to ensure that the PCU is staffed with an
       additional professional with expertise inprocurement matters.

C. Procurement Plan

The Borrower, at negotiations, developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation that
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
Borrower and the Project Team on May 24,2004 and will be available at DNV's web page. It
will also be available in the Project's database and in the Bank's external website. The
Procurement Plan will be updatedin agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

D. Frequency ofProcurementSupervision

Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment of the ImplementingAgency has recommended annual supervision missions to the
field to carry out post review of procurement actions. One (1) out of five (5) contracts signed
should be reviewed.

E. SpecialProcurement Conditions

In order to avoid conflicting interpretations arising from local law and regulations, the Loan
Agreement contains a Special Procurement Condition establishing that price adjustments for
CREMA contracts bid (under ICB) after Loan signing should be done on a monthly basis
through price-adjustment formulas, according to the clauses of the applicable Bank SDB and to
specific methodology that DNV and the Bank would have agreed before loan effectiveness and
that would be included in the Project Operational Manual.

In addition to the above, the Loan Agreement includes the following Special Procurement
Condition: "The invitations to bid, bidding documents, minutes of bid openings, requests for
expressions of interest and notifications of award of all goods, works and services (including
consultants' services), as the case may be, shall be published in the web page of Oficina
Nacional de Contratacionesin a manner acceptable to the Bank." Some projects have argued that
localregulations do not apply on this topic.

Summaryof Benefitsand Costs:

An economic analysis was done for the bridge restoration program and for each rehabilitation
and maintenance program to be implementedby DNV during the period 2004-2010 consisting
of: (a) 8,188 km of CREMA contracts to be bid and awarded in 2004-2005 financed by the Bank
Loan; (b) 6,254 km of CREMA contracts to be bid and awarded in 2005-2006 with local
financing; (c) 2,518 km of CREMA contracts to be bid and awarded in 2007-2009 with local
financing; (d) 2,284 kmof CREMA contractsunder execution and/or to be awardedin2004 with
local financing; and (e) 1,799 kmof two-year unit price contacts to be bid and awardedin 2006-
2009 with local financing, all of which account for 21,042 km or 100 percent of the non-
concessioned national road network.      The main benefits are savings in road user costs. Net
benefits were evaluated using the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4),
which simulates life cycle conditions and costs and provides economic decision criteria for
multipleroaddesign and maintenancealternatives.

The economic evaluation of the project yields a net present value, at 12% discount rate, of US$
1,008 million and an economic rate of return of 45.0%. The economic analysis summary is
given below.

DNVRehabilitationandMaintenancePrograms

DNV collected detailed roadcharacteristics and traffic for each CREMA network andperformed
a project level economic evaluation with the objective o f (a) identifying sections to be
maintained and sections in which some kind of rehabilitation work i s economically justified; (b)

computing the net benefits of possible project alternatives; and (c) ensuringthat all investments
yield a rate of return higher than 12%. To perform a network level economic evaluation with
the objective to assessing all DNV rehabilitation and maintenanceprograms for the period 2004-
2010, the Bank mission has reevaluatedthe benefits of the project by defining a matrix of road
classes based on road condition and traffic. Network data was collected from (a) a sample data
set (60%) of the CREMA contracts to be bid and awarded in 2004-2005 financed by the Bank
Loan; and (b) broad engineeringestimates of the network to be bid and awarded in 2005-2009
with local financing, which has an estimated average roughness in the order of 3.0 IRIand an
estimated average traffic in the order of 1000 AADT. The estimated current characteristics of
network to bebidand awarded in2004-2005 financed by the Bank Loan are given below.

Maintenance and rehabilitation costs were estimated in financial and economic terms; economic
costs being on average 70% of the financial costs. The estimated financial average cost of the
rehabilitation works of the CREMA contracts to be financed by the Bank Loan is US$ 79,300
per km, for 4.0 to 5.0 cm overlays; and the average cost for the CREMA contracts with local
financing and lower standards i s US$ 57,400 per km, for 3.0 cm overlays. Typical road works
unitcosts are given below.

For the overall network to be rehabilitated, the financial capital expenditures during the project
period (2004-2010) are US$ 11,022 per year-km, and the financial capital expenditures after the
project period to obtain the same level of service are US$ 7,575 per year-km. For the overall
network, the financial road user costs savings with respect to the without project case during the
project period are US$468 million, i.e., US$3,712 per year-km.

Bridge Restoration Program

The economic benefits of the bridge restoration component were evaluated by DNV by
estimating savings on vehicle operating costs and passenger time cost and savings on bridge
maintenance costs achieved due to the bridge improvements. For example, for the Rio San
Lorenzo bridge the without project case considers reduced vehicle speeds for heavy vehicles, at
55 km/hr, and that periodic maintenanceis needed every 5 years. The with project case considers
that travel restrictions are eliminated and speeds increase to 85 km/hr, and periodic maintenance
i s needed every 10 years. The main characteristics of the bridge restoration first year program
and the corresponding economic evaluation indicators are given below.

The roads on which the bridges are located have an average traffic of 1,230 AADT and the
average investment cost is US$ 2.1 million per bridge. The economic evaluation of the bridge
restoration first year program yields a net present value of US$ 14.7 million and an economic
rate of return of 38.1%. Extrapolating these results for the entire bridge restoration program,
which considers US$ 31 million of bridge investments, the economic evaluation of the entire

Sensitivity analysis of critical items:

The results are robust relative to the main risks considered in the economic analysis, namely,
cost increases and lower benefits due to lower traffic. Under a worst-case scenario of benefits
dropping to 80% of the current level and a 20% increase in costs, the project still yields
significant benefits, represented by an economic rate of return of 34.3%, which indicates that
there i s limited risk of the project being uneconomical. The sensitivity analysis yields the
following results.

           ARGENTINA: AR NATIONAL HIGHWAY ASSET MANAGEMENT


Introduction

The proposed National Highway Asset Management Project establishes sound elements to
ensure an adequate management of rehabilitation and maintenance activities on the main road
network of the country, through the inclusion of the environmental and social dimension within
the project's cycle to assure the environmental and social sustainability of the project.

As part of the environmental and social assessment, a sample of 20 road networks (Mallas
CREMA) and 5 bridges to be implemented during the first year were reviewed, using the
Guidelines for Addressing Environmental' and Social Safeguard Issues in Roads Financing
Projects, developed by the Bank's Quality AssessmentTeam (QAT).

Also, as part of the assessment process, an analysis of the Environmental Management Division
within DNV was performed, resulting in the identification of two activities that need to be
worked on in order to improve DNV's socio-environmental capabilities: (i)      updating the current
Environmental Management and Evaluation Manual (MEGA93); and (ii)developing an
Institutional Strengthening Plan for DNV's environmental and social management (PFI-GA).
Said requirements were agreed upon with QAT as a means to assure the social and
environmental sustainability of the project and to comply with the Environmental and Social
SafeguardPolicies of the Bank.

Environmental Impacts

The project supports minimum rehabilitation and maintenance works on the existing national
road network. No new construction works out of the right of way of the road network are
contemplated (two new bridges are to be constructed within the right of way) under the project
and as such minimum impacts on the natural surroundings and the population, are to be
expected. Some activities related to the execution of these works could potentially generate
environmental and social risks. However, activities susceptible to generate environmental and/or
social impacts are easily identified, and actions or measuresto prevent and/or compensatefor the
potential negative impacts should be available. Such impacts are direct andtemporary.

a. Activities susceptible togenerate environmentaland social impacts:

    Prior to work execution:
    ..  Selection of areas for placingcamping, equipment and materials.
        Combustible and lubricant transportation.

    During work execution:
    ..  Material and combustible transportation.
        Oil, grease and combustible management within equipment settlings and pavement
        platforms.



                                                60

       Paving platformoperations produce atmospheric contamination.
       Construction activities may create unsafe conditions for traffic, interfering with the flow
   .   of vehicles.
       Dragging of inappropriate materialstowards final disposition areas.
       Elimination of solid waste from construction camping and working sites.

   Recuperation activities:
   =
   ..  Recuperation of borrowing sites, whenever isjustified.
       Management of material or waste deposition sites.
       Re vegetation of areas under interventions.

b. Identification of potential environmentand social impacts:

   Waste and/or contaminants:
   Duringthe rehabilitation and maintenance works, atmospheric emissions may occur due to
   the following activities: a) Operation of machines and equipment, resulting in gas emissions
   caused by the combustion of petroleum derivable; b) explosion of material banks; c)
   dragging of material.

   Solid waste:
   The contaminants that may be produced during the execution phase include: waste from
   materials and residualproducts from machinery such as filters, used repositions, pneumatics,
   oil deposits, rubbish, amongothers.

   Noise and/or vibrations:
   The use of machinery and equipment during the phase of work execution, explosion of
   material banks and the improvement of the road network, may cause levels of noise that
   could affect workers and other populations located along the highways.

   Visual contamination:
   The lack of environmental criteria during the execution of works, for example, during the
   final deposition of waste materials onthe roadside, can alter the landscape.

   Protectedareas:
   The execution of works under areas declared under a specific environmental protection
   regime or in zones of high environment sensitivity, requires an integral management of the
   area. The crossing of protected areas is not foreseen.

   Reestablishmentof environmental losses:
   Whenever it is justified, resources directed towards the reestablishment of environmental
   losses occurred in the past, which currently affect the road (zones of material explosions,
   affected bodies of water, among others), could be introduced as part of the project's
   investment.




                                                61

    Slopes stabilization and eroded zones:
    Certain physical and environmental characteristicsof the zone that could affect the continuity
    of traffic flows, could be improved, in particular those with stability problems presenting
    erosion processes.

Environmental Assessment

The project's main component refers to the rehabilitation and maintenance of existing roads.
Given the type of works being considered, no significant environmental and social impacts that
could endanger the natural surroundings of the area under influence are expected. Potential
impacts arising from bridge reconditioning works can be prevented or mitigated through
adequate environmental management. Given the above, the project has been qualified as
"Category B", following Bank's Operation Policy OP4.01

This categorization arises because the works will be developed along existing roads, without
altering their physical conditions and their potential impacts are easily identified and mitigated
with an adequate environment management. It i s worth mentioning that the main socio-
environmental impacts occurred in the past when the road network were constructed, and that
with the current rehabilitation works, the environmental conditions will be enhanced, through
complementary works such as drainage, signaling, reestablishment of environmental losses,
among others. Inthe bridge component, although two of the proposedbridges are new, this does
not present highrisk due to the characteristics of the influence zone and due to the fact that with
an adequate environmental management, potential risks could be prevented or mitigated (also
within the existing right of way).

The environmental assessment of the project focused on four main areas: a) Environmental
assessment of projects that would be financed by the Bank during the first year of project
implementation; b) Assessment of the environmental and social management of DNV; c)
Revision of existing mechanisms and tools to carry out environmental activities; and d)
Compliance with environmental legislation.

a. Environmentalevaluationof thefirst package of projects

A sample of 20 national road networks (Mallas CREMA) and 5 bridges, were selected to carry
out the environmental and social assessment of the proposed project. The biddingdocuments for
this first packageof works include a set of terms of reference indicating to potential bidders the
need to prepare an Environmental Management Plan for each project (Annex 12), according to
the guidelines set by the Environmental Management and Evaluation Manual. This initiative is
new for this type of contracts, demonstrating an important advance in the environmental and
social managementcapabilities of DNV.

During the Bank's evaluation process, some sectors of the road network within the province of
Buenos Aires were visited in order to obtain a general vision of the type of roads and their
potential risks.  Drawing from this information and with the support of the Environmental
Management Division of DNV the Guidelines for Addressing Environmental and Social



                                                62

Safeguard Issues in Roads Financing Projects was applied, to perform a rapid environmental
evaluation of each project included under the first package, and on that basis, enable the
measurement of potential environmental and social risk. Those results are presented in the
EnvironmentalReport of the DNV that is included inthe Infoshop.

The result of the environmental evaluation determinedthat all the projects on the national road
network are classified on `level 3', meaning that they present low levels of social and
environmental risks, inrelation to environmental sensitivity according to the type of works to be
done.

Inthe case of the bridges, there is one bridge classified as `level 1',presenting potentially high
environmental risks (Bridge over the San Antonio River), because it involves the construction of
a new bridge and the areas of construction are surrounded by natural forests. The bridges
crossing over the rivers San Lorenzo, Corrientes, and those placed on highway number 9, are
classified as `level 2', meaning moderate environmental risks, mainly because they consist of
works aimed at widening the platform and improving access. Finally, the bridge over the
Guayquiraro river, i s classified as `level 3', meaning low environmental risk because it involves
only rehabilitation and maintenance works over the existing platform and the zone of influence
does not present fragile ecosystems that could be at risk during implementation of works. It is
worth mentioning that in the case of the bridge classified as `level l', to the scale of the
                                                                          due
project (30,60m), with an adequate environmental management of the direct impacts, this project
i s viable from an environmental point of view.

As a result of the implementation of the guidelines an estimated environmental budget was
obtained for the first package of works, ascending to US$ 6,391,668.00 ($ 19,175,004), which
represents 3.04% of the total sum US$ 209,977,824.33 ($ 629,933,473). The environmental
budget for the road network is of US$5,998,834.67 ($ 17,996,504) representing 3.0%, while for
the bridge component it is of US$ 392,833.33 ($ 1,178,500), which represents 4.0%. The results
of the environmental analysis of each of the projects included within the first package following
the guidelines are presentedbelow:

b. Institutional evaluation of the environmental management:

During the project assessment, a series of activities aimed at strengthening the social and
environmental management capabilities of DNV were identified. An Institutional Strengthening
Plan for the Environmental Management (PFI-GA) was prepared (Annex 12).

Three main weaknesses were identified, to be addressed during project implementation: (i)    lack
of technical support on the Environmental Management Division to deal with specific issues; (ii)
lack of training at different levels of the institution to promote the environmental and social
agenda; (iii) the needto strengthenprocedures, within the DGA, and between the DGA and other
dependencies of the institution, to introduce the environmental dimension at all stages of the
project cycle. The two first issues were introduced as part of a strengthening plan for DGA,
while the third will be addressed through the use of the updated version of the Environmental
Management and Evaluation Manual (MEGA),to be referredto below.

Inthis sense, the Planincludes basically two components, (i)   Technical Assistance for the DGA
on specific issues; and (ii) on issuesrelatedto environmental management.
                           Training

Regarding the technical assistance, support from an environment specialist is required to follow
up the process of updating the MEGA and its latter promotionanddiffusion. Also, a geographic
information system specialist is neededto optimize the use of existing tools within the DGA.

In relation to the training component, a series of training activities aimed at different levels
within the organization, will be carried out, including: (i)
                                                           Training sessions for DNV on the use
of the updated MEGA I1and other environment related issues through workshops; (ii)       Training
for the DGA in specific technical issues both at national and international level; (iii)
                                                                                      Training to
the regional districts in the use and application of MEGA I1 and specific workshops aimed
towards the Centers of Environmental Management (CEGA) within the districts; and (iv)
Training in specific issues aimed towards the road sector (eg.in Strategic Environmental
Assessment, among others), including the DNV as well as others institutions working within the
sector.

c. Revision of mechanisms and tools usedfor environmental and social management:

Inorder to guarantee the environmental sustainability of the project, after a preliminary study of
the institutional management regarding social and environmental issues, the need for updating
the Environmental Management and Evaluation Manual (MEGA), was identified.

The Manual was developed in 1993 with support from the Bank and has been an instrument that
has significantly contributed to the introductionof the environmental and social dimensions, both
internally and externally, in the projects promoted by the DNV. It is worth mentioning that this
instrumenthas also been used by the Provincial Directorates of Highways, who adapt it to their
particular necessities.




                                                65

A revision of said manual is required to introduce new issues and management tools that are
currently being used internationally, and adjust certain aspects that after several years of
implementation can be thoroughly improved.

In order to update MEGA 11,the DGA has preparedthe corresponding Terms of Reference for
contracting the consultant services that will be in charge of this task. The environment specialist
of the Bank revised these TOR.

The process of selection of the consultant who will be in charge of the task was initiatedthe lSt
of April with the publication of an `expressionof interest', calling for consultant firms to present
their background experience. The following step will be the selection of a short list of consultant
firms who will have to present their proposals. This list should be ready by the end of April, and
after that, the formal contract will be prepared, initiating works during the month of May. The
Manual i s expected to be ready on November 30,2004. The TORSare included inAnnex 12.

d. Compliancewith Environmental L.egislation:

The bidding documents for the CREMA contracts mention the need to comply with
environmental norms andlaws imposed by the National Environmental Authority.

The referred operational and environmental permits from the Environmental Authority are to be
arrangedby each contractor, once the detailed engineeringdesigns ("Proyecto Ejecutivo) and the
Environmental Management Plan, have been finalized. The contractor will have to present a
detailed acceptable management plan of all permits and licenses required for the works that are
not provided by the DNV and that are neededfor work completion, including:

        Certificate of environmental quality or declaration of environmental impact on quarries
        (Legal Framework for Mine Activities)
        Permits for water retention.
        Disposition of materials resulting from removing vegetation along roadside and
        excavations
        Identification of camping sites (when there are settled construction sites in areas
        bordering with protected natural areas or urbanized areas)
        Disposition of solid waste
        Disposition of effluents.
        Transportation permits, including transportation of hazardous materials (combustibles,
        explosives) and hazardouswaste (used oils).
        Continuation of works after discoveries relate to the cultural patrimony, including
        archeological or paleontologic sites.
        Permits for repairing costs causedby temporary closure of roads or accesses.

The contractors must act according to the existing guidelines and must comply with all of the
requisites included within all of the processes permits, adjusting work execution to the
resolutions and decisions taken by the competent provincial or municipal authorities.




                                                66

EnvironmentalManagementPlan

Detailedengineering studies for the CREMA contract will include corresponding Environmental
Management Plans (EMP). The Environmental Management Plans are based on guidelines
provided in the MEGA and on the authorization conditions that could have been set by
provincial or municipal authorities, as well as by the authorities of natural protected areas, when
applicable.

The EMP for the rehabilitation phase must include all specific environmental management
measures for activities directly an indirectly related to construction, identified in the Bidding
Documents as "Enforced Interventions and Recuperation Tasks", such as: selection of camping
sites, lending of materials, paving platforms, inputs required for work completion, land
movements, crosses on water pathways, storing of combustibles, plague insecticides, paints and
grease removers, management and disposition of solid and liquid waste, etc. and the phase of
abandonment.

Once the segment of the road has been freed from traffic, the EMP for the phaseof maintenance
and operation (EMPmo) should contain all the environmental management measures directly or
indirectly related to maintenance and operation, within the BiddingDocuments "Conditions and
Particular Technical Specifications for Bidding Contracts of Recuperation and Maintenance of
Highways", such as: cleaning road zone, reparation of holes and roadside, sealing of road
fissures, etc.

The EMP's objective i s to detail the site of the works and the procedures and methodologies
implemented in the construction and control phases, guaranteeing that works are developed
under minimum environmental impacts. The following guideline is included when referring to
the preparation of the EMPc and the EMPmo: "they must be totally aligned to the current
environmental legislation in the corresponding jurisdiction and include the authorization
conditions that could have been definedby competent provincial authorities. The EMPmust also
include the following plans:

        EMP's TrainingPlan
        It is considered an essential activity within all the phases of the project (construction,
        maintenance, operation) including the admission of personnel. It will be developed
        according to the organization schemeprovidedfor work initiation, orally and written.

        EMP'sActionPlan
        The Action Plan includes the whole set of actions that will guarantee the elimination,
        prevention or control of the environmental risks detected inthe Impact Identifyingphase,
        Mitigation Measures and/or EIAs. The detailed study of the mitigation measures and the
        needto protect vulnerable recipients, are essential for its formulation.

        EMP's ContingencyPlan
        A Planfor attending emergencieswill have to be developed, including (but not restricted
        to) spillingof chemical products, combustibles, lubricants, etc.

    Annex 15: RegionalDistributionof RoadRehabilitationand MaintenanceActivities
    ARGENTINA: AR NATIONAL HIGHWAYSASSET MANAGEMENT PROJECT

Proposed road rehabilitation and maintenance investments were disaggregated by Province to
analyze the regional distribution and coverage of the program. Data received from DNV defining
estimated program investments and program coverage (kilometers under CREMA or Modular)
per province, was compared with economic indicators, so as to identify what proportion of the
expansion of the CREMA system would reach provinces with lower levels of economic activity
within the country.

The indicator selected for this exercise was the Gross Geographic Product (GGP) per capita",
for it is an indicator that accounts for the relevance of the province within the national economy.
The 23 provinces were ranked according to their GGP per capita and the 12 worst positioned
provinces within the ranking were tested for their level of investment and coverage under the
proposed project particularly under the Rehabilitation and Maintenance component. This
exercise led to the following conclusion: 46% of project coverage and 47% of project investment
is concentrated in these twelveprovinces that congregate 30% of total population and represent
36% of the national territorial extension.

When contrasting the investment distributions per province for this project, with investment
distributions from the prior loan, it is observedthat the percentagesof total loan amount assigned
to these same twelve provinces has increased (previously being 39% of total investments and
40% of total coverage), suggesting that the objective of achieving a regionallybalanced outcome
within the CREMA program is being gradually attained (equity based allocations), but priority is
also given to the main roads of the country (efficiency basedallocations).




  The gross geographic product (GGP) of a particular province is equivalent to the cumulative amount of income
  payments received from production factors - (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship)- for their participation in
  the production within that province

                                                                      Management Project.

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:

         Iampleasedtopresentthisletteronsectorpolicy,whichcontainsthemainstrategiesthatthe
Republic of Argentina plans to develop during the years to come in order to implement Government's
agenda on the national road sector.

         The development policy that the Government has presentedwithin the framework of the Strategic
Plan for Territorial Development, emphasizes the need for concentrating efforts in actions that enable a
sustained growth in the economy under a context of social equity that promotes regional integration,
productivity and competitiveness.

         The Government has identified investment in infrastructure as one of the principal aspects that
will ensure sustained economic growth and the reactivation of the productive sectors, under federal
criteria.

         In this sense, the Government plans to develop an ambitious program of transformations within
the transport sector, aimed at fostering efficiency within the sector and reducing transport and logistic
costs in the country, including, among other aspects, the improvement of national road assets in order to
attain a road network in good condition, that would assure an efficient transportation of products
elaborated inthe different areas of the country.

         Within this conceptual framework, the Government has designed a long-term program enabling
investment planning within the sector, aimed at strengthening economic sectors in expansion and
consolidating a new efficient strategy for management and administration of the national road network
under control of the National Highways Directorate (DNV).

         The strategic vision for the nationalroad sector involves two main areas:

         a).  new works involving pavement of roads that constitute main integration corridors or
              corridors of high interest for tourism; works in the road network under concession; capacity
              increasesinroad segmentsthat may need it; pavement works in frontier crossings; and


         b).  management of the existing national road assets.




                                                     76

        Inorder to attain this, the Government plans to:


        a).   continue with the concession contracts for the operation and maintenance of roads with
              highest traffic density inthe country;

        b). expand road network management through performance-based rehabilitation and
              maintenance contracts (CREMA) to most of the non concessionedpaved network; and

        c).   transfer operational functions to the Provinces, regarding maintenance of the unpaved road
              network.

        Under this scenario, DNV would play a fundamental role in the technical planning of
interventions on the road network, the execution of rehabilitation andor upgradingworks required on the
corridors under concession, work supervision and the administrationof a results-oriented strategy over the
remainingpart of the pavednetwork.

        Inorder to develop such a strategy, the Government considers important to have the support of
the World Bank in the gradual expansion of the CREMA program to assume management of the non
concessioned paved road network in a manner consistent with the necessities imposed by the rhythm of
economic growth inthe country.

        Inthis line, a programhasbeenelaborated, aimed at enablingthe Government to:


        a).   manage almost 19.200 km of the road network under the CREMA system and pursue the
              rehabilitation and maintenance of approximately 1.700 additional kilometers under the
              denominated "Modular" system, attaining a total coverage of the non concessioned paved
              road network duringthe period 2004-2010.

         b).  respond to reconstruction andrestoration needs inapproximately 30 highpriority bridges;

         c).  improve road safety conditions over the main national roads and develop an integral road
              safety strategy to be implemented over four identifiedpilot corridors; and

         d).  attain an institutional renewal of the National Highways Directorate in order to strengthen
              its planning capacities and consolidate its orientation towards a result-oriented management
              framework.

         Inthe design of said program, the Government has pondered equity and efficiency criteria in the
distribution of investments on the CREMA system at a regional stance, with almost 50% of investments
and program coverage reaching the Provinces with lowest Geographic Gross Product, while still
prioritizinghightrafficked corridors.

         The Government would implement this programin two phases, each with a duration of five years
or less, aimed at ensuring a greater degree of flexibility in the concretion of the work plan, according to
the expectations of economic growth in the country, and at gradually achieving a steady state condition of
the road network, fostering the consolidation of the institutional bases that would be needed for its
satisfactory execution.

         Duringthe first phase, the expansion plan of the CREMA system over 8.187 kmof the network
would be launched; the rehabilitation of five bridges in critical condition would be undertaken; a bridge
works program for the following years would be defined under parameters resulting from a bridge


                                                     77

management system to be adopted; the road safety pilot would be designed initiating some road safety
works; and DNV's institutional renewal program would be initiated in view of the fact that DNV will be
incharge of project execution.

         The implementation of this programimplies investments inthe order of US$837.3 million, during
the 2004-20 10period.

         Takinginto account the priority given by the Government to this road sector program as a policy
that will build a path towards sustainedeconomic growth, the Government foresees a financing strategy
that will include resources from a World Bank Loan, accounting for US$396 million, and counterpart
funds for US$441,2 million, strategy that implies a commitment of providing annual budget allocations to
the National Highways Directorate, equivalent to: US$19.5 million (2004); US$276.7 million (2005);
US$258.5 million (2006); US$86.5 million (2007); US$96 million (2008); US$94.5 million (2009); and
US$5.5 million (2010).

         This financing strategy, takes into consideration the following criteria in order to guarantee
feasibility inproject implementation:

         a).  duringthe rehabilitationphase of the roadCREMA contracts, where the highest investments
              are concentrated, and therefore the highest financing resources are required, Bank
              contributions will aim at guaranteeing that resource allocations are kept constant and that
              they are enoughto attain the development objectives definedin the program; and

         b).  to finance the required counterpart funds, this Ministry will seek to maintain the financing
              of this program as a priority within its jurisdiction through the assignment of resources
              proceeding from the National General Treasury and through the assignment of funds
              proceeding from the Transport Infrastructure Trust Fund, resulting from a surcharge on
              diesel and administered by the Unidad de Coordinacih de Fideicomisos (UCOFIN) to
              DNV,untilthe global amounts requiredarecomplete.

    Under this context, we ratify our commitment to implement the above-described program assuming
the corresponding obligations for its execution and thank you for your consideration on the foregoing.

    Best regards,

    Minister of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services
