                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to gradually consolidate an efficient road network management strategy, bringing about the necessary resources to
                         preserve the national road network in the long term. Specific Objectives are to: 1. Preserve the condition of vital road assets, through the gradual expansion of
                         performance-based contracts for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the non-concessioned primary paved network; 2. Strengthen road sector management
                         through carrying out a renewal program of DNV to revitalize its role in the sector by: (i) reinforcing its human resource base, (ii) consolidating its transformation
                         into a results-oriented organization accountable for specific outputs; (iii) introducing a systematic approach to bridge management and (iv) enhancing road
                         safety

                         Project closed on August 31, 2010 and has been granted a disbursement grace period until December 31, 2010. This ISR covers the period between June 2010 (previous mission)
                         and closing date. To date US$197 million have been disbursed (99% of Total), including US$1.4 disbursed in the designated account. Results under this project may be summarized

                         as follows: (i) 4,500 km of CREMAs financed under loan. Total length under CREMA by August 31: 12,664 km. Average roughness on target network: 3.12 IRI; (ii) Bridge
                         management system designed and being implemented. 5 bridges under execution (4 contracts) with 57% average progress by August 31; (iii) 4 road safety interventions in critical
                         black spots completed. Horizontal signing target (310 km) met through CREMA contacts; (iv) Road safety engineering designs for 2 road safety pilot corridors completed and
                         communications/educational road safety campaigns in road safety pilot corridors designed; (iv) several activities under Institutional Renewal component undertaken, addressing
                         important issues identified during project appraisal. Since last mission DNV made important progress in other activities lagging behind (Code of Ethics, the publication of a
                         performance indicator report and carrying out user satisfaction surveys) assuring that said activities are still going to be carried out under the APL2.
