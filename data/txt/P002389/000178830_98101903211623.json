While long-term planning of the educational\n            needs of the country would be possible only after the\n            national development plan is completed, there is at present\n            a clearly recognized need for extending and improving the\n            facilities and equipment available in certain schools in\n            order to upgrade the quality and content of secondary\n            education, technical education and teacher training. The\n            present system of secondary education prepares 95% of high\n            school graduates for white collar jobs while the\n            requirements are increasingly for persons with practical\n            training in trade, industry and commerce. Therefore,\n            correction of this imbalance by diversification of the\n            secondary school curriculum is one of high priority. The\n            proposed project would make a beginning towards the\n            achievement of these objectives."}, "docdt": "1969-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
