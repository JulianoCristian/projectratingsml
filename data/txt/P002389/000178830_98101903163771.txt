INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent
to US$ 3 million to Sierra Leone to assist in financing an education
project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed project was identified by a UNESCO mission in
1964. After a number of reviews it was submitted for Bank Group con-
sideration in a revised form by the Ministry of Education in May 1968.
It was preappraised in September 1968 and final appraisal took place in
July 1969.
3.        Negotiations were held in Washington in October 1969.  The
Sierra Leone negotiating team included representatives of the Ministries
of Education, Public Works and Finance and was led by Dr. M. S. Forna,
Minister of Finance.
4.        The following is a statement of Bank loans to Sierra Leone as
of November 30, 1969:

5.        The King Tom Power project, financed by Loan No. 388-SL, was
completed in 1967. The power project financed by Loan No. 553-SL is
under construction and progressing satisfactorily.
6.        The proposed credit would be the first IDA operation in Sierra
Leone. Appraisal of a highway project is scheduled in early 1970; an
agriculture development project is at an advanced stage of preparation.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.        BORROWER:                  Sierra Leone
AMOUNT:                    US$ 3 million
PURPOSE:                   To assist in financing (a) extensions
to eleven secondary schools, two
technical schools, and two trade schools,
(b) rebuilding of a primary teacher's
training college and (c) employment of
consultant architects, and other
specialist advisers.
AMORTIZATION:              In 50 years, including a 10-year
period of grace, through semi-annual
installments of ½! of 1% from May 1,
1980 through November 1, 1989 and of
l$ from May 1, 1990 to November 1,
2019.
SERVICE CHARGE:            3/h of 1% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project
in Sierra Leone" (PE-9a) is attached.
9.        Responsibility for maintenance and control of education as a
public service is exercised by the government of Sierra Leone acting
through the Ministry of Education. The Minister of Education is em-
powered to make regulations controlling the management of all schools.
He makes grants-in-aid to local authorities and voluntary agencies from
a budget voted yearly by parliament. District Councils and other local
boards are responsible to him for the provision of primary education
within their districts.  They may provide and manage schools directly or
permit voluntary agencies to do so. Secondary education and university
education are largely provided by government though there are voluntary
agencies running secondary schools assisted and controlled by government.



- 3 -
10.       There has been substantial under-provision of buildings and
equipment necessary for adequate operation of schools during recent
years. Recurrent expenditure of the central government on education
has averaged 20%-25% of its recurrent expenditure on all sectors during
the last 5 years, while the capital expediture has been extremely limited
and averaged only 6%-7% of the total on all sectors during the same period.
11.       Primary school enrollment at 32% of the eligible age group is
slightly below average for developing countries while secondary school
enrollment at 12.9% of the eligible age group is about the average for
developing countries. While expenditure per student per year in primary
and secondary education is very low, the unit cost of education in
Sierra Leone's only university is excessive and the total operating cost
of the university absorbs about one-third of government's recurrent
expenditure on education. A Commission is inquiring into higher education
with a view to cost reduction, rationalization and increasing efficiency.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that on completion of the
commission's report appropriate action will be taken in consultation with
the Association.
12.       Government with the assistance of UIP is undertaking the
preparation of a national development plan and the completion of a man-
power survey beginning in early 1970. While long-term planning of the
educational needs of the country would be possible only after the
national development plan is completed, there is at present a clearly
recognized need for extending and improving the facilities and equipment
available in certain schools in order to upgrade the quality and content
of secondary education, technical education and teacher training. The
present system of secondary education prepares 95% of high school
graduates for "white collar" jobs while the requirements are increasingly
for persons with practical training in trade, industry and commerce.
Therefore, correction of this imbalance by diversification of the
secondary school curriculum is one of high priority. The proposed pro-
ject would make a beginning towards the achievement of these objectives.
13.       The project would raise enrollments by 1,180 students in
secondary schools, 1,200 in technical and trade schools and 125 in the
teacher training college; and would provide greatly improved facilities
for all 8,lh0 students enrolled in these schools.
14.       The total project cost is estimated at Us$ 5.6 million.  Of
this the Canadian International Development Agency has agreed to make
available a grant of US$ 0.6 million for instructional equipment. UNDP
is expected to provide technical assistance estimated at a cost of
4              3US$ 0.5 million.  The Government would provide Us$ 1.5 million to meet
about 70% of the local costs of the project and would undertake to make
budgetary provision for recurrent expenditure estimated at US$ 0.37
million equivalent per year. The proposed credit of US$ 3 million
would cover the entire foreign exchange requirements of the project not
otherwise financed, estimated at US$ 2.3 million, and local cost financing



- 4 -
of US$ 0.7 million. In view of the high priority of this project, and
of the difficulties which the government would have in spite of its
substantial fiscal efforts in covering the full amount of local expendi-
tures, this small contribution to the local cost financing is considered
reasonable and justified.
15.       The project is well conceived and technically and economically
sound. Implementation is expected to take place over the four years
beginning July 1970, with some costs incurred before that date. Execution
of the project will be the responsibility of a project unit in charge of
a project director responsible to the lNinister of Finance. The Government
would undertake to employ architectural consultants acceptable to the
Association for design and supervision of the project. The Association's
guidelines for procurement will be followed. The equipment being made
available from Canada will not, however, be subject to international
competitive bidding, but would come from Canadian sources. The Association
would agree to a preferential treatment of 15% for domestic manufacturers
of furniture.
PART IV - LBEAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Sierra Leone and
the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1 (d)
of Article V of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
17.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms generally to the
pattern of other agreements for education projects. However, its effective-
ness is conditional upon, among other things, the Borrower's conclusion of
arrangements with UNDP or other sources acceptable to the Association, to
obtain a technical assistance team.
PART V - THE ECONOI4Y
18.       Sierra Leone has a dual economy with an enclave mining sector
and a large and underdeveloped agricultural sector which occupies 80
percent of the population. The average per capita income of about US$ 120
for Sierra Leone's 2.4 million people, though high by African standards,
thus rather overstates the actual living standard of most of the population.
19.       The report on "The Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Sierra Leone" (AW-3a), which was circulated to the Executive Directors on
March 10, 1969, noted continuation of improved economic performance and
successful implementation of a stabilization program under the guidance of
the International Mfonetary Fund. In particular, foreign exchange reserves
had improved remarkably and budgetary performance continued to be satis-
factory. The report concluded that Sierra Leone is creditworthy for a blend



- 5 -
of Bank Group assistance, the chief constraint on development being
limited public savings rather than foreign exchange. An economic
mission now in the field has found that management of both internal
and external finances has continued to improve.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEME
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOiMEiqATION
21.       I recommend that the Ebecutive Directors approve the proposed
credit,
