APPRA-ISAL OF AN EDUCATOMN PROJECT IN SIERRA LEONE
SUMIIAR AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Sierra Leone Governiment requested financial assistance for
an education project estimated to cost US$6.86 million. After appraisal,
the project was modified to cost about US$5.6o million.  Of this, the
Canadian International Development Agency is contributing US$0.6 millicn
for equipment and UNDP is expected to provide technical assistance cost-
ing US$o.5 million. The proposed IDA credit and the Government con-
tribution would cover the remaining US$4.5 million.  Implementation will
require 4 years.
ii.       Sierra Leone lacks a national development plan and an up-to-date
manpower survey, but a 9-man UNDP team is expected to arrive in Freetown
early in 1970 to prepare the forner and carry out the latter. It is clear,
however, that an imbalance exists between general secondary education,
where 26,400 pupils are enrolled, and technical education with only about
700 full-time students. Therefore, until the UNDP team's findings are
made known, Government's policy is to restrict enrollments in general
secondary level and direct efforts towards qualitative improvement of
the schools. Existing technical institutions are to be improved and
expanded within the constraint imposed by a shortage of technical teachers.
iii.      The project would improve existing buildings and provide
facilities for diversified curricula in practical subjects in eleven
general secondary schools. Enrollment would increase by only 4h, but
nearly o,000 pupils would have better employment prospects.  Two tech-
zical institutes and two trade schools would be expanded to raise their
annual output to about 650 craftsmen and technicians. These would re-
place only about a third of the estimated annual wastage of the existing
stock of 70,000 skilled workers in Sierra Leonets economically active
population of about 0.9 million. Their employment prospects should,
therefore, be good. The project also includes the rebuilding of Free-
town Primary Teachers' College where in-service teachers follow upgradinig
coa.rses.
iv.       Funds to provide an architect for the project unit and to support
developments in agricultural education, educational statistics, and
curriculum revision are included in the project.
In addition to the assistance referred to under  ii. above,
the Govermnent expects  to obtain an 8-man team of technical experts under
a UNDP project, to help develop the technical institutes and trade schools
and organize technical teacher training.
vi.       Schedules of accommodation and estimates of furniture and equip-
ment costs are satisfactory.  Contracts for civil works, furniture and equip-
ment procurement would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding.  Consulting architects would be retained to undertake the design
and supervision of construction work involved in the proposed project.



ii
vii.      The estimated annual current expenditure created by the
project would amount to about US$0.37 million which is about 3.5%
of the Government's current expenditure on education. The capital
contribution and current costs are within the capacity of the
Government.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of
US$3.0 million. This would provide for the foreign exchange component,
estimated at US$2.3 million,on the assumption that contracts for furn-
iture to the value of about US$0.20 million will be awarded to local
suppliers, and a local currency component of US$0.7 million.

APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN SIERRA EOSNE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A UNESCO planning mission visited Sierra Leone in 1964.  On the
basis of its findings, a second UNESCO mission helped the Government prepare
an education project for Bank/IDA financing in 1965. This project was
appraised by a Bank mission in 1965/66. The Government was requested to
review its secondary school expansion program and to prepare a revised
education project for presentation to the Bank/IDA. Government action wTas
delayed by a financial crisis in 1966 and a military coup in 1967, but a
revised project iwas presented to the Bank in May, 1968. This was examined
by a Bank reconnaissance mission in September, 1968.  A further Bank mission
in March/April, 1969 assisted the Government in the detailed preparation of
this project. Appraisal took place in July, 1969 by a Bank mission consist-
ing of Messrs. R. F. McMahon (technical education) and W. D. Donnelly (gene-
ral education).
1.02      The project, as amended after appraisal, comprises the construction
and equipment of:
- replacement for Freetown Primary Teachers' College,
- extensions at 11 general secondary schools, and
- extensions at 2 technical institutes and 2 trade schools.
Also included are:
- technical assistance to support developments in agricultural
education, educational statistics and curriculum revision, and
to provide an architect for the project unit,
- consultant architectural services to carry out the construction
program,
- technical assistance for technical education and vocational
training, and associated teacher training (UNDP), and
- instructional equipment (to be supplied under a grant by the
Canadian International Development Agency).
Building and commissioning of the schools and colleges would take 4 years,
during 1970-714.



I.03      Sierra Leone has no national development nor educational plan,
nor has a comprehensive manpower survey ever been undertaken. The Government
has, therefore, requested UNDP to supply a team to do this work and the team
is expected to start to arrive early 1970. However, interviews with larger
employers, labor exchange officials, and the Ministry of Agriculture indicate
a shortage of practically trained people for industry, commerce and agricul-
ture, for which foreigners are still being recruited. About 95% of those
receiving secondary education follow courses preparing them for white-collar
jobs. Their number is in excess of available positions which creates unemploy-
ment problems. Hence a diversified curriculum to include more practical
subjects is necessary.
1.04      Pending completion of the planning indicated above and quantifica-
tion of needs, strategy for educational development during the next two years
should have as its principal objectives:
(a)  improvements to general secondary schools with, as far as
practicable, stabilization at the existing enrollment figure;
(b) development of technical education as quickly as feasible
within the constraint of technical teacher supply;
(c) improvement of teacher training.
1.05      The project would introduce this diversification into existing
schools by providing facilities required for the teaching of agricultural,
commercial, scientific and industrial subjects. It wTould also support a
limited expansion of primary teacher, technical and vocational training.
Enrollments in the eleven project secondary schools would increase from
4,777 to 5,960 but total enrollments in Sierra Leone's 72 secondary schools
would increase by only 4%.  Freetown Primary Teachers' College is used mainly
for upgrading courses for in-service teachers and its capacity would be
increased from 125 to 250 students. Extensions at the technical institutes
and trade schools would increase enrollments from 7h0 to 1,925 full-time
students and thus help to alleviate a shortage of skilled craftsmen and
technicians.
II.  SOCIAL AID ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
2.01      Sierra Leone is one of the smaller West African countries and is
situated between Guinea and Liberia. It has a population of about 2.5 mil-
lion and an area of 28,000 square miles. Population density, which averages
90 per square mile, is low except in the western area, which includes Freetown,
the capital. About 10% of the population live in towns with a population of
13,000 or more. There are a variety of tribes of whom the Mende in the south
and the Temne in the northwest are the largest. The Creoles constitute a
substantial proportion of the population of Freetown and have traditionally



- 3 -
been important in education, administration and the judiciary. About 37%
of Sierra Leone's population are aged under 15. Population growth is esti-
mated to be 15%-2.0%, somewhat lower than the W{est African average.
2.02      Sierra Leone is well endowed in diamonds, iron ore, bauxite and
rutile.  Diamond production is equivalent to 10%-15% of world production by
value and the mining sector as a whole provides about 90% of recorded exports
and about 20% of GDP. The bulk of government revenue derives from mining.
Manufacturing, which accounts for about 6% of GDP, is mostly very small-scale
and only about 4,000 people are employed in establishments with six or more
persons.
2.03      Agriculture engages about 80% of the active population and accounts
for about one-third of GDP. The land, even though not of exceptional qulality,
is uniformly usable but cultivation is largely of a rudimentary and subsistence
nature. Production for the market is the exception and hardly any mechanical
equipment is used by individual farmers. Export crops (mainly palm kernels,
cocoa, coffee, cassava and ginger) made up only some 8% of total exports in
1967.
2.04      After a three-year period (1963-65) of rapid expansion but of
considerable inflation and accumulation of a heavy foreign debt burden, a
Stabilization Plan was implemented wvhich is restoring the basis for sound
economic growth. Per capita income is now about $120 but because of the
divided nature of the economy (an enclave mining sector on the one hand and
a large and underdevreloped agricultural sector on the other), this figure
considerably exaggerates the actual standard of living of most of the popu-
lation.  An improvement can be assured by concentrating on the modernization
of agriculture and by pursuing a realistic strategy for the development of
industry and related sectors. The Government is aware that shortages of
manpower - particularly at the middle-level - are inhibiting development and
that secondary school curricula must be more practically biased to better
equip school leavers for the increasingly diverse demands of the labor market.
The proposed project would provide Sierra Leone with more technically-oriented
manpower, to improve the productivity and impact of investment.
III.  EDUCATION A!D TRAINING SYSTEM
The Administration of Education
3.01      The organization of the Ministry of Education (Annex 1) is satis-
factory, but the post of Principal Education Officer (Technical) has long
been vacant; the planning section lacks adequate staff; there is no official
in charge of agricultural education; and no secondary schools inspectoratee
During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Government would
appoint staff qualified to cover technical and agricultural training, provide
the planning section with a qualified statistician and experienced educational



- 4 -
planner, and form a secondary schools inspectorate.
General Education - Primary and Secondary
3.02      The structure of education (Annex 2) is satisfactory.  Primary
school enrollment (Annexes 3 and 4) at 32% of the eligible age group is
slightly below the average for developing countries and absorbs 32.6% of
public recurrent education expenditure.  The average class size is uneco-
nomic at 31:1 and during negotiations assurances were given by the
Government that it would be raised to 35:1 by 1974.
3.03      The secondary school enrollment of 26,400 (Annex 5) or 12.9% of
the eligible age group is above average for developing countries and absorbs
2h.7% of public recurrent education expenditure.  Of these enrollments, 5%
are in unassisted schools. The pupil/teacher ratio is 25:1 and more econo-
mical working could be obtained by increasing class sizes. The Government
has therefore agreed to a minimum intake of 40 pupils per class in Form 1.
The average enrollment in the upper sixth forms is 17 students per class,
which leads to under-utilization of expensive facilities and high quality
staff.  Agreement has been reached with the Govelrnment that intakes in the
lower sixth forms will be raised to 30 by consolidating sixth form teaching
in fewer schools. It was also agreed that curricula be modernized to
accord with employment opportunities in Sierra Leone's expanding commercial,
industrial, and agricultural sectors.
Technical Institutes/Trade Schools
3.04      Courses in industrial and commercial subjects are given in two
technical institutes and two trade schools, with enroILments in 1967/68
of 573 full-time day, 108 part-time day and 372 evening students (Annex 6).
The general standard of buildings is good but additional equipment is needed
and, due to inadequate direction and trained teacher shortages, the adminis-
tration, organization, teaching, and maintenance are poor. The quality and
quantity of the output are low and, to satisfy existing employment opportu-
nities, both need urgent improvement. The proposed project and the techriical
team requested by the Government would help to meet these deficlencies.
Teacher Training
3.05      In 1969, teachers employed in primary and secondary schools Twere
as follows:
Sierra Leoneans                        Grand
Schools   Trained  Untrained  Sub-Total   Foreigners   Total
Primary    2316       2267       4583           -        4583
Secondary   323        253        576           531      1107



-5-
3.06      The qualification for entry to primary teacher training institu-
tions has been progressively raised to completion of Form 5. This has
resulted in a temporary dearth of trainees and an annual output of only
250 as against a capacity of 360 which is expected soon to be achieved
through the rapidly increasing Form 5 output. Provided the average primary
class size is raised to 35:1 from its present 31:1 (para. 3.02), the poten-
tial primary teacher output is adequate for future expansion and replacement
of untrained teachers.
3.07      Secondary school teachers are trained in the University of Sierra
Leone at Fourah Bay and Njala University Colleges and at the Ministry of
Education's Milton Margai Teachers'College. Present annual output from
these three colleges is only 140 which is two-thirds of capacity. Howiever,
as secondary school intakes have more than doubled in the past five years,
the colleges should soon be full. Meanwhile, if secondary school enrollments
are maintained at about 28,000 until the UNDP team's plan and manpower
survey are completed, and Form 1 class intakes are kept at a minimum of 40,
no extra teachers will be required. The full output of 210 per annum will
then go toward replacing the 250 untrained local teachers, the 530 foreign
teachers and an estimated wastage of 200 teachers over the next five years,
without the need to provide extra facilities.
3.08      Teachers of agriculture and home economics are trained at Njala
University College and the output will be adequate for the proposed project.
Sierra Leone has no facilities for training teachers of technical/industrial
subjects.
Higher Education
3.09      Sierra Leone has one university with two constituent colleges
at Fourah Bay and Njala. Present student enrollments at both colleges total
734 (Annex 7).  There are 104 teaching staff at Fourah Bay and 60 at Njala
giving an overall student/teacher ratio for the university of 4.5:1, which
is considered low.
Educational Radio and Television
3.10      There are two hours of radio programs weekly for primary schools
and 3-1/2 hours for secondary; subjects covered are Health Science, English
and French. A British-supported education T.V. pilot project of four hours
science teaching weekly for Forms 2 lasted 16 months and ended in May, 1968.
Its aim was to investigate whether science could be taught as well by T.V.
as by traditional classroom methods. The Government wished to continue the
program but lacked staff and funds. Because reception in the Freetown area
is poor and the remaining population sparsely distributed, educational T.V.
is not at present considered worthwhile.

IV. EDUCATIONAL FINANCE
4.01      Central Government recurrent expenditures on education (com-
prising all public recurrent expenditures on education except very small
expenditures by District Councils) account for about 24% of total Central
Government expenditures. This proportion is satisfactory although in
absolute terms the level of expenditure has not been sufficient to meet
the demands of rising enrollments. The details are as follows:

4.02      Capital expenditures by Central Government have in recent
years been extremely limited and well over half the total resources
available for investment have come from abroad. Education has received
a very small share of total resources - less than 5% in recent years -
although there was probably some improvement in 1968/69. in addition to
public external assistance for education (included in line 1 below) some
private external assistance has also been given to the University.

16,400 to 26,400. The corresponding desirable capital investment of about
$150 per pupil place in primary schools and $500 in secondary schools
should have totalled some $9.0 million, or Le.7.5 million. In fact,
capital investments for all education, including higher, amounted to only
Le.1.5 million during the three years.  These figures point to substantial
under-provision of buildings and equipment necessary for efficient
operation of schools.



-7-
4.04      Total recurrent expenditures by level and per student enrolled
were as follows in 1967/68 (Annex 8):
Total            %       Expenditures per
Expenditures      of Total  Student Enrolled
(Leones million)  Expenditure (Leones) (Ratio)
Primary education         2.47            32.7       18.8     1.0
Secondary education       1.86            24.7       84.3     4.5
University                2.57            34.1    3,142.0   167.0
Other training            o.64             8.5       n.a.       -
VWhilst the costs per student per year in primary and secondary education
were too low, the unit cost of education in Sierra Leone's only university
was excessive. Also, the total operating costs of the university absorb
about one-third of the Government's recurrent expenditure on education, a
proportion higher than either primary or secondazy education. The Govern-
ment recognizes the high cost of the University in relation to graduate
output and has appointed a commission to enquire into higher education
with a view to rationalization and increased efficiency. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that, on completion of the com-
mission's report, appropriate action will be taken in consultation with
the Association.
4.05      The absence of national and educational planning prevents the
formalation of an accurate assessment of future educational expenditures.
In 1964/65, the latest year for which a firm comparison can be made, total
public expenditures on education (Le.7.1 million) were 3.1% of GDP
(Le.226.2 million). In 1967/68, education expenditures, at Le.7.9 million,
were 11.3% higher than three years previously, an increase almost certainly
lower than that of current price GDP over the same period. The ratio at
the present time is, therefore, probably 2.8% or 2.9%. Assuming that the
ratio will not rise beyond its present level and if real output will
expand by an annual average of 5% in the 1970's, resources available for
education (starting from the 1967/68 base of Le.7.9 million, expressed in
constant prices) may increase to about Le.ll.0 million in 1975 and
Le.14.0 million in 1980.
V. EDUCATION AND TRAINING NEEDS
5.01      According to the 1963 Population Census, out of an economically
active population of 908,147 (Annex 9) 11,066 were engaged in professional,
technical or related fields. This appears to overstate the number of
people holding a full professional qualification because the Education
Profile (Annex 10), made at the time of the Census, shows only 2,100
persons as having attended university for at least one year. Further



-8-
support for this lower figure is provided by a Yanpower Survey, con-
ducted in 1964, which estimated employment of university graduates
or equivalent at 1,580 (Annex 11).  Some 39,800 had received one or
more years of post-primary education or training in 1963, while
employment at this education level and above is recorded as 16,000
in 1964. More recent information on high-level employment is not
available and, in view of the inconsistency of the above data and
the time interval since it was prepared, it does not provide an
adequate basis for projecting manpower requirements.
5.02      In view of the lack of up-to-date information, the govern-
ment of Sierra Leone has recently requested UNDP to provide a team
of experts to work with the Ministry of Development on the production
of a development plan and an associated manpower survey. During
negotiations the government gave assurances that it will, (i) comp-
lete a manpower survey with projections of future manpower needs,
within 2 years of signing the Credit agreement, and (ii) produce
an education plan within one year of the manpower survey's completion.
5.03      However, there are clear indications that expansion of
academic secondary education is not warranted at this time.  At
least 25,000 of the 26,400 now enrolled in secondary schools (total
enrollment has increased by 10,000 in three years) are still receiving
an academic education and there is considerable unemployment amiong
this class of school leavers, while vacancies for those with practical
skills go unfilled. The major employers in Freetown complain of
serious shortages of school leavers with industrial, commercial or
craft training; many posts requiring such background are currently
occupied by non-nationals. Total day enrollment in technical
education in 1969 is about 750, which results Ln an output too
small to satisfy industries' needs for craftsmen and technicians.
5.04      The small numbers of Sierra Leoneans who have taken non-
academic subjects at secondary level have for the most part received
a poor training. Technical schools must therefore be improved so that
practical subjects can be taught effectively, thus increasing the
value of the student in the labor market. For the same reason, the
general secondary schools also need to improve their facilities for
teaching practical subjects and the secondary schools in the proposed
project would therefore provide modern practical rooms, new equipment
and other improved facilities needed for a more up-to-date diversified
curriculum. Paising the quality of teachers, both through technical
assistance (for training of technical teachers) and through improvement
of existing teacher training facilities, is no less important.
5.05      Similar reasoning applies to agricultural training in secondary
schools. Agriculture engages about 80% of the active population but
cultivation is largely of a rudimentary and subsistence nabure. Training
in basic agricultural techniques is urgently required to bring simple
technology to peasant cultivators and to provide staff to support
plantation agriculture as it develops.

VI. THE PROJECT
6.01      The proposed project, which is designed to meet the needs described
in the preceding section, would comprise the following:
(a)  One Primary Teacher Training College.  Rebuilding the
Freetown Primary Teachers' College, providing improved
facilities for 250 students, of which 125 would be
increased enrollments.
(b) Eleven Secondary Schools (Annex 12). Construction of
extensions for practical subjects, providing improved
facilities for 5,960 pupils, of which 1,180 would be
increased enrollments, and 1,190 would be boarding places.
(c) Four Technical/Trade Schools (Annex 13).  Construction of
extensions to two technical institutes and two trade
schools, providing improved facilities for 1,930 students
of which 1,200 would be increased enrollments and 175
boarding places.
(d) Services of Consultant Architects. To set standards in
school buildings, furniture and costs, and oversee imple-
mentation of the building program.
(e) Technical Assistance. To provide an architect for the
project unit and to support developments in agricultural
education, educational statistics and curriculum revision.
(f) UNDP Technical Assistance. To comprise an 8-man team of
specialists in technical education and vocational training
and associated teacher training.
(g) Instructional Equipment. To be supplied under a grant by the
Canadian International Development Agency.
Freetown Primary Teacherst College
6.02      There are 2,270 untrained primary school teachers in Sierra Leone,
of whom about 500 are within commuting distance of Freetown Primary Teachers'
College, which is used in the evenings for training such teachers and up-
grading others. It is on a site adjacent to Bishop Johnson Secondary School
which is included in the proposed project for extension and improvement.
The college buildings are dilapidated and lack equipment. By sharing the
new laboratories, workshops and library to be built for the school, only
minimal extra facilities would be required for the college to increase its
enrollment from 125 to 250, thereby doubling its output, and providing
urgently needed improved training facilities. Reposting of untrained teachers
from the provinces to Freetown would enable the college to be used continuously
in the foreseeable future.



- 10 -
Eleven Secondary Schools
6.03      From 1965 to 1968 enrollments in Sierra Leone's 72 general second-
ary schools increased from about 16,400 to 26,400.  Because of inadequate
capital provision for this expansion (para. 4.03), equipment is deficient,
facilities for science and practical subjects are lacking, and some buildings
in the longer-established schools are old and structurally unsuitable for
conversion. This has resulted in a purely academic education and low-quality
output of pupils for whom unemployment is increasing. Better facilities
for training in practical subjects are therefore needed to prepare school
leavers for existing opportunities in the technical, commercial and agricul-
tural fields.
6.04      Seven of the schools, four of which are in the Freetown area,
were chosen because they are progressive and interested in curriculum change,
but they urgently require improved facilities. The other four were chosen
because of their keen interest in agriculture. Bearing in mind that 24 of
the country's 72 secondary schools are in the Freetown area, a reasonable
national distribution has been achieved (see Map).
6.05      The eleven schools now have 1,150 boarders, mainly in sub-standard
accommodation, about three-quarters of which will be improved, resulting in
facilities for 1,190 pupils, all of whom live beyond commuting distance from
school.
Technical Institutes and Trade Schools
6.o6      Enrollments in technical institutes and trade schools total about
1,100 students, of whom 740 were full-time day, in 1968/69 as compared with
26,000 pupils in general secondary schools. This substantial imbalance bet-
ween technical and general education requires that action should be taken
to increase the output from technical institutes and trade schools. This
view is reinforced by the existing shortage of skilled craftsmen and tech-
nicians and by the fact that many posts requiring technical skills are
filled by foreigners.
6.07      The standard of administration, organization and training in the
two technical institutes and two trade schools is low, principally because
of an acute shortage of industrially experienced teachers. Buildings are
good but some extensions, additional equipment, improved maintenance of
equipment, and improved direction and teaching are required.
6.08      Pending clarification of manpower needs (para. 5.02), developments
in technical trainiDg are being limited to the four existing institutes
and schools (Annex 13) as follows:
(a)  Freeto-wm and Kenema Technical Institutes.  Increased enroll-
menrts in menechanical, electrical, civil engineering and
building technician courses at Freetown Technical Institute



- 11 -
from about 160 to 280 and in commercial studies from
about 110 to 260; at Kenema Technical Institute, artisan
course enrollments to expand from about 100 to 430.
(b) Kissy Trade School. An expansion from about 300 to 700
students which includes new courses in refrigeration and
air-conditioning.
(c) Magburaka Trade School. An expansion from 60 to 240 students
including new courses in painting and decorating, and in
plumbing.
Total day enrollments would increase from about 750 to about 1,950 of whom 175
would be boarders living beyond commuting distance. Additional classrooms,
workshops and equipment would be required.
Technical Assistance
6.09      Because local staff lack experience, technical assistance would be
required as part of the IDA Credit as follows:
(a)  An Agricultural Education Specialist.  To coordinate the
agricultural training programs at Njala University College,
the secondary schools, and primary teacher training
colleges, a qualified and experienced agricultural
educationist would be attached to the Yinistry of Education
for 3 years (para. 3.01). -
(b) A Statistician. To improve the system for compiling and
reporting educational statistics at district and regional
levels, and their processing at headquarters, an experienced
statistician would be attached to the Ministry of Education
for 3 years (para. 3.01).
(c)  Four Curriculum Specialists.  To modernize secondary school
curricula to accord with employment opportunities in Sierra
Leone's expanding commercial, industrial and agricultural
sectors (para. 3.03), four specialists, one each for mathe-
matics, science, social studies and English, would be attached
to the Ministry of Education for a total of 3 man-years.
(d)  A Project Architect.  To coordinate, supervise and approve
the architectural work and contract awards for construction
work, an experienced architect would be appointed to the
project unit for 4 years (para. 7.01).
6.10      From UNDP Funds.  on completion of the proposed expansion of the
technical institutes and trade schools, about 70 technical and 30 general
subject teachers would be needed. No difficulty is anticipated in obtaining
the general teachers (para. 3.07) but special steps to upgrade existing and
train T additional technical teachers are needed. The Government expects to
obtain from UNDP an 8-man team, led by a chief of project, to cover in-plant
and apprentice training, electrical trades, automotive trades, refrigeration



- 12 -
and air-conditioning, machine shop work, commercial teacher training and
instructor training. Each expert would be required for 3 years, except the
team leader who would be required for 5 years. The team would assist the
general development of the four technical institutes and trade schools and
the establishment of a technical teacher training program in association
with the Freetown Technical Institute and Milton Margai Teachers' College.
6.11      During negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that the
services of a technical team as indicated above would be obtained, either
as a UNDP project or through other means.
6.12      The Canadian International Development Agency is to provide instruc-
tional equipment for all the schools in the project in a value of about
Can.$650,00Cor US$6Co,COO. Freightcosts for delivery of the equipment to
Sierra Leone will be met by the IDA share of the project.
Cost Estimates and Financial Plan
6.13      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$5.6 million.  The
Canadian International Development Agency grant is for Can.$0.65 (or about
US$0.6) million and UNDP is expected to provide technical assistance
(para. 6.10) for technical education and vocational training at an estimated
cost of US$0.5 million. A breakdown of the remaining part of the project
(US$4.5 million in total cost), to which a proposed IDA credit of US$3.0
million would apply, is shown below and at Annex 14:

6.15      Of the US$4.5 million project cost listed above, the foreign
exchange component would be 51%, or US$2.3 million, and the local currency
component of US$2.2 million. The proposed credit would finance the entire
foreign exchange cost and US$0.7 million of local costs, with the Govern-
ment providing US$1.5 million to meet the balance of the local cost.
The foreign exchange component was estimated assuming that:
(i)    all construction would be by local contractors;
(ii)    all furniture would be manufactured locally, partly with
imported materials.
6.16      The increase in annual current expenditure created by the project
is estimated at US$0.37 million or about 3ga of the Ministry of Education's
present total expenditure. During implementation of the proposed project,
the maximum contribution by the Government toward the capital cost in any
one year would be about US$0.70 million which is about 7% of the present
IMinistry of Education total expenditure. Consequently, the additional
capital and current costs generated by the project should be within the
Government's capacity.
Accommodation and Equipment
6.17      Accommodation schedules for each school and college have been
revised to acceptable standards and the estimated costs are reasonable.
Preliminary equipment and furniture lists, adequate for cost estimating,
have been found satisfactory; final equiprent lists will be submitted to
the Association for approval after the experts referred to in para. 6.10
have been appointed and assisted in their compilations.
1/ The US$0.06 million is for the freight cost of equipment donated by Canada.



VII. IDPLEMENTATION OF THE PPOJECT
Administration
7.01      To implement the proposed project, a project unit, \'esponsible
to the Minister of Finance, would be established. It would be headed by
a full-time project director and include an experienced and competent
architect, the leader of the technical assistance team, an official
experienced in accounting and auditing procedures, and it would work
in close liaison with the Ministries of Education and Works. During
negotiations, agreement was reached on the staffing of the project
unit.  Appointments to the posts of project director and architect
would be subject to approval by the Association. The project un'it
would have the necessary supporting staff to carry out preparation
of (i) educational specifications for the teaching accommodation;
(ii) architectural briefs for the consultants; and (iii) final
furniture and equipment lists.
7.02      The Government gave assurances during negotiations that the
Ministry of Education would employ architectural consultants,
experienced in school building and school furniture, and acceptabie
to the Association, for the design and supervision of the project-
7.03      International competitive bidding would be used for the
supply of all equipment and furniture and for the construction of
the schools. Items would be grouped to the maximum extent practicable
to form sizable bid packages and to permit bulk procurement.
Procedures for prequalification of contractors and selection of con-
sultants would be acceptable to the Association. The equipment being
made available from Canada as a grant will not, however, be subject
to international competitive bidding but would come from Canadian
sources. Domestic manufacturers of furniture would have a preference
of 15%.
7.o4      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that:
-    adequate budgetary funds would be provided for satisfactory
maintenance of schools and supply of educational materials, and
-    an official would be assigned to its Ministry of Education to
be responsible for regular inspection of school buildings and
for working in close liaison with its Ministry of Works as
to the execution of maintenance work.
Building Construction and Maintenance
7.05      The standards of building construction and design vary considerably
throughout the country. Secondary schools also show a variety of arch-
itectural quality, ranging from dilapidated simple shelters of steel
sheet and timber roof with masonry or mud walls, to more sophisticated



reinforced concrete structures.  In the main, they are modest buildings
with little evidence of waste and generally in keeping with the stringent
economic requirements. Architectural and engineering practice follow
acceptable procedures.
7.06      Tn recent years, due to some stagnation in the economy, the
building industry has not been buoyant and, although an increase in
building activities in the future is expected, it is not likely to be
on so large a scale as to affect project implementation. Building
costs are expected to rise at the rate of Itg yearly during the next
four years and an allowance for this has been included in the cost
estimates for the proposed project.
7.07      A large proportion of building materials is imported and
some of the materials locally manufactured require a high component
of imported raw materials, resulting in a foreign exchange component
of about 15% for civil works. School furniture manufactured locally
has a foreign exchange component of between 10% and 40% depending
on the amount of steel used.
7.08      Secondary school construction and maintenance are administered
by Government through the Ministry of Public Wiorks. There are two
architectural firms and 25 building contracting firms active in Sierra Leone.
The Ministry of Public Works keeps up-to-date lists of approved cont-
ractors from which their tender lists are selected. Tendering is
normally public and advertised in the local press. Bids are considered
by the Central Tender Board; the lowest bid is usually accepted. This
procedure, modified to conform to the Association's guidelines on
procurement, would be acceptable to the Association.
7.09      Suitable land is available for expansion of all schools in the
proposed project and no land costs are included in the cost estimates.
7.10      The building and commissioning of the schools would be phased
for completion in four years (Annex 15). Annual estimated disbursements
during the four years would be:
Year              First   Second   Third   Fourth    Total
Amount (US$000's)   200    1,400   1,220       180    3,000
Credit and Disbursement
7.11      The proposed IDA credit of US$3.0 million would amount to 66-2/3%
of the total estimated project cost of US$4-5 million; it would cover the
foreign exchange component of US$2.3 million and a local currency component
of US$0.7 million. The project would be implemented in four years from
July, 1970, but some expenditures for technical experts will be incurred
early in 1970.
7.12      The credit would be disbursed on the basis of 66-2/3% of the
expenditures of the project (for equipment freight, 100%). This ratio would
be adjusted if necessary, so that withdrawals would be spread evenly during
the period of execution; undisbursed amounts would be available for cancel-
lation; should expenditures exceed the estimated cost of US$4-50 million
the excess would be met by the Sierra Leone Government.

VIII.  CONCLUSIONS
8.01      During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on
the following principal points:
(a)    the appointment of qualified officials in the Minist.ry of
Education responsible for technical and agricultural
subjects, statistics, planning and inspection (para. 3.01);
(b)    the introduction of revised secondary school curricula (para. 3.03);
(c)    completion of a manpower survey and an educational develop-
ment plan (para. 5.02);
(d)    appointment of architectural consultants for design and
supervision of the project (para. 7.02).
The conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit would include:
provision of a technical assistance team for the technical
institutes and trade schools and associated teacher
training (para. 6.11); and
=     establishment of a project unit, responsible to the Yinister
of Finance, with a director and architect acceptable to
the Association (para. 7.01).
8.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an
IDA credit of US$3.0 million.
