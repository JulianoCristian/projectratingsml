development outcome was high,\n            the Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: this project is a stark reminder\n            that housing finance is embedded in the broader financial\n            markets, economy, and political situation of a country. The\n            social upheavals since the global financial crises of 2008\n            battered the financial system. With rising inflation and\n            falling investor confidence, financial depth (M2/GDP ratio)\n            fell sharply, as did capital markets activities. Housing\n            finance which seemed poised in 2005 for a major spurt in\n            growth and innovations was put on hold. However, a recovery\n            may have begun in 2015. In designing the project, it is\n            important to have a good understanding of the various formal\n            and informal market players that affect and would be\n            affected by the intervention. In Egypt, formal financial\n            institutions account for a small share of the market.\n            Self-finance plays a large role and so do informal lenders\n            extending personal loans to home buyers.\n            Builders/developers, especially those operating on a large\n            scale, may possess significant competitive advantages in\n            providing housing loans but they also raise concerns. The\n            case of Egypt provides an illustration. First, developers\n            are well positioned to assess the credit risk of\n            buyers/borrowers. The marketing and construction of housing\n            units allow developers to get to know and often work closely\n            with homebuyers. Second, developers typically keep the title\n            of a property for the first five years of the installment\n            plan and thereafter transfer the title but retain the\n            property as collateral."}, "docdt": "2015-06-26T13:30:05Z"}
