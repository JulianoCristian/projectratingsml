                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is for primary lenders in the financial market (viz., both banks and non-bank lenders) to provide longer-term, market-based
                         mortgage loan financing for residential housing. Such financing is scarce at present, in part because primary lenders do not have reliable access to sources of
                         term finance on favorable terms that could help them to mitigate the associated business and lending risks. The Egyptian Company for Mortgage Refinancing
                         (ECMR) will provide such a source.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The World Bank loan, amounting to LE 214.2 million is now fully disbursed and closed. Although the closing date is July 2011, the last payment was made for LE 12.5 million on 21
                         January 2011. Although there was a slight lag in disbursement during the early stages of the project, the operation got disbursed ahead of schedule. The full disbursement of the
                         World Bank loan means that the Egyptian Mortgage Refinance Company (EMRC) is now fully reliant on its own fundraising capabilities to continue operations. To date, most of
                         project outcome and output indicators have been achieved. The team has started drafting the Implementation Completion Report (ICR).
