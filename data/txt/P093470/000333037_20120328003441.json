for the Mortgage Finance Project\n            for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was low; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned include: the project revealed that\n            deepening financial markets, including secondary markets for\n            loans and increasing institutional investment opportunities,\n            depends not only on creating frameworks for new financing\n            mechanisms, but also on conditions in the underlying market\n            for primary lending and general economic activity. The\n            success of the project was also owed to good financial\n            fundamentals, as well as, an extreme care in designing the\n            liquidity facility and its lending mechanisms to avoid both\n            uncertainties in financial contracts and distortions in the\n            sector, a level, competitive playing field among primary\n            lenders, and conducive property registration and titling\n            processes. The main lesson learnt is that there are critical\n            factors that contribute to the success of the operations,\n            mainly: prior analytical work; strong policy dialogue with\n            the authorities; prompt response to client's needs and\n            the changing environment; provision of technical assistance;\n            conducive legal and regulatory framework; innovative and\n            creative approaches; consultations with the different\n            stakeholders; close coordination with International Finance\n            Corporation (IFC); effective cooperation with development\n            partners; and overall flexibility in implementation of the\n            reforms. All this was crucial to the successful\n            implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
