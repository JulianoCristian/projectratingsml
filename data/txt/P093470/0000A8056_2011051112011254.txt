                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is for primary lenders in the financial market (viz., both banks and non-bank lenders) to provide longer-term, market-based
                         mortgage loan financing for residential housing. Such financing is scarce at present, in part because primary lenders do not have reliable access to sources of
                         term finance on favorable terms that could help them to mitigate the associated business and lending risks. The Egyptian Company for Mortgage Refinancing
                         (ECMR) will provide such a source.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The World Bank loan, amounting to LE 214.2 million is now fully disbursed. The last payment was made for LE 12.5 million on 21 January 2011. Although there was a slight lag in
                         disbursement during the early stages of the project, the operation got disbursed ahead of schedule. The full disbursement of the World Bank loan means that the Egyptian Mortgage
                         Refinance Company (EMRC) is now fully reliant on its own fundraising capabilities to continue operations. To date, most of project outcome and output indicators have been
                         achieved.
