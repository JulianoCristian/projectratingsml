Competitiveness Structural Adjustment Loan Project aims to\n            assist the Government of Peru implement the decentralization\n            of public functions and resources, in tandem with measures\n            to help ensure continued sound public finances, and economic\n            growth. The program proposes the first of three loans, using\n            a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan instrument to\n            support short- and medium-term reforms on state\n            decentralization, and economic competitiveness. A\n            single-tranche programmatic loan would be followed by two\n            further single-tranche loans. The first proposed loan has\n            three specific objectives 1) protect fiscal sustainability\n            during Peru's transition to a more decentralized state;\n            2) assist in strengthening management, and fiscal capacity\n            at sub-national levels for their progressive assumption of\n            service responsibilities; and, 3) support the creation of a\n            better regulatory, and investment environment for upgrading\n            Peru's competitiveness. The subsequent loans will\n            depend on the progress of this initial reform program. An\n            underlying objective of the proposed Loan is to enrich, and\n            extend the government's overall program of accelerated\n            reforms over the past two years. However, risks have been\n            identified in political, economic, financial and technical\n            areas. To mitigate these risks, dialogues with the\n            opposition, and civil society in general, export\n            diversification and competitiveness, the continued\n            strengthening of bank supervision, and a debt management\n            strategy in particular, will outweigh such risks."}, "docdt": "2003-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
