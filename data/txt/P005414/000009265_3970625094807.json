implementation of the Government's economic adjustment\n            program.  The program comprises actions extending export\n            promotion and reform of protection policies, rationalizing\n            the public investment program and improving investment\n            planning and budgeting, and introducing financial sector\n            reform.  The principal aims of the program are to improve\n            the efficiency of resource allocation and utilization in the\n            economy, achieve structural changes in the incentives\n            system, and realize the potential for export development and\n            promotion of public and private savings. The program is\n            described in the Government's Statement of Development\n            Policy to the Bank.  The foreign exchange provided by the\n            loan will be used to finance imports.  The main benefits of\n            the program will be improved allocation and efficiency of\n            investment, increased national production, growth of\n            savings, and an improvement in the balance of payments\n            through increased exports and a reduced current account deficit."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
