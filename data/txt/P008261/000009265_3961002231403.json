utilization and production in key productive sectors during\n            the next 12 to 18 months. The project will provide critical\n            goods and materials to enable vital sectors of the economy\n            to continue to operate. It will finance the priority import\n            requirements of the agriculture and power sectors. The\n            agriculture component provides urgent inputs for crop and\n            poultry/egg production in 1992/93; spare parts for\n            agricultural mechanization and irrigation. The power\n            component will provide materials and equipment for: repairs\n            of generating plants; rehabilitation of the transmission\n            system; improvements in the dispatching/monitoring system;\n            and rehabilitation of the distribution network in Tirana,\n            Shkoder, and Durres. The transport component includes spare\n            parts, batteries and tires for trucks; spare parts for the\n            port at Durres, and telecommunications systems for the\n            railways. Finally, under the general administration\n            component, the project will finance imports of office\n            equipment for the public entities involved in project implementation."}, "docdt": "1992-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
