     Population and Health Project are to assist the Government:\n            (i) to achieve the objectives of the National Population\n            Policy (1983) and (ii) to develop a more cost-effective\n            health services delivery system in line with its Health\n            Policy (1984). To this end, the project consists of three\n            parts. Part A seeks to strnegthen population and family\n            planning programs through technical assistance and program\n            support for: population information in the Population Unit\n            of the Planning Institute of Jamaica; family planning\n            service delivery in the Ministry of Health (MOH); and\n            information education and communication and social marketing\n            of contraceptives (CSM) at the National Family Board. Part B\n            consists of support for Ministry of Health efforts to\n            improve the delivery of an integrated package of services in\n            outpatient facilities, strengthen the referral system, and\n            support the adoption of a health financing scheme. Finally,\n            Part C supports innovative sub-projects designed to improve\n            health and family planning programs."}, "docdt": "1987-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
