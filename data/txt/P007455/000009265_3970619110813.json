      Jamaica. The main objectives of the project were to: (i)\n            achieve the objectives of the National Population Policy\n            (1983), namely fertility reduction and the integration of\n            population concerns in the public and private sector\n            development projects; and (ii) develop a more cost effective\n            health services delivery system in line with its Health\n            Policy (1984). Bank performance was deficient. Borrower\n            performance was deficient. Six key lessons emerge from the\n            project and they are as follows: (i) project design must\n            reflect the institutional capacity of the implementing\n            agency; (ii) to ensure readiness for implementation,\n            institutional capacity should be built during preparation;\n            (iii)  the practice of placing the responsibility of civil\n            works in ministries whose comparative advantage is in other\n            areas should be seriously considered; (iv) the complexity of\n            government procurement procedures is evident in this project\n            and other Bank-financed interventions and requires\n            system-wide rather than project-by-project solutions; (v)\n            changes in task management during the course of the project,\n            particularly one experiencing difficulties, should be\n            minimized; (vi) finally, specific project outcome and impact\n            measures in addition to input and output indicators should\n            be established during design, evaluated as part of the\n            project and consistently monitored to determine project\n            achievement and impact. To conclude, during the second to\n            last year of project implementation, the Bank conducted a\n            comprehensive review of the health sector which assessed its\n            current status and detailed future options for reforming\n            health care provision and financing."}, "docdt": "1997-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
