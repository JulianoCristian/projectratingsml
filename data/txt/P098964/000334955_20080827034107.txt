F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The overall program development objectives (PDO) of the PRSCs series were twofold: (i)
to improve the effectiveness and transparency of the national budget process and
expenditure management (including at the decentralized levels) as the main instrument for
achieving national development goals and reducing poverty; and (ii) help to support
achievement of the PRSP outcomes for improved living conditions of the poor within the
PRSP time horizon.

        1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

        1.1       Context at Appraisal:

        Senegal had registered a sustained and relatively strong economic performance in the
        decade preceding the design of this series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs)
        in 2004. From 1995 to 2000, real GDP growth averaged 4.3 percent per year, enabling a
        sustained increase in average per capita growth. In the 2001-2003 period immediately
        preceding this series of operations, GDP growth remained strong, averaging 4 percent per
        year; the Government maintained a prudent external borrowing policy and tight control
        over domestic financing; and the annual inflation rate averaged 1.5 percent. The country
        was also largely unaffected by regional instability and enjoyed a stable political climate.
        A politically significant milestone was reached in 2000, when the country experienced its
        first transition to another political party since independence, and in 2001 a new
        Constitution both reduced the length of the presidential term (from seven to five years)
        and limited the number of terms to two.

        These years of sustained and relatively rapid economic growth had a positive impact on
        poverty and reduced the level of absolute poverty from 61.4 percent of households in
        1994 to 48.5 percent of households in 2001. Most of this decrease was registered in
        Dakar and other urban areas, however, and public perceptions of poverty showed a
        disconnect with this poverty decline.1 Moreover, the absolute number of poor people
        increased in that period, since the decrease in the rate of poverty was lower than the rate
        of population growth. The likelihood of being poor was highly correlated with the lack
        of access to formal education, chronic health problems, living in a remote region, and
        unemployment or low-quality employment. The persistence of poverty, combined with
        serious deficiencies in terms of both human and infrastructure development, made
        Senegal's attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 uncertain.

        It was in this context that the Government of Senegal designed its poverty reduction
        program as initially laid out in its first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) for
        2003-05. The PRS-I was prepared through extensive consultations with a broad range of
        stakeholders, including representatives from the parliament, central and local
        Governments, donors, the private sector, think tanks, trade unions, and civil society
        organizations. The PRS-I was a well-articulated set of strategies and priorities for
        addressing the country's development challenges by focusing on four pillars: (i) wealth
        creation through economic reforms and private sector development; (ii) capacity building
        and development of basic social services; (iii) improving living conditions of vulnerable
        groups; and (iv) implementation of the strategy and monitoring its outcomes.

        PRSP-I was followed by a second generation program, PRSP-II, covering the years 2006-
        10.    The second PRS was also prepared with extensive inputs from donors, local
        governments, the private sector, and representatives of civil society, and its vision was
        well aligned with the MDGs' agenda. Like the first PRSP, PRSP-II was also articulated

1Two-thirds of households identified themselves as poor and one-third of poor and non-poor alike felt that poverty
had actually substantially increased in their community over the previous five years.


                                                              1

         around four pillars: (i) wealth creation and pro-poor growth; (ii) improving access to
         basic social services; (iii) protecting vulnerable groups against catastrophic and
         exogenous shocks; and (iv) greater transparency combined with participatory processes.
         The first three pillars were consistent with those included in the first PRSP, while the last
         one was added owing to the need to strengthen the effectiveness of public spending
         (through efficient budgetary procedures and controls), as well as to promote private
         sector development (through less distortions and better access to justice).

         It was in this background and perspective that the PRSC I, II and III were designed in
         support of both PRS-I and PRS-II. As set forth in the Bank's 2003 Country Assistance
         Strategy (CAS) for Senegal (Report No. 25498-SN), the PRSCs were seen as critical
         instruments to support the PRSP agenda, notably the pillars of budgetary reforms, wealth
         creation, and the delivery of basic social services to the poorest segments of the
         population over the medium term. These credits were a series of three one-tranche,
         development policy operations implemented over the 2004-07 period.2 The reforms
         supported by the operation would help Senegal implement its poverty reduction program
         in three ways by helping to: (i) to maintain economic growth and improve living
         conditions for the Senegalese; (ii) enhance ownership and functionality for the
         Government in policy planning and budget management, and thereby help the country
         progress towards achieving the MDGs; and (iii) promote coordination and collaboration
         within the Government and among donors, which would lead to a comprehensive
         approach to the delivery of basic social services.

         The Bank, the Government, and Senegal's others stakeholders, including development
         partners, identified the PRSCs as the preferred lending instrument to:

         · align with the Government's strategies and institutions for poverty reduction;
         · provide predictable support through and to the Government's own functional
               administration and budget systems to help consolidate and smooth resource
               mobilization;
         · maintain continuity in the dialogue between the Government and the Bank on critical
                 policy issues;
         · promote ownership and a better functioning of Government institutions; and
         · help focus internal and external resources and attention on meeting key PRSP
                   objectives.

         In addition, the move to supporting poverty reduction through the national budget process
         was consistent with the Government's decision to better align its budget allocation with
         developmental priorities. It was also believed that a multi-sectoral approach would
         promote coordination and collaboration across Government agencies in areas that
         suffered from fragmented approaches, including strengthening the decentralization
         process and improving the Government's delivery of services to the poor and vulnerable.


2PRSC I and PRSC II were each a SDR 20.5 million and SDR 20.8 million (US$30 million equivalent) credit and
PRSC III was a SDR 13.5 million (US$20 million equivalent) credit. PRSC III was originally envisioned at the time
of its design as a US$30 million credit; however, Senegal's subsequent qualification for the MDRI significantly
reduced the fiscal gap, as well as the IDA-14 resources available to Senegal in FY07.


                                                              2

Finally, a multi-sectoral approach was selected as a way to address cross-cutting
constraints and issues that affected service delivery, notably in health and education, but
which could not be addressed effectively at the sector level (e.g., issues dealing with
recruitment, remuneration and deployment of personnel).

1.2      Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved):

The overall program development objectives (PDO) of the PRSCs series were
twofold: (i) to improve the effectiveness and transparency of the national budget
process and expenditure management (including at the decentralized levels) as the
main instrument for achieving national development goals and reducing poverty;
and (ii) help to support achievement of the PRSP outcomes for improved living
conditions of the poor within the PRSP time horizon.

While the PDOs as stated in the first Board document (PRSC I) were clear and well
defined, the PRSCs did not set out quantitative high level performance indicators and
targets to see whether these overall objectives were met or not. To assess progress
achieved by the program, a list of indicators (Cf. Annex 8) built on those set out by
Government in the PRSPs for each area of focus. The initial list counted 45 indicators at
different levels in the results chain. They principally focused on processes and outputs,
rather than outcomes with the exception of the health sector where outcome indicators
were specific, measurable, and quantifiable, with baselines and targets. The indicators
used in the other areas were viewed as leading to, or correlated with outcome indicators,
including those defined for the MDGs.

1.3      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification:

The above PDOs remained unchanged over the PRSCs period.

The number of indicators decreased from 45 in PRSC I to 42 in PRSC II and 36 in PRSC
III. The list of indicators was revised mostly because of data availability issues. Of the 45
initial indicators, 25 remained unchanged, 5 were modified to make them more precise
and/or to replace them by proxy indicators, 15 were dropped mostly for lack of
appropriate data and six new indicators were integrated.

1.4      Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The PRSCs provided support to the Government in the following five priority areas:

         (i)     Strengthening budgetary and financial procedures (including those linked
                 to remuneration of the public sector), and procurement processes and
                 systems;

         (ii)    Decentralization process, by securing financial transfers to local
                 Governments, as well as disseminating and implementing the PRS agenda
                 at the local level;



                                             3

       (iii)    Health services, with a focus on improving information, financial and
                human resources management in the sector, as well as increasing access to
                basic health services that have been identified as the most important
                factors for determining the performance of this sector;

       (iv)     Wealth creation through the support of ongoing reforms in the labor
                market and improvements in the judiciary system; and

       (v)      Improving living conditions of the most vulnerable groups.

These policy areas were selected in view of their contribution to the PRSP-I and PRSP-II
objectives and were complementary with other assistance programs carried out by the
Bank and other donors, notably at the sectoral level. As seen in Table 1 below, the
PRSCs directly supported the PRSP's three pillars.

PRSC I focused on three cross-cutting and institutional areas: fiduciary reforms, by
strengthening budgetary and financial procedures (including those linked to remuneration
of the public sector) and procurement procedures; enhancing financial decentralization
toward local Governments; and, improving health service delivery, including both by
improving financial and human resources management in the sector as well as improving
access to basic health services.

These three areas constituted the backbone of the Government's poverty reduction
strategy and were chosen for their ability to contribute to poverty reduction.
Strengthening the Government's fiscal and budgetary procedures would contribute to
poverty reduction because weaknesses in recruiting and remuneration policies prevented
the public administration from delivering core basic services, especially outside of Dakar.
Similarly, if budgets were misallocated, needed services would not be adequately funded,
and if funds were misappropriated, the quality and quantity of services offered would
suffer. Strengthening the decentralization process ­ including improving the capacity of
local Governments and the gradual transfer of responsibilities to local communities,
particularly in the health and education sectors ­ was viewed as important to targeting the
vulnerable and poor in rural regions where poverty was greater, and improving the
delivery of public services, another component of poverty.         Finally, improving the
delivery of health services would enhance both the access and utilization of better quality
health services and strengthen the health sector's financing and management.

PRSC II and PRSC III further strengthened the reform agenda in the fiduciary,
decentralization, and health areas and added two focus areas on the promotion of wealth
creation and improving the living conditions of vulnerable groups (two of the pillars of
the PRS-I and PRS-II). These two areas were added as part of a deliberately designed
sequencing approach in which the Bank's support over the course of the PRSCs would be
gradually broadened to include these areas, assuming that the Government made adequate
and prior reform progress under PRSC I. By adding these areas, the PRSC series' agenda
sought to strengthen basic elements of the investment climate and reinforce the social
protection strategy and poverty alleviation for the poorest segments of the population.

                                       Improve the quality and supply of health care, including the

vulnerable groups     Vulnerable       economic opportunities and prevent, mitigate, or cope with the
                      Groups           risks to their wellbeing.



   1.5       Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

   As noted above, PRSC II and PRSC III expanded the initial policy coverage to include
   the areas of promoting wealth creation and the improving the living conditions of
   vulnerable groups.        These areas had been identified in PRSC I as areas of focus that
   would be gradually introduced into the PRSC program. The rationale for the gradual and
   sequential approach to focusing on wealth creation, included: (i) the need for greater
   Government specificity as to the types of policy reforms to be pursued; (ii) the political
   sensitivity of this type of reform and the potential for delay by vested interests; and (iii)
   the risk that the rapid inclusion of this focus might make more difficult the task of
   monitoring the PRSC progress in other priority areas. Consequently, PRSC I only
   focused on working with the Government on defining and agreeing on action plans,
   leaving an expansion of coverage to PRSCs II and III, should sufficient progress occur
   (as turned out to be the case). PRSC II and III accordingly focused on improving the
   justice system and strengthening the functioning of the labor market ­ two areas that were
   relatively underfunded by donors and which were expected to have significant
   externalities in the promotion of wealth creation and equity in Senegal.




                                                      5

The rationale for the gradual and sequential approach to improving the living conditions
of vulnerable groups under PRSCs II and III was driven by the fact that the Government
was still in the process of making operational its strategy toward vulnerable groups.
Consequently, PRSC I primarily supported the development of strategies and instruments
to improve the coherence and effectiveness of the actions proposed for vulnerable groups
in the PRSP, whereas PRSC II and PRSC III focused on increasing access to social
protection measures, improving the targeting of actions to improve the lives of vulnerable
groups, and facilitating the access of these groups to basic services.

The addition of these two policy areas does not represent a revision in policy areas.
Rather, their addition was opportunistic in that it took advantage of the progress achieved
under PRSC I to add additional areas that were perceived as crucial to successful PRS
implementation.

1.6 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements
and schedule, and funding allocations):

There were originally 21 triggers identified under PRSC I for PRSC II. These were
reduced to 12 prior actions for PRSC II in order to (i) better conform to Bank guidelines
recommending a smaller number of actions; and (ii) make the triggers more precise in
order to minimize the difficulties of interpretation at the time of negotiations. Four out of
the nine triggers that were dropped, however, were still completed. Similarly, the 15
triggers identified in PRSC II for PRSC III were reduced to a more manageable 10 prior
actions for PRSC III, although a number of the dropped actions were implemented
nonetheless.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix):

Beyond the significant progress achieved (see below) in the five areas of focus, PRSC I,
II and III promoted (i) alignment of Bank support with the Government's strategies and
institutions for poverty reduction; (ii) ownership and a better functioning of client's
institutions, particularly collaboration between the Ministry of Economy and Finance and
the line Ministries; (iii) maintaining policy dialogue between the Government and the
Bank in areas identified earlier as key challenges for economic development; and (iv)
providing a framework for coordination with development partners, particularly with the
IMF through its Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF), and other donors providing
budget support.

The overall PRSC series contributed to the Government's effort to achieve results in
PRSP implementation through the support it provided in the five main areas
detailed above. Senegal made important progress in achieving outcomes in budgetary
reforms (except procurement reforms and external and internal control of the budget),
decentralization, and health service delivery, but program performance in the areas of
wealth creation and protection of vulnerable groups was weaker. These achievements are




                                              6

        described below and shown in Table 2 (Anticipated Reform Measures and Outcomes)3
        and Annex 8 (Key Indicators).

        Prior to Board presentation of PRSC I, the Government completed all planned prior
        actions in budgetary reform, decentralization, and the health sector. As the first credit in
        a series of three operations, PRSC I focused on laying out the groundwork for developing
        strategies for key areas of reform, and supported the institutional and legislative changes
        needed for subsequent reforms. Follow-up actions were implemented in the context of
        PRSC II and PRSC III. For both PRSC II and PRSC III, all planned prior actions were
        also completed before presentation of these credits to the Board.

        Program performance in each of the five policy areas supported by PRSCs I-III is
        described below (also see table 2 for summary of anticipated reform measures, actual
        outputs and actual outcomes).

                  Budgetary Reforms

        By the end of the PRSCs I-III, it was expected that Senegal would have achieved the
        following budgetary and civil service reforms:

                  · A comprehensive three-year MTEF, indicating budgetary allocations through
                      PRS programs and objectives;
                  · Budget execution closer to the approved appropriation;
                  · Increased decentralization of execution in line ministries;
                  · Increased transparency and efficiency in public procurement;
                  · Improved external audits and independent controls of budgets;
                  · Implementation of a recruiting strategy; and
                  · Better control of the wage bill and a new set of financial incentives for civil
                      servants.

        PRSC I, II and III supported progress on budget preparation, execution and
        external control, as well as on human resources management. On budget preparation,
        the credits enabled the Government to progressively introduce a three-year Medium Term
        Expenditure Framework (MTEF) into the budget preparation process, indicating
        budgetary allocations through PRS programs and objectives. Four line ministries (Health,
        Education, Justice and Environment) initiated MTEFs under PRSC I. Under PRSC II, the
        budget was for the first time prepared on a programmatic basis for these four key
        Ministries. At the same time, the Finance Law was prepared and adopted on the basis of
        a uniform nomenclature for current and investment expenditures4. PRSC III continued
        the reforms initiated under PRSC I and II and extended the use of the MTEF on budget
        preparation to three other ministries, including Agriculture. The number of ministries


3The reform measures contained in Table 2 conform to those discussed above (in Section 1.4 Original Policy Areas
Supported by the Program), as set forth in the Program Document for PRSC I. Likewise, the key indicators
contained in Table 3 are also those identified in the original Program Document.
4Before that, the Finance Law was prepared and presented to the Parliament in two separated documents (current
expenditures and investment).


                                                                7

       under the MTEF reached 12 (out of 36) and their share covered 45 percent of the total
       budget in the 2008 Financial Law.

       With regard to budget execution, significant progress was achieved on computerization
       and     decentralization       of     budget      execution       procedures      (déconcentration       de
       l'ordonnancement). Progress on internal control and procurement, however, was weaker
       than expected. The share of procurement contracts approved by CNCA without
       competition and percentage of exceptional expenses in total public expenses remained
       high within the period. Under PRSC I, the Government initiated the decentralization of
       financial execution procedures (déconcentration de l'ordonnancement) from the Ministry
       of Economy and Finance to four line Ministries (Education, Health, Justice, and
       Environment), as well as the implementation of the integration of the public expenses
       software (SIGFIP) in the selected four ministries, and adopted the rule for the "Contrôle
       des Operations Financières" through a Decree signed in 2004. the Government also
       began the audit of the wage bill in the public sector. PRSC II and PRSC III supported the
       deepening of these reforms. Connection to SIGFIP was extended to targeted ministries,
       including Agriculture and Equipment, and to the regions.                       During the PRSC I-III
       implementation period, the budgetary execution rate was also raised significantly, closer
       to the approved appropriation in the line ministries.5

       With regard to external control of the budget, progress was also achieved, although the
       results were less than expected. The PRSC program strengthened the Government's
       external controls on State accounts. Under PRSC I, the authorities submitted to the Cour
       des Comptes the budget execution report for the years 1999 to 2001, under PRSC II the
       one for the year 2002 was submitted, the one for 2003 was submitted in 2007 and the one
       for 2004 was partially submitted in 2008. Under PRSC III, for the first time, the Cour
       des comptes issued its avis de conformité on the 1997, 1998 and 1999 State Accounts
       (and begun the revision of state accounts up to 2003). Parliament adopted the lois de
       règlement. However, the duration between the budget approval and the review of the
       audited budget execution examination by Parliament remained long (7 years against 2
       years according to guidelines)

       In the areas of human resources management, the PRSC assisted the authorities in
       implementing a new civil service recruitment and remuneration strategy, including a pilot
       project for the decentralization of health and education sector staff in the regions and
       based on performance-based allowances to staff.

       In the area of procurement, progress was slower. The PRSC program supported the
       Government's efforts to strengthen the legal framework for the competitive award of
       public contracts.       Under PRSC I, a study devoted to the reform of the legal and
       institutional procurement system was initiated. This study was finalized under PRSC II,
       and was fully adopted under PRSC III, including the adoption of the Code des
       Obligations de l'Administration, the new procurement code which limits the conditions
       under which bids can be approved, and the legal instruments needed for its
       implementation. However, the implementation of the code did not take place in the


5For example, the budget execution rate for the health sector increased from 73 percent in 2003 to 94 percent in
2006.


                                                              8

PRSCs' implementation period, and persistent problems in the enforcement of
procurement rules remained a major concern of Senegal's development partners. There
was actually an upward trend in the issuance of noncompetitive procurement contracts
over the 2004-06 period. The share of contracts awarded by CNCA on a sole basis
increased from 17 percent in 2004 to 24 percent in 2005 and 29 percent in 2006 and
2007. This happened mostly because of weaknesses of the legal framework, as it did not
differentiate clearly the conditions under which a contract can be awarded without
competition from those under which a competition is mandatory. To correct these
weaknesses, the PRSCs supported the preparation of a new legal procurement framework
which was adopted by Parliament in June 2006. The new procurement code reduced the
cases in which a contract can be awarded without competition and involved the private
sector and the civil society as members of the ex post tripartite (Government, Private
sector and Civil society) controlling agency.


       Decentralization

By the end of the PRSCs I-III, it was expected that the following would be achieved in
the area of decentralization:

       · Develop a clear and efficient mechanism for financial transfers from the
            central to local Governments, and within local Governments, including the
            decentralization of the execution of the consolidated investment budget;
       · Institute regional committees to help implement and monitor the PRS through
            regional action plans (Plans d'opérations régionaux -- POR);
       · Improve coordination and harmonization of development activities in the
            regions; and,
       · Use resources and financial transfers more efficiently through improved
            budgetary control procedures, including audits, and procurement.

The PRSCs encouraged the Government to increase and accelerate transfers of financial
resources (FDD and FECL) to local Governments. In 2004 (PRSC I), these transfers were
made in May and in 2005 (PRSC II) they were in April. In 2002, the transfers were
affected in September, nine months into the fiscal year.

Moreover, these transfers grew significantly under the PRSCs, reaching 14.1 billion
FCFA in 2004, 18.7 billion FCFA in 2005, and 19.4 billion FCFA in 2006, compared to
only 12 billion FCFA in 2002. Under PRSC III, a new law was adopted by Parliament
increase the predictability of financial transfers by linking them explicitly to Value
Added Tax (VAT) revenues. Decentralization of the consolidated investment program
(BCI) was initiated for the education and health sectors under PRSC III. Under PRSC I,
the Government supported the preparation of the regional investment plan which was
harmonized with the sectoral investment plan.

PRSC I also encouraged the implementation of the institutional framework supporting the
PRSP at the decentralized level by creating regional committees in all 11 regions which




                                             9

contributed to the second PRSP progress report under PRSC II, and to the establishment
and design of the PRSP II.

However, delays in the transfer of resources to local government that were reduced from
9 months in 2002 to 4 month in 2005, increased to 7 months in 2007. Also, no significant
outcomes were achieved under the PRSCs period in the area of improving coordination
and harmonization of development activities in the regions. While local authorities
prepared the Plan d'Opération Régional (POR), it was not integrated into the Plan
d'Opération Sectoriel (POS), or in the annual budget. With donor support, including the
World Bank, trough the PNDL, the government is preparing the Plan Local de
Développement (PLD). This plan is expected to lead to more meaningful outcomes, in
term of harmonization.

       Health

By the end of PRSCs I-III, it was anticipated that Senegal would have progressed towards
the achievement of PRSP and MDG health targets through increased utilization of a
package of basic health services, including the following:

       · Better immunization coverage, infectious disease control, and nutrition
           activities, notably of children and women;
       · Increased utilization of reproductive health services;
       · Increased primary health care (PHC) services utilization rate;
       · Reallocation of expenditures to pro-poor and cost-effective interventions and
           underserved areas; and
       · Increased number of health districts fully functioning in a decentralized
           manner.

To this end, PRSC I began to support the finalization of the second phase of the National
Health Strategy (PNDS) and the implementation of the new institutional framework
within the Ministry of Health. As a result, a decree was signed organizing the Ministry of
Health in a way that streamlines the internal operation of health agencies. At the same
time, the Government revised the norms for the allocation of health personnel and
launched the design of a medium-term recruitment plan. In addition, the Interagency
Coordinating Committee (ICC) adopted the three-year action plan for immunization and
technical evaluation of the Immunization Financial Sustainability Plan (FSP). Under
PRSC I, the operation of the human resource management directorate and the health
information management system were initiated, both at the central and regional levels.
Furthermore, public expenditure for health as a share of GDP increased from 1.7 percent
in 2003 to 1.9 percent in 2007 and as a share of total expenditure (excluding debt) from
7.7 percent in 2003 to 10.3 percent in 2007.

These efforts were reinforced under PRSC II with the adoption of a MTEF in accordance
with the need to improve coverage in priority health services in underserved areas and
improve health sector performance.         In addition, the Integrated Management of
Childhood Illness (IMCI) program was implemented in at least 50 percent of health posts.
At the same time, the authorities put in place a mechanism for monitoring health sector


                                             10

performance, including the health sector management information system (MIS) in
charge of collecting data, as well as measuring the quality of health services throughout
the country. The reports on health statistics for 2004, 2005, and 2006 were also prepared
on the basis of the data collected by the MIS. Under PRSC III, the decentralization
process was supported by a stronger allocation of responsibilities and resources at the
regional and district level. A pilot project was also designed to favor staffing in regions
where the needs are the most severe.

These measures had a notable impact on health service delivery. The execution rate of the
investment budget allocated to the Ministry of Health reached 94 percent in 2006 (up
from 87 percent in 2004, which itself was an improvement over the 73 percent achieved
in 2003). The DTP3 coverage rate rose to 80 percent in 2006 and 94 percent in 2007, up
from 59 percent in 2003; the share of skilled assisted service delivery increased from 39
percent in 2001 to 59 percent in 2006; and the CPN1 rose from 52 percent in 2002 to 84
percent in 2006. The primary health consultation rate increased from 46 percent in 2003
to 54 percent in 2006 and 64 percent in 2007.

It should be noted that the selection of triggers and prior actions in the health sector was
efficient and results oriented. PRSC I supported the elaboration of the sector policy and
fostered the adoption of a new institutional structure which included a quantitative
monitoring Unit. PRSC II focused on strengthening the health information management
system and started using measurable performance indicators as prior action. Finally,
under PRSC III the use of quantitative indicators as conditionality was strengthened.

        Wealth Creation

In this area, the PRSC program expected to achieve the following:

        · Consolidate consensus around labor reforms;
        · Increase funding and coverage of labor training, notably through public-
            private partnerships, leading to higher skilled workers;
        · Provide more flexibility to labor markets in strategic areas;
        · Speed up processing of cases in the judicial system; and
        · Increase access to, and the quality of, the judicial system by strengthening the
            capacity of the Ministry of Justice and tribunals through the recruitment of
            additional staff.

On the labor side, the authorities introduced a series of actions aimed to promote
vocational training during the PRSC implementation period, improve the legal
framework, and provide more flexibility to labor markets in strategic areas. PRSC I also
supported the creation of a new agency in charge of vocational training (FONDEF) that
aimed to reinforce vocational training by promoting coordination and cooperation with
the private sector and by securing additional funding. FONDEF started to operate in early
2005 by funding more than 30 training programs in 10 enterprises. This program was
strengthened under PRSC III when the number of beneficiary enterprises reached 82.
Also, a new Labor Code was adopted in 2007 and under PRSC III, the Government
adopted twenty-seven complementary legal texts for the application of the Labor Code


                                             11

with the objective of making labor markets more flexible in specific activities. Concrete
reform progress was limited, however, in part by institutional instability at the Ministry
of Labor (discussed below in Section 2.2).

In regard to access to justice, the Government established a committee responsible for
implementing the new sectoral strategy, developed the new communication strategy, and
adopted an action plan to provide legal assistance to the most vulnerable groups. This
effort began under PRSC II and continued its implementation under PRSC III. The
National Commission to Combat Non-Transparency, Corruption, and Misappropriation
of Public Funds (Commission Nationale de Lutte contre la Non-transparence, la
Corruption et la Concussion, CNLCC) received adequate facilities and budget allocations
under PRSC II and its Secretary General was appointed. Under PRSC III, for the first
time, the Commission began to investigate the cases referred to it. However, the CNLCC
lacks legal competences, resources and regular funding in order to be effective. It is
accountable to the President and cannot take cases to court. Also, no reports from the
agency are made public, despite the fact that the law states it.

Finally, the budget of the Ministry of Justice was doubled between 2004 and 2006,
making it possible to increase the number of judges and clerks by about one-third,
thereby increasing access to the justice system. While the justice sector benefited from
good and sound analytical work and support from other Bank projects and other donors at
the beginning of the series, the labor market sub-component did not benefit from
significant technical and financial support from other donors, nor was there good
coordination between the donors in these policy areas. The recent Country Economic
Memorandum, prepared by the Bank in close consultation with the Government and a
broad range of stakeholders (notably trade unions and employer associations) and donors,
focused on labor market issues and helped to close this gap.

       Protection of Vulnerable Groups

The PRSC program expected to achieve the following:

       · Increase access to risk management instruments and social protection
           measures;
       · Improve the identification, targeting, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
           of social protection programs to improve the lives of vulnerable groups, both
           in rural and urban areas;
       · Facilitate access by vulnerable groups to basic services (in complement with
           broad sectoral strategies);
       · Ensure equitable access to an adequate legal framework for vulnerable groups;
           and
       · Reinforce efficient mechanisms to provide resources to vulnerable groups.

An Inter-Ministerial Committee was created in 2005 to pilot and coordinate the
preparation of the NSSP. The strategy focused on the biggest gaps in the support
provided to vulnerable groups by: (i) developing a coherent and integrated methodology
for the targeting and monitoring and evaluation of social protection programs; (ii)


                                            12

      defining demand-side programs and policies to ensure access and utilization of basic
      social services by the poorest; (iii) implementing mechanisms to plan and evaluate the
      transfer of Government resources to vulnerable groups and to rationalize public
      expenditure in these areas; (iv) designing and applying risk management measures; and
      (v) defining an adequate legal framework to protect vulnerable groups.

      Under PRSC III, concrete actions were also achieved with the implementation of the
      program of community-based rehabilitation for the disabled in four regions and a project
      to fight the worst form of child labor. The number of disabled persons receiving health
      devices through the community-based rehabilitation program reached 1,050 in 2006, and
      the percentage of working children between ages 6­14 declined from 37 percent in 2000
      to 22 percent in 2005. New legal texts were adopted as part of the effort to eliminate the
      worst forms of child labor, and a financial program supporting street children in Dakar
      was established.

      The PRSC provided an important opportunity for several ministries involved in social
      protection to have higher visibility in national discussions on poverty reduction as
      witnessed by the fact that the issue of social protection and vulnerable groups became one
      of the main axes in the PRSP II. However, in addition to the institutional instability and
      weak capacity available in the sector, this component did not benefit from significant
      technical and financial support from other donors.

        above, the 21 triggers indentified under PRSC I for PRSC II were reduced to 12 prior
        actions, and some were modified for greater clarification (see Annex 7). Similarly, the
        15 triggers identified in PRSC II for PRSC III were reduced to a more manageable 10
        prior actions, although a number of the dropped actions were implemented nonetheless.6

2.2      Major Factors Affecting Implementation

A number of factors contributed to the largely successful implementation and outcome of
the PRSC program. These include sound macroeconomic management during 2004-05;
strong Government ownership and progress in internalizing the PRSC instrument; the
soundness of the analytical work underlying these operations; and close coordination
among donors in most of the PRSC supported areas. A number of factors also negatively
affected implementation, including weakened macroeconomic performance in 2006; an
unwieldy balance between a high number of objectives and a limited number of prior



                                                     21

      actions; a lack of institutional stability; weak capacity; and an unfavorable political
      calendar. Each of these factors is discussed below.

      Positive Macroeconomic Performance for 2004-05. On average, macroeconomic
      performance was satisfactory during the PRSC series implementation period. Under
      PRSC I and PRSC II (2004-2005), real GDP grew on average by about 5.8 percent
      annually, despite rising petroleum prices and the adverse consequences of a locust
      invasion. Inflation remained subdued, with the annual average CPI rising by about 0.5
      percent in 2004 and 1.7 percent in 2005, reflecting both the low weight of energy in the
      CPI basket, and an abundant food supply, which limited the rise in some food prices.
      The current account deficit (including grants) was 6.1 and 7.8 percent in 2004 and 2005,
      respectively. The overall fiscal deficit (payment order basis, including grants) was limited
      to around 3 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005, and the fiscal stance remained consistent
      with the authorities' goal of preserving debt sustainability. Public sector external debt
      declined by about 12 percentage points and fell to 42.4 percent of GDP at end-2005. In
      2006, however, macroeconomic performance weakened, as discussed below.

      Government Ownership. The Government had ownership of the program supported by
      the PRSCs because these operations were fully aligned with the first and second PRSPs.
      In addition, the preparation of both PRSPs had been led by the Government on a largely
      participatory basis. This process included not only Government but also members of
      Parliament, local Governments and communities, the private sector, civil society, and
      donors. In addition, the prior actions adopted for each operation were based on reforms
      included in the PRSP and/or national sectoral strategies. However, progress in
      internalizing the PRSC instrument was slow (notably under PRSC I) in line ministries
      which were used to receiving funding through investment projects. The Ministry of
      Economy and Finance played a crucial role in explaining this new budgetary approach to
      fund development priorities, as well as in mobilizing needed institutional anchors on
      cross-cutting issues that involved several Ministries and agencies, such as
      decentralization and the protection of vulnerable groups. Government ownership was
      less strong, however, in areas such as justice, labor, procurement, and protection of
      vulnerable groups (see Table 4 below), and less progress was made in these areas.

     Sound Analytical Work. The PRSC program benefited from high quality analytical and
     fiduciary work undertaken by the Bank in support of the Government's PRSP (see Table
     5). In particular, considerable analytical effort was invested in assessing the effectiveness
     of public spending in Senegal, including a Country Financial Accountability Assessment
     (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR), Public Expenditure
     Reviews (PER), an IMF Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), and
     a study on the decentralization process in the country. These analyses identified the main
     shortcomings of the fiduciary system, as well as helped the authorities to prepare two
     action plans for reform in the short- and medium-term. PER updates in FY05 and FY06
     on the effectiveness of public investment spending identified the major improvements
     needed to enhance the management of such spending, including the rationalization of
     projects funded by external resources. The Government's two action plans for fiduciary
     reform were based on the CFAA and the CPAR, and all the donors operating in Senegal
     endorsed those plans, indicating their centrality to the reform process.

     In addition, a poverty assessment study was completed in FY03, showing the evolution of
     poverty trends and providing a better understanding of poverty determinants. In early
     2004, a report on poverty was produced by the Bank and the Ministry of Economy and
     Finance, using the data from the 2001/2002 household survey, and complementary
     studies were completed in 2006 to better understand the factors influencing poverty levels
     and variations in Senegal. Sectoral work included health (health services coverage and
     utilization, health workforce analysis, a PER including a benefit incidence analysis,
     private sector delivery assessment) and education. A Rural Social Protection Strategy
     was completed in FY05 to support policy dialogue in this area and to identify ways to
     improve the effectiveness of public spending. However, the components of the PRSC
     program of labor7 and vulnerable groups were less supported by analytical work.
     Moreover, these components did not benefit from significant technical and financial
     support from other donors.




7A CEM focus on labor market and employment issues was completed in FY08.

Donor Coordination: The Senegal PRSC series was consistent with the trend in other
Bank PRSCs (e.g., Cape Verde, Ghana, Tanzania) in which there was increased focus on
improving donor coordination and focusing operations in respective areas of expertise of
various donors. The design and scope of PRSC I was the outcome of a highly intensive
participatory process between the Bank and the PRSP Secretariat, as well as Senegal's
development partners, particularly those who have chosen to deliver assistance through
budgetary support (EU, France, Netherlands, and Canada). This process was consolidated
in a workshop attended by more than 60 representatives from Ministries, governmental
agencies, civil society, donors, and the private sector. Although during the PRSC I to III
the donors did not coordinate their budgetary support through a formal mechanism such
as a budgetary support group and they did not develop a single matrix for the use of all
donors, policy matrices were exchanged on a regular basis.

All donors also agreed that the PRSCs should support the four pillars identified in the
PRSP, and donor coordination was focused on four issues: (i) implementation of the
CFAA/CPAR action plans, primarily through the coordination of a working group; (ii)
selectivity, in which donors selected a few priority projects for each of their planned



                                              24

         budgetary operation so as to avoid duplication;8 (iii) the selection of monitoring
         indicators to ensure that those used to evaluate the PRSP implementation would, as much
         as possible, avoid duplication and demands on Government human and financial
         resources; and (iv) and the use of five working groups (discussed further below in Section
         2.3 Monitoring & Evaluation) which relied upon the participation of Government
         officials, private sector representatives, and other donors. Finally, all donors supported
         the development of a new sector strategy in the health area. This coordination further
         intensified during the preparation of PRSC III, and continues to advance in the form of a
         joint memorandum of understanding (Arrangement Cadre relatif aux Appuis Budgétaires
         ­ ACAB) developed in early 2008 between the donors that are delivering budget support
         in Senegal.

         A number of factors negatively affected implementation. These were:

         Weakened Macroeconomic Performance in 2006. Economic performance was weaker
         in 2006 under PRSC III, when the annual GDP growth rate was 2.3 percent. Growth
         slowed as a result of an increase in international oil prices, a decline in agricultural
         output, and financial difficulties at public enterprises in the energy and chemical sectors -
         - in particular, an interruption of the operations of the largest exporting firm (Industries
         Chimiques du Sénégal -- ICS).9 Real GDP growth recovered in 2007 at 4.8 percent. The
         current account deficit (including grants) reached 9.4 percent of GDP in 2006, owing to
         oil price increases and the ICS' difficulties, and year-on-year inflation grew to 6.2
         percent by end 2007 (compared to less than 2 percent on average in 2003-2005 period),
         resulting from high energy prices and surging food prices. This increased further in 2007
         to 10.4 percent of GDP. The fiscal deficit (payment order basis, including grants) rose
         from 3 percent of GDP in 2005 to 5.8 percent in 2006, mainly as a result of a surge in
         energy subsidies (equal to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2006) to the electricity company
         (SENELEC) and the oil refinery (SAR) to offset below-market prices for electricity and
         butane gas.10 Increases in capital spending and the wage bill contributed to the increased
         fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit declined to 3.5 percent in 2007 as a result of increased
         revenues and grants and a slight reduction in expenditures.

         There were some positive economic developments in 2006; notably, revenue
         performance exceeded forecasts, increasing by over 9 percent during 2006, and the level
         of public debt declined substantially due to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
         (MDRI). Also, private gross domestic investment increased from 16.3 percent of GDP in
         2004 to 20.3 percent in 2007. From the perspective of poverty alleviation, however, the
         economic deterioration had two negative impacts, including: (i) a decline in per capita

8For example, the budgetary support provided by the Dutch focused on the environmental sector while the Canadian
Cooperation focused on the education sector.
9The Government had a 47 percent stake in ICS. ICS is one of the largest companies in Senegal, accounting for 2%
of GDP, 10% of exports, and 7% of bank credit by end-2005. In the face of cumulative losses over 2003-05
equivalent to 4 percent of GDP (as a result of managerial weaknesses, cost overruns, adverse price developments,
disputes with clients, and exchange rate appreciation in 2004/05), ICS temporarily interrupted operations in 2006
and then operated at only one third of 2005 capacity.
10 These subsidies only partially offset losses at these companies, and disruptions in the supply of petroleum
products and electricity further hurt the economy as SENELEC accumulated arrears to suppliers and SAR was
forced to stop refining activities.

GDP (for only the third time since the 1994 devaluation); and (ii) energy sector subsidies
crowded out spending on priority areas (health, education, justice, and the environment).
Total spending on these priority areas fell by 4 percent in 2006, to 31 percent of total
outlays ­ a setback to the PRSP-II's medium-term goal of an allocation of 40 percent of
total expenditure to priority sectors.

Unwieldy Balance between a High Number of Objectives and a Limited Number of
Prior Actions. The PRSC program included approximately 50 overarching objectives
and sub-objectives across the five policy areas. There were also a high number of reform
measures identified to meet those objectives; for example, PRSC I included 70 reform
measures, of which 11 were prior actions. Relative to World Bank guidelines that
suggest limiting the number of prior action to 10-12 actions on average, the number of
reform measures included in the program matrix was too high to be capably represented
by a selective choice of prior actions. While the other actions in the program matrix were
also important, the Government -- and particularly the sectoral ministries -- focused
primarily on achieving the prior actions.

Institutional Instability. Program implementation was undermined by the rapid turnover
in the Government during the PRSCs' implementation period, particularly in the labor,
social development, and decentralization areas. For example, not less than four Ministers
in charge of labor were nominated during the PRSC program. This high rate of turnover
was also observed among staff holding key positions, particularly within the Ministry of
Health (including also the head of the Ministry). This lack of stability made it difficult to
follow up on the reforms or to address the lack of accountability and weaknesses in
financial management, execution, procurement and audit, and caused delays and
disruption.

Weak Capacity. Achieving the credit objectives was difficult at the sectoral level and at
the local Government level owing to weak administrative capacity. Complementarities
between the PRSC program and other World Bank operations and other donors'
assistance, however, helped to limit the impact of this factor on the implementation of the
PRSCs, as these operations provided technical and financial support to enhance capacity;
for example, this support was critical in efforts to assist vulnerable groups at the local
level in which the social development fund (AFDS) played a central role in diffusing the
community-based approach, targeting the poorest villages, and strengthening the capacity
of community organizations.

Unfavorable Political Calendar during the PRSC III Implementation Period. In
addition to being adversely affected by a surge in international oil prices, PRSC III was
also negatively impacted by the upcoming political calendar, which included presidential
and legislative elections in February and June 2007, respectively. As a consequence,
policymakers were generally more focused on their political endurance than in
implementing the longer-term economic agenda, and vested interests presented important
obstacles to some of the reforms supported by the PRSC III. Shifts in cabinet
composition and internal disputes led to irregularities in government spending, weaker
budgetary controls by the judiciary and legislative powers, and fragile governance in
public and quasi-public enterprises. This political climate led to some economically


                                            26

         deleterious policy decisions, including (i) several pre-election and ad hoc civil service
         salary increases that led to a worsening of the fiscal deficit; and (ii) Government
         unwillingness to pass through increases in oil prices, leading to the subsidization of
         domestic oil products, which had a substantial negative economic impact. However, it is
         important to notice that this situation is a more universal phenomena and not specific to
         Senegal and several countries in the developed and developing world found their
         macroeconomic framework and reform implementation negatively affected by upcoming
         elections and/or the oil price increase.

         Relevance of Risks Identified and Mitigation. The PRSC program anticipated three
         main types of risk ­ vested interests, exogenous shocks, and weak administrative capacity
         ­ and proposed various measures to mitigate these risks (see Table 6). While the risk of
         weak administrative capacity was addressed directly (through technical assistance), and
         the risk of vested interests was to a large extent offset by the inherent design of these
         operations (because all PRSC policy measures were implemented prior to credit
         approval), these operations did not sufficiently anticipate the risk of negative economic
         impacts. While the risk of oil price increases was anticipated, PRSC III overestimated the
         capacity and willingness of the Government to manage oil price shocks.11 While this
         may have been a reasonable assumption given Senegal's decade-long record of economic
         stability prior to the PRSCs and the underestimated wideness of the shock, it clearly
         proved to be insufficient to mitigate against the significant increase in oil prices in the
         context of upcoming elections. In addition, although the ICS accounted for 2 percent of
         GDP and the firm's losses for 2003-05 were equivalent to 4 percent of GDP, the PRSCs
         did not anticipate any economic risk arising from this company's operations. Finally,
         while it was noted that the pressure of upcoming elections might threaten reform
         progress,12 it was not anticipated that political authorities might succumb to ad hoc salary
         increases in an election year.

     2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

     The monitoring and evaluation system of the PRSP was well designed and the PRSCs'
     M&E was built on this system. Performance M&E was placed by the Government at the
     center of the first PRSP and was identified as its fourth pillar.




                                                            28

During the course of 2004, the PRSC series supported the authorities in reinforcing the
PRSP institutional framework, notably at the regional level, and sought to increase the
participation of several stakeholders. The PRSC M&E system (see Figure 1 below) was
built on the existing PRSP institutional framework; the one exception was the creation of
five working groups. Each of these groups was consistent with the main areas defined in
the PRSC program:              (i) budgetary and human reforms; (ii) health services; (iii)
decentralization; (iv) wealth creation; and (v) vulnerable groups. For each of these
working groups, three representatives were designated: one for the main technical
Ministry; one for the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and one for the World Bank's
team. Each group was responsible -- under the supervision of the PRSP unit, the Cellule
de Suivi (CSPLP), within the Ministry of Economy and Finance -- to finalize the action
plan in terms of objectives/measures/indicators that were included in PRSCs I-III and to
monitor and supervise implementation over time.

The CSPLP itself was placed under the authority of two steering committees, chaired
respectively by the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Prime Minister. It was also
linked to line Ministries through focal points or institutions that were identified in
accordance with the PRSP priority areas. At the regional level, several committees
(headed by the Governor) were created and were supervised by the CSPLP.                            This
institutional framework was created by an inter-ministerial decree, and by the time PRSC
I was introduced, it had been functioning for over one year with the support of Senegal's
main development partners.

During the course of 2004, a set of PRSP monitoring indicators was finalized through an
intense dialogue with the development partners operating in the country. The selection
process for these indicators was participatory and included both donors and
representatives of the private and public sectors. The Government established a list of 34
quantitative monitoring indicators covering the three operational pillars13 of PRSP-I.14
The list also indicated the medium- and long-term objectives to be achieved in 2010 and
2015, as well as the definition and the method of calculation of the indicator, and the
source of data to be used. The original PRSC program identified a list of 45 indicators
(as seen in Table 3 above), of which 15 were included in the Government's list of PRSP
monitoring indicators. With the exception of some indicators defined for monitoring
progress in the justice sector and the vulnerable groups' area, most of these indicators
were available in routine reports provided on an annual basis by the Government, thereby
facilitating their utility for monitoring performance.




13Although M&E was identified as the fourth pillar of first PRSP, no indicator was identified to monitor
progress on this pillar itself.
14Less positively, however, these indicators were not clearly linked to specific objectives in a results-
oriented type of framework.

M&E Implementation: Senegal has a relatively well functioning monitoring mechanism
and the PRSC M&E system benefited from it. The quality of Senegal's M&E system in
the Ministry of Economy and Finance was relatively good, even though line Ministries
were handicapped at the beginning of program implementation by outdated information
systems and weak management structures. However, greater attention should have been
given to: (i) maintaining leadership by policymakers in the implementation phase to
foster ownership and momentum which were lacking during the PRSP-I;15 and (ii)
strengthening coordination between sectoral and regional strategies. The World Bank
team worked with stakeholders within the five working groups and the team in the field
participated actively in the coordination meetings organized by the coordination unit
(CSPLP). Nonetheless, not all of these groups functioned equally effectively with donors
and better coordination with donors in some areas is needed in the future (e.g., wealth
creation and vulnerable groups).

Annual progress reports were prepared in 2004 (prior to PRSC I) and in 2005, and a
cumulative progress report on the first PRSP was presented at the consultative group
meeting held in October 2007. The data collecting system functioned moderately well
under PRSP-I and the financial report was significantly reinforced by the implementation
of the public finance management system (Système de Gestion des Finances Publiques ­
SIGFIP), which eliminated previous delays and enabled reports to be produced on a
monthly basis when SIGFIP was fully implemented at the central level. The other
accounts (national account, balance of payments, and monetary account) were also
provided regularly and were of a satisfactory quality, particularly in the context of the
PRSC implementation period.

The quality of social data, however, was less satisfactory owing to the weakness of the
household survey data. During the preparation of the PRSP-II in 2006, the most recent

Minister met only three times.

data available on poverty incidence were from the 2002 household survey16 and the
poverty assessment was not updated. Although the information systems within the line
Ministries were reinforced under the PRSCs, the definition of indicators still needs to be
harmonized and the sources of information need to be better coordinated with the
statistical agency. To address these issues -- and to better coordinate efforts and improve
the monitoring system -- the Government created the new National Statistic and
Demography Agency in 2006 which is following up on the authorities' commitment to
subscribe to the Standard Data Dissemination System (SDDS). In this context, the PRSC
program continued to rely as much as possible on the existing list of PRSP indicators and
those derived from sectoral strategies such as the CFAA/CPAR action plans or the
second phase of the strategic plan for the health sector and PRSP progress reports.

Utilization: Although the Government had a well designed PRSP M&E system that was
relatively well functioning, it is not clear that this system was effectively and efficiently
used by the authorities to learn from reform implementation and to modify policies
accordingly. The demand for monitoring information by policy makers was low, and the
calendar for the preparation of the PRSP progress report was not integrated into the
budgetary process; for example, the progress report of the first PRSP was prepared in
mid-year 2007, after the adoption of the second PRSP. Nonetheless, some findings of the
2003 and 2004 PRSP progress reports -- such as the weak attention given to the
vulnerable group pillar under the first years of PRSP-I implementation -- were taken into
account in the PRSP-II. Overall, however, more attention has been paid to organizing the
supply of monitoring information than to ensuring the effective use of this information to
improve policies and programs. To correct this, the government instituted a joint PRSP
review17 with the donor community and the civil society that will create more demand for
M&E utilization. It is expected that the joint PRSP review will improve accountability
and focus on results.

2.4      Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

As anticipated in the FY07-FY10 CAS, this series of PRSC operations will be followed
by a new series (starting with PRSC IV in FY09) that will incorporate (i) lessons learned
from the implementation of the first PRSC series; (ii) new directions derived from the
second generation PRSP and the Government's Accelerated Growth Strategy;18 and (iii)
strategic choices included in the new CAS. This new series will also be designed in the
context of better coordination among donors, principally through the adoption (in January
2008) of a joint Memorandum of Understanding (Arrangement Cadre des Appuis
Budgétaires, ACAB) between the donors providing budgetary support assistance in
Senegal. The ACAB formalizes collaboration on the macroeconomic framework, the

17Satisfactory PRSP implementation based on the common assessment by the Joint PRSP review is one of
the general condition of the common ACAB matrix with sound macroeconomic framework and good
implementation of budgetary reforms.
18The accelerated growth agenda is designed to strengthen private sector activities and improve the
investment climate and infrastructure in five sectors ­ textiles, fisheries, new technologies and
communications, agro-business, and tourism ­ and address transversal issues such as administrative
barriers and corruption.

public sector management reforms, and M&E of PRSP implementation. It also includes
a common policy matrix between the Government and donors with joint reviews and
supervisory missions.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

The PRSC I, II and III objectives, design and implementation were highly relevant to
country circumstances and development priorities and were highly consistent with Bank
strategies and goals. The PRSCs were aligned with the FY03-05 CAS which supported
the Government's efforts to achieve sustained growth rates, reduce the incidence of
poverty, and improve access to basic social services as described in the PRSP. The five
areas of focus ­ strengthening budgetary and financial reforms, enhancing financial
decentralization, improving health services delivery, promoting wealth creation, and
improving living conditions of the most vulnerable ­ were well aligned with the
Government's priorities under both PRSP-I and PRSP-II. They complemented the Bank's
portfolio of investment projects and they maximized synergies with other donors while
avoiding duplication.

During project preparation, there was close coordination with the EU and the Dutch and
Canadian Governments, which were also preparing budgetary support operations. This
cooperation ensured complementarities between the PRSCs and these other donor-
supported operations; sent a clear message to the authorities regarding donor priorities,
particularly in the areas of fiduciary reforms and health; and enabled agreement on the
monitoring indicators used to evaluate PRSP implementation.                            This cooperation
strengthened further in the context of PRSC II and PRSC III. While the PRSCs did not
adopt the approach used in other countries (e.g., Ghana) where a single matrix was
developed for all areas covered by the project and was used by all donors, this approach
was used for the fiduciary reforms, for which all donors endorsed and organized their
support along the implementation of the CFAA/CPAR action plans.

An important aspect of the PRSCs design was the program's selectivity; under this
approach, the PRSCs focused on those areas which provided the greatest value added to
the ongoing efforts by the Government and its development partners. The priority areas
and themes for the PRSCs were those: (i) which were important to effective PRSP
implementation; (ii) where the Bank held a comparative advantage in the policy dialogue;
and (iii) where there was an absence of support from other donors. This emphasis on
selectivity was used to avoid duplication with other projects supported by the Bank and
other donors; for example, the PRSCs did not directly support the education sector,19 as




19Although the PRSCs did address a number of the cross-cutting constraints faced by the education sector,
including administrative and civil reforms and financial decentralization to help strengthen the delivery and
quality of education services.



                                                    32

this sector received substantial financial support from the Bank and other donors,
particularly Canada.

Accordingly, PRSC I was strategically and narrowly focused on fiduciary reforms,
decentralization, and health services, reflecting the necessity of ensuing sound budgetary
processes, good fiduciary mechanisms, and adequate human resource management at
both the central and decentralized levels. The focus on budgetary reforms was justified
by the nature of the operation (DPO) and was well aligned with the Government priorities
established in the CFAA/CPAR action plans. The PRSC also supported the
decentralization process, which was identified as a top priority by the authorities and
Senegal's main partners in the PRSP, and incorporated measures clarifying
responsibilities between central and local governments, especially in terms of revenues
and expenditures and their alignment with PRSP objectives. The areas of wealth creation
covered by the PRSCs complemented other Bank assistance projects and were
appropriately introduced on a selective basis.       Finally, the protection of the most
vulnerable was perceived as a key pillar of the PRS by the Senegalese authorities. As
implementation of the PRSC action plan resulted in stronger Government systems, the
PRCSs became progressively more extensive and complex over time.

PRSC I was disbursed on the basis of the up-front completion of a set of prior actions
demonstrating satisfactory progress on the country's reform agenda in support of poverty
reduction. Each subsequent operation built on the previous one, with prior actions
formulated and agreed upon, and drawing on the progress towards benchmarks laid out at
the outset.    Although the policy matrix included a large and unwieldy number of
reforms/actions, these were developed in close coordination with the authorities and were
adopted in order to monitor progress over time and to ensure ownership by sectoral
ministries and stakeholders. The number of prior actions, however, was appropriately
and consistently limited to a manageable set of 10-12.

The components of the PRSC program were typically organized by broad PRSP policy
areas, with measures presented in a way to demonstrate reform sequence and logic from
year to year. The policy matrix was not designed to be static and was an integral part of a
step-by-step, flexible process that took into account progress and difficulties in the
reform program. The policy dialogue with the Government was critical in gauging what
was realistic in terms of timing, sequencing, and Government commitment, given
capacity constraints, lessons learned, political considerations, and available analytical
work. Particularly in the area of public financial management, Bank ESW, (PER, Rural
Social Protection Study) provided recommendations in the form of specific policy and
institutional measures that were incorporated into the PRSC policy matrix.

Equally positive, the PRSC's M&E framework was built on the existing PRSP
institutional framework. This provided several advantages to the implementation of the
PRSC program.       First, it provided a monitoring system that was already explicitly
integrated into Government planning and budgeting exercises on an annual basis.
Second, it incorporated the participation of Senegal's main development partners,
including the private sector, NGOs, and donors.         Finally, it avoided creating new
institutions which were already too numerous in Senegal. The creation of the five

working groups focusing on the five key areas supported by the PRSC enabled focused
sectoral collaboration to continue throughout PRSCs I-III.           These groups grew
increasingly active, and often served as catalysts in the areas of budgetary reform,
decentralization, and protection of vulnerable groups; for example, this latter working
group was instrumental in the design of the new Social Protection Strategy. Each group
was also in charge of monitoring and supervising implementation over time in its
respective area.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of
causal linkages between policy actions supported by the operation and outcomes):

As noted in section 1.2, the overall program development objectives of the PRSCs series
were twofold: (i) to improve the effectiveness and transparency of the national budget
process and expenditure management (including at the decentralized levels) as the main
instrument for achieving national development goals and reducing poverty; and (ii) to
support achievement of the PRSP outcomes for improved living conditions of the poor
within the PRSP time horizon. While no high level indicator was selected to assess the
overall PDO, the outcomes rating in this ICR is defined, based on an assessment of the
indicators set out to track progress in the areas of focus.

As detailed above (in Section 2.1 Program Performance), the PRSC series was successful
in supporting the Government's effort to achieve results in PRSP implementation in the
areas of budgetary reforms (with the exception of procurement and external and internal
control), and improving health services. Achievement of objectives in the areas of
Decentralization, wealth creation and protection of vulnerable groups was slower and
moderately satisfactory.

Notably, the areas where reform progress was slower --- procurement, labor reform,
justice, and vulnerable groups ­ were characterized by weaker levels of Government
ownership (refer to Table 4 above).         Labor and vulnerable groups were also less
supported by analytical work than other reform areas. Similarly, the areas of labor and
vulnerable groups did not benefit from technical and financial support from other donors,
nor was there good coordination between the donors in these areas.

It is difficult to disaggregate the impact of the PRSCs from that of other Bank projects or
the activities of other donors. Nonetheless, it can be argued that a number of policy
actions under PRSC I-III led to positive results.. The PRSCs fully supported the reforms
needed to reinforce efficiency in the management of public finances and to reach
vulnerable groups through four components (fiduciary reforms, decentralization, health
sector and vulnerable groups). In the areas of decentralization and vulnerable groups, the
PRSCs opted to address cross-cutting issues that were not addressed under other Bank
instruments such as Community Driven Development (CDD) or complementarities with
other donor programs.

However, a number of measures have just begun to show results and will need to be
maintained for a longer period to achieve notable outcomes among the targeted poorest
groups.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of
PDOs):

PRSC I          Moderately Satisfactory
PRSC II         Moderately Satisfactory
PRSC III        Moderately Satisfactory

Justification: All three PRSCs are rated Moderately Satisfactory. While the design of
the PRSCs was highly relevant, the achievement of the program objectives was moderate,
under each PRSC. Globally, significant outcomes were achieved in budgetary reforms
and the health sector. However, less significant outcomes were achieved in the areas of
decentralization, wealth creation and vulnerable groups. PRSC II was more successful
than PRSC I or PRSC III.

Under PRSC I, it took time for the budget support approach to be fully internalized by the
Government, particularly the line ministries. Four line ministries tested the preparation of
their budget on a programmatic basis and adopted the MTEF. The three years recruitment
program started and the transfer of resources to the local government took place earlier in
the fiscal year (June in 2004 compared to September in 2002). In the health sector, the
DTC 3 coverage increased from 59 percent to 2003 to 85 percent in 2004, the share of
health services delivered by skilled health staff grew from 39 percent in 2001 to 45
percent in 2004 and the CPN1 coverage reached 65 percent in 2004, up from 52 percent
in 2002). However, the progresses registered in the health sector were lower than
expected.

Under PRSC II, based on lessons learnt from the implementation of PRSC I, significant
progress was achieved in the area of budgetary reforms. For the first time, four line
ministries (Education, health, Justice and Environment) effectively prepared their budget
on a programmatic basis, after the test conducted under PRSC I. The recruitment program
functioned better and the new procurement framework was prepared and discussed with
all key stakeholders. The delay in the transfer of resources to the local government was
further reduced to 4 months (transfer took place in April 2005) and the amount allocated
reached FCFA 18.7 billion. In the health sector, the indicators continued to improve. The
DTC3 coverage and the CPN1 were maintained respectively at 85 percent and 65 percent,
and the share of health services delivered by skilled health staff reached 52 percent. The
other two other components (wealth creation and vulnerable groups) were fully integrated
but progress remained slower. However, outcomes achieved in the areas of procurement
and external control of the budget were lower than expected. The share of contracts
approved by CNCA on sole basis increased from 17 percent to 24 percent and the loi de
règlement of 2003 was not transmitted to Parliament.

The implementation of PRSC III was affected by the broader context characterized by the
surge in oil prices and the pre-electoral situation that contributed to weakened
macroeconomic performance. The GDP growth rate fell down to 2.3 percent and the
fiscal and external deficit were wider than the average in the 2003-2005 period. Despite
this unfavorable context, progress made in the health sector was maintained and
consolidated. The DTC3 coverage reached 89 percent in 2006 and 94 percent in 2007, the



                                            35

CPN 1 grew to 74 percent in 2007 and the share of health services delivered by skilled
health staff increased to 59 percent in 2006 and 63 percent in 2007. The recruitment and
remuneration program was pursued, the new procurement code was adopted and for the
first time the Cour des Compte issued its conformity statement (avis de conformité) on
the 1997, 1998 and 1999 State Accounts. However, in the area of decentralization, the
delay in the transfer of resources to the local government that was reduced to 4 months
began to increase to 5 months in 2006 and reached 7 months in 2007.

3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously
covered or to amplify discussion above):

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Senegal Poverty Monitoring Report (ESPS-2005), which is part of the overall
monitoring program for the Poverty Reduction Strategy, aimed to collect and analyze
indicators for a regular follow-up of poverty progression in Senegal. According to the
ESPS-2005, Senegal achieved significant progress in poverty alleviation during the
PRSP-I and initial PRSP-II implementation period. The ESPS found that the share of the
households living in poverty decreased from 57.1 percent in 2001-02 to 50.8 percent in
2005-06. However, poverty reduction was significantly lower in rural than in urban
areas.

The delivery of public services in the education and the health sectors improved in the
PRSC implementation period and contributed to a reduction in poverty and gender
inequity. According to the administrative data,20 the gross primary enrollment rate
apparently continued to grow under PRSC I and PRSC II, reaching 81.8 percent in 2006,
compared to 76.8 percent in 2003. Notably, girls' education improved, with gross
primary enrollment rate for girls (82.2 percent) exceeding boys (81.5 percent) for the first
time in 2006.

In the health sector, the number of births assisted by trained personnel reached 59 percent
in 2006, compared to 39 percent in 2001. Nine out of ten women who had a living birth
received prenatal treatment during their pregnancy. In the area of children's health, the
strengthened effort in DTP3 immunization improved the rate from 59 percent in 2003 to
80 percent in 2006 and 94 percent in 2007.                     In addition, a pilot project for the
decentralization of health staffs was implemented in 25 regional health posts in 2005, and
the primary health care utilization rate rose from 46% in 2003 to 54% in 2006.
Improvement in health outcomes, particularly for pregnant women and children,
contribute directly to reduced poverty levels and inequalities.

In the area of social development and helping the most vulnerable, new legal texts were
established as part of the effort to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, and a financial
program supporting street children in Dakar was established. A program of Community-
based Rehabilitation for the disabled was also implemented in four regions. The number
of disabled persons receiving health services through community-based rehabilitation

20The administrative data are collected within the Ministry of Education at the central and decentralized
level and are not directly comparable to the survey data collected directly from households.


                                                    36

programs reached 1,050.      Finally, financial transfers to the most vulnerable groups
increased, including the disabled and uninsured workers in strategic economic sectors
such as the transport and agricultural sectors who account for a large share of informal
workers in urban and rural areas. As vulnerable groups are frequently not covered by
national and sectoral programs, the PRSCs addressed these inequities and contributed to
Senegal's economic development.

Over time, it was expected that the PRSCs would have additional positive impacts on
poverty by (i) eliminating obstacles to private sector development through labor and
justice sector reforms, thereby mobilizing private investment and fuelling economic
growth; and (ii) improving the stock of human capital, through labor market reforms and
improved health services, thereby creating a healthier work force with improved labor
productivity and enhanced economic growth. The slow progress on labor and justice
sector reforms in particular -- as well as the longer time needed to realize the benefits of
these types of reforms in general ­ probably mean that several of these anticipated gains
need more time to be realized.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on
longer-term capacity and institutional development):

The most significant institutional changes took place in the area of fiduciary reform. As
discussed, the PRSCs supported the Government's efforts to progressively introduce a
three-year MTEF into the budget preparation process and decentralized budget execution
in the line ministries. This yielded positive results, especially in terms of linking detailed
sectoral strategies to the PRSP and the budget and in setting up a functional monitoring
and evaluation system. These reforms were accompanied by institutional changes such
as decentralization of budget execution (COF délégué and ordonnateur délégué) which
permitted financial reporting at the sectoral level. In addition, capital expenditures began
to be executed at the local level for both the education and health sectors.             The
predictability of the resources transferred to local Governments was both improved and
accelerated, and the amount was predetermined by law as a fixed part of the VAT
revenue collected in the preceding year.

In early 2006, the Government created a new National Statistic and Demography Agency
with the responsibility for coordinating current M&E efforts and improving monitoring
over time.    This institutionalized by law the previous links between the disparate
institutes that existed prior to this agency's establishment, and should improve data
availability, consistency, comparability, and interpretability. In the area of procurement,
progress was achieved with the adoption of the Code des Obligations de
l'Administration, the new procurement code and the legal instruments needed for its
implementation. To improve transparency, this reform also allowed an active role for the
private sector and civil society on ex post control of the procurement process by enabling
their participation as members of the Autorité de Régulation des Marchés Publics
(ARMP). A final institutional change that occurred under the PRSCs was the creation of
the Commission Nationale contre la Corruption that aims to combat non-transparency,
corruption, and misappropriation of public funds.

         3.4        Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

         None.

         3.5        Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
         (optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

         No beneficiary survey was conducted.

         4.         Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

         Rating:

         PRSC I              Moderate
         PRSC II             Moderate
         PRSC III            Significant

         Justification: The risk to development outcomes is moderate for PRSCs I and II and
         significant for PRSC III. The policy reforms introduced under these credits provided the
         progressive foundation for the introduction of additional reforms under subsequent
         credits. The fiduciary framework has been strengthened, and a number of reforms have
         created programs or mechanisms that will not be easily dismantled.21 Following the
         decline in priority expenditures in 2006, the Government has committed (in the context of
         the PSI arrangement with the IMF) to again increase spending in areas such as health and
         education.

         There continues to be, however, a number of risks to sustainability. Continuing surges in
         international petroleum prices and selected foodstuffs threaten economic stability; other
         possible exogenous risks include drought and locust invasions. Internal threats include a
         potential failure to successfully address the weaknesses of Senegal's energy sector which
         the international price increase has brought about, and the prospect of delays in the ICS'
         recovery, which would reduce average GDP growth. Progress on poverty reform could
         also be threatened by a lack of resolve to move forward with difficult structural reforms,
         continued weaknesses in fiscal governance, and absorptive capacity constraints. The chief
         mitigating factors to these risks include the policy dialogue and continued budgetary
         support in the context of the follow-on PRSCs and the IMF's PSI (approved in November
         2007 and whose first program review was completed in June 2008); committed
         Government and donor support to the goals of Senegal's poverty reduction program; and
         improved coordination among donors through the ACAB. This formalized cooperation
         will further unify donor support for continued reforms, as well as reduce Government
         transaction costs and free up administrative resources that can be focused on further
         poverty reduction efforts.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design,
implementation and outcome issues)

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending
phase):

Rating:

PRSC I         Satisfactory
PRSC II        Satisfactory
PRSC III       Moderately Satisfactory

Justification: Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory for
PRSC I and II and moderately satisfactory for PRSC III. Each operation was an
integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, and its objectives were well
aligned with the Government's development agenda, priorities, and policies as set out in
the PRSP. The PRSCs' policy matrices, including prior actions and triggers, were based
on reforms included in the PRSP and national sectoral strategies, and the quantitative
targets were consistent with those selected by the authorities in the PRSP.

All three PRSCs were designed using a participatory process to identify priority areas for
the PRSC, and were attended by representatives from the Government, donors, civil
society, and the private sector. These priority areas were consistent with the PRSP
strategy, complementary with Bank and other donors' support to the PRSP in other areas,
and emphasized concrete indicators and results. In addition, the institutional framework
(including M&E) for the PRSCs was centered on that used for the PRSP. As noted
previously, project preparation of the PRSC was coordinated with the EU and the Dutch
and Canadian Governments, thus ensuring complementarity with their support, and
providing a consistent message to the Government by supporting the same priority
actions; there was also close collaboration in the definition of the monitoring indicators to
be used to evaluate the implementation of the PRSP. Finally, the PRSC program was
also closely coordinated with the IMF's PRGF according to the standard agreed-upon
institutional division of labor under which the IMF took the lead on macroeconomic
issues and the Bank held responsibility for structural and social issues.

PRSC I: Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. PRSC I was an integral part of
the CAS, and its objectives were well aligned with the Government's development
agenda, priorities, and policies, as set out in the December 2002 PRS. The team was
appropriately balanced, and included specialists in macroeconomics, health, law, social
protection, and financial management.




                                             39

          PRSC II: PRSC II incorporated four key lessons learned from the implementation of
          PRSC I.22 In addition, more attention was paid to vulnerable groups under PRSC II, as
          emphasized in the first PRSP progress report and the Joint Staff Advisory Note. The
          PRSC program was closely coordinated with the PRGF.                           In concurrence with the
          Government, the timetable for PRSC II (i.e., scheduling of the ROC meeting, appraisal
          mission, and negotiations) was designed to ensure that the operation would be aligned
          with the preparation of the 2006 Budget. Finally, the team was again appropriately
          balanced, and included specialists in relevant areas.

          PRSC III: PRSC III incorporated the lessons learned from the implementation of PRSC
          II,23 and continued to rely on the institutional framework that was designed to support
          PRSCs I and II. The prior actions for PRSC III were consistent with the triggers defined
          at the end of the preparation of PRSC II but were appropriately shortened from 15 to 10
          in order to follow World Bank guidelines and make them more precise, thereby
          minimizing difficulties in interpretation during negotiation. However, it should be noted
          that, while possible risks had been broadly anticipated, PRSC III overestimated the
          capacity and willingness of the Government to manage the oil price shock, a main reason
          for the weakened macroeconomic performance in 2006, due to its decade-long record of
          economic stability prior to the PRSCs and the significant wideness of the shock. Finally,
          while it was noted that the pressure of upcoming elections might threaten reform
          progress, it was not anticipated that the political authorities might succumb to ad hoc
          salary increases in an election year. There were moderate shortcomings in the appraisal of
          the PRSC III, particularly for structural, financial and macro-economic aspects, which
          lead to a rating of moderately satisfactory.

          (b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

          Ranking:

          PRSC I             Satisfactory
          PRSC II            Satisfactory
          PRSC III           Satisfactory



22 These were: (i) a budgetary approach was an effective tool for mobilizing the entire Government on cross-cutting
issues, and the PRSC approach helped to reinforce the much-needed institutional anchor on issues that involved
multiple Ministries and agencies (e.g., decentralization and the protection of vulnerable groups); (ii) the PRSC
approach needs to rely not only on the PRS but also on the sectoral strategies approved by the Government and the
multiple partners operating in Senegal; (iii) the preparation of the PRSC needs to be aligned with the national budget
(which did not occur under PRSC I); and (iv) the need to clearly define actions and outcomes, using (if possible)
monitoring indicators from existing programs and those defined in the PRPS, in order to avoid subsequent
difficulties in interpreting targets and to minimize duplication in monitoring progress.
23These were: (i) a budgetary approach was an effective tool for mobilizing the entire Government on cross-cutting
issues, and the PRSC approach helped to reinforce the much-needed institutional anchor on issues that involved
multiple Ministries and agencies (e.g., decentralization and the protection of vulnerable groups); (ii) the success of
the PRSC program is closely linked to its alignment with the national budget cycle because it ensures that key needs
are incorporated in budgetary discussions; and (iii) participatory ministries and agencies have a tendency to focus on
the realization of prior actions at the expense of other actions/outcomes, which ­ while not surprising ­ may be
detrimental to progress over time.


                                                               40

Bank performance in supervision under PRSC I , II and III is rated satisfactory. Bank
supervision of the PRSC series was not fully aligned with the activities of other donors,
but workshops organized by the Government when designing, implementing, and
following up on the PRSC were opened to others donors present in Senegal. In the
fiduciary area, however, Bank supervision was aligned with the activities of the other
donors under the coordination of the Government. Coordination with the IMF in the
context of the PRGF was relatively good and the actions in the fiduciary area were also
aligned. To track progress, the team focused on the verification process that monitored
implementation of the policies supported by the PRSCs and identified how to best
measure the completion of the agreed policy actions. The evaluation of the PRSC series
was closely linked to the monitoring of the PRSP and sectoral national strategies,
including through the use of a common set of output and outcome indicators. For all
three operations, supervisory missions contained an appropriate mixture of personnel
relevant to the policy areas of the PRSCs. The Bank team collaborated very closely with
the five working groups established to monitor the implementation of policy actions in
the five areas of the PRSC program, and devoted specific attention to coordinating the
teams' activities with other donors, particularly in the areas of health and
decentralization.

Within the Bank, for all three operations the consultation process functioned well and the
comments received were taken into account by the team. Internal reviews led to a refined
focus on: (i) the status of the macroeconomic framework; (ii) content and design; (iii)
triggers and monitoring indicators; (iv) donor coordination; and (v) implementation and
monitoring of results and risks. The main choices, such as policy areas, sequencing, and
number of prior actions of the program were agreed within the team.

As part of preparation of PRSC IV, the Bank team continued monitoring the
implementation of the actions and reform areas supported by PRSC III. Policy dialogue
between the Bank and the Government in the key areas (Electricity and Chemical sectors)
that were outside of the PRSC area but affected negatively the macroeconomic
framework was quite difficult but relevant--and continues in these days.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating:

PRSC I          Satisfactory
PRSC II         Satisfactory
PRSC III        Moderately Satisfactory

Justification: As Bank performance for both quality at entry and supervision for
PRSC I and II is rated satisfactory, overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory
for these two operations. For PRSC III, although quality of supervision is rated
satisfactory, quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. The PRSCs were a
well-designed and implemented series of operations. As described in earlier section, the
three operations were highly relevant to Bank and Senegalese priorities and significant
reform progress was made in the areas of decentralization, budgetary reforms, and the



                                            41

provision of health services, and to a lesser extent, in the areas of wealth creation and the
protection of vulnerable groups. These reforms laid the basis for a number of positive
and measurable outcomes. The operations were well coordinated with other key donors,
and this coordination is providing the basis for the use of a common matrix and stronger
cooperation in the context of the ACAB for PRSC IV and subsequent operations.

(c)       Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating:

PRSC I             Satisfactory
PRSC II            Satisfactory
PRSC III           Moderately satisfactory

Justification: Borrower performance for PRSC I and II was satisfactory and for
PRSC III moderately satisfactory. The good policy implementation record under PRSC
I, II and III was an indicator of strong Borrower ownership and commitment to the PRSC
program (although in areas where Government ownership was less strong, the
implementation record was weaker). PRSP-I and PRSP-II contained well articulated and
comprehensive poverty reduction strategies, and both programs were endorsed by all
major stakeholders in Senegal; in particular, PRSP-II benefitted from a fully participatory
process that included the Government, donors, members of Parliament, local
governments and communities, the private sector, and civil society. The implementation
and monitoring of the PRSC series was built on the institutional framework for the PRSP,
thereby avoiding duplication, and the unit responsible for the PRSC series was also the
one in charge of PRSP preparation and implementation. To reinforce ownership at the
sectoral level, five working groups were formed around the priority areas of the PRSC
program and these groups followed up daily on the implementation of the reforms under
the supervision of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, via the CSPLP.

However, institutional instability -- as characterized by the rapid turnover in key
personnel -- undermined program implementation in the labor, social development, and
decentralization areas. This lack of stability made it difficult to follow up on reforms or
to address weak accountability and other weaknesses. Weak administrative capacity at
the sectoral and local level also affected the achievement of some credit objectives,
although technical assistance provided by the Bank and other donors helped address this.
Finally, weakened macroeconomic performance in 2006 and elections in 2007 slowed
some reforms and progress towards poverty reduction.

         PRSC I: Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The sound policy record in PRSC
         I reflected the Government's strong ownership and commitment to the PRS program.
         Five working groups were formed and followed up on day-to-day implementation of the
         reforms under the supervision of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, via the PRSP
         Secretariat. There was, however, an initial lack of understanding of the PRSC instrument
         ­ which was new ­ particularly in sectoral ministries that were used to investment
         projects. This lack of understanding was exacerbated by the unexpected delays in the
         IMF-sponsored PRGF, which prevented the inclusion of PRSC I in the 2005 budget. The
         Ministry of Economy and Finance played an effective role in explaining this new
         budgetary approach to fund development priorities, as well as mobilizing needed
         institutional anchors on cross-cutting issues. In addition, macroeconomic performance
         was sound.

         PRSC II: Borrower performance continued to be satisfactory. The Ministry of Economy
         and Finance held a workshop in 2005 to present and validate the updated PRSC program
         with the main stakeholders in the country, including the actions to be achieved under
         PRSC II, and a detailed action plan toward PRSC III. The second PRSP Progress Report
         (May 2005) overcame a number of the shortcomings of the first PRSP Progress Report
         (March 2004), notably: (i) it included a detailed analysis of the linkages between the
         allocation of resources within the budget and the PRSP priority sectors; (ii) it identified
         and used a series of quantitative indicators to monitor progress over time; and (iii) it
         strengthened the participatory process with donors, civil society, local governments, and
         the private sector, particularly during the report's evaluation and preparation.

          PRSC III: Borrower performance under PRSC III is rated moderately satisfactory.
         While the Government's up-front completion of all prior actions demonstrated
         "satisfactory progress of Senegal's social and structural reform agenda in support of the
         PRSP,"24 Borrower performance under ICR guidelines is rated in accordance with a
         number of criteria, and the Government's performance was moderately satisfactory in
         some areas.25       With regard to fiduciary issues, a significant number of government
         contracts continued to be granted on a sole source basis. To correct these weaknesses, the
         Government prepared a new legal procurement framework that reduce the cases in which
         contract can be awarded without competition and involved the private sector and the civil
         society as member of the ex post tripartite (Government, Private sector and Civil society)
         controlling agency. The new legal framework was adopted by the Parliament in 2006, the
         implementing framework was adopted in 2007 and the key agencies put in place for its
         effectiveness in 2008.

         With regard to the enabling environment, the macroeconomic performance weakened in
         2006 and expenditures on priority sectors fell due to pressures for energy subsidies,
         slowing progress towards the MDGs, while per capita GDP also declined. Also, the
         presidential and legislative elections in February and June 2007 meant that the focus of

        the authorities shifted partially; shifts in cabinet composition and internal disputes also
        affected the Borrower performance.

        5. Lessons Learned (both operation-specific and of wide general application)

        The implementation of the PRSC program has led to several key lessons, as discussed
        below.

        1. The PRSC approach is an effective tool to strengthen the country-based
        development model. The PRSCs had a clear impact on Government ownership of the
        reform program. The PRSCs helped the reformers within the Ministries to mobilize the
        entire Government on cross-cutting issues and encouraged the Government to provide
        leadership and accountability.               Subsequently, the strengthened alignment and
        predictability of support through the PRSCs have begun to lead to improved decision-
        making by the Government at various levels. This momentum has to be maintained and
        strengthened in two ways. One, the Bank should reinforce this instrument and confirm its
        confidence in the country-based model by gradually increasing the share of the budget
        support in the global portfolio. Two, the Bank has to take the lead in facilitating
        coordination among donors in order to reassure those countries that hesitate to move
        toward budget support.            The implementation of the harmonized and multi-donor
        budgetary support instrument ­ ACAB ­ will provide a mechanism for effectively
        coordinating expanded donor budgetary support.

        2. The PRSC instrument can be an efficient instrument for reinforcing the
        Government's monitoring and evaluation system. The PRSCs helped to create a
        strengthened mechanism that could collect data, generate statistics, and measure
        qualitative results in sectors such as health, rather than simply measuring progress by the
        amount of total expenditure. This was a significant achievement relative to PRSC
        programs in other countries where M&E capability lagged behind overall reform
        progress. Nonetheless, this information is still not effectively used by policy makers to
        reorient policies. The next PRSCs will need to further strengthen M&E capabilities,
        notably the feedback mechanisms that use monitoring information to improve budgeting,
        policies, and programs, which will enable the Government to strengthen the results-
        oriented framework.

        3. Budgetary support through an instrument such as a PRSC is an effective tool to
        address cross-cutting constraints and issues that affect service delivery -- notably in
        health and education -- that cannot be effectively addressed at the sector level or through
        investment operations only -- for example, for issues dealing with recruitment,
        remuneration and deployment of personnel. As such, it is more effective than sectoral
        support because it can embed sector policy within crosscutting issues such as civil service
        reform or improved expenditure management. It is also effective for mobilizing the
        entire Government on such crosscutting issues.26


26For example, the Social Protection Strategy was adopted by the Inter-ministerial Committee supported by the
PRSC program, while the production of the MTEF in four key sectors (education, health, justice, and environment)
was the result of coordination between these in-line Ministries and the Ministry of Economy and Finance.


                                                              44

        4. An institutional "anchor" is important and necessary to ensure that specific
        needs are incorporated into budgetary discussions; this is particularly true for issues
        such as decentralization or the protection of vulnerable groups that involve multiple
        Ministries and agencies. Conversely, those areas that do not have such an anchor lack an
        advocate in the budget process and consequently may not receive adequate funding.
        Such areas need to be identified upfront, and a ministry or other unit needs to be
        explicitly assigned such an advocacy role in order to ensure that key reforms receive
        adequate financial support.

        5. The move to multi-donor and harmonized budgetary support (in the context of
        the ACAB) should be a positive contributor to future reform implementation. As
        demonstrated in the PRSC programs in Ghana, Mozambique                       and Cape Verde,
        harmonized budgetary support has a number of advantages because it can: (i) provide a
        powerful instrument for unifying donor assistance around a coherent set of policy actions;
        (ii) ensure the predictability of annual aid flows, thereby further strengthening budgetary
        planning; (iii) lower government transaction costs from dealing with multiple donors; (iv)
        generate substantial reform momentum as the combined resources of multiple donors
        provide a substantial incentive for governments to proceed with difficult reforms; and
        (iii) once successfully implemented, the move to harmonized budget support can be
        catalytic in encouraging additional donors to join, with a further positive impact on
        predictability and government transaction costs. Finally, such instrument will lead ­
        owing to the need to reconcile multiple donor priorities into a single policy matrix ­ to a
        simplified set of reform objectives, thereby correcting one of the initial (and later
        corrected) weaknesses of the PRSC series.

        6. These lessons highlight the need for the next PRSCs to be more focused on
        limited number of objectives and non binding measures. While the number of its
        policy areas was fewer than the average27, the PRSC I program included approximately
        50 overarching objectives and sub-objectives and 70 reform measures, of which 11 were
        prior actions. While the other actions in the program matrix were also important, the
        Government -- and particularly the sectoral ministries -- focused primarily on achieving
        the prior actions. This was corrected in later PRSCs, including as a result of lessons learnt
        and disseminated Bank wide through the Bank reviews of conditionality.

        7. The last lesson is the same as the one identified by the IEG review of the
        Simplified ICR for PRSC I. The related lesson is that clearly defined monitoring
        indicators and the use of realistic quantitative targets can help support progress
        towards expected results. The credit appears to have been relatively more successful in
        achieving its objectives where indicators were easy to identify and statistical data were
        available to monitor quantitative targets, such as in the area of health reforms and in some
        aspects of budgetary reforms.

                            de Soutien à la Réduction de la Pauvreté



Cette note présente le point de vue du Gouvernement sur la mise en oeuvre Crédit de Soutien à la
Réduction de Pauvreté (CSRP) et formule un certain nombre commentaires généraux sur le
rapport provisoire intitulé Implementation Completion and Results Report dans lequel la Banque
mondiale fait l'évaluation interne des trois premiers CSRP (I à III).

I - BILAN RESUME DU CREDIT DE SOUTIEN A LA REDUCTION DE LA
PAUVRETE
1. En 2002, le Gouvernement a adopté un Document de Stratégie de Réduction de la Pauvreté
(DSRP) qui portait sur la période 2003-2005, suivant un processus largement participatif. Ce
document qui a été examiné et adopté par la Banque mondiale et le Fonds Monétaire
Internationale la même année, reposait sur quatre (4) piliers que sont (i) la création de richesses,
(ii) le renforcement des capacités et promotion des services de base, (iii) l'amélioration des
conditions de vie des groupes vulnérables et (iv) le suivi de la mise en oeuvre et évaluation. C'est
pour appuyer la mise en oeuvre de cette stratégie que le Gouvernement, avec l'appuie de la
Banque mondiale et des autres partenaires techniques et financiers que avait identifié et préparé
le CRSP en 2004.

2. Le Crédit de Soutien à la Réduction de Pauvreté poursuivait deux principaux objectifs : (i)
aider le Gouvernement à améliorer l'efficacité et la transparence du budget, principal instrument
de lutte contre la pauvreté ; (ii) contribuer à l'atteinte des objectifs du DSRP, notamment dans
l'amélioration des conditions de vie des populations, notamment les plus pauvres.

3. Nous avions identifié cinq (05) composantes : (i) Réformes budgétaires et financières ; (ii)
Décentralisation ; (iii) Santé ; (iv) Création de richesses (Emploi et Justice) et (v) Protection des
groupes vulnérables. Pour chacune de ces composantes, des activités ont été identifiées et un
certains nombre d'indicateurs de suivi mis en place.

4. Dans l'ensemble, la mise en oeuvre de la Stratégie de Réduction de la Pauvreté a été
satisfaisante même si les impacts ont été quelque peu atténués par les chocs exogènes. En effet,
d'après les résultats consignés dans les différents rapports d'avancement annuels du DSRP,
d'importants progrès ont été faits dans les secteurs prioritaires du DSRP. En effet, le
Gouvernement a réalisé la plupart des mesures d'accompagnement du pilier « création de
richesses » et inscrit l'économie nationale dans une dynamique d'accélération de la croissance


                                                      54

par des politiques macroéconomiques rationnelles, l'amélioration du climat de l'investissement
et des avancées dans les réformes structurelles notamment dans les secteurs de l'arachide et de
l'électricité.Cependant, les impacts sur la réduction de la pauvreté ont été atténués, du fait de
chocs comme les catastrophes vécues par les populations ces dernières années : pluies hors
saisons, sécheresse, inondations, naufrage du bateau « le Joola », invasions acridiennes, etc. La
dernière enquête de suivi de la pauvreté (ESPS) réalisées auprès des ménages montre que
l'incidence de la pauvreté des populations a baissé de 57.1% en 2001/02 à 50,6% en 2005/06.
toutefois, la baisse de l'incidence de la pauvreté a été moindre en milieu rural. Elle est passes de
65.2% en 2001/02 a 61,7% en 2005/06.

5. En ce qui concerne le second pilier, les investissements dans le capital humain de manière
générale ont fait l'objet d'une attention particulière de l'Etat avec l'allocation de 50% du budget
de fonctionnement aux secteurs sociaux (éducation, santé). Même si tous les effets attendus ne
sont pas encore constatés, les investissements dans ces secteurs ont permis d'améliorer
sensiblement les indicateurs sociaux tendant ainsi vers l'atteinte des OMD. En effet, le taux brut
de scolarisation élémentaire est passé de 79,9% à plus de 86% entre 2004 et 2007 et attestant
ainsi un bon rythme d'évolution vers les objectifs de la scolarisation universelle d'ici à 2015.
Malgré ces progrès, près de 300 000 enfants en âge d'aller à l'école primaire en milieu rural et
36 000 enfants dans les zones urbaines ne sont pas scolarisés. En outre, la scolarisation des filles
dans l'élémentaire a beaucoup progresse ces dernières années. Les taux de scolarisation sont
passés de 82,4 % à 83% et de 77,3% à 89,2% respectivement chez les garçons et chez les filles
entre 2004 et 2007.

6. Quant au taux d'achèvement de l'école primaire, il se situe à 55,7% en 2007 contre 48,4% en
2004, attestant toujours une contre performance au regard de la moyenne de 66%, pour les pays
accédant au guichet de l'IDA. Pourtant, la part des dépenses d'éducation primaire dans le PIB est
de 2,08% contre une moyenne de 1,84% pour ces pays. Selon l'ESPS, l'abandon scolaire,
mesuré par la proportion des élèves qui ont quitté l'école au cours de l'année scolaire 2004/05
concerne 85 300 personnes, soit un taux d'abandon de 5,5%. La mauvaise perception de l'école
jugée inutile/sans intérêt (par 21,0% des enquêtés), l'échec aux examens (17,4%) et le travail des
enfants (15,6%) effectué à la maison ou en dehors, sont les principaux motifs d'abandon
déclarés. Dans le domaine de l'alphabétisation, le Sénégal est en train de réaliser des progrès
significatifs, même si d'importants efforts restent à faire en milieu rural. En effet, le pourcentage
des adultes (15 ans et plus) qui ont la capacité de lire et écrire dans une langue quelconque taux
d'alphabétisation est passé de 32,9% en 1004/95 à 37,8% en 2001/02 et à 41,9% en 2005/06. des
adultes, en dépit des efforts importants réalisés dans le cadre des campagnes d'alphabétisation.
En milieu rural, le taux d'alphabétisation est estimé à 26,4% en 2005/06, soit moins que la moitié
de celui observé en milieu urbain qui est à 60%.

7. En matière de santé, la part des dépenses budgétaires allouée ne cesse également de
progresser. En effet, la part du budget de la santé (fonctionnement et investissement) dans le
budget de l'Etat hors dette est en constante progression, passant de 7,7% en 2003 à 7,82% et
10,3% respectivement en 2004 et 2007. Le taux de consultation primaire curative a évolué
positivement passant de 50% en 2004, à 52% en 2005 et 64% en 2007. Une plus grande
performance a été réalisée dans la couverture vaccinale des enfants et l'assistance à
l'accouchement. Le taux de couverture vaccinale est passé de 78% à 94% entre 2004 et 2007 et
la proportion d'accouchements assistés, de 52% à 62,5% sur la même période. L'accès aux
services de santé reste difficile au Sénégal, surtout en cas d'urgence. En effet, selon l'enquête



                                                     55

ESPS, seuls 61,3 % des populations sont à moins de 30 minutes d'un service de santé, avec une
très forte disparité entre la capitale (Dakar) et les autres milieux de résidences. Ce taux est de
83% à Dakar contre seulement 44.1% en milieu rural, du fait notamment des difficultés de
transport liées aux longues distances et à la mauvaise qualité des infrastructures routières.

8. Le Sénégal enregistre l'un des taux de prévalence du VIH les plus faibles en Afrique
subsaharienne estimé à 0,7% dans la population générale, avec 0,9% chez les femmes et 0,4%
chez les hommes, selon la dernière enquête EDS IV, reflétant ainsi l'efficacité des politiques
mises en oeuvre par le pays pour lutter contre la pandémie mais aussi la féminisation de
l'épidémie. Malgré ces résultats, le nombre de personnes infectées par le VIH/SIDA demeure
important, se situant autour de 75 000 adultes et de 5000 enfants infectés (CNLS 2004),
constituant ainsi une menace sérieuse. L'importance et la complexité des problèmes posés par le
VIH/SIDA ont conduit les pouvoirs publics à considérer l'épidémie à la fois comme un problème
de santé publique mais aussi de développement. Pour faire face à la menace de la pandémie,
l'accès aux ARV a été facilité depuis 2003 pour les personnes infectées par le VIH.

9. Les prévalences de la malnutrition sont encore élevées au Sénégal, particulièrement en zone
rurale. Ainsi, le niveau de l'insuffisance pondérale est deux fois plus élevé en milieu rural (22%)
qu'en milieu urbain (10%). Les régions les plus touchées sont Kolda, Matam et Saint Louis qui
présentent les niveaux qui atteignent 30% pour l'insuffisance pondérale. Selon les données des
enquêtes EDS II et IV (1992 et 2005) il y a une amélioration de la situation nutritionnelle des
enfants âgés de moins de 5 ans. En effet, entre 1992 et 2005, la prévalence de l'insuffisance
pondérale (Poids/âge) est passée de 21% à 17%, celle du retard de croissance (Taille/âge) est
passée de 22% à 16% et celle de la maigreur (Poids/taille) est passée de 9% à 8%.

10. Concernant l'accès à l'eau potable, une analyse récente des résultats du secteur a montré
qu'en milieu urbain, le taux d'accès à l'eau potable a connu des progrès sensibles, passant de 78%
en 2000 à 85% en 2005 et 98% en 2007. Cette progression est notamment due à l'exécution de
programmes ambitieux de branchements sociaux par la SONES. Malgré ces importants acquis, il
subsiste encore de sérieuses disparités d'accès selon les usagers et les régions. En milieu rural, le
taux d'accès raisonnable à l'eau potable a connu une progression de 56% en 2000 à 61% en 2005
et 72,4% en 2007. Les consommations spécifiques sont encore très faibles. Les usagers des
bornes-fontaines qui représentent 35% des ménages ruraux consomment à peine 20 l/j/pers. En
matière d'assainissement, le taux d'accès

en milieu urbain a connu une progression limitée sur la période 2000-2005, passant de 56 % à
59%. Ce taux est estime à 64% en 2007.

11. Dans le secteur de la justice, même si les résultats et impacts ne sont pas encore visibles ou
restent en dessous des attentes, beaucoup d'efforts ont été consentis par le Gouvernement. Les
moyens humains et ressources financières mis à la disposition du Ministère ont été
considérablement accrus ces dernières années. Le budget du ministère de la Justice qui était de 7
milliards en 2001 est passe a 12 milliards en 2005 puis 21 milliards en 2007. Le gouvernement
continue de travailler sur les facteurs de dysfonctionnement tels que les lenteurs des procédures
judiciaires, le déficit d'infrastructure, l'obsolescence de l'outil de travail et l'insuffisance
numérique de personnel qualifié dans des domaines liés aux affaires commerciales et financières.

12. Ces importants résultats ont été obtenus grâce notamment à la contribution du Crédit de
soutien à la Réduction de la Pauvreté (CRSP) qui appuyé la mise en oeuvre de reformes
transversales (finances publiques, décentralisation, groupes vulnérables). En effet, le


                                                     56

Gouvernement, avec l'appui du CSRP a mis en oeuvre d'importantes reformes en matière de
finances publiques. La programmation du budget a été améliorée avec l'introduction du Cadre de
Dépenses a Moyen Terme (CDMT) et des Cadres de Dépenses Sectorielles a Moyen Terme
(CDSMT) au niveau de 12 ministères dépensiers dont l'Education, la Sante, la Justice,
l'Environnement, l'Agriculture, entre autres. Le Sénégal a également déconcentré
l'ordonnancement du budget au niveau de 6 ministères a installé le logiciel SIGFIP (Système
Intégré de Gestion des Finances Publiques). Par ailleurs, l'Etat a mis en oeuvre sa stratégie de
recrutement et de rémunération dans la fonction publique qui accru le personnel dans les
ministères clés (Finances, Education, Sante, Justice). La mise en oeuvre de ces reformes dont
certaines ont été choisies comme déclencheurs dans le CSRP ont permis de relever
considérablement les capacités d'absorption des ressources internes (incluant les appuis
budgétaires) par les ministères dépensiers dont ceux de l'Education et de la Santé.

13. Même si beaucoup d'efforts restent à faire, le Sénégal a progressé dans la mise en oeuvre des
reformes portant sur les marches publics et le contrôle externe du budget. En effet, le Sénégal a
adopté un nouveau code des marchés publics et a déjà, avec l'appui de la Banque mondiale et
d'autres partenaires, mis en place les institutions et organes chargées de sa mise en oeuvre. Les
changements apportés par le nouveau code donnent une plus grande participation au secteur
privé et à la société civile, qui sont désormais sont représentées au même titre que l'Etat dans les
organes de contrôle. Le Gouvernement a également progressé dans la production des comptes de
gestion et des projets de lois de règlements. A ce jour, les comptes de gestion de 1997 à 2004 et
les projets lois de règlement de 1997 à 2003 ont été déposés à la Cour des Comptes. Grace a un
renforcement des capacités de la Cour, celui-ci a donne ses avis de conformité pour les de 1997,
1998 et 1999 et avance dans l'examen des compte a partir de 2000. Un programme de
transmission des comptes restants a été établi afin de respecter dans les prochaines années à venir
la directive de l'UEMOA.

14. En ce qui concerne la décentralisation, le processus de décentralisation a connu, au Sénégal,
plusieurs étapes à l'issue desquelles certaines compétences ont été transférées, mais dont
l'exercice se heurte à plusieurs difficultés. Les différentes évaluations ont mis en exergue : (i) le
manque notoire de moyens dont disposent les collectivités locales pour faire face aux exigences
et compétences qui leur sont transférées ; (ii) la non fonctionnalité des organes d'appui, (iii) la
mauvaise compréhension du sens de la décentralisation et (iv) le retard accusé par l'État dans la
mise à la disposition des collectivités locales des FECL et des FDD. Toutefois, le Gouvernement
a réalisé d'importants avancements allant dans le sens de la levée de ces contraintes. Il a accru
considérablement les ressources et amélioré leur prévisibilité en fixant le montant de l'enveloppe
globale proportionnellement à la TVA collecté en N-1. Le retard accusé dans la mise à
disposition des ressources a été également réduit.

15. Concernant la protection des groupes vulnérables, le Sénégal a élaboré sa Stratégie Nationale
de Protection Sociale, grâce notamment à l'appui du CSRP. Cette stratégie qui devient de
référence en matière de protection des groupes vulnérable a été intégrée dans le DSRP II. La
mise en oeuvre de cette stratégie permettra la mise en place des systèmes de prévention et de
gestion des risques efficace et élargie qui auraient permis d'éviter ce basculement quand
interviennent ces chocs et de création de nouveaux pauvres notamment pour les acteurs du
secteur informel. En effet, les dispositifs formels de protection sociale existants, basés sur la
couverture des fonctionnaires et autres salariés contre les risques (constitués par la sécurité
sociale couvrent moins de 20% de la population et ne concernent que les branches santé, retraite,



                                                     57

prestations familiales. Ainsi, une grande majorité de la population (secteur informel, secteur
rural, journaliers et catégories sociales vulnérables) n'est pas couverte par ces dispositifs formels
et font le plus souvent recours aux systèmes dits traditionnels de solidarité et/ou à des systèmes
alternatifs comme (i) les systèmes d'assurances santé, (ii) les assurances gérées par les
Institutions de Micro Finances, (iii) les assurances gérées par les coopératives, (iv) les Mutuelles
de santé communautaires.

II - COMMENTAIRES GENERAUX SUR LE RAPPORT
16. Ce bilan sommaire des progrès réalisés par le Sénégal au cours de ces dernières années
montre que les résultats consignés dans le rapport sont en ligne avec notre analyse. Egalement
nous partageons globalement les principales leçons tirées dans le document dont certaines
d'entre elles font déjà de mise oeuvre. Le Sénégal a réalisé au cours de l'année 2007 un important
progrès en matière de coordination des appuis budgétaires, en signant avec sept (07) partenaires
techniques et financiers un Arrangement Cadre des Appuis Budgétaires (ACAB) avec une
matrice de mesures communes. Il a également adopté un plan d'action portant sur
l'harmonisation et l'efficacité de l'aide, et institué la réalisation d'une revue annuelle conjointe
du DSRP basée sur un processus largement participatif et transparent afin de mesurer les progrès
réalisés et les mesures correctrices à apporter. Cette revue vient consolider la qualité du dialogue
politique entre acteurs qui a été redynamisée depuis la tenue de la dernière réunion du groupe
consultatif d'octobre 2007. Depuis lors, des rencontres trimestrielles présidées par le Chef du
Gouvernement sont tenues régulièrement. Par ailleurs, le Sénégal a signé avec le Fond Monétaire
International un programme sur la période 2007-2010 au titre de l'Instrument de Soutien à la
Politique Economique (ISPE) dont la première revue a été jugée concluante par le Conseil
d'Administration du FMI en juin 2008.

17. Afin de consolider tous les progrès réalisés jusqu'ici et d'avancer dans la mise en oeuvre de la
Déclaration de Paris, le Gouvernement pense que l'appui budgétaire est l'instrument idéal et
privilégié. Le CSRP ainsi que les appuis budgétaires des autres partenaires démontre clairement
que cet instrument est plus cohérent avec les instruments, reformes et procédures nationaux et
plus apte à produire des résultats soutenables dans le temps. Par conséquent, nous pensons que le
CSRP qui a joué un rôle de propulseur, devrait davantage jouer un rôle de catalyseur dans
transition des autres partenaires vers l'appui budgétaire. Pour cela, le CSRP devrait être renforcé,
notamment par l'inclusion d'autres secteurs déjà bien structurés.
