improved range\n            and cattle management systems on about 100 ranches to be\n            developed on tribal land zoned as commercial; (ii) seek new\n            technologies to benefit small livestock owners through\n            developing about fourteen grazing units on tribal lands\n            zoned as communal for testing alternative grazing systems\n            and provide support for small communal schemes in these\n            areas; (iii) promote more efficient marketing of livestock\n            through constructing new and improving existing trek routes,\n            improving rail handling facilities, and constructing holding\n            grounds for small stock; and (iv) strengthen institutions\n            serving livestock development programs. About 1,000\n            individuals in tribal areas are expected to benefit from the\n            ranch development and a much larger number, over 3,500\n            individuals, will benefit from the communal grazing units\n            and the improvement of the marketing infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1977-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
