The ranches\n            would be located in a thinly populated area with a high\n            potential for beef cattle production and close to\n            Tananarive, the capital and largest consuming center. One of\n            the ranches would engage in breeding imported Brahman bulls\n            for improvement of local cattle and would serve as a center\n            for the production and distribution of legume seed for\n            native grassland improvement. The proposed project would\n            also upgrade access trails to the ranches and improve main\n            stock routes by providing water points and feeding\n            facilities. Provision is also made in the proposed project\n            for administrative and management services."}, "docdt": "1969-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
