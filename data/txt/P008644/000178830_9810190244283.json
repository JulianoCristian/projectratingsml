The credit line would be channeled\n            through participating financial intermediaries to support\n            investment and rehabilitation programs of textile\n            enterprises for strengthening their productivity and\n            competitiveness.

The\n            project faces moderate risks associated with possible slow\n            utilization of the credit line and lower than expected\n            returns from the enterprise-specific restructuring programs.\n            Appropriate incentives have been introduced to maintain the\n            interest of the participating financial institutions and as\n            well as measures to strengthen the appraisal and support\n            capacities of the financial and technical institutions\n            serving the textile sector.
