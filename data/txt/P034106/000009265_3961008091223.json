           Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project are to: 1)\n            create new temporary employment opportunities in rapidly\n            growing urban and peri-urban areas; 2) help municipalities\n            create or rehabilitate basic, urgent infrastructure assets;\n            and 3) develop municipal capacity to manage these assets and\n            help the Ministry of Interior, Posts, and Telecommunications\n            (MOI) to play its tutorship role. The project will have two\n            components: 1) a program of poverty-oriented,\n            labor-intensive works sub-projects which will fall into the\n            following categories: (a) economic infrastructure projects;\n            (b) social infrastructure projects; (c) municipal\n            income-generating projects; and (d) municipal management\n            projects; and 2) capacity building (pilot decentralization)\n            including: (a) infrastructure planning and urban space\n            management; (b) management reform; (c) training of municipal\n            staff and elected officials; (d) capacity strengthening of\n            the Directorale of Local Government of MOI (DCL), the\n            Decentralization Technical Coordination Committee (DTCC),\n            and the Association of Mayors; and (e) reform of the legal\n            and regulatory municipal framework."}, "docdt": "1996-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
