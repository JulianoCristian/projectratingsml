INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT

EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A
COCOA PROJECT IN WESTERN STATE
April 15, 1971



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENIDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A COCOA PROJECT IN WESTERN STATE
I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US
$7.2 million to the Federal Republic of Nigeria to assist in financ-
ing a project for the expansion and improvement of cocoa production in
Western State of Nigeria.
PART I - HISTORICAL
1.        The proposed loan would be the Bank Group's first operation
for agriculture in Nigeria.
2.        In late 1964 the Bank appraised a project for the expansion
and improvement of cocoa production in the then Western Region of
Nigeria.   Although negotiations took place early in 1965, the pro-
posed loan was not made because of the outbreak of disturbances culmin-
ating in the civil war which ended in January 1970.
3.        Following constitutional changes in 1968 which resulted in
the creation of 12 States in place of 4 regions, the former Western
Region became Western State except for a small area along the coast
which was incorporated into the newly formed Lagos State.   Western
State was directly affected only slightly by the war and the Government
decided to proceed with the cocoa project.   Progress, however, was
limited by severe shortages of funds and staff.
4.        In 1968 the Bank was asked to consider an enlarged project
and a pre-appraisal mission visited Nigeria in April 1969.  After
further preparation by Western State, the project was appraised in March,
1970.
5.        Negotiations were held in Washington in January 1971.   The
Federal Government was led by Mr. J.A. Adeyeye, Deputy Secretary,
MIinistry of Finance. The Western State Government delegation was led
by Mr. J.O. Akinwolemiwa, Chief Planning Officer, Ministry of Agriculture
and National Resources.
6.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and
IDA credits to Nigeria as of March 31, 1971.

Report covering the Rehabilitation Program Loan (P-911, dated April 2,
1971) which is due to be considered by the Executive Directors on
April 20, 1971.   There have been no substantial changes since that
time.    The same Report also sunmarizes the Bank Group's lending and
other activities proposed for the coming xonths; including the
agricultural sector mission which is now in the field.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
8.        Borrower:                  Federal Republic of Nigeria.
Beneficiary:               Western State of Nigeria.
Amount:                    US $7.2 million equivalent in
various currencies.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        An appraisal report entitled 'Western State Cocoa Project"
(PA-69a dated April 6, 1971) is attached.
10.       Nigeria is the world's second largest producer of cocoa
and over the last ten years has produced 17 percent of world output.
Cocoa has represented about 18% of Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings
and 95 percent of it has been produced in Western State.
11.       High producer prices resulted in considerable planting in
the 1950's.   This planting and effective pest and disease control
resulted in increased production in the early 1960's.   Production
since the mid-1960's has been relatively stable, reflecting consid-
erably reduced world and producer prices, poor husbandry, few new
plantings and neglect of existing plantations during the civil war.
Some 70 percent of the cocoa trees are now more than 30 years old and
a substantial decline in yields can be expected unless new planting
and replanting schemes are instituted.
12.       In its Second National Development Plan 1970/74, Nigeria
has accorded high priority to agriculture which accounts for over
50 percent of its GDP and employg about 80 percent of the working
population.   Some 350,000 farmers grow cocoa in Western State on
small holdings averaging about 3.5 acres.   In order to retain
Nigeria's share of the world cocoa market, both the Federal and the
Western State Governments recognise the need to offer inducements to
encourage substantial new plantings and replantings by small-holders.
The proposed project is designed to help achieve these objectives by
providing farmers with credit, subsidising the cost of improved
seedlings, pesticides and fertilizers and increasing producer prices.
13.       The producer price paid to farmers is set annually by the
Western Nigeria Marketing Board (4NNMB), subject to the approval of
Western State Executive Council and the Federal Ministry of Finance.
For 1968/69 this price was set at £N100/long ton, increased to £NY1O
for 1969/70 and further increased to £N155 for 1970/71.   Iihen the
1970/71 price was set the world market price of cocoa was equivalent
to about £H262/long ton but in recent weeks it has fallen to around



- 4 -
£N220.   Even at current market prices a producer price of £N155
provides a contribution to Western State Government revenues and
a trading surplus for WZ,MB, which, although much less than in the
past, is still substantial.   A reduction of the producer price
to an average level of the past decade, say £NllO/long tonwould
still enable farmers to service their loans and provide them with
a reasonable return.
14.         The Project, which would be the first stage of a pro-
gram to rehabilitate cocoa production in the Western State of
Nigeria, consists of the planting of about 16,500 acres of new
cocoa and the replanting of about 27,000 acres currently under old
cocoa trees producing uneconomic yields.
15.         A Project Unit, responsible to the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Natural Resources of Western State, would be established
to administer the project and conduct soil surveys.   Some 450
agricultural superintendents, agricultural assistants and special
labourers would be trained in modern cocoa production techniques
with the assistance and cooperation of the Cocoa Research Institute
of Nigeria which is located in Western State.
16.         The approximately 8,000 participating farmers would
receive credits in cash and in kind for labour, seedlings, fertil-
izers and pesticides directly from the Project Unit.
17.         The project would also include provision of vehicles
and equipment required to prepare a project for a second stage of
Western State's cocoa rehabilitation program.
18.         The estimated cost of the project (excluding interest
on the Bank loan) is $10.4 million, of which $3.37 million would be
the foreign exchange cost.   In addition, Western State Government
would have to spend a further £N 1.5 million ($4.2 million) over three
years after completion of the five year development period, to bring
the last acreage planted under the project to maturity.
19.         The proposed loan of $7.2 million would cover the whole
foreign exchange cost, $1.26 million interest on the loan and $2.57
million of local expenditures.   The balance of local expenditures
($4.5 million) would be provided by liestern State.
20.         The Federal Government would re-lend the proceeds of the
proposed loan to the Western State Government on the same terms as
the Bank loan, the Federal Government bearing the foreign exchange
risk.



21.         Loans to farmers would total about $4.5 million.    Those
planting 4 acres of new cocoa would receive credit equivalent to $450
and those replanting 4 acres would receive the equivalent of $485.
Loans would be at an interest rate of 95 percent and repayments would
be made through the Cooperative and Investment Trust Society Limited
which would repay Western State Government the capital element of all
repayments as they are received, together with interest at the rate
of 7¼< percent per annum.  The 2 percent differential would be re-
tained by the Cooperative Trust to cover its services and credit risks.
All participating farmers would be required to be members of cooperative
marketing societies and loans would be secured by deductions by the
cooperative societies from the proceeds of farmers' cocoa sales.
22.         Vehicles, tractors, spraying machines, tools, fertilizers
and insecticides valued at $2.4 million would be procured through
international competitive bidding procedures.    Other purchases,
amounting to about $0.9 million, not suitable for international com-
petitive bidding, would be subject to local competitive bidding in
accordance with established procedures which are satisfactory to the
Bank.
23.         The project is justified by the economic and financial
benefits to be derived from the additional cocoa production and by
the benefits accruing from improved administration, agricultural
techniques, training and credit.   By 1985, when the project plantings
would be in full production, incremental annual output is estimated at
15,000 long tons (0.1% of world cocoa trade) which, at a projected
average world price of $0.27 per pound spot N.Y., would provide about
$9.1 million in foreign exchange ($7.7 million net).
24.         Even on an assumed producer price of £NllO/long ton, and
after loan repayment, the net income of the 8,000 participating farmers
would be at least doubled.   The financial rate of return on investment
to farmers engaged in new planting would be 32 percent calculated over
a 25 year project life, and for replantings, the rate would be 20 per-
cent.   Based upon current export duties, sales taxes and marketing board
surpluses, the government would recover its investment by 1984 and over
the 25 year project life would earn an estimated total cash surplus of
about $20 million equivalent, representing a yield of about 10.6 percent
on its own contribution.
25.         Historically, cocoa prices have fluctuated widely over re-
latively short periods and long-term forecasts have to be regarded with
some caution.   Current forecasts suggest a long-term equilibrium price
ranging from 25 to 30 cents a pound, spot N.Y.   At a price of 27 cents,
the return to the economy would be 17 percent if the opportunity cost
of farmers' family labour is taken at zero or 14 percent if it is valued
at 3s/6d per day, per head.   If prices fell to the lowest level of the
projected range (US $0.25/lb) and yields declined by 10 percent the rate
of return would be 13 percent at zero farm family labour cost, or 10 per-
cent at 3s/6d per day.

26.        The existing cooperative structure would be considerably
strengthened by its involvement in the administration of the credit
extended to farmers.   The establishment of a Project Unit and the
training of extension workers would be of particular value in connec-
tion with the second and larger phase of the cocoa rehabilitation
program which the Government proposes to develop from the studies and
surveys to be carried out as part of this project.
27.        In view of the relatively low foreign exchange component
in the project, the Bank has to include in its financing some local
expenditure if it is to make a significant contribution to the im-
provement of cocoa growing and marketing.   In addition to providing
funds for planting and replanting, the project could help bring about
significant improvements in farming practices and in the organisation
of cocoa farmers in cooperatives, changes which are necessary for the
success of the current project and which will provide the basis for
cocoa rehabilitation programs in the future.   The project has been
reviewed by FAO's Study Group on Cocoa which has expressed its support.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AID AUTHORITY
28.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of
Nigeria and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank
and the Wlestern State of Nigeria, the Report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agree-
ment and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
29.        The draft Loan and Project Agreements follow the pattern
of loan agreements for similar agricultural projects.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
30.        A report entitled "The Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Nigeria" (AW-22a) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on January 29, 1971.
31.        The Report and Reconmendation of the President on the
Rehabilitation Program Loan due to be considered by the Executive
Directors on April 20, 1971 contains a brief recent analysis of
Nigeriats current position and prospects. It confirmed that
Nigeriats foreign requirements for foreign capital remain large and
that Nigeria is creditworthy for substantial borrowings on convention-
al terms even though much of its borrowing should be on more con-
cessional terms.

PART VI - COMIPLIANCE IITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMET
32.        I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMI"fl DATION
33.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed Loan.
