WESTERN STATE COCOA PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i,        This report appraises a project for the expansion and improvement
of the cocoa production industry in the Western State of Nigeria, for which
a Bank loan of US$7.2 million equivalent is proposed. The project is de-
signed to serve as a pattern for the continued development of both the
Western State cocoa industry and of other cocoa producing States.  It would
be the Bank group's first agricultural lending operation in Nigeria. The
Western State produces about 95% of Nigeria's total cocoa production, which
during the period 1958-69 contributed about 18% of Nigeria's foreign ex-
change earnings. With the rapid increase in petroleum exports from Nigeria,
cocoa's share in total exports will decrease. However, the Western State's
ability to raise resources for development will remain heavily dependent
upon cocoa exports, although due to large areas of over age cocoa, it is
probable that in future production will decline. The proposed project would
reverse this trend by introducing a balanced program of replanting old cocoa
farms producing sub-economic yields, and planting up new land suitable for
cocoa cultivation which exists in the east of the State.
ii.       The project includes two main components:  the on-lending of
US$4.52 million equivalent through the Cooperative Investment and Trust
Society Ltd. to farmers; US$1.46 million for the planting of 16,500 acres
with high yielding cocoa varieties, and US$3.06 million for the replanting
of 27,000 acres of old low yielding cocoa farms with the same varieties.
All project farmers, totalling about 8,000, wotuld he members of cocoa market-
ing cooperatives, through which loan repayments would be secured. The
project would provide also an improved cocoa extension service, staff train-
ing, soil survev, and the equipment required to prepare an investment project
for a second stage of the Western State's cocoa rehabilitation program,
costing USS5.91 million.
iii.      Pro½oct farmers would receive loans of pn to Ni 40/acre at 9-1/4%'
to be repni( over 12 years, for new plantinR and up to NM. 43f/acre at 9-1/47
over 15 vears for replanting.  Farmers' repayments would average 40% of
their irross tncomes from project assisted new plantings and repl-antings,
and thoir annual net cash Incomes in the Period following loan repayment
would be for new planting, about N+. 28/acre, compared with about 'NE 12/acre
on existing farms, and for replanting, about NE, 23/acre compared with about
NE 7/arre on existing farms.  Total incremental cocoa production at maturity
would be ahout 15,000 tons/annum, abouit 0.1% of world trade in this crop,
which would earn about US$7.7 million net in foroign exchange, at a projected
world price of US 27 cents/lb, Spot New York.
iv.       Project costs are estimated at UV1l.7 million equivalent.  The
proposed loan of IJS$7.2 mill.ion wouldl finance 62% of project costs, covering
the foreign exchange costs which, including I-ank loan Interest over 6 years,
are estimated at IJSS4.0 million (407 of total proiect cost), and IJS$2.6



- ii -
million (37%) of local currency costs. Where practical, project procurement
would be by international competitive bfdding; goods and services obtained
in this way would have an estimated value of US$2.44 million. Local competi-
tive bidding would be used to obtain goods and services with a total
value of about US$2.5 million. The remaining project costs consisting
mainly of hired labor, planting materials and staff salaries would not be
suitable for competitive bidding.
v.        The project would be implemented by a project unit established
especially for the purpose within the State Ministry of Agriculture,
and which would maintain separate project accounts.  A project steering
committee would be appointed to coordinate the work of other agencies
concerned with the project and to oversee project progress. The studies
precedent to the preparation of a further investment project would be
carried out by the Planning Division of the Ministry of Agriculture.
vi.       The project would make a significant contribution to the
Western State's foreign exchange earnings, it would begin an improvement
of the Nigerian cocoa industry, it would increase the incomes of some
8,000 farmers and it would assist the development of small farmer credit
facilities by supporting the Cooperative Investment and Trust Society Ltd.,
a well established and financially sound institution. Based on the current
forecast range of long-term cocoa prices, the estimated rate of return from
investment in the project is estimated at 17%. A sensitivity analysis shows
that if prices were to fall to the lowest level of the predicted range
(25 cents/lb), and if at the same time yields were reduced by 10%, the
return would be 13%.
vii.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$7.2 million equiva-
lent, for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 6 years.



NIGERIA
WESTERN STATE COCOA PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Federal Government of Nigeria 1/ has requested a Bank loan to
assist in financing a cocoa project in the Western State.
1.02      This report describes a project which would assist farmers by
providing credit for the planting of new farms, and for the replanting of
old low-yielding farms. The project would include also the training of
extension staff, and the strengthening of cooperative societies and the
Cooperative Bank. It would serve as a pattern for the continued improvement
of the State's cocoa production industry.
1.03      A similar project was prepared by the Western State Ministry of
Agriculture in 1964 and appraised by the Bank in November 1964. Negotia-
tions for the proposed loan of US$4.6 million were held in Lagos in early
1965, but following the outbreak of civil war, the proposed loan was not
submitted to the Board. In 1968, Government requested the Bank to recon-
sider a similar but larger project. This report is based on the findings
of a Bank appraisal mission, composed of Messrs. A. Denness, P. Th. Grosjean
and M. El Moghazi (PMWA), which visited. the Western State in February/March
1970.
1.04      The project would be the Bank group's first lending for agri-
cultural development in Nigeria.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      The 12-State Federal Republic of Nigeria has a total area of
about 357,000 sq miles, and a population in 1970, estimated by the Federal
Government to be about 66 million. It is predominantly an agricultural
country, the agricultural sector accounting for about 55% of GDP, and
providing employment for about 80% of the working population. The main
export crops are cocoa, groundnuts, groundnut oil and cake, palm oil
and kernels, and rubber; and in 1968 - the last year for which data are
available - they contributed about 58% of total exports; cocoa alone
contributed 25%, valued at NE 52 million (US$146 million).
2.02      The Western State, with a population of about 10 million people,
lies between latitudes 6° and 9' and longitude 2' and 4', and comprises
about 30,000 sq miles. Within the State there is considerable climatic

variation, rainfall varying from 45 inches In the northwestern savannah
zone to over 100 inches In the southeastern forest zone.
2.03      The forest zone consists of swamp and rain forest, and produces
rubber, cocoa, kola, palm produce, citrus, robusta coffee and timber for
local use and export.  Food crops are also produced, but the population is
heavily dependent upon food from the savannah zone, which comprises about
35% of the State. This latter zone is well suited to the production of
arable crops, such as yams, maize, sorghum, rice, tobacco and cotton
and also has an important potential for livestock production.
III. THE COCOA INDUSTRY
A. Background
3.01      Nigeria is the world's second largest producer of cocoa after
Ghana. Annual production in 1958-70 averaged about 210,000 tons. During
this period cocoa exports averaged 18% of Nigeria's total foreign exchange
earnings. The Western State produces about 95% of Nigeria's cocoa. Apart
from a few large farms, the State's 1.2 million acres of cocoa are grown on
small-holdings. Yields average about 350 lb/ac, but large variations result
from differences in management, soils and climatic conditions (Table 3 and
4 of Annex 8 give details of Nigerian and World Cocoa production).
3.02      Nigerian cocoa production remained relatively constant at about
100,000 tons annually in the 1946-56 period. Thereafter production increased
steadily, reaching a peak of 294,000 tons in the 1964/65 season. That peak
was not regained until the 1970/71 season when excellent growing conditions
resulted in a record crop of about 310,000 tons, and in the five years
1966-70 annual production averaged only about 200,000 tons. The reasons
for the climb in production up to 1964/65 are well established; large areas
of cocoa were planted in the 1950's in response to good producer prices, and
in the late 1950's, Government introduced extremely effective pest and
disease control programs.
3.03      Due to lower world prices, and the practice in Nigeria of
requiring growers to market their cocoa through a Government Marketing
Board empowered to accumulate price support reserves (see para 3.12),
producer prices since 1961 have been inadequate to induce new planting
on anything like the scale of the 1950's. Consequently, while there is no
accurate data, it is probable that the productive acreage of cocoa in
the State has remained more-or-less static over the last six years, with
new plantings being compensated for by old cocoa being abandoned due to
low yields. Government cocoa survey records show that about 70% of the State's
cocoa is over 30 years old, and that extensive areas have been abandoned be-
cause with increasing age of the trees, falling yields have made farm msin-
tenance uneconomic. While a continuation of the 1970/71 producer price of
NE 155/ton may encourage farmers to continue and improve the upkeep of low
yielding farms, it is not clear whether a producer price of this magnitude
alone would induce a significant amount of either new planting or replanting.
The heavy plantings in the 1950's were made at a time when producer prices
ranged between NE6 150 and NE, 200/ton. Since that time there has been



appreciable inflation and labor costs alone have more than trebled; and
consequently the stimulus to plant cocoa is appreciably less than it was
15-20 years ago, even at the present producer price of NE 155/ton.
Furthermore, land suitable for new planting is much less readily available.
Most of this is in the east of thie State, and while in the 1950's much new
land was opened up in these areas, a large proportion of new planting was
carried out also in areas in the center, south and west, where cocoa has been
grown since the turn of the century; and where today almost all the land
suitable for the crop has been planted. Consequently there are now far
fewer farmers with land on which to plant cocoa even if the inducement to
do so exists.
3.04      Current Government cocoa policy, within the framework of which
this project has been prepared, is aimed at retaining Nigeria's share of
the expanding world market through increased cocoa production in the tradi-
tional cocoa growing areas where cocoa production makes the optimum use of
ecological conditions and farmers' experience. The policy is based on
the premise that a substantial degree of Government assistance will be
necessary to induce the levels of new planting and replanting necessary
to counteract the declining yield of aging cocoa. It is proposed to
provide such assistance in two ways:
(a) provide credits to farmers for new planting and to
replant old, low yielding cocoa; and
(b) subsidize the cost of pesticides, improved varieties
and fertilizers.
While some credits have been issued since 1965 the supply of funds has
been inadequate to sustain a well organized program; supervision has been
inadequate and results in terms of increased production have been small. The
subsidy scheme for cocoa pesticides, on the other hand, has worked very well,
and has been the princi,pal means of maintaining production in recent years.
3.05      The subsidy scheme for cocoa pesticides and fertilizers costs
about NE 540,000 (USS1.5 million) annuallv, and Government justifies these
subsidies on the grounds that (a) in the past cocoa producers have received
prices for tncer crop substantially below those that world prices justified,
and that suirptises accruiing to the Western Nigerian Marketing Board (WNMB)
in this way were not used to support prices, but rather employed for the
development of other sectors of the economy, and (b) that while in future
the proportion of the werld price paid to the producer may be raised, it is
the Government's intent>ln to retain this means of indirect taxation.  It
can be argued that aban(louling the Marketing Board system and its associated
indirect taxation woald allow farmers' incomes adequate to insure satisfactory
levels of farm maintenance, new planting, and replanting, without the aidl
of subsidlies.  Trading surnluses budgeted for by the Western State Marketing
Board, however, form an Important part of the States' annual revenues, and
the Government's need for stich cocoa revenuies will remain for some time to
come. Consequiently the policv ot- subsidizing cocoa pesticides and
fertilizers will nsed to continue if these inputs are to have a significant
impnct on production.
3.06      Government intends to continue sutbsidizing cocoa pesticides and
fertlilzers and for the purposes of this report it is assumed that project



- 4 --
oarticipants would continue to henef it f rom these arrangements.  Durifng
negotiations, assurances were obtaiTried f ron thr Governreunt that exilsting
subsidies for insecti.ides, fuunpic hiels an4; ft-rt  lizers wotil d iot be reduce(d
without prior ronsill.t ;tion wi th th{ Bank   i Tf the Riank were to finance a
larger project in the future, it might require a say ii pritc  poilicy
decisions which is not Justified for ttks proje(t in view of its relatively
small size (see 7.07).
B. Prodtucer Price
3.07      The producer price is set by WNMB in advance of each harvest
season.  Normally, rhe orice established Is one which will allow WNMB to
generate a trading surplus which is used to support Government expenditures
in other sectors.  Thus, in ]9h0/7(0, the price set by WNMB of NE 150/ton
was estimated to vield v direct Covernment reveniue of about NE 56/ton from
export and other taxes and a Marketing Boardl trading surplus of about NE 22/
ton (see Annex 8, Table i).
3.08      While it is Government's intention to maintain this type of price
structuring, the current producer price of N6 155 for the 1970/71 season cannot
be maintained if the world price falls to the Nb 216/ton (US 27U/lb), as
forecast by the Bank's Economic Department, because at this price level and
with existing operating costs and export duty policies, WNMB would sustain
trading deficits.
3.09      For the purpose of this report, a producer price of NE 110/ton
(US$13.75/lb) has been assumed, since at this price WNMB would be able to
continue the level of financial assistance to the State Government which it
was able to provide over the past five years. On the other hand, it is
extremely unlikely that the producer price will fall to NE 110/ton, since
in recent years cocoa farmers have shown themselves capable of influencing
Government policies, and Government would probably prefer to reduce its
budgetary reliance on WNMB surpluses before reducing the producer price to
such a low level. Consequently, NE 110/ton is considered the minimum level
to which the producer price would fall, and as described in paras 8.09 and
8.10, at this price level project farmers would be able to repay their new
planting and replanting loans and retain a satisfactory income.
C. Institutions
3.10      Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR):  The State
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources assists farmers through six
divisions of the Ministry. These are Agricultural Extension Services,
Agricultural Research, Fisheries, Veterinary, Forestr'  and Produce Inspec-
tion. Cocoa research, the responsibility of the Federal Government, is
maintained at a high level at the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria (CRIN)
and has produced valuable new techniques and new cocoa varieties for farmers'
use. However, through lack of funds and unsatisfactory organization, the
Agricultural Extension Service is finding it difficult to disseminate new



- 5 -
varieties and knowledge effectively, either in the case of cocoa or other
crops. If agriculture is to develop at the required pace, a switch must
be made from the present system of producing general extension services
only, to the preparation and implementation of projects which provide
farmers with a package of requisites: extension, inputs and credit. The
most effective use of available resources can be made only in this way.
3.11      Cocoa Marketing Cooperatives have existed in Nigeria since 1930
and have proven generally successful. The basic unit of the cooperative
system is the primary society which operates at village level. The apex
organization is the Association of Nigerian Cooperative Exporters (ANCE).
It is Government policy that the cooperative movement should be assisted
and encouraged to expand in the agricultural sector. Further details on
Cooperatives are given in Annex 6.
3.12      The Western Nigeria Marketing Board (WNMB), reorganized under
the Western Region Marketing Board Law of 1954, is charged with marketing
the State's main export crops, fixing cocoa and other producer prices
annually, and accumulating operating surpluses to support producer prices
at times of low world prices, (Annex 8 gives details of WNMB's activities
and organization). WNMB operates through more than 290 cocoa licensed
buying agents (LBAs) who are responsible for the purchase, grading, storage
and evacuation of produce to port of shipment. Twenty-three LBAs are
cooperative unions which purchase from primary cooperative societies about
17% of the State's total cocoa production. Farmers receive a producer price
for cocoa, at present Nt 146 (US$420)/ton, which is fixed prior to the
start of each season by WNMB with the approval of the Federal Ministry of
Finance and the State Government Executive Council. LBAs receive a fixed
allowance from WNMB to cover bagging, handling and storage, overheads and
profits. Details of LBA functions and allowances are given in Annex 8.
3.13      The Produce Inspection Division (PID) of the State Ministry of
Agriculture is responsible by law for maintaining the quality of all crop
exports. For its cocoa work, PID is financed by a levy of NE 1.5/ton
of cocoa exported. PID ensures that all cocoa is of exportable quality
when handed over for shipment. A further quality check is made at a point
immediately prior to shipment by the Federal Produce Inspection Service.
About 997 of all cocoa exported from Nigeria is Grade I and there have
been onlv minor complaints from overseas buyers concerniing the declared
quality of cocoa.
3.14      The Ni erian Produce Marketing Company Limited (NPMC), a non-
profit marketing agency for all State Marketing Boards, is responsible
for the export and sale of all produce purchased by its member Boards.
NPMC collects sale proceeds, pays export duty and port, shipping and handling
charges, and remits the balance of proceeds, less its operating and handiling
charges, to the respective marketing boards. Almost all cocoa is sold by
private contract for future deliverv, usually tip to six to nine months in
advance. These arrangements work satisfactorily. Details on NPMC are given
in Annex 8.



- 6 -
3.15      The Cooperative Investment and Trust Society, Ltd. (Cooperative
Trust?, together with its subsidiary holding, the Cooperative Bank of
Western Nigeria, was establis shed to prov Ltie the cooperative movement
with commercial hanking services, the provision of seasonal production
loans to cooperative society members, and seasonal cocoa pturchastng loans
to Cooperative Unions. The Trust and the Cooperative Bank are well-
managed and organized and their debt recovery has been satisfactory;
they have no overdue long-term loans or seasonal loans overdue for more
than two years. They have the full confidence of the cooperative movement
and other financial institutions in Nigeria. During the politically
agitated period, following Independence, they maintained satisfactory
banking standards and preserved their financial and economic decisions
from direct political influences. The Government intends thaL both the
Trust and the Cooperative Bank should expand their activities and play
a major role in providing agricultural credit, especially to small scale
farmers. In view of their past performance, the Trust assisted by the
Cooperative Bank, would provide a satisfactory channel for loans to project
participants. Details of the Trust and Cooperative Bank, together with
balance sheets and financial statements, are given in Annex 7.
IV. THE PROJECT AREA
4.01      The project area would comprise suitable cocoa production areas
within the Abeokuta, Ibadan, Oyo, Ondo, and Ijebu Provinces (see Map).
Within these areas climatic and soil conditions are well suited to cocoa
production and although Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (SSVD, see Annex 5),
is endemic, the strains of the virus are not as virulent as those found
in Ghana. SSVD control policy is as follows:
1.   in two areas- designated areas of mass infection
(AMI) - one near Ibadan containing about 100,000
acres of cocoa and the other near Ilaro with about
25,000 acres of cocoa (see Map), no control
measures are practiced, since control would mean
cutting out the bulk of the cocoa and the economy
of these areas would be completely disrupted. Some
of the best cocoa soils available are inside the
AMI and suitable techniques would be used for
project replanting made within the AMI (see Annex 5).
2.   all other cocoa areas are subject to a regular
survey to locate SSVD outbreaks. Where outbreaks
are identified, the diseased trees and their contacts
are uprooted, mandatorily, and the grower compensated.
4.02      Age of Cocoa Farms:  Ministry of Agriculture surveys show that
cocoa yields are declining on about 750,000 acres of over age cocoa; and
that of this acreage, about 60% is on soils capable of providing suffi-
ciently high yields to make cocoa growing profitable. This 60% is con-
centrated in the older, traditional cocoa producing areas of Ibadan and



- 7 -
Abeokuta provinces and where the majority of good cocoa soils have been
planted with the crop.
4.03      Land Use and Farm Size:  Ministry of Agriculture surveys show
about 1,200,000 acres of cocoa in the state of which more than 90% lies
in the project area. The number of individually owned holdings is unknown,
and while the majority of the state's 350,000 cocoa farmers - about 60% -
farm about 1-1/2 acres each, this group produces only about 20% of total
cocoa production. The bulk of production comes from holdings in the 3 to
20 acre range.
4.04      Labor Requirements:  Farm labor requirements vary, but on a
typical farm in the cocoa belt, cocoa competes with food crops for avail-
able labor. Peak labor requirements for both cocoa and food crops occur
during the period May to August, and while family labor can manage all
operations during the slack season, they can only supply about half of
what is required during the peak season. Hired labor, particularly that
moving in from outside the cocoa producing areas, from the savannah zone
and the Northern States, is essential to cocoa farmers in the project
area, especially those whose holdings exceed 2 to 3 acres. The return
per acre affects the amount of labor used on a cocoa farm, and the use of
new varieties, fertilizers and improved disease and pest controls, would
enable farmers to offer wages sufficiently attractive to ensure the required
supply of labor.
4.05      Credit Facilities:  In the past, credit facilities for cocoa
farmers have been provided by various Government agencies and the Coopera-
tive Organization. However, a successful combination of credit appraisal,
technical implementation and loan repayment has not yet been achieved.
4.06      Communications:  The project area is well served by major and
minor roads. Good roads and a railway line are available for evacuating
cocoa to the port of Lagos.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Description
5.01      The prolect would be the first stage of a program to rehabilitate
the Western State's cocoa industry and would be carried out over a five-
year investment period. The project would involve:
(a)  planting of up to 16,500 acres of new cocoa and
replanting up to 27,000 acres on which cocoa is
senescent and yielding at sub-economic levels,
with improved high yielding cocoa varieties.
These programs would be carried out through pro-
viding cocoa farmers with credits for new planting
and replanting; labor and pesticidles, fertilizers
and improved planting materials:



- 8-
(b) establishing a project administration responsible to
the Ministry of Agriculture to manage the project;
(c) training project staff in modern cocoa production
techniques;
(d)  providing the vehicles and equipment required by
the Government to prepare in detail an investment
project for a second stage of the State cocoa re-
habilitation program, and the studies precedent to
this.
B. Field Development
5.03      The project would be phased as follows:
1971/72  1972/73  1973/74  1974/75  1975/76

Planting           -      6,000    6,000    6,000    9,000
New planting and replanting would be phased to coincide with the establish-
ment of the project unit, and year 1 would be devoted largely to constructing
project facilities, purchasing equipment, soil surveying participants' farms,
planting plantain as temporary shade on areas to be replanted, and establishing
cocoa seedling nurseries for the plantings planned for year 2. First new
plantings and replantings made under the project would come into production
in year 5.  Further details of project phasing are given in Annex 1.
New Planting and Replanting
5.04      Farmers carrying out new planting and replanting would receive
credits for crop establishment, fertilizers and capsid control. Crop
establishment credits would be provided in the form of cocoa seedlings pro-
duced by the project authority in centralized nurseries, and cash for part
of the labor required for farm development and maintenance until new plantings
are four years old and replanted farms three years old. Fertilizers would be
supplied for application in the first four years and thereafter farmers would
be able to obtain seasonal fertilizer credits from the Cooperative Bank.
For capsid control, credits would be in the form of insecticides.



- 9 -
5.05      Project Staff Training:  The Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria
(CRIN) would provide inservice training for project staff, through an
intensive two-week course covering modern methods of cocoa production. The
training of some 450 agricultural superintendents, agricultural assistants
and special laborers before beginning field operations would be partially
financed under the project. CRIN would also supply the services of its
cocoa specialists to the project unit as required.
5.06      Project Administration:  The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources (MANR) is responsible for all cocoa extension and development
work. However, it does not have the administrative or technical capacity
to carry out the project efficiently. Consequently, a Project Unit would
be established responsible to the MANR, and the Project Manager would report
directly to its Permanent Secretary. The project costs include funds to
finance the capital costs of establishing the Project Unit and its operating
costs during the project development period. Project farmers would be
required to own a spraying machine as a condition for receiving a credit.
The majority of farmers in the project area already own such machines. Those
who do not, and who apply for credits, would be able to purchase one from
the Project Unit, on credit terms if necessary.
5.07      Study for Stage II Project:  In addition to the areas of land
suitable for cocoa remaining unplanted in the Western State, large areas
require replanting with high yielding hybrids. Concurrently with the
project, the Government would carry out a study to determine the best way
of developing new and replantable areas, and would prepare one or more in-
vestment projects for their development. The project would provide funds
to finance the vehicles and equipment required to carry out the following
studies:
- an inventory of unused cocoa land in the Western
State, including soil surveys,
- a sample survey of the cocoa industry.
The terms of reference of the proposed studies, a draft outline of which
appears in Annex 10, were agreed with the Government during negotiations.
5.08      Soil Survey:  The project would provide for soil surveying of
applicants' farms. Surveying would be carried out by staff seconded from
the Agricultural Research Division of the MANR. During negotiations, assur-
ances were obtained from the Government that the necessary staff would
be seconded to the Project Unit.
VI. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Costs
6.01      Estimated project costs, including interest on the proposecd
Bank loan, would total Nt 4.16 million (US$11.65 million) of which the



- 10 -
foreign exchange component is about NE 1.65 million (US$4.63 million) or
40% of total costs. The breakdown of costs is detailed in Annex 2 and
summarized in the following table:

increases in Civil Service salaries, a 10% contingency on all items except
Bank loan interest, and exclude farm family labor to which a cash cost is not
attributed. Costs are based on Government salary and wage scales, up-
to-date building costs, recent quotations given by suppliers of vehicles,
materials, and farm input and farm labor requirements given by MANR and
local research organizations.

B. Proposed Financing
6.03      A loan of US$7.2 million would be made to the Federal Government
at the prevailing Bank rate for a term of 20 years including a grace period
of six years. The loan would be relent to the Western State Government
on the same terms. The proposed loan of US$7.2 million would be 62%
of the overall cost of the project. US$4.6 million, or 64% of the loan
would cover the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project. The
balance of US$2.60 million (36% of the loan) would finance 37% of local
currency costs. The size of the Bank contribution would be adequate
to ensure the satisfactory organization and execution of the project.
The Government contribution covering the remaining 38% of project costs,
would be made available from budgetary sources. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that all funds required for the
project would be made available in advance and in block form, on the basis
of quarterly estimates prepared by the project manager. If Government
required payment of import taxes on items included in project costs such
taxes should be added to Government's financial contribution to project
costs. In addition to the stated project cost, Government would have to
spend another NE 1.5 million (US$4.2 million) over 3 years after
completion of the five year project development period, to bring the last
acreage planted under the project to maturity. During negotiations
assurances were obtained from Government that it would maintain the required
extension staff and provide the same subsidies and services to the last
farmers as those provided to other farmers under the project.
6.04      The Western State Government would apply proceeds of the loan and
64% of its own contribution (NE 1.02 million (US$2.86 million) ) as follows:
(a) to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
an amount of NE 1.55 million (US$4.34 million) for
the project unit investment and operation, soil and
cocoa surveys and CRIN services;
(b) to selected sub-borrower farmers participating in the
new planting and replanting schemes through the
Cooperative Trust, NE 1.6 million (US$4.5 million) for
farm inputs and hired labor (details of subloans to
participating farmers are given in para 7.09); and
(c) against capitalized interest and commitment charges
on Bank loan, NEL 0.45 million (US$1.25 million).
The remaining 36% of the Western State's contribution or about NE 0.57 mil-
lion (US$1.60 million) would finance subsidies on farm inputs. Consequently,
the project would be financed as follows:

C. Procurement
6.05      Procurement of vehicles, tractors, spraying machines, tools, fer-
tilizers and insecticides valued at about US$2.44 million (NE 0.87 million)
would be through international competitive bidding. Other purchases,
amounting to about US$0.92 million (NL 0.33 million), would be subject to
local competitive bidding organized by the Project Manager in accordance with
established Government regulations which are satisfactory to the Bank. The
balance of project costs consisting mainly of labor hired by farmers, plant-
ing materials and staff salaries would not be procured by competitive bid-
ding.
D. Disbursement
6.06      Disbursement of the loan would be made against:



- 13 -
(a) - 80% of all loans made to farmers under the project,
about US$3.3 million (Nb 1.18 million);
- 100% of the CIF cost of directly imported vehicles,
sprayers, and cocoa survey equipment and experts'
services or 80% of the cost of these items if
locally procured, about US$0.79 million (NE 0.28
million);
(b) - 40% of building and equipment costs, and staff
salaries, totalling about US$1.25 million (NE 0.45
million); and
(c) capitalized interest for an estimated amount of US$1.25
million (Nb 0.45 million), directly charged by the Bank.
An unallocated amount of US$0.60 million (NE 0.23 million) would meet con-
tingencies on the above items. The breakdown of the proposed Bank loan in
categories is detailed in Annex 2, Table 10. Expenditures would be evidenced
by contracts, shipping documents and certified records of expenditures. Any
surplus loan amounts would be cancelled. The loan would be disbursed over
a five-year project development period and an additional nine months for
final settlement of project accounts. Estimated loan disbursements are de-
tailed in Annex 2, Table 9.
E. Accounts and Audits
6.07      Project accounts and records of disbursements made to individual
farmers would be maintained by the project unit, and farmers loan accounts
would be kept by the Cooperative Trust. Project unit accounts and those
Coonerative Trust accounts pertaining to the project would be audited annu-
ally by an independent auditor, mutually acceptable to Government and the
Bank. The auditing of cooperative societies accounts would continue to be
the responsibility of the Registrar of Cooperatives (see Annex 6, para 12).
Audited annual accounts of the project unit and the Cooperative Trust, and
balance sheets and loan accounts of the cooperatives involved in the
project, would be submitted to the Bank within four months of the closing
of the financial year. During negotiations, assurances to these effects
were obtained from the Government.
VTI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Organization
7.01      The project would be carried out by a project unlt responsible to
tihe Minlstrv of Agriculture and it would be a condition of effectiveness of
the loan that the unit, with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, had



- 14 -
been established. Overall project management and financial control would
be exercised from a prolect head office at Ibadan, thie Western State capital..
The unit would be staffed bv the followinp kev personnel: Projecrt Manager,
Deputy Project Manager, Financial Controller, Accountant ancl Senior Credit
Officer.  The Project Manager would be responsible to the Minlster of Agri-
culture, through his Permanent Secretarv.
7.02      Field management would be effected throuRh four main field offices
located at Ibadan, Ilesha, Abeokuta and Akure, each staffed by an agricultuiral
officer, clerk, typist, storekeeper and drivers. Each field office would
control a maximum of four, and a minimum of two operational units. Each
operational unit would include two Agricultural Superintendents (AS), 10
Agricultural Assistants (AA), and 30 Special Laborers (SL). These
arrangements would give a coverage of one Special Laborer to 40 farmers.
7.03      In addition to field management staff, the project unit would
maintain a field control unit at head office. Consisting of one Agricultu-
ral Officer and four Agricultural Superintendents, it would be responsible
to the Project Manager for random spot checking of project field operations.
7.04      The studies precedent to the preparation of a second stage invest-
ment project would be carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture's Planning
Division, which would appoint a senior member of its staff to be responsible
for coordinating field studies and investment project preparation, and for
reporting to the Bank. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government that the initial coordinator and his terms of reference
would be mutuallv acceptable to Government and the Bank. The appointment of
the coordinator and acceptance of the terms of reference by the Bank would
be a condition of disbursement of Bank funds against the studv components of
the project.
Project Coordinating Committee
7.05      A Project Coordinating Committee would be appointed to supervise
project progress and to coordiniate the work of the several agencies involved
in the cocoa industry. Under the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary
MANR, the committee would be made up of senior representatives of the Min-
istry of Agriculture, Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria, Cooperative
Department, Cooperative Trust, and the Ministries of Economic Planning, and
Finance, who would be of such seniority as to ensure the full support of the
departments and entities represented. The Project Manager would be the exe-
cutive secretary of the committee which would meet not less than every three
months. It would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan that
a committee with a membership and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank
had been established. A project organization chart is at Annex 5.
Cooperative and Marketing Organization
7.06      Membership in a cocoa marketing cooperative through which the
farmer would be obligated to sell his cocoa would be a prerequisite to par-
ticipation in the new planting and replanting schemes. The farmers would be
further obligated to remain a member of the cooperative until he had repaved



- 15 -
his loan in full (see para 7.13). Assurances to these effects were obtained
from Government during negotiations. A sufficient number of such societies
are firmly established, and operate efficiently. Thev operate principally
as cocoa buyers for the cooperative unions that are Licensed Buying Agents
(LBA) of the Western Nigeria Marketing Board (WNMB). Unions are paid a
buying allowance by the Board, of which they retain part to cover their own
operating expenses, the remainder being distributed to the primary societies
according to the volume of cocoa handled. The Cooperative Trust advances
funds to cooperative unions and primary societies for cocoa purchasing.
The system is satisfactorv and during negotiations assurances were obtained
from the Government that cooperative unions and societies involved in the
project would continue to receive the funds required for timely and effective
cocoa purchasing.
7.07      Cocoa marketing procedures continue to be subject to review and
change by the Federal and Western State Governments. Consequently, during
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Bank would be notified
promptly of any changes made in the existing cocoa marketing procedures,
cocoa producer prices, taxes on cocoa sales and cocoa export duties.
B. Location of Areas of Operation
7.08      Project operations would be located as follows:
-----------------------Provinces------------------
Abeokuta          lbadan         Oyo            Ondo

Replanting would be carried out within the Areas of Mass Infection (AMI) and
in disease free areas. Replanting within the AMI would require modified
techniques (see Annex 5), but is of great importance since the use of virus
tolerant varieties and the cutting out of old diseased trees could lead to
the eradication of SSVD in these areas. SSVD control outside the AMI, but
inside the project area, would continue to be carried out by the Ministrv
of Agriculture and assurances to this effect were obtained from the Gov-
ernment during negotiations.
C.  Credit Arngements and Terms of Subloans
7.09      Approved project farmers would be eligible to receive:



- 16 -
-    credit of up to NE 40.52/acre (US$113.47) to plant
four acres; two acres in the first vear of partici-
pation followed by two acres in the third vear if
the initial two acres are maintained satisfactorily.
-    credit of up to NE 43.39/acre (US$121.49) to renlant
four acres: two acres in the first year of participation
and if these are maintained satisfactorilv, a second
two acres in the third vear.
7.10      Credits would be disbursed in six annual installments of:

Credits would be disbursed in cash and kind directlv by the project authoritv,
subject to satisfactorv completion of farm work, see Annex 5.
7.11      Credits wotild be made through the Cooperative Trust.  Sub-borrowers
would receive credit for up to NE 40.52 (US$113.47)/acre or a total of NE 162.10
(US$453.88) per farmer planting four acres of cocoa, and up to NE 43.39
(US$121.49) or a total of NE 173.56 (US$485.97) per farmer replanting four
acres of old, low yielding cocoa. The terms of the new planting credits
would be 12 years including a grace period on principal of six years and
interest capitalized for five years, and for replanting credits, 15 years
including a grace period of eight years and interest capitalized for seven
years. Repayment of the principal would start in the 7th and 9th years and
terminate in the 12th and 15th years for new plantings and replanting
respectively; see Annex 3, Table 1. Interest would be 9-1/4%, assuming a
7-1/4% rate of interest on the Bank loan and a 2% marpin to be retained by
the Cooperative Trust to cover its services and credit risks. The rate of
9--1/4% per annum is in line with the Government's stated long-term agricul-
tural credit policy.
7.12      The Cooperative Trust would repay Government the capital element
of sub-borrowers repayments as these are receivable, together with interest
at 7-1/4%. Project participants, who would be members of cooperative soci-
eties, would market their cocoa through their societies, and a loan agreement
between each participant and the Cooperative Trust would entitle the society
to deduct loan repayments from his cocoa sale proceeds. Details of the
Cooperative Trust on-lending are given in Annex 7, Table 5.
7.13      The project unit staff would include 4 loan officers experienced
in agricultural lending activities, seconded to the project authority from
the Cooperative Trust. They would be primarily responsible for appraising



- 17 -
the creditworthiness of project participants and ensuring that project
participants sign loan agreements with the Cooperative Trust before credits
are disbursed. Farmers loan agreements would make provision for settlement
of outstanding loans by the inheritors of a deceased participants' farm,
and would also stipulate that loans would become payable immediately if the
participant ceased to be a member of the cooperative society, with which
he registered prior to receiving a project loan. It would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed loan that Government and the Cooperative
Trust had entered into a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the
Bank, covering the terms and conditions of Government on-lending to the
Cooperative Trust and of the Cooperative Trust on-lending to project farmers.
In addition, the subsidiary loan agreement would provide for the disbursement
of approved loans to participants to be made by the project unit.
D. Staffing
7.14      Key positions at project head office (see para 7.01) would be
filled by suitably qualified and experienced staff, recruited internationally,
if necessary. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that initial appointments to the posts of Project Manager, Deputy
Project Manager, Financial Controller, and Senior Credit Officer, and the
terms of reference and conditions of employment of these officials would be
mutually acceptable to Government and the Bank. A Project Manager and
Financial Controller acceptable to the Bank have been designated and their
appointment together with that of Deputy Project Manager, Financial Control-
ler, and Senior Credit Officer, would be a condition of effectiveness of the
loan.
7.15      The remaining staff required for the project would be drawn from

VIII. PRODUCTTON, MARKETS. FARMER BENFFTTS
AND GOVERNMENT BJFNEFTTS
A. Yields and Output
8.01      Trials in the prolect area with hvhrid cocoas have vielded
over 2,000 lb/acre at maturitq. However, because of the large number
of farmers (about 8,000) involved in the project, large variations in
farm management standards, and thus yields, are inevitable. It is estimated
that new farms planted under the project would vield an average of 850
lb/acre from the seventh year after planting; and that mature yields
on replanted farms would be rather less, averaging about 750 lb/acre.
The lower yields on replanted farms would reflect the lower fertilitv
of their soils. Both replanted and new farms would begin Yielding in
their fourth year, and production would increase progressivelv up to the
seventh year after which it is assumed that thev would remain stable until
the farms are 25 years of age. After 1985, project plantings would produce
an annual output of about 15,000 tons valued at about US$9.1 million in
foreign exchange, assuming an average world price of US 27 cents/lb. Further
details on estimated yields are discussed in Annex 5.
8.02      Food Crops: The majority of farmers in the replanting scheme
would plant some plantain and cocoyams as temporary shade for their
replanted cocoa. These crops would supply a source of food and in some
cases, cash income to the farmer. However, because of the variation
between farms and the density of temporary shade required, it is difficult
to estimate either an average vield per farm or an average cash income.
B. Markets and Prices
8.03      During the past 23 years (1945/46 to 1968/69) world supply/demand
of cocoa has been growing at an average of 3.7% vearlv, and averaged about
1.3 million metric tons per year during the last three years of the period.
From the mid-14O's and throughout the 1950's, the world cocoa situation
was characterized by short supplies and relatively high prices.  The real
price, in terms of 1969 dollars, spot New York, averaged 48.3 cents per pound
in 1950-54 and 40.7 cents in 1955-59. These earlier price levels encouraged
technical improvements and new planting.  As a result, the world situation
shifted from shortage to relative plenty and the average price for 1960-65
(in real terms) was 25.8 cents per pound. In spite of a yearly rate of
growth in demand (i.e. grindings) of approximately 7% (1960-65) compared
with 3.8% previously (1954-59), stocks of cocoa beans reached a record high
level at the end of 1965 and the average real price for that vear fell as
low as 19.1 cents per pound.



- 19 -
8.04      After the mid-sixties, due to a combination of unfavorable factors
including political unrest in some major producing countries, the supply/
demand situation began to move from surplus to deficit and by 1969 a short
supply situation was clearlv evident. From 1966 to 1969, the vearly growth
in output had decreased to 0.7%. The price, in real termLs, rose steadily,
averaging 34.6 cents in 1966-69 compared with 25.8 cents in 1960-65.  These
high prices resulted in a severe curtailment in world demand and in
manufacturers' stocks being drawn down considerably.  By the end of 1969,
stocks were at a record low level. The average 1969 price of 45.7 cents
was higher than in any year from 1950 to 1969, except for 1954 and 1958.
In 1970 Production again increased sharply, largelv due to very good weather
in West Africa and prices declined, these are now about 29 cents/lb.
8.05       Based on current information, world production of cocoa in 1.975
may amouint to 1.66 million metric tons rising to 1.97 million metric tons in
1980 and 2.34 million metric tons in 1985. This implies an annual growth
in production of about 3.5% compared with 3.7% in the period 1946 to 1969.
8.06      The question of how Bank financing might affect future world cocoa
output and market prices cannot be answered with precision or assurance.
Total output from all Bank Group cocoa projects currently approved or under
consideration is expected to be about 55 thousand metric tons as of 1980
and 49 thousand metric tons as of 1985. These quantities will be a minor
proportion of world production or exports in those periods, less than 3%
Based on rather simplified assumptions regarding price elastictties of demand,
etc., (see Annex 12) the notential. effect of the additional production could
be either to slightly reduce the price of cocoa in 1980 and 1985 or to dis-
place an equivalent amount of higher cost production.  Price adjustment would
take place if the periods aroundl 1980 and 1985 were times of short crops when
prices would be above the mediium term  equilibrium  level.  If prices were at
or below the equilibrium level, the displacement effect would take place.
8.07      Accordine to the market annex prepared bv the Bank's Economic De-
partment (Annex 12), the long-term equilibrium price of cocoa by the 1980's
may be as low as; 25 cents/lb spot New York in 1969 dollar term.s.  This
price is the low estimate of a range of 25-30 cents/lb in 1969 dollar terms.
Accordinglv, for purposes of this appraisal a real price of U.S. 27 centslb
has been used.
C. Farmers Benefits
8.08       Esrtmated farm htjd5t-rs for new planting and renlanting are at
Anne-x 3.  Thev are based on the credit terms oittlined in para 7.11 , and
oT1 a producer prfee of Nb 1()/ton (WS 13.75 cents/lh eqtuivalent) which is
about tlhe level It is estImated to reach in relation to the Bank's forecast
of IJS 27 cents/lb for the wor]ld Price of cocoa, (see P.a1r  3.09).

New Plant~in
8.09      Annual gross income from a newly plantedl four acre farm is esti-
mated at about NE. 10 (US$28) in vear 4, increasing to about N+ 167 (US$467.60)
at maturity in year 11. Farmers would hegin loan repayment in year 6, and
after maintaining a debt service of about 40% of their gross return, or
about 64% of their net return, would complete repayment In year 12. After
completion of loan repavment, net income per annum would be Nb 112.08
(US$313.82). This net income of NE 28.02/acre (USS78.46) is more than double
the present average net income of a cocoa farmer in Nigeria of about NE 12.00/
acre, and is equivalent to a financial rate of return to the farmer of 32%
calculated over 25 years.
Replanting
8.10      Farmers replanting four acres of cocoa would receive a gross
income estimated at about Nt 10 (US$28) in vear 5, increasing to about
NE 147 (US$412) at maturitv in year 12.  Farmers would begin loan repayments
in year 8 and after maintaining a debt service of about 40% of their gross
income or about 66% of their net return, would complete repayment in year
15. After completion of loan repayment, net income per acre would be NE 23
(US$65) which would compare with a present average net income of about
NE 7/acre. This increased income would provide a strong incentive for
farmers to replant their old cocoa farms, and it would be equivalent to a
financial rate of return of 20% to the farmers on his replanting investment,
calculated over 25 years.
8.11      The financial rates of return given above for new planting and
replanting are calculated on a producer price of Nt 110/ton (see para 3.09)
and consequently are minimum rates on farmers' investments.
D. Government Revenue
8.12      Government would receive substantial revenues from the
proJect. Annex 9 shows that, taking into account current cocoa export
duties, sales tax and WNMB operating surpluses after payment of a pro-
ducer price of NE 110/ton, Government would earn an annual cash surplus
from 1980, and would recover all its expenditures on the project by 1984.
The total surplus accruing to Government over the 25 year prolect life is
estimated at N+, 7.3 million (US$20.0 million equivalent). Assuming a
world price of UJS 27 cents/lb and a producer price of N+u 110 per ton, the
financial rate of return to the Government would be 9.9%. The yield to
Government on its awn contribution to project costs is estimated at about
10.6%.

IX. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
9.01      The project's primary benefits would be the increased
production of cocoa and resultant higher foreign exchange earnings,
a satisfactory return on investment, and higher incomes for about
8,000 participating farmers. The project would demonstrate the benefits
of imnroved agricultural techniques and inputs, and show the value of
supervised credit projects in agricultural development. In addition,
the Cooperative Trust would be strengthened, rural employment would be
increased and farmers would see the benefits of replanting old, low yielding
cocoa farms.
9.02      Based on a world price of US 27 cents/lb, it is estimated that
at full production the project would generate about US$ 7.7 million
per year in net foreign exchange earnings.
9.03      The calculation of the return to the economy from the project
is shown in Annex 4. It takes into account only about 34% of labor costs.
This is the proportion of farm labor requirements that would be supplied
by hired labor on an average farm, the remainder being provided by the
farm family at no cash cost. In view of the strong social ties which
bind farmers to their land, and their associated reluctance to work for
a daily wage which is only available at peak seasons of the year (see
para 4.04), the opportunity cost of farmer's labor is low. It is difficult
to determine a value for this opportunity cost, but if costed at an average
wage rate of NE 3/6/day for men, women, and children, the rates of return
given below would be reduced by about 3%.
9.04      On the basis of the yields and costs estimated in this report, an
assumed real cocoa price of US 27 cents per pound, the treatment of labor
costs described above, and a project life of 25 years, the return to the
economy would be 17%. The return has been tested for sensitivity at various
prices, which include the 25-35 cent levels contained in the market annex,
combined with a 10% reduction in yield (see below and Annex 4, Table 2).

9.05      The new planting and replanting components of the project share
the majority of project administrative and overhead costs. However, for
comparative purposes, separate rates of return for the two components have
been calculated by pro-rating project overheads between the two project
components. As shown below the components could withstand slightlv lower
cash returns per acre than the conservative estimates used in this report
and remain economically viable. Further details of the sensitivity analysis
are given in Annex 4, Table 2.

9.06      In view of the superior benefits of new planting, the inclusion
of replanting as a component of the project may be questioned.  Several
circumstances, however, justify its inclusion. The two principal of
these are: first, the extent of uncultivated cocoa soils is limited, and
the Western State would be unable to maintain and increase its cocoa
production bv planting new areas onlv, and allowing establishe(d cocoa
areas to degenerate further. Thus, despite its relatively lower, although
still satisfactory economic rate of return, the replanting of old cocoa
farms is a necessitv, and indeed the time to demonstrate to farmers that
replanting is a rewarding operation is long overdue. Second, if replant-
ing does not take place serious economic and social disruption will
occur in the presently relatively prosperous cocoa growing areas. Replant-
ing is technically more difficult than new planting, and bevond the
capacity of the average farmer unless closely supervised and supported as
envisaged under the project. Consequently, at the present time, when
the cocoa farm goes out of production the land is used for the growing
of food crops at a verv low level of productivitv.
X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     During loan negotiations the following main assurances were
obtained:
(a) existing subsidies for insecticides, fungicides and
fertilizers would not be reduced without prior consult-
ation with the Bank (para 3.06);
(b)  all funds required for the project would be made availa-
ble in advance and in block form on the basis of quar-
terly estimates prepared by the Project Manager, and,
Government would maintain, over the three years after
completion of the five-year project development
neriod, the required extension staff and provide the
same subsidies and services to the last project farmers
as those provided to other farmers under the project
(para 6.03);
(c) project unit accounts and farmer loan accounts with the
Cooperative Trust would be audited annually by an inde-
pendent auditor mutually acceptable to Government and
the Bank, and these accounts, together with those of the



- 23 -
cooperatives audited by the Registrar of Cooperatives,
would be submitted to the Bank within four months of the
closing of the financial year (para 6.07);
(d) initial anpointments to the positions of Project
Manager, his Deputy, the Financial Controller and Senior
Credit Officer, their terms of reference and conditions
of employment would be mutually acceptable to the
Government and the Bank (para 7.14).
10.02     Conditions of effectiveness are:
(a) the project unit, with terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, had been established (para 7.01-7.04);
(b) a project coordinating committee, with membership and
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, had been
established (para 7.05);
(c) a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank had
been signed between Government and the Cooperative Trust
and would not be changed without prior approval of the
Bank. The agreement would:
-    define the terms and conditions of Government?s
onlending to the Cooperative Trust, and of the
Trust's loans to project farmers;
-    provide for secondment of Cooperative Trust staff to
the project unit;
-    allow loan disbursement by the project unit: and
-    provide for project loan repavments to be made through
cooperative societies by deduction from cocoa sale
proceeds (para 7.13).
(d) the ProJect Manager, his Deputy, the Financial Controller
and the Senior Credit Officer had been appointed (para
7.14).
10.03     A condition of disbursement of the study component of the loan
would be that the Government had appointed a survey coordinator acceptable
to the Bank, with satisfactory terms of reference (para 7.04).
10.04     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$7.2 million equivalent.

ANNEX 4
NIGERIA
WESTERN STATE COCOA PROJECT
Rate of Return Calculation
1.        Table 1 shows details of annual costs and returns used in
calculating the economic rate of return from investment in new planting,
replanting, and the total project. A sensitivity analysis with respect to
four levels of world cocoa price, two yield levels, and with family labor
cost included in total project costs, is given at Table 2.
2.        The following assumptions and data have been used in the rate
of return calculations.
(a) Project Life
The life of new planting, and replanting components
of the project is assumed to be 25 years as from Project
Year 1. Thus, farms planted under the project and which
would come into bearing in the fifth year would produce
benefits for periods ranging from as high as 20 years for
farms planted in Project Year 2, to as low as 14 years
for farms established in Project Year 7.
(b) Costs
(i)  On Farm Investment and OperatinW Costs
These have been developed basically from Tables 2
and 3 of Annex 2, which give a breakdown of these costs
on a per acre basis. On-farm costs include hired labor
cost, and a 10% contingency on all costs has been included
in rate of return calculation. In replanting, as shown
in Table 3 of Annex 2, and in new planting, Table 2 of
Annex 2, the percentage of total labor requirements
assumed to be supplied by hired labor varies from year to
year in line with labor needs. It is assumed that for
replanted cocoa hired labor would meet about 34% of all
labor needs and in the case of new planted cocoa about 30%
of all labor requirements. The cost of hired labor is
assumed to be Nb .375/man-day. No cash, or economic cost
is attributed to family labor, see Para (v) below.
(ii) Project Administration
All project admtnistration costs, both capital and
recurrent arising from implementation of the project and
including the costs of extension services are taken into



ANNEX 4
Page  2
account. No residual value is attrilbuted to Government
assets created under the project. Thie costs of project
administration arc detailed in Annex 2, Table 1.  For
the calculation of the rates of return of the niew planting
and replanting components, administration costs have been
divi,ded equally betwseen the two comnonents except for the
cost of the operational units whlitch ihave 1becn charged to
each component according to the b)reakdown given in Ainex i,
Table l.
(iii) Special Services
These costs, as detailed in Annex 2, Table 1, hiave
been included in the calculation except for the cocoa
survey whicih, as a preparation of future projects, has
no quantifiable returns.
(iv) Marketig Costs
The full costs of moving project produced cocoa from
farm gate to FOB Nigeria are taken into account. These
costs are shown in Annex 8 and average Nh 30.25 per long
ton.
(v) Family Labor Costs
Total labor requirement per acre is given in Annex 2,
Table 2 and 3 and family labor is represented by the
difference between total and hired labor. Such family
labor has been valued at NE 0.18 per man-day against
NE 0.375 for hired labor because it is carried out mainly
by women and children who are paid less than men.
(c)  Benefits
(i) Yields and Outputs
Yields and outputs used in the calculation are given
in Annex 1, Table 2.
(ii) Prices
Returns have been calculated by using the following
FOB prices:  Nb 272,232,208 and 192 per ton corresponding to
cif New York prices US 35,30,27 and 25 cents per pound
respectively, see Annex 8, Table 6. Benefits shown in
Table 1 are calculated at US 27 cents per pound.

Technical Aspects of Cocoa Growing in Western Nigeria
and Project Implementation
I. BACKGROUND AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF COCOA PRODUCTION
Historical
1.        Cocoa was introduced into Nigeria from Fernando Po in 1874, and
production increased rapidly through the initiative and enterprise of large
numbers of small scale farmers. In 1966/67 Nigeria'a production of 235,000
tons of cocoa, represented about 20% of total world production, making it
second only to Ghana as the world's largest producer.
Climate, Soils and Ecology
2.        Cocoa requires a hot wet climate with temperatures between 20 0C
and 27 C, and a rainfall of between 50 and 70 inches a year. Rainfall
should be evenly distributed through the year but a dry sunny period is
desirable to limit fungal diseases and to increase photosynthesis.
3.        Soils should be free-draining and permit adequate root develop-
ment, and much of the world's cocoa is grown on structural clay-loams and
sandy loams.
4.        Cocoa is grown most successfully in tropical rainfall areas when
it is planted under virgin or old secondary forest, where it benefits from
accumulated soil fertility, and the more even climatic conditions brought
about by the forest.
Agronomy
5.        Land Preparation: Planting preparation procedures vary according
to the type of natural vegetation present. In primary and secondary forest,
the forest must be selectively thinned to ensure that sufficient sunlight
reaches the cocoa trees, and to allow air currents to pass through the farm,
thus helping to reduce a build-up of humidity and a consequent increase in
fungal diseases. On cleared land, or land that has been recently used for
shifting cultivation, temporary ground cover and shade must be established
before cocoa is planted. Cocoyams, pidgeon pea, cassava and plantains are
commonly used for this purpose.
6.        Planting: Traditionally, cocoa is planted either as beans at stake
or as bare root seedlings; the plants are closely and irregularly spaced,
making farm maintenance, especially disease and pest control, difficult.
However, with the introduction of improved varieties, seedlings are now
raised in polythene pots in nurseries and transplanted into rows in the
field after four to six months.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
7.        Maintenance of Youn& Farms:  Under traditional methods of random
planted cocoa which results in a variable density of trees per acre, young
cocoa receives little attention, and weeding is seldom carried out. This
results in s1ow growth and commonlv trees do not come into bearing until
thev are six years old.
Harvesting
8.        In Nigeria the traditional variety of cocoa, Amelonado, usually
produces two crops each year. A main harvest beginning at the end of the
wet season in September and continuing through the first months of the
dry season until December, and a second minor harvest during the first
months, June and July, of the following wet season. Ripe pods can be
left on the tree for up to two weeks but unharvested pods are liable to
Black Pod disease and germination of beans within the pod, and farmers try
to pick pods every three weeks. After picking, the pods are left for three
to seven days before being taken to a central collection point where the
beans are extracted, fermented in heaps for seven days, and sun dried for
about ten days. The dry beans are then bagged and sold.
Pests and Diseases
9.        The three important pests and diseases of cocoa in Nigeria are
Capsids, Black Pod and Swollen Shoot Disease (SSVD). Several minor pests
and diseases are also present but they cause relatively minor production
losses.
Capsids
10.       The most damaging of insect cocoa pests is the Capsid.  Capsids
(more correctly Mirids) feed by injecting cell destroying enzymes into
young tissues of the tree, twigs or pods, and sucking out the resulting
fluids. The feeding points are sites of secondary infection by the fungus
Calonectria, and it is this fungus permeating through the plant tissue
which ultimately kills the affected portion of the tree.
11.       Following intensive research in the screening of insecticides
carried out in Nigeria and Ghana, a Benzene Hexachloride formulation was
found to be effective against capsids, and widespread spraying began in 1957.
Black Pod
12.       Black Pod is a fungal disease Phytopthora palmivora which attacks
ripening cocoa pods. The fungal spores require conditions of high humidity
before they germinate and therefore losses from this disease occur at the
height of the wet season which itself often corresponds with the period of
maximum ripening. In areas of very high rainfall, the eastern fringes of
the 'cocoa belt', Black Pod becomes the limiting factor in expanding cocoa
plantings.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
13.       The disease can be partly controlled by good farm sanitation, which
includes the removal of diseased pods and by allowing wind currents to
pass through the farm to reduce humidity to a minimum. Chemical control is
obtained by spraying cocoa pods with copper compounds, usually a form of
Bordeaux mixture, which prevents pod penetration by the germinating fungal
spores. Spraying must be carried out at three weekly intervals during the
pod ripening period.
Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (SSVD)
14.       SSVD is present in one form or another in all cocoa producing
countries of West Africa. It is endemic in the 'cocoa belt' and although
yields are reduced and trees die slowly, the virus strains present are
not the virulent 'killer' strains found in Ghana. In Nigeria the following
methods of control are used:
1.   Two large areas of mass initial infection have been demar-
cated; one area containing about 100,000 acres of cocoa
near Ibadan, and another containing some 25,000 acres of
cocoa near Ilaro. These areas were designated Areas of Mass
Infection (AMI) (see Map). No control measures were carried
out in these two areas since cutting out would destroy the
bulk of the cocoa acreage completely disrupting the economy
of the two areas. In addition, a 'cordon sanitaire'
was established around the AMI and regularly inspected for
SSVD. Diseased trees and their contacts, within the cordon
sanitaire are cut out.
2.   All other cocoa growing areas of the region are subject to
a survey designed to locate SSVD outbreaks, in any such
outbreaks the diseased trees are cut out.
Cutting out is accepted only as a temporary measure, and the true answer to
the problem is in breeding cocoa varieties that are resistant or highly
tolerant to the different cocoa virus strains.
Cocoa Varieties
15.       The original introductions of cocoa into Nigerla were of the
Amelonedo type, and this became the traditional planting material of the
country.  The 1944 introduction into Nigeria and Ghana of varieties
collected in the Amazon Valley of South America has resulted, however, in
the prodtuction of hybrid cocoa, both among the Amazon families and between
the Amazon and Amelonado varieties. The majority of these Amazon hybrids
are higher yielding than Amelonado, and come into bearing earlier and are
more easily established. In addition, a few have shown themselves signifi-
cantly tolerant to the strains of SSVD found in Nigeria.
16.       hlybrids, however, do have some disadvantages.  They tend to be
more susceptible to Black Pod, and Stem Canker fungal diseases; the crop
is produced over a much longer period of the year than Amelonado, and



ANNEX 5
Page 4
since farmers may be disinclined to harvest the very early and late pods,
the risk of Black Pod fungus disease spreading from ripe to unripe pods
is increased. Finally, it has been suggested that hybrids have a shorter
economic cropping life than Amelonado.  Thiere is no established evidence or
reason for this, and although yields have been shown to decline from about
years 8 and 9 onwards, this is likely to be due to soil exhaustion result-
ing from continuous heavy yields, and probably could be reversed by the
use of fertilizers, as already indicated by CRIN experiments.
17.       Nevertheless, while existing Amazon hybrids are not the ultimate
in cocoa breeding, given sound management and efficient disease and pest
control, they are the best material now available.
18.       Work is proceeding at CRIN research station on breeding for both
virus tolerance/resistance and Black Pod disease resistance. Such material
is unlikely to be available for commercial use, however, for another 15-20
years.
Fertilizers
19.       The Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria and the Ministry of Agri-
culture have conducted cocoa fertilizer trials for the last decade. These
trials have shown that fertilizers stimulate the growth and early production
of young cocoa trees, increase the yield of mature trees, and give economic
responses under conditions of good management. Sufficient trials have been
carried out to enable fertilizer application recommendations to be made for
different ecological areas of the State. A complete fertilizer containing
nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium is recommended for areas south of
Ibadan, while nitrogen and phosphorous alone are recommended for the Ibadan
and Ondo provinces.
20.       Yield increases have been variable, but an average yield increase
of about 32% from mature cocoa have been obtained from applying 27 lbs P 20
and 143 lb N per acre, resulting in a profit of about NI 14.5/acre.             5
IT. THE PROJECT AND PROJECT AREA
Climate and Ecology
21.       Over the project area there is a hot dry season from November to
March and a cooler rainy season from April to October. The rainy season
is interrupted by a minor dry season typically lasting from late July to
early September, but varying in incidence from year to year. In late
December and January the area is influenced by hot, dust laden, drying,
winds - harmattan - coming from the north. At these periods, cloudless
skies with high day temperatures and cooler nights, predominate.
22.       A climatic feature of the area is the large variation in annual
rainfall and the considerable variation in annual rainfall caused by local



ANNEX 5
Page 5
differences in topography. In Ibadan, average rainfall for the period
1952-1958 was 50 inches, with a minimum of 41 inches in 1958 and a maximum
of 63 inches in 1957. For Ondo, during the same period and year, rainfall
averaged 62 inches, with a minimum of 47 inches and a maximum of 97 inches.
Geology
23.       The project area overlies very old, Pre-Cambrian metamorphic rocks.
Rock composition is variable, both in grain size and mineral composition,
ranging from course-grain pegmatite to fine grained schist and from acid
quartzite to basic rocks.
Relief and Drainage Vegetation
24.       Apart from small areas of special relief, the land surface is
gently undulating and descends from about 800 ft above sea level in the
north to 400 ft in the south. The main rivers all flow generally south-
wards. These rivers flow throughout the year but the network of streams
which serves them flow only intermittently. The climax vegetation over
the area is lowland rain forest, but due to shifting food crop cultivation
little high forest remains, and most of the unused areas of the cocoa belt
are secondary forest or bush.
Soils
25.       Project soils are generally described as being moderately to
strongly leached soils of low to medium humus content, weakly acid (PH 5.5)
to neutral surface layers, and moderately to strongly acid sub-soils. The
soils are derived from rather acid crystalline rocks, are fairly deep, porous,
friable and free draining. Clay and silt are low, and they are generally
suitable for cocoa production.
Planting Material
26.       Project material would be confined to a selection from a series
of Amazon/Amelonado hybrids - Series II Hybrids - which in field trials
have shown themselves to be superior yielders, and also some selection from
aseries of "Elite" varieties produced by the Cocoa Research Institute of
Nigeria, and selected for their drought resistance, ease of establishment,
and SSVD tolerance.
27.       Four hybrid seed gardens producing seed by hand pollination
techniques have been established in the project area, but their present
combined seed production is insufficient for project and extension service
requirements.
28.       Estimated project seed pod requirements, assuming 30 seeds/cocoa
pod would be:



ANNEX 5
PIge 6
1971       1972       1973      1974      1975
220,000   220,000   245,000  350,000  50,000
Total seed garden pod production in 1968 was 192,000, the limiting factor
being lack of trained hland pollinators.  The project will provide for the
tra:ining and employment of up to 30 additional hand pollinators, which
would ensure sufficient supply of seed.  Hiand pollinaltioLn would also enable
the timing of pod production to be controlled so that seed would be avail-
able in December/January; the most suitable time for nursery planting.
Seedling Nurseries and Planting
29.        Cocoa seedlings would be raised in polythene bags in central
nurseries from mid-D)ecember, throughl January.  Seed would not be planted
earlier as seedling root deformation occurs if seedlings remain in the
nursery for more than five months.  For both new planting and replanting,
field work will begin in the year prior to planting. In new planting, the
dense natural shade would be selectively thinned and undergrowth cleared.
In the following year, planting lines would be cleared and planting holes
dug 9' x 9'.  Regular hand weeding would be carried out and progressive
slhade removal by cutting, ring barking, and poisoning would begin the fourth
year after planting. Cocoa would not be thinned at maturity.
30.        For replanting, in tae year prior to planting, cocoa would be
underbrushed, and old diseased cocoa trees removed together with any excess
shade. Potentially good cocoa trees would be retained as temporary shade
supplemnented withi plantain where necessary.  It would be a condition of cocoa
planting that such temporary planting should have been successfully estab-
lishied prior to cocoa planting.  Trash would not be removed as this would be
used as ground mulch.  Weeding would be by hand, no chemical weeding would
be used.  As seedlinp  cocoa grows, old cocoa trees would be progressively
remnoved. In the areas of Mass Infection, all cocoa would be removed from
a cordon 30 ft wide completely surrounding the newly planted cocoa.
Iiarves ting
31.        The processes of harvesting, fermentation and drying would follow
traditional practices, but the use of hybrid seed would present somne features
new to Nigerian cocoa farmers, and would necessitate improved management
teclniques.  The wider spread of crop over the year would mean an increased
number of harvestings; the higlher proportion of pods in canopy branches
would make harvesting more tedious and increase the chances of missed pods.
Anti-Capsid Control
32.        In the project area, capsid damage is still extensive, despite
widespread control spraying, and some resistance to benzene hexachloride
insecticide has been found.  Sucih resistance is not as widespread as in
Glhana, and CRIN are carrying out selection trials to determine a suitable
alternative insecticide.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
33.       Capsid spraying on young cocoa begins in June and is followed by
a repeat spraying every other month until February.  Mature cocoa spraying
begins in August, followed by a second application 28 days later; there-
after spot spraying is carried out as and when required.
Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (SSVD)
34.       As described in para. 14 above, SSVD is endemic in the project
area and the presence of the Areas of Mass Infection have precluded complete
eradication of the disease. The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for
SSVD control throughout Nigeria's cocoa belt.   Inside the AMI replanted
farms would have a cocoa free cordan sanitaire 30 ft. wide surrounding the
new areas. Replanted farms would be regularly reinspected for virus infec-
tion and infected trees would be cut out. Outside the AMI, control consists
of cutting out infected and contact trees and replanting them at the begin-
ning of the next rainy season free of charge. Survey and control would be
continued during the course of the project.
Yields
35.       Yield variation is large within the project area, amelonado
yields varying from 100 lbs/acre to 1,000 lbs/acre, with an average poten-
yield of 800 lbs/acre and an estimated average actual production of 360 lbs.
While little data is available concerning the yields of hybrids under
small scale farming conditions, trials have given yields of over 2,000 lbs.
Accepting the high level of supervision that would be maintained by the
project unit and the high level of farm input consumption it is estimated
that the following average yields will be obtained by project farmers.

Fertilizers
36.       Fertilizers would be applied to all cocoa planted under the pro-
ject. For all farms except those near Ilaro, a compound NP 25:15 fertilizer
would be used. For farms near Ilaro, a compound NPK 15:15:15 or 15:15:10
would be used. Fertilizers would be applied as follows:
Year 1. 1 oz/tree in July and again in September.
Year 2. 2 oz/tree in April followed by 1 oz/tree in August.
Years 3 and 4. 2 oz/tree in April and again in August.
Years 5 - 7. 1 cwt/acre in April repeated in August.
Mature Cocoa. 2 cwt/acre in April followed by 1 cwt/acre in August.

III. PROJECT FIELD MANAGEMENT
Selection of Areas
37. Replanting. Villages in which the scheme would operate would be
selected from Cocoa Survey records, which contain details of farm age and
size and which would facilitate the grouping of project farmers into local-
ized groups, each containing about 25 farmers. One Special Laborer would
be responsible for the project activities of one group of 25 farmers.
New Planting. Areas in which the work of Operational Units would
be concentrated would be selected by the project unit in consultation with
the Ministry of Agriculture.
Selection of Farmers
38.       The project would be advertised and farmers from selected villages
would obtain project application forms through project field staff. In the
event of there being more applications than can be included in the project,
the area Agricultural Officer would arrange a random draw. Appraisal of
applicants and their farms would follow the results of the draw. Unsuccess-
ful applicants would be eligible for participation in future years in order
of the original draw. Each selected applicant and his farm would be checked
for the conditions set out in Annex 11. An applicant's failure to fulfill a
qualification would result in his rejection. Reports would be completed in
quadruplicate and filed at Operational Unit, Area and Headquarters levels
and with the Cooperative Trust. Final approval of selected farmers would be
made by the Cooperative Trust, and those approved would be required to sign
an agreement with the Trust.
Programming and Payment of Credits
39.       Project farmers would be required to satisfactorily establish
temporary shade on the areas to be replanted one year before planting.
Failure to establish such shade would automatically cancel the farmer's
rights to any further benefits under the scheme. For new planting, farmers
would be required to satisfactorily thin the natural shade over the areas
to be planted, in the year before planting. Once temporary shade had been
established and permanent shade thinned, cocoa planting and maintenance
would proceed as outlined in Annex 5.
40.       Credit cash payments would be made only after successful
completion of various stages of planting and maintenance and would be
dependent upon the area Agricultural Officer receiving satisfactory progress
reports from his field staff.
Materials issued as credits would be stored at field level and
approval for issue would rest with the heads of Operational Units.



ANNEX 5
Page 9
Unsatisfactory Reports
41.       Farmers receiving unsatisfactory reports would be given a reasonable
period in which to rectify the situation. A further unsatisfactory report
would result in cancellation of the respective agreement. On cancellation,
the Cooperative Trust would institute proceedings to recover credits already
disbursed.

Western State Cocoa Project
Cocoa Marketing Cooperatives
I. Introduction
1.        The cooperative movement was launched in the 1930's by the
Ministry of Agriculture to organize cocoa marketing amongst smallholders
and to assist in their competition with private companies and traders
handling cocoa exports. In 1936, a cooperative law was passed, estab-
lishing the Registrar's powers and duties, and permitting the organizing
of cooperative societies. The Cooperative Movement developed, and in
1945 the Association of Nigerian Cooperative Exporters Limited (ANCE)
was established as an organization embracing all Cooperative Produce
Marketing Unions (CPMU) and Societies (CPMS) in the then Western Region.
After Nigerian Independence in 1960, the cooperative movement suffered
from political interference: economically unsound societies were estab-
lished, loans were made without guarantee, and established cooperative
laws were overruled. This situation no longer exists and since 1965,
the cooperative movement, insulated from political pressure, has steadily
developed.
The primary societies
2.        The basic unit of the Cooperative Movement is the primary
society organized at village level.  During their annual general meeting,
members of a primary society elect a Committee, consisting of a President,
Vice-President and Treasurer, and a maximum of eight other members. The
Committee is responsible to the general meeting for the executive manage-
ment of the society and appoints a secretary to manage the day-to-day
operations. The secretary is responsible for purchasing cocoa from
society members, bookkeeping, stock maintenance and cash operations. He
prepares the society profit and loss account, and the balance sheet, which
the Committee presents to the annual general meeting, and Registrar of
Cooperatives for approval.
3.        Cooperative societies are primarily interested in cocoa market-
ing but they provide also their members with farm inputs such as pesti-
cides, fertilizers and sprayers and with seasonal credit facilities for
their purchase. In these functions, the primary societies are assisted
by the Cooperative Supply Association Limited (see para. 10) and the
Cooperative Bank (see Annex 7). Seasonal loans granted in kind to members



ANNEX 6
Page 2
at an average rate of 15% per annum are reimbursed by deduction from the
proceeds of each member's sale and there is a well established practice
of loan account keepinig at the primary society level. In addition to
production loans, primary societies may grant short term cash loans to
members.  The credit worthiness of a member is appraised by the committee
and the total indebtedness of each lllember cannot exceed three quarters
of the estimated value of his caslh crop for the ensuing season.  A member
is not allowed to borrow money from any source other than the society
without prior approval of the general meeting and Registrar.
4.        To become a member of a primary society, a farmer must be over
18 years of age and own a cocoa farm.  He pays an entrance fee of about
five shillings, varying from society to society, and subscribes at least
three shares of one pound each. A member must sell hisi cocoa only to his
society, except where prior permission has been given by the Committee.
This system works satisfactorily as long as the cooperatives are able to
make immediate cash payments for their member's cocoa. In practice, how-
ever, there are occasions when societies are short of cash and consequent-
ly members sell to other buying agents. No member is entitled to withdraw
from his society unless he has been a member for at least two years and
has given six-months notice. If a member withdraws from his society or
is expelled by a decision of the general meeting for mischievous conduct
toward the society, outstanding loans and interest thereon become payable
immediately. Under the project the loan agreement to be entered into by
cooperative members and the Cooperative Trust would cater for immediate
total loan repayment, if a project participant leaves the society through
which he was given a development loan.
5.        Primary societies derive their main income from that part of the
licensed buying agent allowance passed on to them by the Unions. Addition-
al income accrues from shares purchased by members, entrance fees, interest
on seasonal loans and commission on the purchase of farm inputs by members.
Societies may also accept deposits from members in individual savings
accounts and use such proceeds for investment or for loans to members.
Reserves Funds are held by societies to meet losses and assets depreciation,
and many societies have established an Educational Fund to finance scholar-
ships for members' dependents.
The Jnions and the Association of Nigerian Cooperative Exporters (ANCE)
6.        In 1968/69, the Western State had aoout 900 cocoa marketing prim-
arv societies grouped in 22 Unions, themselves organized as cooperatives,
their members being the constituent primaries.  The Unions are licensed
buying agenits and organize the cocoa marketing of their societies as
prescribed by the Marketing Board (see Annex 8). Besides their marketing
operations, Unions group farm input orders from their constituent societies
and pass bulk orders to the Cooperative Supply Association. If members



ANNEX 6
Page 3
request for productive and consumption loans exceed available funds, unions
borrow directly from the Cooperative Bank for on-lending to its member
societies. The Union committees decide the credit worthiness of each
society and fix the maximum amount each is permitted to borrow. Societies
are not entitled to borrow from sources other than their union without
prior Union and Registrar approval.
7.        ANCE, with headquarters in Ibadan, started operations in 1945,
with a membership of 4 Cooperative Produce Marketing Unions. Membership
grew steadily and during the period 1964/5-1968/9, averaged 21 unions
representing some 850 primary societies and about 47,000 individual members.
During the same period ANCE handled a yearly average of 38,000 tons of
cocoa or approximately 17% of the total Western State production. This
represents an average annual production of 1,800 tons per union, 45 tons
per society or 0.81 tons per member. In addition to cocoa marketing, its
main operation, ANCE deals also with palm products, coffee and copra and
small quantities of other cash crops. Further data on ANCE and its
constituent unions are given in Table 1. Production statistics show
marked decreases in 1965/6 and in 1968/9; in both years crop production
was substantially reduced by bad weather throughout West Africa. In
addition, the establishment in 1965/6 of the Midwestern State with its
own export cooperative association deprived ANCE of four unions which
joined the new Association. In 1969, another union left ANCE following
the establishment of Lagos State.
8.        ANCE is organized on the cooperative pattern, each union being
represented at the Annual Meeting. A committee consisting of the President,
Vice-President and one representative selected by the unions of each
Province, is responsible for the executive management and appoints a
.)ecLetary to carry out day-to-day operations.  ANCE's main object is to
operate as a central marketing agency for members' produce. Initially,
ANCE was the sole licensed buying agent for the whole cooperative movement
but in 1960, each member union whose cocoa throughout exceeded the minimum
required by the Marketing Board, registered as a licensed buying agent and
took direct advantage of the buying allowance. ANCE also provides ser-
vices to its members such as transport, storage and marketing of produce
which are not controlled by the Marketing Board. It assists also its
member unions in their relation with the Marketing Board. ANCE is respon-
sible for the general development of cooperative marketing organizations,
represents their interest at Government level and participate in the
Cooperative Union of Western Nigeria which is the apex organization of
the cooperative movement in the Western State. If a member union runs
into difficulties, incurs losses or is generally mismanaged, ANCE may take
over temporarily by appointing a Secretary directly responsible to ANCE.
The same procedure is applied when new unions are established. In 1969/70
nine societies were under the direct control of ANCE - three of them be-
cause of mismanagement - and their production was handled under ANCE's
buying license.

9.        ANCE's funds are derived from share capital subscribed by
members (LIO per society member of the union), deposits from members as
long-term loans and most importantly from levies charged on their members
for services rendered.  In 1968/69, each tnion paid levies of 24 shill-
ings and two pence per ton of cocoa from a btuving allowance of some bN9.
ANCE in turn, contributed 5 shillings per ton of cocoa to the Cooperative
Union of Western Nigeria. Further income accrues from debt service on
loans granted to meinber unions and from cocoa buying allowances for cocoa
handled directlv by ANCE.  Details of ANCE profit and loss accounts and
balance sheets for the period 1964-1969 are given in Table 1.
The Cooperative Sutolv Association, Ltd. (CSA)
10.        In 1965, the cooperative movement realized the advantages of
purchasing their inputs in bulk directly from foreign producers. Unions
and societies formed a new cooperative society, the Cooperative Supply
Association to collect all the societies' orders for farm inputs and
purchase these in bulk. The Cooperative Supply Association Ltd. has grown
steadily since its inception and now covers the whole of Western and
Midwestern State. Through a network of district and field units, the
CSA collects farm input orders from cooperative societies and unions,
calls for bids, imports and organizes their distribution amongst purchasers.
CSA, the biggest importer of farm clhemicals in Nigeria, also assists
cooperatives fromn oth-er States in purclhasing their farm inputs. The
project unit could use CSA's services for the provision of project ferti-
lizers and pesticides provided thiat tenders, whiichi are at present only
offered to six big international companies, could be opened to inter-
national bidding.
Other Cooperative Organizations
11.       In addition to ANCE and the Cooperative Supply Association, the
Cooperative Union of Wlestern Niigeria includes also the Cooperative Bank,
(see Annex 7), 35 Unionis conisistinlg of some 1,400 cooperative thrift and
credit societies, and some 270 crafts' consumers' and building societies.
'iotal membershiip of the Cooperative Union of Western State exceeds 100,000
members.  (see Chart 1, organization of the cooperative movement.  The
Union maintains an audit which ensures a permanent control of all accounts
In eaclh society, union or association. This unit operates satisfactorily
and thie Registrar of Cooperatives uses its services occasionally to ensure
societies' audit which he is empowered to do by law (see para. 12).
The Cooperative Societies Division
12.       -This Division, directed by a Registrar, is within the MHinistry
of Trade and Industry, and controls the cooperative movement, using
legislation provided by thie Cooperative Societies Law (1953), and subse-
quent regulations. It registers eligible societies, supervises societies,



ANNEX 6
Page 5
unions and associations, audits cooperative accounts at least once a year,
and approves balance sheets and allocation of bonuses. The Registrar's
consent is needed for cooperatives to grant loans to non-members and to
borrow outside the cooperative movement. If any member of a society
committee or other officers are deemed not fit by the Registrar, he may
require their replacement and can appoint a replacement after a thirty
day vacancy.
13.       New societies undergo a probationary period of approximately
one year before registration. After applying for registration, new primary
societies are supervised and audited by the Department of Cooperatives as
for a fully registered society. Registration is granted when the Registrar
is satisfied that cooperative legislation is being correctly applied, at
least 10 members have paid more than the minimum share of one pound, and
the cocoa throughput of a cocoa marketing society exceeds 40 tons per year.
14.       In 1969/70, besides the Registrar and the Chief Assistant
Registrar, the Division employed, 180 officers and had a total budget of
about LN140,000. It also organizes, together with the Cooperative Union
of Western Nigeria, revision courses for its own officers and cooperative
secretaries in cooperative principles, law, bookkeeping and commercial
practices. The training program, staffed by cooperative officers is
carried out at the cooperative college in Ibadan. Chart II shows the
organization of the Division.
Cooperatives in the project area
15.       In 1968-69, fifteen unions composed of 542 primary societies
and some 37,000 members were existing in the project area. Over the last
five years (1964/5-1968/9), these uni.ons produced an average of 34,122
tons of cocoa representing 2.436 tons per union, 66 tons per society or
0.93 tons per member. Further details on cooperative unions and societies
in the project area are given in Table 2. Due to good growing conditions
in the project area the trading results of project area cooperatives are
slightly above the average for ANCE societies. (see Table 1). While the
average annual output per ANCE member during the period 1964-69 was 0.81
tons and average annual gross earnings IN84, the average cooperative
taember in the project area produced 0.93 tons per year, and earned about
hN800 per year (1964-69) despite losses incurred in 1965/66 due to bad
weatlher.
Conclusion
16.       The cooperative movement is well established in the Western
State and experienced in providing seasonal loans to its members. Under
the supervision of thle project unit, it would be able to provide the
basis for a satisfactory system of input distribution and loan recovery
with the full participation of its key organization, the Cooperative Bank,
wiiich would, amongst others, secure the funds required for prompt purchas-
ing of cocoa by societies from their menibers.

WESTERN STATE COCOA PROJECT
Agricultural Credit Organizations
in the Western State
I. Introduction
1.        In 1946, Government established the Nigerian Local Development
Board - subsequently replaced by four regional boards - to provide credit
to individuals, private companies and cooperative societies for agricul-
tural and industrial projects. In 1953, the cooperative Bank was estab-
lished by the cooperative movement to cater for the credit requirements
of the unions and cooperatives and took over such activities from the
Board. In 1955, the Western Regional Development (Loans) Board was taken
over by the Western Region Finance Corporation.
2.        The Western Region Finance Corporation which was not involved
in credit to cooperatives, tended to overlook agriculture credit needs
and concentrated on industrial development. In 1964, the Government
created a new corporation specialized in agricultural credit: the Western
Nigeria Agricultural Credit Corporation. The new corporation took over
some 50,000 agricultural loans from the Western Region Finance Corporation
totalling about NE 1.5 million, 40% of them being considered as bad debt
to be written off. Since 1967, proposals have been made to recombine the
two Corporations, but in March, 1970, the question was still under
government review.
II. Western State Agricultural
Credit Corporation (ACC)
Objectives and Powers
3.        Under the Western Nigerian Agricultural Credit Corporation Law,
1964, ACC is entitled to provide agricultural loans to Western State
farmers. The act creating ACC distinguishes between loans to large scale
farmers, to be made directly by ACC, and loans to small scale farmers who
are members of cooperative societies, for which ACC provides funds to the
Cooperative Bank. This distinction whiclh implies agreement and coordi-
nation between ACC and the Cooperative Bank has never worked properly,
because, under political pressures at the beginning of its existence, ACC
entered into doubtful business with hastily set-up and unregistered
cooperatives, overruling practices established by the Registrar of
Cooperatives and the Cooperative Bank. Besides granting loans, ACC is
also empowered to subscribe share capital in agriculttiral ventures, to
participate in agricultural schemes launched by the Ministry of Agriculture



ANNEX 7
Page 2
and Natural Resources and to manage agricultural projects. In its relation
with farmers, ACC adopted supervised credit methods consisting of inten-
sive guidance in farm, home and financial management. Its lending is based
on the potential income and repayment capacity of the borrower, rather
than on collateral security.
Organizations:
4.        ACC's Board is appointed entirely by the Governor of the Western
State. Under present military rule, the Board's Chairman ranks as Commis-
sioner in the Government and the five other senior civil servants who
constitute the Board represent the Governor's office, Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the University of Ife.
The Division of Cooperatives was represented by the Registrar of Coopera-
tive, but, despite the importance of the cooperative movement in any
agricultural credit scheme, the new Registrar nominated in 1968 has not
yet been appointed to ACC's Board. The Board meets regularly, issues
policies and approves loans while the day-to-day operations are left to
the General Manager and Secretary.
5.        Five main Departments carry out ACC's operations.  The Loan
Making and Servicing Department appraises loans and supervises disburse-
ment after Board approval. This lending activity is carried out from
Corporation headquarters in Ibadan through three circle offices in
Abeokuta, Ibadan and Akure. These three circles are divided into 10
areas, covering 104 Local Advisory Committees (LAC). Each circle is
directed by a Loan Inspector responsible for lending operations, and for
supervising of Agricultural Assistants seconded to ACC from the Ministry
of Agriculture for technical appraisals and project supervision. ACC's
remaining four Departments deal with accounts, internal audit, administra-
tion and legal matters. Chart 1 shows ACC's organization. Professional
staff employed by ACC in March, 1970, totalled 64, including 15 Agricul-
tural Assistants and Superintendents seconded from MANR.
Financial Situation and Lending Operations
6.        On March 31, 1969, ACC's capital amounting to EN2.15 million
(US$7.68 million) was made up of NE 1.58 million (US$5.64 million) trans-
ferred from the Western Region Finance Corporation at the establishment
of ACC in 1964, NE 0.5 million (US$1.78 million) given as a grant by the
Produce 1larketing Board on behalf of the Government and NE 0.07 (US$0.25
million) directly subscribed by Government. However, the Nb 1.58 million
net asset taken over from the Western Nigerian Finance Corporation con-
sisted of loans amounting to some NE 0.7 million (US$2.5 million) for the
principal and about NE 0.88 million (US$3.14 million) of interest overdue
thereon. In 1966/67, ACC proposed to write off NE 0.94 million (US$3.36
million) as a current loss but the proposal which appeared in ACC balance
sheet of that year (see Table 1) was rejected by Government and the
amount was reintroduced into ACC's loan account. As these loans are now
overdue for more than 6 years, and the cost of recovery through legal



ANNEX 7
Page 3
action increasingly expensive, it would be wise to write them off progres-
sively over the next five years, matching these losses with a corres-
ponding increase in reserves, financed from undistributed profits.
7.        From the beginning of its operations in 1964 to March 31, 1969,
ACC has granted 1,269 loans for a total principal amount of NE 224,728. In
March 1969, the total amount repaid, including interests totaled Nb 137,134
or 61.0% of the principal paid out. During appraisal it was impossible
to obtain an accurate picture of ACC debt recovery, as ACC was unable to
supply the required data. However, from evidence available it was clear
that present debt recovery is less than the 61% quoted for March, 1969.
Of 1,269 loans issued, 774 loans totalling N152,855, were granted in
1965-66 to so-called cooperative societies during an agitated election
campaign. 447 of those cooperative societies were improperly established
and it was never clear to them if the funds were given as loans or
political gratifications. Since then, many of those hastily established
cooperatives have disappeared. In March, 1969, 215 registered societies
had repaid principal and interest amounting to NE 95,103 but it is unlikely
that further significant amounts will ever be reimbursed on the loans.
8.        Since 1967-68, ACC has tried to restart its operations on a
sounder financial basis. In compliance with its establishment act, it has
left cooperative societies lending to the Cooperative Bank; it has also
improved its techniques of loan appraisal by using staff seconded from MANR.
Ilowever, lack of new funds, and overstaffing have prevented such policies
from showing their results and ACC position is still very weak. In 1968/69,
114 loans amounting to NE 10,122 (US$36,135) were appraised and approved by a
staff of 50 professionals, representing an average of 2.28 loans of NE 202
per professional staff.
9.        In addition to its lending activities, ACC is Government's
agent in a joint venture with Plantations and General Investment Trust, Ltd.,
a British Company establishing a 4,000 acre rubber plantation called
"Waterside Rubber Estates, Ltd.". Government has subscribed 49% of the
NE 150,000 capital paid in and in 1968-69, ACC advanced NE 20,825 as working
capital on behalf of the Government. Planting began in 1965 and by March,
1969, 1,991 acres were under rubber. First production is expected in 1972.
Government is now considering a second joint venture with foreign inves-
tors to establish another 1,000 acre rubber plantation.
Conclusion
10.       ACC is structurally and operationally weak.  Its Board, consist-
ing exclusively of civil servants under the chairmanship of a Commissioner,
is open to direct political pressures which in the past have overruled
conclusions reached by financial and economic analysis. ACC's capital
consists mainly of dubious assets taken over from the Western State
Finance Corporation. Furthermore, ACC has no authorized capital and is
entirely depending upon yearly Government budget allocations for the
continuation and the expansion of its operations. ACC is overstaffed in
relation to its operational activity which during the last two years, has
been almost confined to overdue debt recovery while new loans were reduced
to an insignificant level.

11.       In its request to the Bank, the State Government envisaged that ACC
would be responsible for all credit aspects of the cocoa project. Govern-
ment planned to on-lend the Bank loan, together with its own contribution,
to ACC to provide project loans. However, due to the poor past perform-
ance of ACC and its present lack of suitable management, the proposal was
unacceptable to the appraisal mission.
III. The Cooperative Bank and
the Cooperative Investment and Trust Society, Ltd.
Introduction
12.       In 1953, the leading cooperative organizations in Western
Nigeria launched a credit organization, the Cooperative Bank of Western
Nigeria, to collect and distribute savings available inside the cooperative
movement, and to borrow additional funds as required. The Cooperative
Bank of Western Nigeria was established as a cooperative society. It was
given a Government grant of Nb 1 million (US$2.8 million) and its first
members were the primary societies, unions and apex organizations of the
cooperative movement. At first the Cooperative Bank confined itself
mainly to the financing of cocoa purchases by ANCE and cooperative unions
and societies. Short-term funds required for such operations were pro-
vided by cooperative savings and by heavy borrowing from commercial banks.
The Cooperative Bank developed rapidly, entering more and more into normal
commercial banking as well as in the field of long term loans and invest-
ments.  At the beginning of the 1960's the Central Bank of Nigeria warned
the Cooperative Bank that it should become a licensed company under the
Banking Ordinance (1958) if it wished to continue commercial banking. To
comply with bank legislation specifying liquidity of assets, and to
preserve long term investment operations it had already entered into, the
Cooperative Bank became a subsidiary of a new "Cooperative Investment and
Trust Society,Ltd." which took over all the long term loans and invest-
ment operations of the Cooperative Bank. The Cooperative Bank transformed
itself into a company and became a fully-fledged commercial bank under
the Banking Ordinance.
The Cooperative Investment and Trust Society, Ltd.
13.       Only unions and societies duly regictered in the Western and
Lagos State can become members of the Trust which is established and
registered as a cooperative society under the Cooperative Societies Law
(1953). The Board of Management, elected at the annual meeting, consists
of the President, Vice-President, the Treasurer, one member coming from
each well-defined area and the managers of the apex organizations of the
cooperative movement. It is responsible for the general management of
the Trust, day-to-day operations being left to the General Manager who is
appointed or dismissed by the Board with approval of the annual meeting.

14.       The Trust's capital, paid in shares of Nt 1 each, amounted to
NE 58,939 (US$165,029) as of March 31, 1969. There is no fixed authorized
capital and each member is free to subscribe any amount above the minimum
set for each type of societies and unions. Reserves at the same date were
valued at NE 1,221,027 (US$3,418,876). Ninety percent of the Trust portfolio
valued at NE 555,631 (US$1,555,768), consists of 500,001 shares of one
pound each of the Cooperative Bank, the remaining Nh 55,698 being miscel-
laneous investments in cooperative ventures, especially in cocoa planta-
tions totalling 1,500 acres. Total loans granted by the Trust amounted
to NE 330,866 on March 31, 1969, of which 31% was for cooperative societies
agricultural projects, 44% for cooperative buildings and equipment, includ-
ing 3 supermarkets being constructed by the Cooperative Supply Association,
and the remainder being for various commercial and manufacturing loans.
In 1968/69, the Trust made a profit of NE 4,950 (US$13,860) which is rather
low compared to the average surplus of NE 11,624 (US$32,547) over the last
six years. Since its inception, the Trust has not incurred a loss.
Details of the balance sheets for the last 6 years and of the portfolio
and loans account are given in Table 2.
The Cooperative Bank of Western Nigeria
15.       In 1962, the cooporative society "Cooperative Bank of Western
Nigeria" became a company registered under the Company Ordinance and
obtained a full banking license. Its members are registered cooperative
societies in the Western and Lagos States and these comprise the annual
meeting with powers apportioned to the number of shares subscribed by
each member. Individuals or other organizations may become members and
subscribe shares but have no voting powers in the company. The majority
of the Cooperative Bank members are also members of the Cooperative Trust,
and the elected management board of the Bank also serves as a Management
Board for the Trust. The General Manager of the Trust is also the Mlanager
of the Cooperative Bank.
Under the General Manager, the Cooperative Bank's administration splits
into four departments: Investment Department, Accounts Department,
Inspectorate Department and Administrative Department. These four
departments are responsible for supervising the 11 branches opened in the
main towns of the Western and Lagos States through which the Cooperative
Bank receives deposits and disburses loans. In March, 1970 the Cooperative
Bank employed 231 staff members out of which 36 were qualified profes-
sionals. Chart 2 shows the organization of the Trust and the Cooperative
Bank.
16.       Autlhorized capital of the Cooperative Bank is fixed at NE 1,000,000
(IJq$2.8 million) of which NE 504,593 had been paid in as of March 31, 1969.
Tlhe Trust has subiscri-bed and paid in NE 500,001 (T!St1.4 million); the
remainling capital was subscribed by ANCE, the Cooperative Supply Association
and otlher apex organizations of the Cooperative movement. The Reserve account
has increased from Nb 26,050 in 1963/64 to Nb 42,381 in 1968/69. At the end of
the financial year 1968/69, more than 2,500 current saving and bank accounts
amounted to a total deposit of NE 2.82 million (11S$7.9 million); a rate of



ANNEX 7
Page 6
3.5% per annum was paid on savings accounts. At the same time the total
amount of loans and advances represented some NE 2.48 million (IIS$6.94 million).
For the same financial year, profits amounted to NE 26,424 (t'S$73,987), a
result slightly above the average profit for the last six years estimated at
NE 25,543 (US$71,590). Details of the balance sheets for the last 6 years
and of the profit and loss account are given in Tables 3 and 4. The
Cooperative Bank and the Trust accounts are audited by an independent auditor
(SPENCER THIRWELL ALALADE and Co.). In addition, by a special covenant of
the Articles of Association, the Registrar of Cooperatives is entitled to
supervise and audit all the Cooperative Bank's accounts as for any cooperative
society (see Annex 6, para 12.).
17.       As already described in Annex 6, the Cooperative Bank is mainly
concerned with financing cocoa purchasing and other cash crops. The
Cooperative Bank has its own resources for these operations but borrows
also some NE 8 to NE 10 million every year.  This short term borrowing costs
between 8% to 10% per annum and is usually reimbursed in less than one year.
The Cooperative Bank has never defaulted on such borrowings. The Coopera-
tive Bank on-lends these funds to the Unions for their purchases and
Unions distribute the funds amongst their member cooperatives. Rates
charged by the Cooperative Bank to the unions, which are the licensed
buying agents, are about 12% per annum.
18.       In close coordination with the Cooperative Supply Association
(CSA) the Cooperative Bank finances the purchase of agricultural inputs
to be used by farmers, and provides CSA with the short term credit required
to finance the bulk purchase of these items. Within the limitations of
the regulations established by the Cooperative Law (see Annex 6, para 3),
the Cooperative Bank provides credit for seasonal cash loans to farmers
at a rate of 15% per annum.
The Role of the Trust and the Cooperative Bank in the Cocoa Project
19.       The Governments request to the Bank for project assistance proposed
that the Cooperative Bank would only be used for the banking needs of
the project without having responsibility for the lending operations,
which were to be carried out by ACC. As ACC cannot carry out such activ-
ities (see para 11) it is proposed that the Trust would handle project
credit requirements. Creditworthiness of each applicant, who would be
or become a member of a Cooperative Society would be appraised by the
Cooperative Bank Staff seconded to the projec* unit. After a loan agree-
ment had been entered into between the Trust and the selected cooperator,
the project unit wu._d disburse the loan in cash and kind, and charge :it
to the farmer's loan account kept at the society and the Trust level.
Primary societies would collect required repayments by deductions from
the sales of cocoa and transfer them to the Trust. These operations
would be carried out through the Cooperative Bank's branches in the
project area. Risk incurred by the Trust and the operating charges of the
Cooperative Bank would be covered by a 2% margin on the interest charged
to project farmers. Total amounts of the loans disbursed by the project
unit, would be reimbursed by the Trust to the Government together with an



ANNEX 7
Page 7
interest of 7-1/4% per annum. Tables 5 and 6 show individual and overall
estimates of disbursement and debt service which the farmers and the Trust
would experience under the present project.
Conclusion
20.       The Trust and the Cooperative Bank have operated very satis-
factorily since their inception; their financial performances have always
been good; they have the full confidence of the cooperative movement and
of other financial institutions in the country, and they are backed by
the Cooperative Division and the Government whose policy supports the
expansion of the Cooperative Bank's agricultural lending. During a
politically agitated period, they have been able to maintain high banking
standards and to preserve their financial and economic decisions from
direct political pressures. It is felt therefore, that the Trust and the
Cooperative Bank are able to provide a satisfactory system of loan recovery
under the cocoa project.

ANNEX 8
NIGERIA
WESTERN STATE COCOA PROJECT
WESTERN NIGERIA MARKETING BOARD (WNMB) AND COCOA MARKETING
Background
1.        Until 1939 exports of cocoa and other crops were made by
expatriate commercial firms who had established agents and buying stations
in the crop producing areas. To correct deficiencies in the then existing
marketing system, and to ensure the delivery of essential commodities
during the war period, the British Government established statutory market-
ing organizations with an export monopoly of all essential crops from
Nigeria. An Agency - the West African Produce Control Board - was also
established in the United Kingdom for the purposes of handling the market-
ing of these essential commodities during the period 1939-1945.
2.        Early in 1947 a draft Nigerian ordinance was prepared to establish
a Nigerian Cocoa Marketing Board and an advisory Committee to guide the
Board. A bill was prepared and after consideration and amendment in the
regional houses of Assembly, it was presented to and passed by the Legis-
lative Council in August 1947. The resulting law, known as the Nigerian
Cocoa Marketing Board Ordinance, was brought into effect in September 6,
1947, as Government Order No. 1257. This ordinance made the Nigerian
Cocoa Marketing Board the sole purchaser of all cocoa produced in Nigeria
for export, and it empowered the Board to purchase such cocoa at prices
fixed by it and approved by the Government. In the same year the Nigerian
Produce Marketing Company Ltd., was formed and incorporated in the United
Kingdom under the Companies Act of 1930. This firm was located in London
since it was anticipated that the organization would handle sales abroad
of vegetable oils and oils seeds as well as cocoa.
3.        In 1953, at the London Conference on the Nigerian Consitution,
it was decided that the existing commodity marketing boards should be
regionalized. Recommendations were made that:
(a)  existing commodity marketing boards which operated on
a country-wide basis and handled a single commodity or
group of commodities, should be replaced by a single
'all-purpose' marketing board for each region and be
made responsible for all the purchasing arrangements
within the region and for price stabilization, research
and development policy.
(b) a central board with executive powers relating to the
prescription of grades, calling forward for export,



ANNEX 8
Page 2
shipment and overseas sales of produce on behalf of
the regional marketing boards should be established.
At the same time, the constitutional conference decided that reserves
of the former commodity boards should be distributed to the regional
marketing boards on the principle of origin of produce.  Accordingly, an
initial provisional distribution of L 25 million was made to the Western
Nigeria Marketing Board.
4.        The Marketing Board Law was enacted by the legislature of the
Western Region in September 1954, end the board came into legal existence
in October of the same year. In 1955, the Nigerian Central Marketing
Board was legally established. The main functions responsibilities, and
powers of the Central Marketing Board were the following:
(a) to arranging for export, shipping and sale of produce,
(b) to prescribe grades and standards of quality of produce
purchased by the regional marketing boards for export,
(c) to purchase produce from the regional marketing boards
for export and sale.
(d) Act as the agent of the regional marketing boards for
the export and sale of produce.
5.        In 1957, the conference to review the Nigerian constitution
considered the future of the Nigerian Central Marketing Board and other
matters concerning the statutory structure for handling export produce.
The conference decided that both the Nigerian Central Marketing Board
and its overseas selling organization, the Nigerian Produce Marketing
Company, Ltd., (NPMC), should be abolished. Functions performed by
these two bodies would be allocated among:
(1) the regional marketing boards, and
(2) a company to be called Nigerian Produce Marketing
Company, Ltd., Lagos, (i.e. incorporated in Nigeria).
Establishment of NPMC (Lagos) and the other changes mentioned above became
effective October 1958. During the 1960/61 marketing season, NPMC's
operations were revised to permit the sale of marketing board produce
from Lagos as well as London. Thus, foreign buyers were given the option
of buying either on a cif, or fob, basis. The Company's practice of
concluding sales contracts only through intermediaries in London was
also discontinued. Sales were henceforth made on a net price basis,
effective December 1, 1961. During the 1962/63 marketing year, the
London office of NPMC was closed and all sales functions were handled
from the Lagos Office.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
6.        WNMB was established by law as a corporate body with perpetual
succession and a common seal and with power to sue and be sued in its
corporate name. The Board consists of a Chairman and of not less than
seven nor more than ten members all of whom are appointed by the Minister
(or by the Military Governor during the present Military Regime).
The Chairman holds office for 5 years from his date of appointment while
members serve for three years, both are eligible for re-appointment. As
now constituted the Board has its own executive committee and in operational
matters functions as an autonomous body. Present membership is as follows:
(1) Permanent Secretary Ministry of Agriculture-Chairman.
(2) Commander, 2nd Infantry Division (Rear) Nigerian Army - Member.
(3) Chief Development Officer Ministry of Trade and Industry - Member.
(4) Senior Assistant Secretary (Revenue) Ministry of Finance.
(5) Assistant Chief Agricultural Extension Services Officer,
Ministry of Agriculture - Member.
(6) Chief Projects Investigation Officer, office of the
Military Governor - Member.
(7) General Manager, Western Nigeria Marketing Board - Member.
7.        The Board by law is charged with the following main functions
and responsibilities:
(a) marketing the State's main export crops, namely Cocoa,
Palm Kernels, Palm Oil, Seed Cotton, Lemons and Grapefruit;
(b) appointing Licensed Buying Agents (LBA) to perform on
the Board's behalf the purchase, grading, storage and
evacuation of the produce to port of shipment;
(c) fixing producer prices at the beginning of each produce
season for an entire crop-year and the building of
reserve funds for stabilizing these producer prices in
time of low market prices; and
(d) providing assistance to the producing industries for
the benefit and prosperity of the people of the Western
State.
Cocoa Buying
8.        The Board is responsible for marketing the main export crops of
the State, and is empowered to secure the most favorable arrangements for



ANNEX 8
Page 4
the purchase and evacuation to port of the commodities subject to its laws
and ensure a system of orderly marketing. The Board appoints Licensed
Buying Agents (LBA) who are responsible for the purchase, grading, storage
and evacuation of the produce to port where it is exported and shipped by
the Nigerian Produce Marketing Company Limited (NPMC). LBAs are paid a
Block Buying Allowance to cover the purchase price, the cost of evacuating
produce and a remuneration fee. The main functions cocoa LBAs are required
to perform on behalf of the Board are:
(a) to purchase cocoa at gazetted buying stations at no less
than the minimum fixed prices;
(b) to bag and arrange for cocoa inspection in accordance with
the regulations;
(c) to finance cocoa purchases and provide suitable storage
until the time of evacuation to port;
(d) to make returns of purchases and stocks as the Board
or its duly authorized executive may require; and
(e) to arrange for conveyance and delivery of cocoa to
Board's stores according to its instructions which
may be issued from time to time by the Board's
executive.
The agents of the Board are supervised by the inspectorate arm of the Board.
9.        The annual producer price is determined by the Marketing Board
with the approval of the State Government Executive Council and the Federal
Ministry of Finance. Since credit for the finance of cocoa purchases and
all other export commodities is available by law to State Marketing Boards
only from the Central Bank of Nigeria, the latter's concurrence with pro-
ducer prices is required. Before each buying season opens WNMB announces
the price per long ton to be paid at all buying stations. The producer
price remains fixed for the entire season regardless of fluctuation in world
market prices. WNMB maintains inspectors in the field to ensure that pro-
ducers receive the official minimum price.
10.       WNMB pays LBAs a block allowance, at present NE 12.34 per long ton
(for breakdown see Table 1) to cover all expenses of handling cocoa from
buying points up to loading for transportation to port of shipment. Trans-
port costs from local stores to port stores are not included in the allowance
as they are paid directly by WNMB. The block allowance includes a commission
of NE 1.05 and a NE 2 remuneration.
Sources of Funds for Financing Cocoa Purchases
11.       LBAs are responsible for financing cocoa purchases and under
existing financial arrangements they are able to raise the required funds



ANNEX 8
Page 5
by borrowing from commercial banks while cooperative unions obtain their
funds from the Cooperative Bank. Interest rates charged by commercial banks
vary between 8% and 10% depending on the creditworthiness of the LBA, and
the Cooperative Bank interest rate to Unions is slightly less. The agents
are relatively free of any price risks but are liable for certain losses in
quality and any leakages in quantity, although they have been given (up to
1967/68) an allowance for carrying insurance against some risks. At the
same time, they may benefit financially fron any up-grading in quality or
increases in quantity.
12.       LBAs take title to produce purchased upon acquisition from farmers,
and retain title until the product is graded by an inspector of the Pro-
duce Inspection Division, and the LBA given a certificate of acceptance.
Once graded, the cocoa automatically becomes the property of the Board and
LBA collect the value of the declared purchase. Payment of the block buy-
ing allowance, and any other allowable expenses are made upon acceptance
of the graded cocoa at Apapa or Ikeja ports of shipment.
13.       Prior to the 1967/68 season WNBM obtained, for the purchase and
evacuation of cocoa to port of shipment, credit facilities from a consor-
tium of commercial banks. As of the 1967/68 cocoa season, all Marketing
Boards were required by law to obtain such funds only from the Central
Bank of Nigeria. As previously, credit facilities of the order of E 15
million to L 20 million are made available each year in the form of bill
finance at a discount rate of 6 percent against the pledging and registra-
tion of forward sale contracts by the NMPC with the Central Bank. Bills
are drawn by the Board early in the season to finance purchases and move-
ment of cocoa through its licensed bying agents, from September or October
each year to about March of the succeeding year. As from April, the borrow-
ings are repaid by the NPMC to the Central Bank from its forward sales
proceeds made for the account of the Board and the repayment is usually
completed by the end of July each year. Borrowings of each year are
always fully repaid before the commencement of the following season.
14.       NPMC incurs, during cocoa shipment and sales abroad, certain
direct charges such as export duty, wharfage, lighterage, shipping, insur-
ance and certain costs at ports of discharge. During purchase payment,
NPMC retains 20% of the sales price to cover these various costs. Due to
a steady increase in handling costs, NPMC is now to retain 24% of the
purchase price.
Taxation - Revenue to Government
15.       Export duties are payable on cocoa exported abroad at a rate of
15% on an fob price of NL 150 per ton, increasing by 1% for each additional
£ 10 rise in fob price up to a maximum of 20%. Duties are payable by NPMC
on behalf of the State Boards and revert in total to the State from which
the produce originated.



ANNEX 8
Page 6
16.       On a total sale of 200,000 tons of cocoa in the year and on
average fob price of NE 250/ton total export duty occurring to the Western
State Government would be in the order of Nh 12 million. In addition to the
above, a Produce Sales Tax of NE 4/ton of cocoa purchased by the Board is
levied by the State Government. This is a tax on the producer and is re-
tained by the Board from the producer price due to the farmer.

WESTERN STATE COCOA PROJECT
COCOA DEVELOPMENT STIJDY
Draft Outline of Terms of Reference
1.        Preliminary estimates prepared by the Western State Government
indicate that some 750,000 acres of cocoa out of a total cocoa of about 1.2
million acres are over 30 years of age. Future development of the cocoa
industry requires both the planting of new areas and the replanting of areas
where, because of age and disease,sub-economic yields are being obtained.
2.        More accurate data on the cocoa industry is required before a
detailed investment plan can be prepared. To supply the required data, two
surveys would be carried out by the Government.
- an inventory of vacant land suitable for cocoa.
- a sample survey of existing cocoa land.
Inventory of Vacant Land Suitable for Cocoa
3.        Soil and land surveys would be carried out in the following Divislion
of the Western State:
Ilesha North   Owo
Ilesha South   Eketi North
Ondo            Eketi Central
Akuve
4.        The Inventory study would include, among others, the following:
(i)  aerial photography at a scale of 1:20:000 of the seven divi-
sions listed above.
(ii)  photo interpretation of aerlal photographs to identify land
suitable and available for cocoa planting, and preparation
of topogrnphical maps at a scale of 1:62,5000.
(iil)  detailed soil surveyinig of all areas, which from photo inter-
pretation appear suitable and available for cocoa planting.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
5.        Survey area aerial photographs would be taken between September
and October 1970, and photo interpretation and map preparation soil survey
would begin in mid 1971 and be completed in two years.
Sample Survey of the Cocoa Industry
6.        A suitable stratified sample survey of cocoa farmers would be
carried out to obtain data on, amongst others, the following:
- total acreage of cocoa in the Western State.
- age distribution of cocoa.
- yields.
- inputs used: insecticide, fungicides, and fertilizer.
- areas of new land suitable for cocoa planting.
- areas of existing farms suitable for replanting.
- labor supply and amount of hired labor employed.
- farmers debt situation.
The survey would be carried out over an eighteen-month period.
Investment Plan
7.        The investment plan would take into consideration, among others,
the following:
(i) project location and general plan of project illustrated by
maps, scope and magnitude of the project, area to be devel-
oped, major features of proposed development;
(ii) present agricultural production in the area; farm sizes and
land tenure system; existing roads and water facilities;
social infrastructure of the area (schools, dispensaries,
etc.);
(iii) area topography, climatical data, soil survey data,
present land use;
(iv) estimated capital costs, breakdown into foreign exchange and
local currency requirements; maintenance and operating costs;
phasing of financial requirements:

(v)  organization to be responsible for settlement aspects;
maintenance of roads, wells and other proposed investments;
(vi)  credit needs and arrangements; and
(vii)  analysis of estimated benefits to farmers, the Government,
and the economy.

(I)  Applicant must be able to prove rights of usage to at least
4 acres of good cocoa land, of which 2 acres must be under
satisfactorily maintained cocoa.
(II) Applicant must be a member of a cocoa marketing cooperative
society.
Replanting
(III) Applicant must be able to prove ownership of at least 2
acres of land, carrying old cocoa on good cocoa soils.
(IV) Temporary shade must be satisfactorily established during
the year prior to planting. Failure to establish shade
-would automatically cancel the right to any further credits.
General   Applicants must:
(VI) be prepared to replant or new plant the minimum required
area with cocoa and the acreage must be in one contiguous
block.
(VII) show evidence of ability to adapt good cultural methods.
This would be assessed from farming standards on the appli-
cant's holding.
(VIII) live sufficiently near his farm to allow his regular personal
supervision of operations.
(IX) possess a spraying pump in workable condition, or alterna-
tively, be prepared to purchase one on credit if necessary.
B.   Special Requirements for Areas of Mass Infestation with Swollen Shoot
(i)  Participants within the area of swollen infection are required to
establish a 30-foot wide cocoa-free cordon around their replanted
farms.
(ii)  Participants must agree to special inspection by the Cocoa Survey
Branch of the Ministry and to the removal of swollen shoot



ANNEX 11

diseased trees and contact trees without compensation, other than
replanting by the Cocoa Survey Branch of the areas cleared.
C.   Requirements for Soil, Climate, and Fertility
(I) Land to be planted must satisfy the requirements of good
cocoa land set by the Soil Survey Branch of the Ministry
of Agriculture.
(II) Land must be in a satisfactory rainfall area.
(III) Land to be newly planted must be under forest or bush fallow
for more than 10 years duration.
D.   Project farmers would be required to follow recommended cultivation
practices.   Failure to do so will result in cancellation of the loan
agreement between the farmer and the Cooperative Trust; and legal
action would be taken to recover the values of credits issued
to the farmer.

WESTERN STATE COCOA PROJECT
WORLD COCOA MARKET SITUATION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        Cocoa is a particularly volatile commodity and requires frequent
review because of the sensitivity of production to the vagaries of weather
and the effect of this on price in the medium-term. Cocoa is also a commo-
dity which has relatively few producers and exporters. More than three-
quarters of world output and exports is concentrated in five countries
(Ghana, Nigeria, Brazil, Ivory Coast and Cameroon) as shown in Tables 1 ancl
2. When Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Dominican Republic, Papua and New
Guinea and Togo are added about 90% of each of these world totals is
accounted for. The importance of cocoa in the ten countries' foreign ex-
change earnings varies from around 66% for Ghana to only 2.5% for Brazil as
shown in Table 3.
II. PAST TRENDS
2.         Since World War II (1945/46 to 1968/69) 1/ world production of
cocoa has increased at an average of 3.7% yearly. Within this time span
there have been three distinct periods. For the first 13 years (1945/46
Lo 1958/59) the growth in production averaged 2.2% yearly while in the
following five years (1959/60 to 1964/65) there was an acceleration to
6.2% yearly. This was followed by a sharp deceleration in the yearly growth
rate to 0.7% in the last three years (1965/66 to 1968/69). Aggregate world
production since 1946 is shown in Table 6. Table 1 shows world production
by leading producers for selected 5-year average periods over the past 30
years and Table 4 shows production in the most recent period by individual
years from 1963/64 to 1969/70.
3.        The accelerated growth rate in world output of cocoa in the early
1960's may be attributed in part to favourable weather conditions. Crop
failures because of poor weather had occurred in 1951/52 and 1957/58,
whereas in the early 1960's weather was generally favourable. In 1964/65
world production reached a record level of 1.5 million metric tons due
mainly to exceptionally good weather, particularly throughout Africa, the
world rate of gain from the previous year was +24.8% but in the following
year production fell almost all the way back to the previous level (see
Table 4).
1/   Notations such as 1945/46 refer to the crop year beginning in October
of the first year shown and ending in September of the second year shown.



ANNEX 12
Page   2
4.        The favourable effects of weather during the early 60's were
also reinforced by the cumulative benefits of extensive techirnical develop-
ments involving improved yields and disease control whlicth had been imple-
mented throughout the decade of the fifties, particularly in the first five
years.  At the end of World War II swollen shoot disease had been spreading
in Africa, mainly in Ghana.  It was brought under control in the early
1950's by extensive cutting out of infected trees and replanting with
high-yielding stock. New cocoa areas were also opened up in Ghana.  In the
case of Nigeria the disease was not as widespread or as severe but the rate
of replanting there to replace trees passing their maximum yield period was
relatively low throughout the fifties. In other areas in Africa, however,
new cocoa plantings were extensive. At the same time, increased use of
fertilizer and mass spraying against capsid disease had been undertaken in
Ghana and Nigeria and to a lesser degree in other African areas.
5.        The most recent period (1965/66 to 1968/69) was dominated by
unfavourable weather conditions, particularly in 1965/66 and 1968/69 in
Ghana and Nigeria, where excessive rain ruined the crop.  In Ghana, the
low levels of output in 1966 may also be due in part to the removal of the
subsidy on spraying after the price of cocoa (in 1969 dollars) had fallen
to a record low of 19.1 cents in 1965 (see Table 7). In Nigeria political
unrest and labor problems in the cocoa area plus insufficient replanting
in the 1950's also contributed to the contraction in production. Elsewhere
in Africa, however, there has continued a steady and rapid expansion on the
whole. In Central and South America there has been a gentle rise in output;
the growth in the first three years of the period was followed by a decline
in the last year (1968/69) but indications are thiat the expansion was
resumed in the present season (1969/70). In Oceania tlhere has been a
considerable increase due to the fairly steady expansion in Papua and New
Guinea. For the world as a whole, then, production of cocoa in 1965/66-
1968/69 averaged 1.3 million metric tons compared with the 1964/65 peak
level of 1.5 million metric tons (see Table 4). In 1968/69 world output
amounted to only 1.23 million metric tons.
6.        Before turning to demand, a few comments on concepts may be use-
ful. World demand is represented in this paper by world grindings. "Grind-
ings" are not identical to "consumption"; the latter refers to net imports
or grindings of beans adjusted by net imports or exports of cocoa products
converted into bean equivalent while the former refers to the quantity of
beans (as reported by the manufacturers) which has undergone the initial
manufacturing process. The world consumption estimate is prepared by FAO
and published in the July issue of their quarterly "Cocoa Statistics".
There is, however, a lag of about two years in the complete data. In
contrast the first estimates for world production and world grindings are
made in October of the October/September crop year by tne Cocoa Study
Group and are adjusted as the season progresses.
7.        At the October 1969 meeting of the Cocoa Study Group's Statistical
Committee, the Secretariat stated that due to the growing diversity of
cocoa products, the application of the FAO conversion factors no longer gives
satisfactory results. The Committee is trying to develop new conversion
factors.



ANNEX 12
Page   3
8.        Notwithstanding these shortcomings, consumption data are more
appropriate than grindings for certain purposes. Table 5 shows total and
per capita consumption 1957-59 and 1965-67. It illustrates the wide diver-
gence of per capita consumption throughout the world.  However, it should
be noted that most of the developing world lies in the tropical belt and
this circumstance is not conducive to chocolate drinking. Also, in many of
these cotntries, spicy foods are more acceptable as a "treat" than a
chocolate bar. These factors probably play as important a role in consump-
tion in those areas as price and income levels.
9.        The data also show that there has been a sharp increase in con-
sumption for the Centrally Planned Countries. Although 1957-59 total
demand in the Centrally Planned Countries was lower than in the developing
group, by 1965-67 both groups consumed about equal amounts. It is difficult
to forecast the future rate of growth of grindings or consumption in the
Centrally Planned Countries since likely changes in import policies are
not known. It is assumed that the future percentage rate of growth in total
consumption will slacken because of the rising consumption base. Even
allowing for a deceleration, however, per capita consumption is expected to
continue to increase.
10.       The re-opening of the European market and the removal of all
wartime controls in the United States by 1946 stimulated demand for cocoa
products at a time when supplies were relatively short, particularly during
the first half of the 1950's. Actually the entire decade was characterized
by short supplies and relatively high prices (see Table 6).  The real
price 1/ for cocoa, spot New York, averaged 48.3 cents per pound in 1950-54
and 40.7 cents in 1955-59 compared with 36.9 cents over the entire post-war
period (see Table 7). Undoubtedly these price levels encouraged the various
tcchnical developments noted previously in paragraph 4.
11.       The world cocoa situation shifted from shortage to relative plenty
during the first half of the sixties. The average price for 1960-65 (in
real terms) was 25.8 cents per pound. Notwithstandi-- a yearly rate of
growth in demand (i.e. grindings) of approximately 7% (1960-65) compared
with 3.8% previously (1954-59), stocks of cocoa beans reached a record level
oF 5.7 months' supply of grindings at the end of 1965 and the average price
for thit year was extremely low (see Tables 6 and 7).
12.       Afteir the mid-sixties, the supply/demand situation began to move
from surplus to deficit and by 1969 a shiort supply situation was clearly
evident. The price, in real terms, rose steadily, averaging 34.6 cents in
1966--69 compared with 25.8 cents in 1960-65.  Actually the 1969 price of
45.7 cents was higher than in any year from 1950 to 1969 except 1954 and
1958.
13.       These high prices resulted in a severe curtailment in world
grindings.  From 1966 to 1969 annual world grindings were more or less
trendless. It is fairly evident that the price in real terms for 1.969 has
1/   In terms of 1969 dollars.



ANNEX 12

stimulated the use of substitutes for and economizing in the use of cocoa
butter, such as reducing the size of clhocolate bars, increasing the use of
fruits and nuts, and using more white chocolate coatings madle from vegetable
oil in the expensive boxes of chocolates.
14.       Another result of the high prices was that manufacturers' stocks
were drawn down considerably. A fairly reliable yardstick that has been
used for judging the world cocoa situation is the level of stocks in terns
of months' supply with respect to grindings. As shown in Table 6, estimated
end-year total stocks (held mainly by consumers) were considered generally
short during the fifties, ranging from a high of 4.5 to a low of 2.5 months'
supply with respect to grindings (the 10-year average was 3.45 months'
supply). During the first half of the sixties total stocks were at record
high levels, particularly at the end of 1965 (5.7 months' supply). Commen-
cing in 1966, however, sotcks have declined steadily and by the end of 1969
were 2.2 months' supply, a record low level.
15.       Until the past year the stock policy of cocoa manufacturers, on
a global basis, appeared to be one in which a minimum working level of stocks
was around 3 months' supply, associated with prices higher than 30 cents,
and a maximum level of 5-6 months' supply, associated with prices in the
low twenties or below.  Despite the low stock level reached at the end of
1969 and expected to prevail for 1970, however, prices fell sharply during
the first half of 1970. According to Table 6, stocks at the end of 1970
may still be extremely low. In contrast the monthly average spot price fell
from an average of 48.6 cents in November 1969 to 29.3 cents in May 1970.
The average for January-October 1970 was 34.4 cents. Thie overall statistical
position judged by past experience does not seem to warrant such a sharp
price decline. This suggests that the cocoa industry may have changed its
stockholding policy for the time being. The high cost of financing stocks
and the relatively low world production of the past three years have
probably induced manufacturers to operate on a new minimum level of stocks,
at least for a while.  At the same time, 1970 price movements from January
to May may in part have been an overreaction to the relatively high price
and heavy forward sales during the first few months of the crop-year. Since
MJay prices,have strengthened. The average for October was 36.3 cents.
III. FUTURE PROSPECTS
If.       The main purpose of this section is to indicate the probable
cocoa price level by 1980 and beyonid when production from the Nigerian
cocoa project and all other Bank cocoa projects enter the market.  Various
long-term historical trends have been used as a basis for judgements to
arrive at a probably equilibrium price. The various estimnates, asstumptions
nmd judlgements are discussed in the following paragraphs.



ANNEX 12
Page   5
Production
17.       Based on estimates by the Banks' Area and Agriculture Projects
Departments for individual countries, world production by 1975 may amount
to 1,660 thousand metric tons. This implies a yearly increase of 3.4%
over the short-term (1967/69 to 1975) and would mean an acceleration of the
rate of growth as compared with the period since 1965/66 but at a lower
rate than the preceeding period of fast growth (6.2% per year in 1959/60-
1964/65). Over the longer term, 1946 to 1975, the rate of growth would
turn out to be 3.5% yearly, about the same as that for the period 1946 to
1969 (see paragraph 2). It should be noted that no allowance has been ma le
in these estimates for a drastic crop failure or a bumper crop due to
weather conditions.  Changes in weather may alter the level of output in
any one year by as much as +25% from the previous year. In the year
following the good or bad weather, output usually resumes its normal leveL.
for that year but the changed stock situation may alter the medium-term
outlook.
18.       For the longer term, since we do not have sufficiently detailed
data on plantings and yields, we have estimated 1980 and 1985 world
production by applying a long-term yearly rate of growth of 3.5% to the
projected 1975 world production, which yields an estimated output of 1,972
thoysand metric tons in 1980 and 2,342 thousand metric tons in 1985. While
the geographic zones suitable in climate and soil to the culture of cocoa
is limited, it is believed that the availability of land and the trends in
improving yields and in replanting make these levels of output technically
feasible.
Grindings and Stocks
19.       The years 1967-69 were selected as the base period for estimating
the future secular growth in grindings related to income growth. Grindings
averaged 1,375 thousand metric tons in that period with an average real price
of 37.5 cents per pound, spot New York. This price level corresponds
closely to the average real price of 36.8 cents during 1950-66 which was
the period for the computation of the income and price elasticities of
demand. These computations yielded estimates that fell within a range of
-0.2 to -0.42. A price elasticity of -0.3 has been used for purposes of
this paper. An aggregate real income growth of 5% yearly in the consuming
areas and a short run income elasticity of +0.3 has been assumed. 1/
20.        On the basis of these relationships, world grindings could be
expected to grow at 1.5% yearly assuming a constant real price of 37.5
cents per pound, spot New York. Since world production is expected to
expand at 3.4% yearly over the mediumn-term, however, the base price would
have to fall sufficiently so that grindings and stocks could increase and
absorb the difference between potential output and demand at constant
prices. Assuming that manufacturers will continue to operate at the
1/   World Cocoa Outlook, The Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ghana, Volume II, AW-6a restricted, May 6, 1969.

P age 6,
current very low stock levels for another year or two and thereafter
improve their stock position to a level of about 3 montlhs' grindings,
supply and demand could be balanced on the basis of a rate of growth In
world grindings of somewhat less than 3% yearly.  onh this has is, over thie
long-term period 1946 to 1977, the yearly rate of expanlsion in grindings
would have averaged 3.4% compared with 3.8% from 1.946 to 1969.  The assumed
level of stocks is low compared with historical data. It is expected,
however, that manufacturers may continue their present policy of operating
on a considerably lower stock level than in the past for the next few years
because of the present high cost of financing and of carrying cocoa.
21.       Under conditions outlined in the preceeding paragraphs the real
price of cocoa should decline considerably from the level of recent years,
and may reach a level in the neighborhood of 25 cents per pound, spot
New York, after the mid-1970's compared with 37.5 cents in 1967-69.
22.       As the real price approaches the middle of the 20-cent range
after 1975, manufacturers are likely to revert to more "normal" stockholding
policies and this tendency should provide an element of support to the
market price. For example, a shift in stock level from 3 to 4 months'
grindings after 1975 should he sufficient to maintain prices around 25
cents in 1969 dollar terms. In any case, however, our present judgment is
that the long-term equilibrium price of cocoa lies within the range of
25-30 cents per pound in 1969 dollar terms, as suggested by Table 6 and the
price record for the most recent decade, 1960-69, shown in Table 7. This
decade encompassed periods of surplus, shortage and very close balance
between world production and grindings. The price for the period as a
whole averaged 29.3 cents per pound in 1969 dollar terms. Within the decade
the first six years was a period when production generally exceeded grind-
ings and the price averaged 25.8 cents per pound. In the last four years
production growth lagged and the price averaged 34.6 cents per pound. The
high estimate of 30 cents per pound as the possible long-term equilibrium
price, is based on the fact that the price for the decade as a whole did
average 29.3 cents per pound in real terms.
23.       A number of considerations, however, suiggest that the long-term
equilibrium price will tend to be closer to the mid-twenty-cent price
level than to thirty cents. One is thlat the shortages of the late 1960's,
when the thirty-cent price prevailed, were of extreme severity and duration
(see Table 6). A second consideration is that during the opening years of
that decade, when surpluses were being regiscered, manufacturers' stocks
were being replenished and hence lending considerable support to the market
price. Thirdly, during the three-year period when world production and
grindings were in very close balance, with stocks at normal levels of 4-5
months' supply, the price tended toward the mid-twenty cent level. Lastly,
it must be presumed that as replanting and new plantings occur and given
the improved methods of handling pests and disease, average yields will be
increasing; thus unit costs in the future should tend to decline.



ANNEX 12
Page   7
24.       In tnese circumstances, our present judgement is that the long-
term equilibrium price level may be at or near a spot New York price of 25
cents per pound, in 1969 dollars.
25.       It should be emphasized, as already mentioned, that in any given
year the world crop may differ greatly from trend due to weather, and
hence prices will temporarily move above and below the equilibrium level.
Also for lack of more data, the rate of imports into the Centrally Planned
Countries is assumed not to materially affect demand as projected on the
basis of income growth, etc. in the rest of the world. Actually, this
assumption adds an element of conservatism to the price forecast since the
historical relationship used in the projections relate to a period during
most of which the Centrally Planned Countries accounted for around 6% of
world grindings on the average, compared with 13% in 1967-69. Even assuming
that the rate of increase in the CPC's grindings will decelerate in the
future, they are expected to continue to grow at a considerably higher rate
than those of the rest of the world.
Effect of Bank Projects
26.       By 1975, 8 thousand metric tons of cocoa will be produced from
all the Bank Group cocoa projects, which have been appraised, approved or
considered. This figure consists of rehabilitation, replanting and new
planting. The comparable figures for 1980 and 1985 are 55 thousand metric
tons and 49 thousand metric tons, respectively.
27.       If the Bank project production could all be considered as
additional to our projected world production, (based on the long-term trend
of 3.5% per year), Bank projects would have the effect of potentially raising
the rate of growth of world production from 3.5% per year to 4.0% yearly
from 1975 to 1980; thereafter output from the Bank projects would grow at
a lower rate than in the previous period resulting in 3.4% yearly growth
for total world production from the 1980 base of 2,027 thousand metric tons.
For purposes of further comparison, it might be noted that the yearly rate
of growth in world production fromn 1967/69 to 1975, when output from Bank
projects will he negligible, is expected to be 3.4% yearly. During 1960
to 1965, it was 6.2% yearly.
28.       It is believed, however, that only a portion of the Bank projects'
outptut will be additional.. "Additional" is used here in the strict sense,
which implies that if Bank financing was not granted, the land to be used
for new planting would not be used for cocoa nor would rehabilitation take
place. On this basis, in 1980, of the total Bank project output of 55 thou-
sand metric tons, 42 thousand tons will be additional. In 1985, the
additional amount which may be attributahle to Bank financing is estimated
at 35 thousand1 metric tons out of the total of 49 thousand tons.



ANNEX 12
I'age 8
29        On these assumptions, and further assuming (a) that manufacturers'
stockholding policies will not change and (b) that the price elasticity of
cocoa is -0.3, the potential effect of the additional production would, at
first sight, be either to lower the price of cocoa by around 7% by 1980
(i.e., by about 1.75 cents per pound when the price is in the upper 20-cent
range) or to displace an equivalent amount of higher cost production else-
where - including any higher cost production within the same countries where
the projects are located. By 1985, however, the probable decline in price
would only be by about one cent.  The principal adjustment would take place
in pyice if the period centered around 1980 and 1985 were periods of short
crops, i.e., when the price that otherwise would have ruled would be above
the equilibrium level. If the price in those periods was at or below the
equilibrium level, the displacement effect would have taken place.
30.       It must be emphasized that the above judgments on price or
displacement effects are critically dependent on a large number of assumptions
the validity of which is not certain. For example, if consumer (or producer)
stockholding policy changes, at any pre-assumed price level, the effect of
the "additional" production would be offset or intensified, as the case may
be. Further, the price-elasticity of demand may change, either because of
changes in consumer habits or because of substitution against cocoa at high
prices and in favor of cocoa at low prices (see paragraph 13).  Since, in
addition, (a) it is impossible, due to the lack of the data that would be
necessary, to forecast with any precision or assurance what the likely state
of the cocoa market will be in any given year or group of years in the
future, especially beyond 1975; (b) it is difficult, given our current
information, to refine our judgment of the likely long-term equilibrium
price, or the associated growth rate in production/grindings, beyond the
limits already suggested; and (c) it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively
that in the absence of Bank financing the land in question will not be
planted to cocoa or be rehabilitated, it is difficult to forecast what the
effect of the additional production will be in a specific year or on the
average, or which particular countries will be affected if the displacement
effect becomes operative. A further element that makes fine measurements
difficult is the volatility of the cocoa market already alluded to: in the
period 1946-1969, the average annual deviation of production from trend, as
measured by a five-year moving average, was 5.9% and the annual average
year-to-year deviation 'n price on a similar basis was 13.6%.
31.       The foregoing considerations indicate that great caution must be
exercised in interpreting such estimates of long-term future price effect
of Bank projects as given in paragraph 29. Another question that might be
asked is whether proving assistance to increase future cocoa supply should
not also be considered in the light of its implications for the long-term
strategy of the cocoa market. There is not doubt that, given the low price
elasticity of demand, a shortage increases producing countries' unit prices
in the short-term. It does not, however, automatically follow from this
that maintaining "high" prices would necessarily be to the long-term
interests of the market.  In other words, substitution might be encouraged
which could tend in the long-run to reduce demand.

IV. INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS
32.       Since 1956 international cocoa meetings - first under the auspices
of the Cocoa Study Group of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations and later under UNCTA!) - have been taking place. Throughout
these meetings the main item on the agenda has been the discussion of
some form of stabilization scheme for cocoa. Three UN conferences have
been held for the purpose of negotiating an International Cocoa Agreement
all of which ended without result. The last conference in November/December
1967 considered a draft 5-year agreement whose mechanism consisted of
maintaining the price of cooca between agreed limits, establishing a sales
quota system and operating a buffer stock.
33.       In the meantime, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD called a cocoa
working party meeting (June 1968). However, there were still too many
points of disagreement, such as the size of country quotas and the price
level for cutting them if necessary, distribution of votes, preferences and
the treatment of exports of products from producing countries, to proceed
to a negotiating conference.
34.       In June 1969, UNCTAD convened a technical preparatory meeting,
attended by Ghana, Nigeria, Brazil, Cameroon, Ecuador, Mexico, Ivory Coast,
United States, United Kingdom, Germany F.R., Netherlands, Soviet Union,
Switzerland and France, to discuss some of the outstanding problems (in
particular, definition of cocoa and cocoa products, treatment of sales on
terminal markets, exports of products, long-term contracts, fine and flavor
cocoa, and non-members; and details of export controls and sales quotas).
It was hoped that the 14 countries would be able to settle many of these
problems before proceeding to a negotiating conference. On the last day
of the meeting, however, one of the delegations presented a statement
calling for an increase in the price range from 20 to 29 cents, as set out
in the December 1967 draft agreement, to 25 to 34 cents per pound. In view
of the lack of agreement between the countries, the Secretary-General
indicated that he would be willing to conduct bilateral consultations with
major producers and consumers to see whether the draft of the agreement as
it stood at the time could be salvaged.
35.       In October 1969, the Producers' Alliance (Brazil, Cameroon, Ghana,
Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Togo) 1/ asked UNCTAD to intensify bilateral dis-
cussions with a view to getting the governments to meet and to resume
1/   This alliance was formed in July 1964 for the purpose of "ensuring
adequate supplies of cocoa to the market at reasonable prices".
Actually in mid-October 1964 they suspended sales until the beginning
of February 1965 in an effort to try to raise prices and to reduce
stocks in consumers' hands, This move was not successful since all
the member-countries were not willing to suspend sales and some of
them reportedly sold below the minimum level.

negotiations for an international agreement. In April 1970, the Alliance
met to review the cocoa situation. They supported the price range of 25
to 34 cents per pound (see paragraph 34). In the meantime, they seem to
be going ahead with plans in the hope of bringing about an agreement,
although it may include producers only.
36.       In December 1969 the Secretary-General of UNCTAD had private
talks with six countries (Ghana, Brazil, Ivory Coast, United States, United
Kingdom and France) to ascertain whether there was a genuine desire for a
scheme to regulate the trade of cocoa. Although the results of these
discussions have not been published, it is known that all the countries
concerned indicated readiness to complete the preparations for the conclu-
sion of a cocoa agreement without any further delay.
37.       In June 1970, UNCTAD called another country consultation meeting
of the 14 members.  (See paragraphs 33 and 34.)  The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) was also invited to attend to explain the IMF buffer stock
facility. No agreement between producers and consumers was reached on the
increased price range, however (25 to 34 cents per pound instead of 20 to
29 cents per pound). Several countries also questioned the type of quota
system such as sales quota or export quota. Although a date was not set
for resumption of the meetings, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD was asked
to continue his consultations with both producers and consumers.
38.       It should be noted that the yearly price projection, as given in
this paper, has not made any allowance for the operation of an International
Cocoa Agreement. In present circumstances, no agreement seems to be in
sight at least for the early part of the 1970's.

Calculated "total stocks"
The difference between world production, adjusted for 1% loss in weight during the movement of
supplies from producing to consuming countries, and world grindings is assumed to be the yearly
carry-over. "Total stockst' are an accumulation of the yearly carry-overs, making no allowance
for cocoa which may have been destroyed in the producing country. Since actual total stock
information is not published the figures can only be regarded as estimates. The basis for the
calculations is as follows: For the period 1906 to 1969, the end-1956 figure was used as the
starting point for the calculations, both forward and backward, since FAO in their CCP/Cocoa/62/L,
1 April 1962 paper indicated that total end-stocks in 1955/56 amounted to 290 thousand metric
tons (this figure was reduced by 5 thousand tons because the consumption figure used at that
time was later revised upward by 5 thousand tons).
