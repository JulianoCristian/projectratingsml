A Project Unit, responsible to the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Natural Resources of Western State, would be\n            established to administer the project and conduct soil\n            surveys. Some 450 agricultural superintendents, agricultural\n            assistants and special labourers would be trained in modern\n            cocoa production techniques with the assistance and\n            cooperation of the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria which\n            is located in Western State. The approximately 8,000\n            participating farmers would receive credits in cash and in\n            kind for labour, seedlings, fertilizers and pesticides\n            directly from the Project Unit. The project would also\n            include provision of vehicles and equipment required to\n            prepare a project for a second stage of Western State's\n            cocoa rehabilitation program."}, "docdt": "1971-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
