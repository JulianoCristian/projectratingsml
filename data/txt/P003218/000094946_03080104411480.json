The\n            project is rated against its original objectives, which were\n            not achieved. The original project design failed to deliver\n            and it is on this that the project is rated. The\n            restructuring and decentralization of the central ministry\n            took much longer than anticipated. Many donors became\n            disillusioned particularly since a number had argued for\n            completing the restructuring before this project. The\n            concept of the project as an umbrella to unify 180 separate\n            donor-funded projects, was not sufficiently owned by the\n            donors and was something of a mirage in the absence of a\n            common donor funding pot, which had never been a realistic\n            possibility. The Bank belatedly, after three years, at the\n            midterm review, narrowed the concept to support a limited\n            number of specific investments. Even the project as\n            restructured/scaled down does not appear to have achieved\n            most of the revised objectives. With respect to\n            restructuring the ministry, this had some initial benefits\n            through decentralization but modest impact on the efficiency\n            of the headquarters. With respect to research, project funds\n            were used for a number of specific research programs of some\n            value and for setting up the Golden Valley Agricultural\n            Research Trust (GART), but most of this does not seem to\n            have increased the flow or quality of technology much. The\n            new of released new varieties appears to have been\n            declining. Extension did shift direction from the top-down\n            training & visit (T&V) system to a more promising\n            participatory group-based approach, but, with operating fund\n            problems, it is questionable in practice how much real\n            impact this has had. With respect to sector reforms, where\n            there is largely limited and indirect attribution to the\n            project or to the associated program dialogue,\n            implementation performance has been mixed and unstable.\n            Fertilizer subsidies were removed but have been revived. A\n            proposed new Crop Marketing Authority will aim to attempt to\n            stabilize prices and through purchasing and selling coarse\n            grains without impacting on private sector marketing.\n            Lessons learned include: 1) The minimum requirements to\n            reduce risk in sector-wide programs to an acceptable level\n            are: realism of expectations; a strong lead agency with, at\n            most, modest reform needs; clear characterization of the\n            donor harmonization sought; a sector where the timing is\n            right; and a depth and breadth of government ownership\n            sufficient for the scale of the task. 2) Projecting the\n            detailed steps and phasing for policy and institutional\n            reform is important. 3) Defining what is a realistic outcome\n            within an immediate project time frame is important--the\n            project lacked shorter-term monitorable substantive\n            performance indicators and did not correct for this at the\n            Mid-term Review. Project supervision reports need to reflect\n            updated progress towards achievement of objectives and to\n            signal to management what actions are needed. 5) In\n            preparing for policy reforms the impact of each reform on\n            the productive capacity and incomes of the poor in different\n            locations should be projected."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
