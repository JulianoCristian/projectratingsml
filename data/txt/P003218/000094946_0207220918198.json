ProiecProject\n            sustainability is rated as likely. World Bank performance is\n            assessed as satisfactory, while Borrower performance is\n            marginally satisfactory. There were five lessons learned: 1)\n            For a complex institutional reform program to succeed it is\n            essential that there is sustained and broad-based commitment\n            to, and ownership of proposed changes. A major weakness of\n            the the project was that it depended on the championship of\n            a few officials who had moved on by the time the project\n            became effective. 2) The attempt to carry out institutional\n            (restructuring, decentralization) and policy reforms (credit\n            policy, input marketing policy, output marketing policy,\n            land policy) while implementing sector-wide initiatives was\n            difficult for a weak implementing institution like the\n            Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MAC). 3)\n            Transitional measures and expected output should be clearly\n            defined. A transitional period was needed to put in place\n            the institutional framework and pilot certain initiatives.\n            4) For complex projects and programs, it is essential that\n            there is a unit fully responsible for the day-to-day running\n            of the operation. 5) Risks and mitigating measures should be\n            identified realistically. No provision was made for any\n            delays in restructuring MAC. Similarly, no provision was\n            made for the risk of government failing to adopt and\n            implement the Letter of Sector Policy Development."}, "docdt": "2002-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
