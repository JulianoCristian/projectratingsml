The\n            lessons learned indicate that in order to understand\n            specific lessons from the execution of the subprojects, and\n            to address the long term forestry issues in Nicaragua, the\n            PCU commissioned two studies. Innovative projects should not\n            necessarily reflect the prevailing Bank's strategy for\n            the sector. Deforestation, inter alia, is the result of\n            assigning low value to forest and forest products. Success\n            in establishing sustainable forestry sector management\n            requires effective and meaningful participation of\n            stakeholders. Political support and Government commitment to\n            a long-term goal will create confidence in the system.\n            Sustainable forestry development efforts cannot succeed\n            without a holistic approach that deals with land security\n            and agricultural productivity. New technology transfers that\n            are appropriate and divisible are not necessarily expensive.\n            Assigning forests protective status might be less efficient\n            unless supported by an incentive mechanism to support\n            sustainable management."}, "docdt": "2004-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
