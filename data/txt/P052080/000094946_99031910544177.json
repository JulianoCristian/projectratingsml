The project consists of four components. 1)\n            Technical assistance to private and communal sector forestry\n            will finance technical assistance, training, workshops,\n            studies, office equipment and supplies, vehicles, and\n            operational expenses. 2) Assistance to forestry sector\n            institutional reform will finance technical assistance and\n            training to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. 3)\n            Pilot subprojects will develop and test innovative\n            activities and new mechanisms for finding solutions to\n            priority forestry sector problems, including innovative\n            models for reforestation and land rehabilitation, forestry\n            resource management, increasing decentralization of forestry\n            functions, public-private sector partnerships, creative\n            financing mechanisms for sustainable forestry management and\n            reforestation. The project will finance a program of grants\n            to private sector, nongovernmental organizations,\n            communities, and municipalities to carry out the pilot\n            sub-projects which included specific actions for monitoring\n            and evaluating the results of implementation. 4) The last\n            component will finance the Project Coordination Unit, which\n            is responsible for overall project administration."}, "docdt": "1998-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
