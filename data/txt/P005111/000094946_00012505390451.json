One\n            hundred percent of project objectives was achieved But for\n            delay in completing the project by 18 months, the project\n            might have merited a \"highly satisfactory\" rating.\n            Both World Bank and Borrower performances were satisfactory.\n            Key lessons learned include the following: For procurement\n            of specialized contracts, e.g., gas meters, supervisory\n            control and data acquisition and monitoring system (SCADA),\n            etc., greater review should be made on the specifications\n            prepared by the consultants. Second, the consultants staff\n            should work closely with PETROGAS, the petroleum gas company\n            in Cairo, and not entirely in their head office. Third, the\n            World Bank's close supervision and close continuous\n            communication in resolving outstanding issues greatly\n            contributed to achieving success."}, "docdt": "1999-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
