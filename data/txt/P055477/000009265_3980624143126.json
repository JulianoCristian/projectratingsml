The\n            mining of metallic minerals generates solid waste, some of\n            it hazardous, and problems with water, soil, and air\n            contamination; and it poses risks for flora and fauna and\n            for people's health and safety. In arid and semiarid\n            zones where water is already scarce and access to\n            underground water is expensive, the water supply is further\n            taxed. Where most of the mining areas are located upriver\n            from the agricultural areas, surface and underground waters\n            are affected. Effective waste disposal is important to\n            prevent tons of residue waste from drying up and being\n            widely dispersed by frequent, strong winds. Non-metal mining\n            may produce air pollution, excessive noise, and vibrations\n            when this activity is located near population centers.\n            Abandoned caves from excavations can become flooded and in\n            summertime be used as makeshift spas/\"seaside\n            resorts,\" which has led to human fatalities.
