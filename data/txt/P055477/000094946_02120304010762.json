Several lessons are drawn\n            specifically from the project as follows. Creating an\n            enabling environment, with responsive institutions to\n            interface with the private sector is not only important, but\n            it enabled significant contributions to the country in terms\n            of mining exploration, and development. Moreover, the\n            integrated approach to sector reform, outlines the\n            applicability of the project and its components, as to the\n            development of mining rights, and environmental management\n            capacity, including the success of a well-defined\n            coordination between the federal, and provincial\n            implementing units, which established strong leadership, and\n            active participation at the provincial level, providing a\n            decisive stability factor. It is important to note the\n            usefulness of the geodetic, and environmental data\n            infrastructure, particularly for infrastructure, e.g. roads\n            construction, national hazards mitigation measures, and land\n            use planning. Nonetheless, sustainability of some of the\n            project's institutional achievement might be\n            jeopardized by the adverse macroeconomic situation of the\n            country. However, core administrative functions are, as a\n            rule, sustainable after closure of the project."}, "docdt": "2002-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
