institutional reforms which encourage the\n            environmentally sound expansion of private investment in\n            mining. There are five components in this project. 1)\n            Institutional framework development will include\n            reorganization and staffing of key administrative units,\n            setting-up of efficient work procedures, and training of\n            staff in the public mining agencies of the 17 provinces this\n            project concentrates on. 2) Mining cadastre and registry\n            system will improve the reference mining geodetic network,\n            introduce unified registering procedures and clear up\n            backlog of pending concession applications. 3) Environmental\n            management will carry out environmental and socio-economic\n            baseline studies in selected mining districts. 4) Unified\n            mining information system will strengthen the information\n            management units in the 17 provinces and provide hardware\n            and software. 5) Project coordination will monitor,\n            supervise, and provide management control for all components\n            and for the overall project."}, "docdt": "1998-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
