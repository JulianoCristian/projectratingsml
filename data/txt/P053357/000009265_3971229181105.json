"The quick disbursing Rehabilitation\n            Credit Project provides financial support for the first set\n            of measures in Albania s economic recovery program. These\n            measures aim to address some of the key structural\n            weaknesses which have contributed to the recent crisis, and\n            to alleviate the increased poverty and unemployment\n            generated by the crisis. Specifically, the credit supports\n            (1) the winding down of the pyramid schemes by appointing\n            external administrators to control these companies operating\n            the schemes, and to manage the recovery and distribution of\n            their assets to depositors; (2) reforms in the banking\n            sector including enhancing private sector participation in\n            the three commercial and savings banks, as well as\n            strengthening the legal and judicial framework, the\n            financial infrastructure, and banking supervision; (3)\n            increased budgetary outlays for social assistance through\n            block grants to local authorities, especially to benefit the\n            elderly and orphans, and increasing the involvement of\n            nongovernmental organizations; and (4) employment promotion\n            through community work programs, adjusting social insurance\n            legislation, and implementing a new financing and accounting\n            system for the unemployment insurance program. The Credit is\n            closely coordinated with the conditions of structural reform\n            in the financial sector approved under the IMF's\n            post-conflict Emergency Assistance Program, which underpins\n            the macroeconomic framework. The Credit will be released in\n            a single tranche."}, "docdt": "1997-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
