The main\n            challenge was to create an industrial base for Ghana. The\n            Trade and Investment Gateway Project invested in physical\n            and institutional linkages between the port, the Export\n            Processing Zone (EPZ), and the Multipurpose Industrial Park\n            (MPIP) for trade promotion. It produced integrative\n            multi-polar special economic zones (SEZ) in Tema and a\n            capillary of free zones enterprises in the rest of the\n            country. As a result, thousands of job opportunities were\n            created, and export revenue increased. The discovery and\n            exploitation of oil and gas in Ghana, the integration of\n            local competitiveness platforms had been an appropriate\n            approach to industrial policy and structural change. The\n            platforms helped to build integrative economic clusters in\n            the Ghana Western Corridor, support growth, and foster the\n            country\u2019s sustainable participation in globalization."}, "docdt": "2011-04-12T05:32:05Z"}
