Some lessons\n            learned included: private developers for Export Processing\n            Zone (EPZ) do not have to be international. Attracting firms\n            to the EPZ does not have to be led by an international\n            private developer. The international private developer\n            failed to perform and the national developers took over and\n            the EPZ is fully operational. Timely restructuring of a\n            project can lead to a successful implementation of a\n            project. When a project becomes very difficult to implement\n            it's usually a sign that there is a need to revisit the\n            fundamentals of the design and its concepts to enable\n            retrofitting or adjustments of key features of the project\n            for it to work."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
