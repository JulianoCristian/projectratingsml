There are two main components. The\n            first finances feasibility studies of a railway corridor and\n            marshaling yard, and detailed engineering, construction, and\n            supervision of the off-site infrastructure for the Tema\n            export-processing zone, including constructing access roads,\n            side drainage, and associated works; constructs water supply\n            systems, wastewater disposable systems, and off-site\n            drainage systems; supplies and installs electrical power and\n            transformers; builds a container devanning area outside of\n            the port and improves port container and airport cargo\n            facilities; and implements the environmental management\n            plan. The second component promotes investment and removes\n            administrative bottlenecks to facilitate trade. It builds\n            capacity by changing operational procedures, human\n            resources, and international standards compliance in\n            customs, excise, and preventive services; increasing private\n            participation in the ports and harbor authority; converting\n            the civil aviation authority into a regulatory agency and\n            operationalizing open skies; modernizing immigration\n            services regulations and operating procedure; providing\n            country and investment support to the investment promotion\n            center; funding expertise, equipment, training, and\n            operational support to the free zones board; and manages the\n            Gateway program."}, "docdt": "1998-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
