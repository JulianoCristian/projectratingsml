It was\n            among the forerunners of decentralization. It established a\n            legal framework that clearly separates service provision\n            from policy making, thus allowing private sector\n            participation. The key to success in the Colombian water\n            sector reform has been the development of homegrown\n            solutions, and at times, skillfully adapting models used\n            elsewhere to the particular circumstances and culture of\n            Colombia. As a result, Colombia has made substantial\n            progress in the expansion of water supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) services. By 2002, urban water supply access was 99\n            percent, rural water supply coverage 71 percent. Sanitation\n            access has also been upgraded with urban coverage of 96\n            percent and rural coverage of 54 percent. Over the years,\n            the World Bank has supported Colombia through advisory work,\n            capacity building and lending. Since 1988, the World Bank\n            has provided a series of loans with a total value of over\n            US$ 700 million to the Colombian WSS sector."}, "docdt": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
