                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project aims to improve the provision of water supply and sanitation services in Colombia in a financially efficient and sustainable manner through the
                         provision of capital investment subsidies for poverty-focused coverage expansion and service quality improvement. The Project will (a) scale-up the
                         involvement of the private sector in medium-sized cities through the introduction of performance-based management arrangements with specialized operators;
                         (b) support service-improvement related investment through targeted capital grants in small, medium, and large urban areas served by public utilities; and (c)
                         deliver appropriate water supply and sanitation investments in Colombia?s underserved rural areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
