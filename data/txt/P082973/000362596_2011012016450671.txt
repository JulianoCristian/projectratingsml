Amendment to the Loan Agreement 
Excellency: 
 
We refer to the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia (the “Borrower”) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the “Bank”) dated June 2, 2005, with respect to 
the above-captioned Project (“Loan Agreement”).  Capitalized terms used in this letter (“Amendment 
Letter”) and not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Loan Agreement.  
 
Pursuant to your letters dated December 17, 2008, August 10, 2010 and December 13, 2010, we 
are pleased to inform you that the Bank hereby agrees to amend the Loan Agreement as follows:  
 
1. 
The table in Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended and replaced to read in its entirety as 
 
set forth in the attachment to this Amendment Letter. 
 
2. 
Section 2.03 of the Loan Agreement is amended and replaced to read in its entirety as follows: 
 
“Section 2.03.  The Closing Date shall be March 31, 2011 or such later date as the Bank shall 
establish.  The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later date.” 
 
3. 
The last line of Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement which reads “the Project is expected to be 
 
completed by October 31, 2008” is hereby deleted in its entirety. 
 
Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing amendments by signing and dating this 
Amendment Letter in the spaces provided below.  Henceforward, all other provisions of the Financing 
Agreement, except as amended through this Amendment Letter, shall remain in full force and effect.  This 
Amendment Letter shall be executed in two counterparts each of which shall be an original.  Upon 
confirmation, please return one fully executed original to us.
