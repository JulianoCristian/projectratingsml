The Project will (a)\n            scale-up the involvement of the private sector in\n            medium-sized cities, through the introduction of\n            performance-based management arrangements with specialized\n            operators; (b) support service-improvement related\n            investment through targeted capital grants in small- and\n            medium-size cities, and in some high poverty peri-urban\n            areas of large cities, served by public utilities; and, (c)\n            deliver appropriate water supply and sanitation investments\n            to Colombia's underserved rural areas. Consistent with\n            the scope and objectives, the Project will have two\n            components: Component 1 - Municipal Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Infrastructure, to finance investments in the\n            rehabilitation and construction/expansion of primary and\n            secondary water and sewerage networks; investments in water\n            treatment plants, pumping stations and main collectors,\n            wastewater treatment infrastructure including treatment\n            plants and discharge infrastructure; and, construction and\n            implementation supervision at the municipal level through\n            independent supervision consultants. The Component will\n            finance two types of subprojects: a) infrastructure\n            investment subprojects, to be accompanied by technical\n            assistance for utility reform; and, (b) modernization\n            subprojects, which would involve financing of both\n            investment, and the introduction of private sector\n            management for local utilities. Component 2 - Program\n            Management, Benchmarking, Monitoring and Evaluation, to\n            finance consultant services and equipment to strengthen the\n            capacity of the Ministry of environment, Housing and\n            Regional Development (MAVDT) to implement the Project at the\n            central level, and provide technical assistance to the\n            participating municipal utilities. Activities to be financed\n            under this Component include: supply and installation of\n            information technology equipment to allow for an efficient\n            monitoring of utility performance, and program\n            implementation; technical assistance and training to the\n            MAVDT, for Project implementation, monitoring and financial\n            management; and, other operating expenses for the MAVDT, and\n            in particular, The Directorate of Potable Water and Basic\n            Sanitation (DAPSBA)."}, "docdt": "2005-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
