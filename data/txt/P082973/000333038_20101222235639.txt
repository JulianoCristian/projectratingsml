7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The Project aims to improve the provision of water supply and sanitation services in Colombia in a 
financially efficient and sustainable manner through the provision of capital investment subsidies for 
poverty-focused coverage expansion and service quality improvement. The Project will (a) scale-up the 
involvement of the private sector in medium-sized cities through the introduction of performance-based 
management arrangements with specialized operators; (b) support service-improvement related investment 
through targeted capital grants in small, medium, and large urban areas served by public utilities; and (c) 
deliver appropriate water supply and sanitation investments in Colombia?s underserved rural areas.
