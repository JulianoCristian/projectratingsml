"7281", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Water and Sanitation\n            Sector Support Project for Colombia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the subprojects were selected by the community to solve\n            specific problems. This demand-driven selection process\n            resulted in a piecemeal operation with subprojects financing\n            components or parts of an overall system. Challenges to this\n            approach included difficulties in defining baselines and\n            target quality indicators, a lack of coordination with\n            components outside the subproject that are needed to have\n            the system in operation, and missed opportunities to\n            identify more efficient and cost-effective solutions. To\n            that end, there is a need to include technical assistance\n            and policies that enable the execution of overall system\n            assessments and planning in order to derive investment\n            projects. In an innovative approach to institutional reform,\n            the Project linked institutional reform activities with\n            investments in works. The institutional reform related\n            activities were included as conditions in subproject\n            contracts. As a result, 10 specialized operator and 19\n            public companies were incorporated in the provision of Water\n            Supply and Sanitation (WSS) and technical assistance was\n            provided to identify municipalities to take steps to improve\n            financial viability and accountability and strengthen\n            operation and implementation capacity. Performance\n            indicators and results, however, were not adequately\n            documented during project supervision. There is a need to\n            improve internal capacities at the utility level to collect\n            and report performance indicators, as well as to increase\n            oversight and technical assistance from the Ministry and the\n            Bank to better measure project results and extract lessons\n            learned. The quality of preparation and attention to\n            safeguards at appraisal was reasonably good; however, the\n            Project encountered safeguard issues due to the low capacity\n            at the local level and insufficient oversight. To that end,\n            the Bank and Borrower need to ensure that social and\n            environment specialists are key members of the implementing\n            unit, comprehensive training and instruments (e.g.\n            environmental management plans in construction and\n            supervision contracts) are specified and applied to all\n            levels of the implementing structure (i.e. municipalities,\n            construction supervisors and government), and that specific\n            monitoring indicators are included and follow-up during supervision."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
