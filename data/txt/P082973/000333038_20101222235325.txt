RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. 
This Restructuring Paper responds to various request of the Republic of Colombia (the 
Borrower) to amend the Loan Agreement for Water and Sanitation Sector Support Project (7281-
CO) to encompass the following proposed changes: (i) an extension of Closing Date; (ii) a 
reallocation of Loan Proceeds; and (iii) a consolidation expenditure categories. 
2. 
These changes will enable the Republic of Colombia to: (i) complete 13 water and 
sanitation subprojects currently under implementation; (ii) complete implementation of the 
Remedial Action Plan (RAP) for Safeguard Management; (iii) conduct an independent end-
Project evaluation; and (iv) allow for the orderly completion of the Project and closing of the 
Loan.  
PROJECT STATUS 
 
3. 
The Board approved this Project on March 22, 2005 in the amount of US$70.0 million.  
Overall, the Government’s performance has been satisfactory. Following the signing of the Loan 
Agreement on June 2, 2005, the Project became effective on August 31, 2005. The Project’s 
Development Objective indicator that 1.2 million consumers receive improved access to reliable 
and safe water supply and sanitation is on target to be fully achieved with the completion of 
subprojects currently under implementation.  In addition, the Government has made significant 
progress to resolve the number of land acquisition, easement, resettlement, and indigenous 
people (IP) cases through the implementation of the RAP.  The Bank has fully disbursed the total 
Loan amount of US$ 70 million, but the Borrower still needs to document US$14.1 million. The 
Loan fiduciary ratings are satisfactory. 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
Extension of Closing Date
4. 
An extension of the Closing Date from December 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011 was 
discussed with the Borrower during the November 2010 technical discussions. The Borrower has 
formally through a letter dated December 13, 2010 requested an extension to March 31, 2011.   
This will be the third extension of the Project for a total accumulative period of 23 months.  
5. 
The proposed extension is necessary to: (i) complete 13 water and sanitation subprojects, 
with a total value of about US$ 10.6 million; (ii) complete implementation of the RAP approved 
by the Bank on April 2010; and (iii) conduct an independent end-Project evaluation.  
Implementation setbacks, namely obtaining construction permits, land acquisition, lack of 
counterpart funds, and weak contractors, have been overcome, and an action plan with concrete

and time bound steps to complete the Project on the proposed closing date have been agreed 
between the Bank and the Borrower.

7. 
The proposed reallocation, corresponding to an amount of US$ 416,730.68 between 
Categories (1) and (3), is necessary to implement the Safeguard Remedial Action Plan and 
conduct the Project final evaluation.  The reallocation does not result in a change to the Project 
activities or require modification to the Project description in the Loan Agreement.  
8. 
On April 21, 2009, the Bank sent a notice approving the Borrower’s request to 
consolidate Categories 1 and to 2 into one Category to finance both Part A.1 and Part A.2 of the 
Project in order to simplify internal Project accounting.  Although the amounts were consolidated 
under Category 1, the description of said Category remained unchanged (not reflecting that the 
amount allocated to Category 1 included the amount of the Loan to finance expenditures for both 
Part A.1 and Part A.2 of the Project).   To properly consolidate the amounts and maintain the 
consistency in the description of said Categories, these changes are included in the Amendment 
effective retroactively to the date of the Notice sent by the Bank.
