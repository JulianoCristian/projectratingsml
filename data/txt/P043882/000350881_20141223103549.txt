IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This report provides lessons of experience and reflects the findings from a thematic
cluster of project performance assessment reports (PPARs) on farm restructuring in
transition economies in Europe and Central Asia. Bank-supported projects in five
countries form the basis of this review. In all the five countries – Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Romania and Tajikistan – there was an extreme urgency when the projects were
being designed to resuscitate primary agricultural production and the agribusiness
following the end of Soviet era.

The report also contributes to IEG’s FY2010 evaluation of the World Bank Group’s
support to Agriculture and Agribusiness, which focuses on contributions to agricultural
growth and productivity in the last decade.

The thematic overview pulls together evidence from FY2008 and FY2010 PPARs. The
FY2010 PPARs cover the Armenia Agricultural Reform Support Project (approved
FY1998, Credits 30350 and 30351) and the Georgia Agricultural Development Project
(approved FY1997, Credit 29410). These PPARs have not previously been published and
form Annexes A and B of this report.

The FY2008 PPARs—which have already been separately published—are: the Tajikistan
Farm Privatization Support Project (approved FY1999, Credits 32400 & 32401); a cluster
assessment of the Azerbaijan Agricultural Development and Credit Project (approved
FY1999, Credit 32360) and the Farm Privatization Project (approved FY1997, Credit
29330); and a cluster assessment of the Romania General Cadastre and Land Registration
Project (approved FY1998, Loan 4258) and the Agricultural Support Services Project
(approved FY2000, Loan 4533). These assessments are available on IEG’s website.

Each PPAR was prepared by IEG based on the Implementation Completion Reports,
Staff Appraisal Reports, Loan Agreements and a review of Bank files. An IEG mission
visited Armenia and Georgia in November 2008, and held interviews with a number of
stakeholders including representatives of Government and the implementing agencies,
plus local staff, direct beneficiaries and other donors in Armenia. The cooperation and
assistance of all the stakeholders is gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, the draft reports for the Armenia Agricultural
Reform Support Project and the Georgia Agricultural Development Project were sent
separately to the concerned government officials and agencies for their review and
comment. No comments were received from the Borrowers.

Summary
IEG assessed the performance of 7 projects in 5 transition economies in the Europe and
Central Asia (ECA) Region. Four of the countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and
Georgia) were former republics in the USSR. The fifth country, Romania, is now a
member of the European Union. The projects were prepared following the generalized
collapse of these economies in the early 1990s, which forced the pace of efforts to
privatize and restructure the socialist agro-industrial complex and industrial farming
systems.

This review addresses the following questions:

              Was the Bank’s support for the agricultural sector relevant?
              What progress did the countries make with agricultural sector reform?
              What were the project outcomes and the associated risks?
              How satisfactorily did the Bank perform?

With respect to relevance, the Bank’s overall strategy was informed by the solid and
comprehensive body of analytic work it conducted on the ECA agricultural transition.
The objectives and the design of individual projects were for the most part consistent
with the overall strategy and benefited from this solid analytic underpinning.

The Bank kept a detailed scorecard of sector reform progress. The biggest strides were
taken by Romania (spurred by the EU accession). Armenia and Azerbaijan also did fairly
well; but Georgia regressed (owing to the disruption caused by civil strife) and Tajikistan
languished, remaining to a large extent a planned economy. With respect to specific areas
of reform, price and market liberalization advanced most. There was less progress with
solving the financing problems of agriculture, the liberalization of agro-processing and
input supply, and with institutional reform.

In terms of outcomes and risks, six of the seven projects fell on the satisfactory side of
the ratings divide, performance generally benefiting from strong government
commitment. The risks to development outcome derive mainly from concerns about the
sustainability of rural financial services and the capacity of the small farmers to compete
in the more open trading environment. The most robust performance and prospects for
sustainability was shown by the projects that sought to strengthen land administration.

Bank performance was, in most aspects, satisfactory, although supervision was
somewhat stronger than quality at entry. Particular sources of strength were the Bank’s
well-focused analysis, its eventual de-emphasis of policy-based operations relative to
investment projects (a previous IEG evaluation found that investment operations, partly
because they are implemented over a longer period than adjustment operations, lent
themselves better to the nurturing of institutions and the development of capacity), its
emphasis on learning by doing and its hands-on supervision. By comparison,
performance on monitoring and evaluation was weak and quality at entry was sometimes
hampered by an over optimistic assessment of local capacity.
                                             x


IEG draws the following lessons:

      Given the large attitudinal shift involved in the agricultural transition, government
       officials and project staff need substantial technical assistance and training before
       operations can be expected to succeed.

      In the complex and rapidly changing ECA environment, sound donor
       coordination was critical.

      With respect to agriculture and agribusiness services, project experience
       demonstrated that farmers and rural business owners will respond enthusiastically
       to innovative technologies corresponding to their needs.

      On land administration, the Bank’s international experience strengthened the
       design of projects in ECA, and these projects showed the importance of avoiding
       a “one-size-fits- all” approach and the sound payoff to adopting a unified
       approach to develop property registry and cadastre.

      The rural finance operations showed that with appropriate regulation, technical
       advice and staff training banks that lend to rural areas can operate sustainably.
       Also, non-bank financial intermediaries have an important role to play in rural
       areas; but it is important to be realistic about their capabilities.

1. Introduction
1.1     This review is based on IEG assessments of 7 projects in 5 transition economies in
the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region (Table 1 below). Four of the countries (Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Georgia) were former republics in the USSR. The fifth country,
Romania, is now a member of the European Union. The projects were formulated during a
period of hesitant recovery following the general economic collapse of the early 1990s,
which was associated with and exacerbated by the rapid privatization and restructuring of the
socialist agro-industrial complex and industrial farming systems.

1.2      This review addresses the following questions:

                          Was the Bank’s support for the agricultural sector relevant?
                          What progress did the countries make with agricultural sector reform?
                          What were the project outcomes and the associated risks?
                          How satisfactorily did the Bank perform?

The Project Setting
1.3      In the former Soviet Bloc nations the agricultural transition began around 1990.1
Initially, in the five countries assessed in this report, agriculture’s share of GDP grew
because other sectors contracted faster. 2 But from 1996 onwards agriculture began a steady
contraction relative to the economy as a whole (Figure 1).

1.4     After the initial collapse of farm output it was expected that sector growth would
resume. The agriculture supply response that many within and outside the region expected to
emerge early on was complicated by the removal of consumer subsidies and the contraction
of export demand as the trading system collapsed. The essence of the agricultural transition
was the state’s withdrawal from its traditional role as claimant of rents from farming and
agro-manufacturing. This role passed in stages to the beneficiaries of land reform, collective
farm restructuring and privatization of the agro-industrial complex. With the removal of
Soviet-era subsidies on machinery, farm chemicals, animal feeds and energy, and “credit”,
the terms of trade moved quickly and in most countries quite strongly against agriculture—
particularly against the livestock sector which had been particularly sheltered.3

1.5     Throughout the Former Soviet Union and Romania there was an urgent need to
increase productivity. During the socialist era, agriculture and food production were
regulated by government plans, without regard to efficiencies or comparative advantage.
Input provision was often dominated by a few state-owned firms and a few inefficient state
buyers dominated marketing channels. The large-scale livestock and crop cooperatives from
the Soviet era were unsuited to market-based private agriculture. It was a challenge to create
a system of farming based on private ownership of land and responsive to market signals.
The scrapping of the socialist command and control system centered on the break-up of
collective farms and the privatization (or restructuring) of agricultural and agribusiness
assets. This was accompanied by a collapse of the centrally planned marketing chains and
foreign trade arrangements, as well as input supply systems. At the same time, the
agricultural finance system stopped operating.

1.6     Each country took its own path. For example, with respect to land reform, Azerbaijan
opted for comprehensive privatization, distributing plots more or less equally among rural
households. Armenia followed a similar approach, while also settling displaced families from
Azerbaijan on former state farm lands. Romania opted for near complete privatization, but
based on restitution. Possibly this was the only socially acceptable approach (as was the case
in other countries); but it did lead to “second generation” problems that were largely avoided
in Azerbaijan and Armenia. Meanwhile, in Tajikistan, the government granted heritable use
rights in the non-cotton growing zones to the north but maintained control over cotton
production and marketing decisions in the mono-cropped areas of the South. Similarly,
diverse techniques for privatizing the agro-industrial state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were
employed, ranging from management-employee buyouts, to voucher privatizations, to
outright sale of the more attractive assets. Attempts were also made to restructure rather than
privatize “strategic” SOEs, especially the large-scale grain stores and mills.

1.7     These early reforms fragmented farm holdings in all five countries, creating a large
cohort of semi-subsistence private farmers, and disrupted input supply and marketing
arrangements.4 Research and extension systems were poorly adapted to serve small farmers,
the available crop and livestock technologies being more suited to the industrial crop and
livestock operations characteristic of the socialist period. Agribusiness plant was obsolete,
risks were high and inefficiencies were pervasive.

1.8      With demise of the material balance planning systems and the curtailing of quasi-
fiscal transfers via the state banking structure, financial “markets” stopped working. There
was a pressing need to develop commercial banking, with its associated regulatory structure
and supporting services (clearings, credit bureaus, savings accounts, etc.) as well as a broader
array of financial services not previously available to commercial enterprises and households.
Lacking access to organized credit lines in the immediate aftermath of decollectivization, the
new class of smallholders retreated into semi-subsistence production while rural
entrepreneurs were forced to rely on savings and informal borrowing.

1.9      Large pockets of rural poverty persisted. Following the break-up and privatization of
Soviet-era collective farms, a large pool of elderly farmers was left operating tiny farms on a
semi-subsistence basis throughout the FSU and in Romania. These small-holders have
neither the incentive nor the skill needed to adapt to commercial farming. They have shown
little inclination to join marketing cooperatives and other associative institutions, or to
engage in contract farming with processors and marketing agents. But the area operated by
individual farms is growing in size through leasing and (to a lesser extent) sale of land, a
process that is now permitted by laws governing real property and contract. The effect was
an inevitable shedding of farm labor as productivity-increasing investments were introduced
and farm operations were modernized.5


2. Was the Bank’s support for the agricultural sector
relevant?
Relevance of Overall Strategy
2.1     The Bank’s decision to assign priority to farm and agro-industrial restructuring was
entirely appropriate. In all five countries there was an urgent need to revive agriculture and
agribusiness. The overriding aim of the projects assessed here was to increase rural
productivity and incomes, with support for smallholder farming and private enterprises being
central. Operations were designed to promote private and financial sector development,
public-private partnerships in farm technology transfer and business development services,
infrastructure development and modernization programs and reform of government
supporting services.

2.2     Country Assistance Strategies in all five countries gave an appropriate priority to
agricultural sector development, through sector work and policy notes, via thematic
components of adjustment lending and later Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits, and by
targeting critical technical assistance and investment needs.

2.3    The analytic work carried out by the Bank’s agriculture unit in ECA was highly
relevant, helping to underpin country assistance strategies and development policy operations
throughout the Region. ECA-wide, sector work progressed through four phases. First, in the

5. Kharatyan (2007); Burcroff & Ahmadov (2008); and World Bank (2007).
                                                    5


early 1990s comprehensive reviews provided a benchmark assessment for various ECA
economies, setting out an agenda for policy reform. (One of the largest of these was a food
sector study, begun before the collapse of the Soviet Union.) Second, in the mid-1990s, the
focus shifted to specific themes. A substantial body of work on land reform and farm
restructuring led to the Bank becoming the leading source of knowledge about these issues in
Central and Eastern Europe.6 Other studies were devoted to rural finance, trade and research
and extension. During a third phase (the latter part of the 1990s), a series of sub-regional
reports were produced, focused mainly on accession to the European Union. Regional
seminars based on this work involved close dialogue with the European Commission.
Another multi-country initiative tackled the question of farm debt in the CIS countries,
influencing debt settlement legislation in Moldova and Ukraine. After 2000, a fourth phase
involved the next cycle of comprehensive sector reviews, including Moldova, Macedonia and
Serbia. In short, within the space of a few years the Bank became a major repository of
knowledge on ECA. A 1997 report noted that donors, firms and academics were major users
of the Bank’s ECA studies—to a greater extent than in other regions.7

2.4     With respect to the five countries covered by this review, the analysis and policy
dialogue were highly relevant. In Armenia, Georgia and Romania dialogue was based on the
findings and recommendations from comprehensive agricultural sector reviews. In
Azerbaijan the Bank carried out an informal agricultural sector review in 1995, because the
government was not yet ready for a formal review and supporting Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM). But the government did agree to the first of two poverty assessments
and to a public expenditure review, and later to an agricultural marketing study in 2005-06
and a CEM in 2008-09. A less focused approach also had to be initiated with Tajikistan,
owing to the chaos that followed the civil war. Here, a “Country Study” was carried out in
1994 under the Bank’s CESW program, which also included a section on agriculture,
followed by a Rural Social Assessment Note in1998. A policy letter was submitted in May
1999 that placed on record the Tajikistan Government’s commitments to agricultural sector
reforms that would be supported by Bank lending.

2.5    In the wake of decollectivization, steps to rationalize the macro-policy framework
were supported by a large portfolio of adjustment lending to the five countries, all designed
and coordinated with the IMF’s stabilization programs. For example, sequences of policy-
based lending operations were implemented during the 1990s—17 in the 5 countries under
review here. These sought to simplify and liberalize trade regimes, free up the pricing of
previously controlled commodities, lay the foundations for fiscal reform, rationalize public
spending and (later and to a lesser extent) improve and extend social safety nets. Operations
included a financial structural adjustment loan and two Private/Public Institution Building
Loans to Romania. Tajikistan rebuilding efforts were supported by a Post-Conflict
Rehabilitation Credit (1997). Also, an agricultural structural adjustment loan was
implemented in Romania soon after its Revolution.

2.6    Towards the end of the 1990s—the period when the seven assessed projects were
developed—there was some shift of emphasis in agricultural lending from policy-based

operations to investment operations. This made strategic sense. A previous IEG evaluation of
World Bank support for agriculture sector reform in Eastern Europe and Central Asia found
that investment operations, partly because they are implemented over a longer period than
adjustment operations, lent themselves better to the nurturing of institutions and the
development of capacity. The biggest challenges for capacity building were, by and large, in
the line agencies, particularly the Ministries of Agriculture, where staffs were often poorly
equipped for the transition to a market economy.8

Project Relevance
 2.7 The objectives of the seven projects (set out in full in Annex 3) were highly relevant.
 Each of the projects was closely aligned with the Bank’s overall ECA reform agenda. In
 each of the ECA countries the agricultural sector reforms envisaged in the early 1990s (at
 the start of the transition) can be summarized as follows:

                     Liberalization of prices and markets, creation of a market-compatible
                      system of conditions in the macro-agrarian economy;
                     Privatization of land and transformation of the inherited economic
                      structure;
                     De-monopolization and privatization of food processing and trade in
                      agricultural products and capital goods;
                     Creation of a functioning rural bank system; and
                     Establishment of an institutional structure and system of state
                      administration required by market economies.9

2.8     The design of the projects was substantially relevant. For the most part, they were
well adjusted to country circumstances. Operations were adequately sequenced and there was
a large measure of complementarity between sector investment lending and policy lending.


3. What progress did the countries make with agricultural
sector reform?
3.1     The Bank’s ECA Region rated progress on reform in five thematic areas. Between
1997 and 2005 the Bank prepared an annual progress report, rating the change in each of the
five agenda items listed above and deriving a composite score (Table 2; Figure 4). Over the
period, the most progress was made by Romania (spurred by the EU accession); Georgia
regressed (owing to the disruption caused by civil strife), swapping places with Azerbaijan;
and Tajikistan languished, remaining to a large extent a planned economy “The biggest
progress has been achieved in price and market liberalization, while there is a substantial lag
in solving the financing problems of agriculture, the liberalization of agro-processing and
input supply, and in the areas of institutional reforms”.10

3.2     Each of the five items on the reform agenda was linked ultimately to productivity
enhancement. With respect to the seven projects assessed, only two have statements of
objectives that refer explicitly to the need to boost agricultural productivity. But in each case
there was a clear understanding—made explicit in the country assistance strategies—that
sector productivity growth was essential. Boosting productivity entailed labor shedding,
accompanied by more efficient use of farm inputs.

3.3     The level of agricultural productivity and the pace of sector productivity growth
correlate roughly with the overall score of the country on the Bank’s reform rankings. Thus,
Romania and Armenia had the highest level of agricultural value added per worker—and also
the fastest growth rate. Georgia and Azerbaijan occupy an intermediate position; with a slight
decline in value added per worker in Georgia. Tajikistan has the lowest productivity and has
made only limited progress (Figure 3). The ranking of the five countries by reform progress
coincides with their ranking in terms of the share of farmland in private use. Around 2005, in
descending order, privately used land accounted for the following shares of agricultural land:
Romania (86 percent); Armenia (77 percent); Azerbaijan (35 percent); Georgia (26 percent);
Tajikistan (9 percent).11

3.4     In summary, the project objectives, implicitly or explicitly, emphasized productivity
growth. Productivity growth has, indeed, taken place, particularly after 2000. The rate of
productivity growth was partly driven by the adoption of the reforms that have been
promoted by the Bank since the start of the transition. The factor that was most instrumental
in boosting productivity was labor shedding. The countries with the highest levels of
agricultural value added per worker (as shown in Figure 3) were also those that shed the most
labor from the farm sector (Table 3).

3.5     There has been more progress on price and market reforms than the other areas
captured in the ECA reform indicators (Table 2) above). Price signals are diffused more
rapidly than before and there is closer integration with world markets. But there is a sharp
difference between the countries in the level of openness: trade as a proportion of sector GDP
is higher in Azerbaijan and Georgia than in the other countries (Figure 4).

4. What were the project outcomes and the associated
risks?
(a) Overall outcomes and sustainability
4.1     Project outcomes were positive overall. Six of the seven projects fell on the
satisfactory side of the ratings divide. The projects in Azerbaijan and Romania had the
strongest outcomes. The assessments are less sanguine about sustainability. The rating of risk
to development outcome was significant for four of the projects (Table 4).

4.2    There were four overarching factors that influenced project outcomes. First,
governments were generally supportive. During the preparation phase, except in Tajikistan,
government backing for the development objectives of the seven projects was generally firm.
Commitment tended to wane during early implementation but then picked up again following
mid-term adjustments and supporting policy reforms.

4.3     Second, at project inception, none of the implementing agencies were adequately
staffed to address the challenges at hand. The members of these agencies were poorly
equipped to develop new services responsive to the needs of small-scale farmers and
agribusinesses. Nor were they well placed to deal with the conflicting demands of foreign
donors, or able to grasp the intricacies of the Bank’s procurement and disbursement
procedures. Sometimes there was an outright rejection of the advice proffered by foreign
agencies, including the Bank. These strains lessened over time as implementing agency staff
gained experience and the projects began to bear fruit.

4.4    Third, the fallout from the Russian financial crisis of 1998-1999 placed every
country, except Azerbaijan, under considerable financial stress, resulting in budgetary
cutbacks and shortfalls in counterpart funding of projects. However, from about 2000
                                                   11


onwards, governments began to make the necessary budgetary provisions again and the pace
of implementation accelerated.

4.5     Fourth, aside from the financial crisis of the late 1990s, the effect of increased
exposure to the outside world had a generally positive influence on the achievement of
project objectives. The prospects of joining the European Union quickened the pace of
agricultural sector reforms in Romania (which acceded in 1997). The World Trade
Organization has exercised a similar pull. Romania joined the WTO in 1995, Georgia in
2000, and Armenia in 2003; and Azerbaijan and Tajikistan were granted observer status.

4.6     The risk to development outcome was influenced by the following factors. First and
foremost, there are major concerns about the sustainability of rural finance initiatives:
participating banks withdrew from the follow-on project in Armenia because conditions (e.g.
for administering reflows) were too restrictive; in Georgia, the credit unions foundered and
there are legal impediments to their revival; in Azerbaijan, farmer access to credit remains
highly constrained.12

4.7     Second, the small farmers that were targeted by agricultural support services may not
survive in the more competitive environment. In Romania, small dairy farmers face particular
challenges in meeting European Union sanitary requirements.13 In Armenia, the services
provided by the regional service centers are poorly adapted to the new realities of a
commercial faming environment; small farmers do not perceive these services as helpful in
terms of enhancing their ability to compete and are correspondingly disinclined to pay for
them.14

4.8     Third, the results achieved on land administration generally appear more sustainable.
Progress toward improved registration and cadastre is unlikely to be reversed in Georgia and
Romania.15 In Azerbaijan government and farmers remain firmly committed to the
privatization of land ownership.16 By contrast, in Tajikistan, there are fewer results to
sustain: land reform remains incipient, proposals are donor-driven with limited local
ownership and any improvement in land legislation will have limited impact on farm
investment levels as long as farmers’ freedom with respect to choice of crops and markets
remains as tightly constrained as it is at present.17

(b) Results by sub-sector
Agricultural and Agribusiness Services

4.9    The services inherited from the Soviet era were geared to the large collective farms
and focused on maximizing output rather than profits. Following the collapse of the
communist model, agricultural services were understaffed and poorly equipped to address the

needs of the mass of newly created smallholder farmers. Machinery and input suppliers and
agribusinesses provided patchy coverage. The Bank responded to this institutional vacuum
by promoting decentralized extension, competitive grant schemes and providing support to
agribusiness.

4.10 Decentralized extension services. The two Azerbaijan projects covered by this review
(FPP, ADCP) decentralized (and privatized) extension services more effectively than the
Armenia project (ARSP). In Azerbaijan, Regional Advisory Centers (RACs) were
established for each of the five regions covered by the project.18 Each center hosted a
network of extension agents and organized training, demonstrations and information
campaigns. Three of the RACs were contracted out to nongovernment agencies. Extension
agents contacted 91,000 farmers in 2004, well above the appraisal target of 10,000-15,000
farmers per year. Most farmers interviewed by IEG spoke highly of the program. The 25
Veterinary Field Units created under the project were successful, reaching out to 48,000
livestock owners (the appraisal target was 20,000). The Field Units were privately run and
proved able to cover costs through charges on medicines and services. The veterinarians
spent about two-thirds of their time in the field, and the rest at the clinic. Medicines were
significantly more expensive than publicly supplied drugs, yet demand from farmers was
high. Because the private veterinarians had to provide a better service in order to get paid,
they had a greater range of medicines, and their professional knowledge was more up-to-
date.

4.11 In Armenia, with somewhat less success, support centers (MASCs) were established
in each of the ten provinces, building on support from the United States Department of
Agriculture that dated back to 1997. The centers provided a broad range of extension services
and staff spent the bulk of their time working directly with farmers. To make them more
responsive to clients each center has, since 2002, hosted an advisory council with
representatives from local government, farmers and private agribusiness firms helping to
shape the annual work plan. Decentralization worked less well than in Azerbaijan and the
support centers are unlikely to prove sustainable. First, attempts to cover the operating costs
of the centers from sale of services made limited progress owing to client resistance. Second,
with the winding up of project financing, the centers have ceased to assist with farmer credit
applications, making them less appealing to clients. Third, the centers are not well placed to
serve the emerging new class of well-educated, commercial farmers who prefer to approach
private services for technical advice.19

4.12 Competitive Grant Schemes. This approach to agriculture technology transfer made
big strides in Romania and Azerbaijan; it was less successful in Armenia. In Romania, seven
calls for proposals were organized between 1999 and 2004. The 2,575 proposals received
were screened by a CGS Secretariat for quality and responsiveness to established priorities.
Successful applicants were invited to submit full project proposals, which were also pre-
screened by the Secretariat and then forwarded to local peer reviewers for evaluation. Of the
329 proposals that were fully evaluated, 154 were funded and 149 were successfully
implemented. The implementation period for each subproject averaged 3 years. About three-

quarters of the subprojects were extension-oriented, involving the transfer of existing
technologies. Implementation of the CGS was slow to begin with owing to the project staff’s
lack of experience with procurement and financial management; but it later picked up.

4.13 The scheme favored public-private partnerships, establishing links between 334
public agencies and 227 private organizations (including farmer associations, NGOs, and
commercial firms). The private organizations absorbed 58 percent of total CGS funds. The
scheme also fostered links between farmers and agribusiness firms, particularly for milk
production and processing.20 In Romania, the project management unit offered valuable
technical advice and assistance to applicants during the proposal preparation process. It also
repeatedly surveyed the 154 CGS grants that were approved for financing, using the findings
to help streamline the approval process. There is one caveat. Farmers who attended the
training and demonstration sessions organized through the CGS program, and who drew the
highest benefits from the project, were more likely to be medium-scale or progressive—those
best equipped to adapt to the commercial environment.21

4.14 In Azerbaijan, a CGS for financing applied research and demonstrations was
established.22 Of the 168 proposals submitted, 52 were funded, each receiving a grant
averaging US$28,000. Public research institutes captured 80 of CGS funding, with private
and nonprofit agencies accounting for the remaining 20 percent. The CGS supported a
farmer-responsive and problem-oriented approach to agricultural technology, with
demonstrations and training a major part of each subproject. About 30 percent of farmers
attending demonstrations subsequently adopted the technology—moderately successful by
international standards. The crop yields of adopters were 50 percent higher than those
obtained under the previous technology.23

4.15 In Armenia, 45 research grants were competitively selected between 1999 and 2004.
The CGS provided stopgap funding at a time when budgetary support for the research
establishment was barely enough to cover salaries and facility maintenance. The scheme
introduced a welcome measure of competition and accountability. However, schemes of this
nature will not by themselves ensure emergence of the strategic focus needed to transform
the agricultural research agenda. Moreover, the activities funded were not always of the
highest relevance to farmers. Government agricultural scientists, schooled exclusively in the
collectivist tradition of agriculture, were ill-equipped to devise solutions for the issues facing
small-scale farmers in an evolving market economy. The CGS would have been more client-
responsive if it had been open to a wider range of applicants, including nongovernment
institutions, as well as researchers in universities and government institutes.24 Also,
complementary initiatives are needed to train farmers in business-oriented approaches and to
reform the legal and regulatory framework for agribusiness. To the extent that farmers have
business skills and the legal and regulatory framework is right, the research demands of

farmers and agribusinesses articulated through a competitive system are more likely to
encourage the development of viable research projects.

4.16 Agribusiness support. One of the highlights of the assessed projects was the creation,
in Armenia, of the Agribusiness Development Center, which provided business advice and
training in financial analysis, strategic planning, and marketing to agribusiness firms and
large-scale farmers. Since 2003 ADC has operated as a private consulting company
providing service under contracts with the Ministry of Agriculture. It stages trade fairs,
provides market information and promotes exports. It also set up an association for
agricultural input suppliers, which successfully improved farmer access to safe, high-quality
agrochemicals.

Land Administration

4.17 This section covers the restructuring and sale of properties previously held by the
state, the registering of land title and transactions, and the creation of cadastral databases
specifying parcel locations, boundaries and plot sizes. The projects supported by the Bank in
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Romania were more successful overall than that in Tajikistan.

4.18 In Azerbaijan, the two assessed projects made a major contribution to successful
farm restructuring. The first project (FPP) piloted an egalitarian process of land
redistribution, based on six collective farms. Land titling at the six pilot sites was completed
by mid-1998, just 18 months after Board approval. Individual land titles were given to 6,645
families (the appraisal target was 4,800). The distribution of equal land areas to all persons,
regardless of age, social position or gender was welcomed by farmers; and 95 percent of
farmers surveyed reported that the process of allocating land by lottery was fair. The pilot
was rapidly scaled-up to a nationwide operation. By 2001, two years before implementation
of FPP ended, 1,980 of Azerbaijan’s 2,020 state and collective farms had been privatized,
accounting for 95 percent of agricultural land.25 The follow-on project (ADCP) successfully
established a system for recording land transactions. The land registration service was
decentralized from Baku to 10 regional offices, speeding up procedures and improving
farmer access. The time taken to register a land transaction fell from several weeks to 10-15
days. The offices became financially self-sustaining with transaction fees covering 80 percent
of variable costs. The project supported computerization and the digitization of land
records.26

4.19 In Georgia also, the reform of land administration procedures began as a pilot (in two
regions) and was later scaled up nationwide. An independent and self-financing land
registration and cadastre agency was set up.27 Under the supporting law of fees for land
registration services, base fees have been held at historic low levels but receipts have
increased owing to the rapid rise in transactions registered.28

4.20 In Romania, by mid-1997, almost 70 percent of those who had applied for restitution
of land and property tied up in collective farms had been issued with a private title. But, as
the system of national land administration was in disarray, the records of real estate
ownership were disorganized and fragmented, and partly as a result, there was little land
market development in either urban or rural areas.29 One-third of the new landowners was
living in towns and had little interest in farming. The project facilitated exit from agriculture
of persons and the consolidation of farm holdings. A secure land book system of title
registration was established throughout the country, linked to a cadastre. This provided a
single window for all property transactions. Procedures were streamlined. Within the space
of two years the time taken to register a sale was cut from 30-60 days to 10 days.30 Recorded
real estate transactions more than doubled between 2003 and 2006; then doubled again in
2007. The number of mortgage loans recorded by the National Bank of Romania increased
from 1,948 in 2001 to 82,675 in 2005.

4.21 Tajikistan took a different path. Farms were restructured but the government retained
ownership of land, leasing it to farmers for cultivation. As in Azerbaijan, the Bank used a
pilot approach, starting with ten collective farms, with the intention that the model would be
replicated on the 600 or so state and collective farms that remained in operation nationwide.31
The ten pilot farms were divided into 5,872 individual and family farms. Holdings were
allocated by lottery and, similar to the Azerbaijan project, farmers found this to be a fair and
equitable way to allocate land rights. Land maps were updated, parcels were demarcated and
numbered, leasehold land use certificates were issued and records were computerized. The
land use certificates were at first expensive; but under the follow-on project the cost per
certificate was reduced from US$120 to US$7. Start-up grants tied to the purchase of
agricultural inputs helped farmers to begin operating. From this technical perspective the
project succeeded and the approach taken lends itself to adoption throughout the country
(although the Bank could have a done a better job in publicizing the results—IEG found that
other donors were not familiar with the model).32 The Tajikistan project was less successful
overall than its Azerbaijan counterpart. The Bank had to work within the prevailing
limitations on tenure security. According to the 1996 Land Code, farmers were entitled to
lease the land for 99 years; the lease right could be transferred through sale or inheritance and
sub-leasing was permitted. This arrangement is intrinsically no more or less conducive to
economic efficiency than private ownership; but it will not be efficient if the lease right is not
properly enforced. Leasehold tenure was far from secure in Tajikistan and when IEG
assessed the project in 2008, government was still able to revoke leases when land use was
deemed “inappropriate”.33

4.22 Around 80 percent of the land covered by the project was located in cotton areas; and
it is in these areas that farming operations were most tightly constrained. Following the 2002
decree bearing on restructured family farms operators were, in principle, free to grow what
they want; in practice, farmers in cotton-growing areas still needed to meet cotton quotas—
they had little freedom to diversify—and they needed to follow a central plan, which

determined when cotton was sown, watered and harvested.34 It was not uncommon for local
governments to seize the land of farmers who failed to meet their cotton quotas. Farmers in
non-cotton growing areas close to markets in Dushanbe and in the hills were able to make
their own cropping decisions and buy seeds and fertilizer on the market. Farmers in cotton-
growing areas were obliged to rely on approved brokers to provide them with overpriced,
low-quality inputs at high rates of interest; and the price paid to them at the gin was below
the market rate. Also, the one-time startup grant provided by the project was not enough to
offset the longer-term constraints posed by the limited access to, and high cost of, credit and
farm inputs. The project did not finance farm machinery; the machines inherited from the
collective farms were too bulky and too dilapidated to be of much use on the new, small-
scale holdings. These factors reduced the project’s contribution to raising farming
efficiency.35

4.23 IEG concluded that in preparing the Tajikistan project the Bank was too willing to use
the Azerbaijan model as a blueprint, paying insufficient attention to the differences in the
incentive regime of the two countries. However successful the project was in confronting the
technical challenges of restructuring, titling and registration, the constraints on tenure
security, crop diversification and investment in farming were not much alleviated.

Rural Finance

4.24 Following the collapse of the centralized system for financing agriculture in the early
1990s, institutional credit and other financial services to farmers and rural enterprises (e.g.
savings accounts) were virtually nonexistent. The new cohort of commercial banks provided
only short-term loans at very high interest rates, mainly for trade. Prudential regulation and
competent supervision to govern banking services was still being refined, and commercial
bank outlets in rural areas were few. The operations of non-bank financial intermediaries
(including microfinance institutions and leasing companies) were scattered, small-scale and
unregulated. Access to financial services by prospective rural clientele thus remained
severely limited as the projects were being prepared.

4.25 The five projects under consideration in this report covered the spectrum of
transition-era financial interventions. All five offered a farm credit line, two through
commercial banks (Armenia ARSP, Georgia ADP), two through state-owned banks
(Azerbaijan FPP, Tajikistan FPSP), and one through an agency not yet identified when the
project was approved (Azerbaijan, ADCP). Three projects were designed to support lending
to agribusiness and rural non-farm enterprise (Azerbaijan ADCP, Georgia ADP and Armenia
ARSP). In each case an effort was made to scale up the volume of funds for on-lending
during the life of the Bank credit, with provision made for relending the proceeds of loan
repayments. Institutional development was a feature of all projects (except Tajikistan FPSP),
involving the expansion of branches and mobile banking units into rural areas. Two of the
projects (Armenia ARSP and Georgia ADP) offered savings facilities to sub-borrowers.

4.26 There were significant successes. Apart from the Georgia ADP and the Azerbaijan
FPP, repayment rates exceeded 95 percent, largely in response to improved regulation and
supervision. To varying degrees, all five projects contributed to the development of a credit
culture, something that had not existed during the Soviet era. The following paragraphs
examine specific features of the projects covered in this review.

4.27 In the Armenia project the eligibility criteria for financial intermediaries to
participate in the project were kept fairly loose, a pragmatic adjustment to the shortage of
suitable candidates. The vetting process failed to exclude weak contenders. Five of the 8
participating institutions were wound up or restructured during the commercial bank
consolidation of 2001-2002. IEG concluded that the Bank should have taken more steps to
ensure that participating intermediaries had a clear plan in place to meet the Basel
capitalization requirements within a reasonable period—or be excluded from the project later
on. Moreover, intermediaries should have been expected to make adequate provisions for
liquidity; and to adopt international accounting standards. Also, before implementation began
the laws bearing on moveable and immoveable collateral needed tightening.36

4.28 In Azerbaijan, the first of the two project’s assessed (FPP) launched a credit pilot
that worked through the state-owned Agroprombank. Given that this was the only bank with
rural outreach it was an obvious choice. But although Agroprombank had experience in
lending to individual farmers its performance under the auspices of FPP was mixed.
Complicated loan application procedures undermined farmers’ trust. Nevertheless, the credit
component of the project was fully disbursed and over 90 percent of loans were repaid. The
follow-on project (ADCP) promoted the creation of credit unions (formal, legal entities) and
(small, informal) borrower groups, with a view to increasing the depth of intermediation in
rural areas. The project created an agency specifically to administer this credit initiative, with
limited success. First, the agency was so risk averse that the scope for experimentation was
limited. Second, the high fee for licensing credit unions (US$5,600) deterred applicants.
Third, not enough attention was given to designing an exit strategy—it was unclear what
would take the place of this project-specific entity once implementation ended. The ADCP
credit component got off to a slow start but eventually the output targets—numbers of credit
unions and borrowers groups created, volume of lending, loan recovery—were all amply
exceeded. The ADCP follow-on operation took the process a step further, and more credit
unions and borrower groups were created.

4.29 While FPP and ADCP both substantially achieved their rural finance objectives, some
problems remained. Farmers interviewed by IEG drew attention to the following
shortcomings:

       Periods for seasonal credit were too short;
       Seasonal credit often arrived too late for purchasing inputs;
       There was a lack of medium-term and long-term credit, hampering
        crop diversification and on-farm investment;
       Individual credit limits were too small;
       Credit unions did not take deposits;

36. Armenia, ARSP, PPAR, p. 10.
                                                   18


       The credit ceiling for credit unions and borrower groups was too
        low.37

4.30 In Georgia, an attempt was made to increase farmer access to credit by promoting
credit unions; and to increase commercial bank lending to agribusiness. Both efforts fell
short. Ten credit unions were set up at the outset. At first, they performed well. Encouraged
by this success, the central government made pre-election promises that there would be ‘a
credit union in every village’. In 1998-1999, 164 credit unions were created, with 12,231
members. The network expanded so rapidly that sustainability was compromised. The project
design did not spell out sound criteria for credit union startup, and not enough was invested
in training managers and ensuring adequate oversight. Following the mid-term review a
regulatory body for credit unions was established in the National Bank of Georgia but the
necessary supporting legislation was not drafted. A Credit Union Law was being prepared
when IEG visited the country in November 2008 but it had yet to be submitted for review by
the Parliament’s Banking Committee. Only 7 credit unions remained in operation; IEG was
informed that just two of these were viable.38

4.31 The project also included a component to promote lending by commercial banks to
agribusiness. Eight banks participated in the project, making loans to canneries, wineries and
other agribusiness processing firms. Results were not sustainable. Two of the 8 banks were
caught up in the Russian financial crisis and were subsequently liquidated. Instead of being
made available for fresh lending, the proceeds of loan repayments were transferred to the
state budget, contrary to the aim of encouraging reflows. Based on its review of loan
approval and macroeconomic data IEG concluded that this component made only a
negligible contribution to financial deepening. Problems were as follows:

       The eligibility of banks wishing to participate was not properly vetted;
       The staff of the participating banks were not properly trained;
       The appraisal of loan proposals was insufficiently rigorous: the business plans of
        agribusiness borrowers were often not closely inspected; and
       The Bank’s Development Credit Agreement was not sufficiently specific about the
        provision for reflows.39

4.32 In Tajikistan, the project set up six credit institutions, each in the form of a Non-
Banking Financial Organization (NFBOs) as classified within Tajikistan’s legal system. The
interest rate charged the farmers was high and difficult to repay from traditional agricultural
activities. Interest rates varied between 30-37 percent depending on the NFBO (with an
inflation rate estimated at 12 percent in 2003 and at 7.5 percent in 2006). IEG found that
NFBOs were making a profit and were on schedule with the repayment of their US$200,000
line of credit. Repayment rates were 100 percent at first but dropped subsequently. Half of
the credit extended went to small businesses, the rest to larger farm and non-farm enterprises.
More than 15 percent of credit applicants were women (falling to 10 percent by 2007). IEG

found that the constraints on farmers’ freedom to determine cropping patterns (see paragraph
2.7 above) substantially undermined the enabling effect of easier access to finance.

4.33 The project included a component to allocate one-time grants to farm families of up
to US$300 per hectare (with an upper limit of US$600 per family). These were intended to
help farmers purchase critical farm inputs. To obtain grants farmers needed to show proof of
local residency and a land certificate; also their farm land had to be irrigated and membership
of a water users association was required. A beneficiary survey conducted in 2005 found that
out of a randomly selected sample of 100 family farms spread across the ten FPSP pilot
areas, 98 percent received a one-time grant. While 54 percent of those surveyed had utilized
the grant to buy farm inputs for the next cropping season, 38 percent had used it to improve
housing, and 66 percent had used some of the grant funds to meet family needs. IEG found
that the one-time grants were necessary but insufficient; there needed to be a longer-term
guarantee of access to finance, inputs and machinery.40


5. How satisfactorily did the Bank perform?
5.1     Quality at entry was sometimes hampered by an over optimistic assessment of local
capacity. The design of monitoring and evaluation was often schematic. In the early phase of
project implementation supervision often needed to be more intense. These important
shortcomings aside, Bank performance generally stood out for the depth of analysis
underpinning its interventions and the spirit of pragmatism and flexibility that it brought to
bear.

5.2     The ratings of Bank performance are mainly positive, although somewhat less so for
quality at entry than for supervision (Table 5).

5.3     Well-focused analysis. Particularly relevant were the series of country-focused
Agriculture and Food Sector Reviews commissioned by the Bank from the mid-1990s. These
reviews recognized that a piecemeal approach to agricultural restructuring would not be
successful given the broad menu of multi-dimensional and interlinked investments required
to support the rural transition and the need to rapidly dismantle the collective farms and
associated input supply industry. The reviews tracked the early reforms in agricultural
restructuring and assessed on-going pricing and trade reforms. They allowed to Bank to
clarify the broad outlines of its rural investment support in the transition economies and to
use this as a guide for designing specific operations.41

5.4     Justified switch from policy-based to investment lending. The Bank initially
experimented with sector adjustment lending, with a view to consolidating the reforms being
supported by SALs, FSALs and private sector incubator operations. This approach was
abandoned once it became evident that, for government and rural target populations alike,
there were substantial needs for training, technical assistance and core infrastructure
investment. Policy reform could not be tackled either before, or in isolation from, actions
taken to address these needs. From the mid-1990s onwards the Bank switched emphasis from
policy-based operations to investment project lending for agricultural.42

5.5     Effective use of mid-term reviews. Being designed to address the still very unfamiliar
rural policy environment associated with the scrapping of state-managed industrial
agriculture, the Bank’s initial portfolio of investment projects were pilots in the true sense of
the word, including all seven of the projects under review. While the development objectives
of each project supported CAS objectives, the project designs (and loan/credit agreements)
maintained sufficient flexibility to facilitate substantial modifications when needed to
improve implementation performance and anticipated development impacts. This flexibility
was manifest in the mid-term reviews. All of the seven projects underwent mid-course
restructuring, ranging from moderate to severe. Closing dates were extended for all seven,
ranging from 12 months in the case of the Romania ASSP to 38 months in the case of the
Georgia ADP.

5.6     Good use of PIUs. Implementation of the entire portfolio under review was facilitated
by the establishment of Project Implementation Units (PIUs). Though there was initial
resistance to the roles assigned to the PIU’s, more so in some countries (e.g., Tajikistan) than
in others (Armenia), as the implementing agencies began to better understand how to service
the advisory and financial needs of smallholders, the stature of PIU’s increased
commensurately – to an extent that they have been given semi-permanent status by the
Governments of Romania, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.

5.7     Emphasis on learning by doing. The seven assessed projects were designed as
extended pilots to demonstrate techniques for administering programs for small farms and for
providing advisory and technical support in the wake of decollectivization. The designs for
all seven projects aimed to consolidate gains realized thus far and to lay the foundations for a

more viable structure of private farms and agro-enterprises. There were follow-on operations
for all seven projects, with a view to consolidating the positive results obtained and
incorporating lessons learned (Table 6).

5.8     Solid follow-up. The experience with the Romania GCLR illustrates the pay-off to
strong Bank commitment. In 2004, following consistent advice from Bank portfolio review
and supervision missions and a change of government, Romania finally unified
responsibilities for implementing the general cadastre and land registration components of
the project in a single, semi-autonomous and self-financed government agency. There was a
rapid turnaround, the project exceeding most of its appraisal targets by an ample margin.43

5.9    Weak monitoring and evaluation. The Bank had a key responsibility for ensuring that
M&E was adequately addressed in project design. Technical assistance for monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) featured in all the assessed projects but, with some exceptions (e.g.
monitoring of the competitive grant schemes in Romania ASSP) the systems established
were generally weak. Monitoring of implementation progress was reasonably successful but
rigorous impact evaluation either got underway too late in the project cycle for results to be
available for these assessments; or was simply not attempted.

5.10 Difficult attribution of sector outcomes. It is not possible to determine how much the
growth of agricultural outputs and productivity was the result of Bank interventions. Other

players such as the IMF, the European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development were also heavily engaged, both in terms of providing finance and in
promoting policy and institutional reform. Several exogenous factors also influenced
outcomes: ranging from the fallout of war (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan) to the Russian
financial crisis (1998-1999), to natural disasters (frost devastation in Armenia, prolonged
drought in Georgia), and more positively, the stimulus provided by the prospect of accession
to the European Union (Romania).


6. Lessons
(a) General Lessons

6.1     Given the large attitudinal shift involved in the agricultural transition,
government officials and project staff needed substantial technical assistance and
training before operations could be expected to succeed. Governments showed strong
commitment to the preparation of the projects under review. Yet once the loans were
approved, delays in declaring effectiveness were experienced for several of the loans, while
during early implementation even staffs of the project units often did not fully understand
how specific project activities linked to objectives. If this was true at the center, it was even
truer in the localities where projects were implemented. Consultant services were not always
used as effectively as they might have been (this was the case for credit operations in the
Armenia ARSP and Georgia ADP). There was an attitudinal lag: most government officials
in the agricultural ministries still exhibited a command and control mentality with respect to
agricultural development.

6.2      When the leadership of project implementation units was skilled and motivated and
their staffs were well trained, project implementation generally proceeded smoothly once
some experience with the Bank’s procedures had been acquired. This was especially the case
with project units for the Romania ASSP and Georgia ADP, whose performance improved
rapidly once professionally adept managers were recruited to replace earlier political
appointees. Similarly, the appointment of a technically trained person to manage a purely
technical agency such as the Romania’s ANCPI for the GCLR Project resulted in a rapid
acceleration of project implementation.

6.3     In the complex and rapidly changing ECA environment, sound donor
coordination was critical. The two Romania projects rebounded from a very poor start once
the Bank and other members of the donor community began working together to help
Romania meet the European Union accession requirements. Together they helped Romanians
to take advantage of the grants-in-aid made available under the Community’s special
accession program for agriculture and rural development (SAPARD).

6.4    Where donor coordination was less sharp, progress was slow. Management of the
land registration component of the Georgia ADP was, at times, complicated by conflicting
donor expectations that proved hard to resolve. In Tajikistan, it took the Bank until 2003 to
                                              23


realize that if donors spoke with one voice to the government on land reform, it might create
conditions more favorable for the farms that the project had restructured.

(b) Lessons from the Sub-sectors
Agricultural and agribusiness services

6.5     Farmers and rural business owners will respond enthusiastically to innovative
technologies corresponding to their needs. Experience from the assessed projects showed
that agricultural research and extension works best when it is consultative and demand-
driven. In Romania, the competitive grant approach proved to be an excellent vehicle both
for generating applied research findings and extending these to farmers. But, as Armenia
showed, the competitive grant scheme can also lack the strategic focus needed to effect a
comprehensive strengthening of agriculture research. To respond to farmers’ needs,
competitive research grants should be open to all applicants, including non-governmental
organizations, universities, and government research institutes. For pure farm extension
work, the financial sustainability of advisory services in a setting with many small, semi-
subsistence farmers can only be achieved if government acknowledges its responsibility to
provide these citizens with appropriate and effective advice and information. This will
probably entail some measure of subsidy given the low incomes of many of the clients; but
that need not preclude use of private contractors to deliver the service.

Land administration

6.6     The Bank’s international experience with land policy issues has strengthened the
design of projects in ECA; but there is no uniquely correct model for land
administration or land reform and effectiveness depends on responsiveness to local
conditions. Whether grounded in restitution (Romania), or in the granting of more or less
equal allotments to agricultural workers and other rural residents (South Caucasus), or being
limited to the transfer of usufruct rights only (Tajikistan), each program was designed to
accommodate socio-political necessities in the aftermath of de-collectivization. In Tajikistan
however the project design was overly ambitious and not tailored enough to the local
circumstances.

6.7     It makes sense to adopt a unified approach to land administration. Cadastral and
land recording/land registration services are both technology and information intensive.
These two services need to be closely linked and preferably digitalized to increase efficiency
and enhance access. The unified approach worked well in each of projects reviewed here that
had a land administration component (Azerbaijan FPP and ADCP; Georgia ADP, and
Tajikistan FPSP).

Rural finance

6.8     With appropriate regulation, technical advice and staff training banks that lend
to rural areas can operate sustainably. To realize the potential from scaling up commercial
bank lending to rural areas, it is essential: (a) to confirm that supervision and prudential
regulation has been developed and can be effectively enforced; (b) to “prequalify” the banks
                                               24


deemed eligible to participate in tendering for loan proceeds, based on rigorous prudential
examination; (c) to ensure rigorous monitoring of the credit program, with the assistance of
international expertise if necessary; (d) to ensure that the terms, maturities and grace periods
of loans are proportional to the expected returns and the estimated economic life of the
investment; and (e) to allow intermediaries to administer credit reflows in accordance with
their own terms and conditions.

6.9     The non-bank financial intermediaries have an important role to play in rural
areas; but it is important to be realistic about their capabilities. There is a strong demand
for locally-based credit facilities (such as credit unions) in rural villages, and for rural
financial institutions that take credit. These institutions must be savings-driven and
encouraged to diversify their loan portfolio rather than focus only on farm lending.
Sustained, strong support in the form of training and supervision is required if they are to
evolve into viable financial institutions. The volume of lending needs to keep step with the
growth in management skills and savings mobilization among members (overly-rapid
expansion in the Georgia ADP and ambitious targets in the Azerbaijan ADCP considerably
stressed implementation of farmer credit programs in these two projects). In general, these
projects have shown that small village-based credit cooperatives are not an appropriate
mechanism for large-scale credit delivery.

ANNEX 1: ARMENIA - AGRICULTURAL REFORM
SUPPORT PROJECT (CREDITS-C30350 & C30351)
Summary
The Armenia Agricultural Reform Support Project (ARSP) was the first Bank-assisted
project to support the transition of Armenian agriculture from a centrally planned and
publicly owned sector to privately owned commercial farming. The project also helped
implement the Bank’s revised regional strategy for agriculture and rural development. This
strategy eschewed further agricultural adjustment lending, looking to multi-activity
investment projects as the main vehicles for accelerating farm productivity and rural
enterprise development.

In Armenia, during the two years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, lands were
distributed mainly to collective farm workers or their offspring. The process was rapid and
had several desirable features: (i) the state and collective farming system was broken up, with
these lands converted to privately owned holdings; (ii) the new private holdings could in
principle be inherited, sold or leased; and (iii) there were no longer official restrictions on
what could be produced and what could be sold.

The ARSP supported a first phase of reforms to Armenia’s agricultural technology system
and its rural financial markets. The project introduced private contracting for both applied
research programs and farmer information (extension) services, with a view to boosting farm
productivity. It also offered business development services for rural enterprises. The uptake
of recommendations from both the farm and enterprise advisory services was facilitated by
sub-loans from private intermediaries, a new departure for rural Armenia.

Outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The project’s development objectives were
substantially relevant. At project inception, agriculture still played an important role in the
economy and support for the agricultural technology system was critical to the sector’s
development. The tens of thousands of rural smallholders newly endowed with land
generally lacked the skills to farm it. The project made a contribution to the objective of
developing private sector farming and agro-processing, mainly through establishment of an
agribusiness development center (subsequently successfully privatized). Although the project
exceeded its targets of expanding credit to the farming sector and a substantial amount of
lending was recycled as reflows, more could have been achieved in this area, had
participating banks been better screened. In the event, five of 8 participating banks were
liquidated or restructured following the shake-up of Armenia’s banking system after the
Russia crisis. Attainment of the third objective—increasing the efficiency of agricultural
services—fell short of expectations, partly because the introduction of a competitive grant
scheme for agricultural research failed to have the catalytic effect that was hoped for. On the
other hand the available evidence suggests that the project reaped a high rate of return, based
on the performance of the frost damage and credit line components, as well as high returns
on new farming technologies supported by the project.
                                              30


The Risk to Development Outcome is rated significant. The sustainability of project-
sponsored institutions is open to question. While the agribusiness development center
continues to thrive, performance of the agricultural support centers under the follow-on
RESCAD project has been poor. The banks that initially participated in the project withdrew,
preferring to lend from their own resources rather than use project funds. There has been
little institutional strengthening in the wake of credit closing.

Bank Performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Quality at entry had some shortcomings:
the credit line for farmers was under-designed; arrangements for restructuring the agricultural
research system were insufficient; and there was limited provision for monitoring. Project
supervision had to contend with fall outs from external shocks to the Armenian economy and
severe frost damage. Supervision was thorough and there was continuity in team
composition.

Borrower Performance is also rated moderately satisfactory based on the credit effectiveness
delay, shortfalls in counterpart funding, unsatisfactory handling of the technology
component, and procurement problems.

This project assessment suggests three broad lessons.

   Lesson 1: Projects that involve a major restructuring of financial institutions and that face
   limited Borrower capacity need to meet the following conditions:

          Clear and rigorous criteria for determining whether commercial banks are eligible
           for tendering in the project;
          “Prequalification” of financial intermediaries deemed eligible to participate in
           tendering for loan proceeds, on the basis of a thorough prudential examination—
           supervised by the Bank where necessary;
          Continuous monitoring by the Bank to ensure that eligibility and performance
           criteria are met;
          Hiring of banking or credit specialists to oversee the processes for determining
           eligibility and carrying out tendering.

   Lesson 2: In order to provide the right incentives it is important to allow participating
   financial intermediaries to administer credit reflows in accordance with their own terms
   and conditions. Provided that participating banks meet the regulatory requirements
   approved by the Bank, and articulated through the project design, there is no case for
   paternalism in dictating how they should employ the returns to their lending activity.

   Lesson 3: Projects that are designed to support reform of the national agricultural
   technology system need to be based on a clear agreement with the various concerned
   government agencies about the implementation strategy and arrangements for
   coordination; this agreement needs to be reached before the loan or credit is made
   effective.

Background
Overview

1.      After 1991 Armenia underwent an abrupt shift from central planning to a full market
economy. It recovered relatively quickly from the initial shock of transition and, over the past
half decade, the economy has grown at an average annual rate of 10 percent. After
independence the loss of guaranteed input and output markets in the Former Soviet Union
severely affected farmers and agro-processing industries. The agricultural sector came to
serve as a safety net employing nearly three times as many people as before independence,
the result of an inflow of refugees following the war with Azerbaijan44 and the collapse of
non-agricultural income sources. The subsequent growth of the sector has been driven by
productivity gains, due largely to liberal market mechanisms, private ownership of land,
export opportunities and (limited) investments in rundown infrastructure.

2.       The share of agriculture value added in GDP rose from 17 percent in 1990 to a peak
of 37 percent in 1996, and then fell to 20 percent in 2006 (Table 1). The terms of trade
moved against agriculture following the 1998 Russia crisis, with the prices of industrial
goods and services increasing consistently. The growth of jobs outside agriculture and the
process of financial deepening proceeded more slowly in Armenia than in the new EU
member countries, although prospects have recently improved. Agriculture’s contribution to
exports (only 1.6 percent in 2002) has remained limited, reflecting weak comparative
advantage.45

3.      Agriculture remains an important source of rural household income. Between 2002
and 2004 46 percent of the labor force was employed in full- and seasonal farm operations.

4.      Nationwide, growth and income transfers under Armenia’s system of family
assistance allowances resulted in a sharp decline in poverty. The share of the population that
was poor fell from over half to 27 percent between 1998 and 2006, while the rate of extreme

Though most originated from urban areas and had few agricultural skills, the very large bulk of refugees were
resettled in rural areas and given private plots.”
45. For example, fruits and vegetables—a major farm exportable—had a Revealed Comparative Advantage of
only 1.1 in 2003. (An RCA > 1.0 demonstrates comparative advantage.)

poverty dropped from 21 percent to 4 percent.46 Income inequality also lessened. In 1999,
the national Gini was 0.57 but by 2006 the coefficient had fallen to 0.37.47 According to the
most recent poverty assessment, the share of the rural population living beneath the poverty
line fell from 48 percent in the late 1990s to 23 percent in 2005. The share of rural residents
in extreme poverty fell from 14 percent to 2 percent.48

5.      The countryside has benefited from overall economic growth but less so than
metropolitan areas. Commercialized agriculture on larger, consolidated holdings has begun to
spread in Armenia, especially in the Ararat and inter-montane valleys. However, owing to the
limited off-farm employment opportunities, rural small-holders depend heavily on their small
farms for survival. Agriculture continues to function as a social safety net for the rural poor,
retaining a strong subsistence orientation—less than half of output is marketed.

The Agriculture Sector Context

6.       At the start of the 1990s, the key issues in the agricultural sector included the poor
condition of the irrigation system and state ownership of agro-processing enterprises.
Agricultural reform started early; the Bank’s support to the reform program—comprising
analytical work and six investment credits—was generally well conceived and successfully
executed, but with some shortfalls. The integrity of a major portion of the irrigation system
was restored, water losses were reduced, Water User Associations were established, and
efforts were made to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture to manage the
system.49 Land markets and the use of land as collateral expanded, with the number of land
transactions doubling from 2000 to 2002. However, the sustainability of the irrigation system
was uncertain.

7.      The Bank’s index of agricultural reform shows Armenia with a score of 7.4 in 2001,
higher than any other CIS country; the average for all 12 former Soviet Republics was 5.2.50
Although the sector’s contribution to total exports remains small, in recent years, exports of
processed foods such as tomato paste, cognac, and processed fruits have increased
substantially, aided by the privatization of ago-processing enterprises.

8.     Raising agricultural productivity remains central to income growth in the rural areas
given the limited job alternatives. The rural labor force contains a large proportion of semi-

48. It is of interest that the largest reduction in rural poverty occurred in the highland and mountain villages (i.e.
above 1300 meters elevation). Residents in these villages not only benefited from Armenia’s family assistance
allowances and a disproportionate share of remittances from “guest workers abroad”, but also witnessed an
expansion of rural non-farm enterprise activities in the trade, services and light manufacturing sectors. This
suggests that the general improvements in Armenia’s investment climate are also beginning to penetrate
Armenia’s rural areas, as reflected in the near tripling (tough still limited) of rural borrowing from formal
sources between 2002-2006 (recorded in RA 2008, Table 2.16 and para. 120).
49. In 2003, responsibility for irrigation and drainage development was transferred to the Water Resources
Commission.

subsistence and elderly farmers operating small, fragmented farms.51 There is a growing
commercialization of agriculture, accompanied by the consolidation of operational holdings,
in the Ararat Valley and in some of the country’s more fertile inter-montane zones. But
improving the effectiveness of agricultural extension, credit, and input supply remains
essential for the development of a viable agricultural economy; this goal continues to
underpin the Bank Group’s sector strategy for Armenia.

The Banking System & Rural Financial Markets

9.        Drawing on the results of a recent Article 4 consultation, the Staff Appraisal Report
(paragraph 1.13) reported that the monetary crisis and currency depreciation prevailing in
Armenia in 1993-94 eroded the real values of nominal claims, including the bank’s deposits
and loan portfolios, as well as confidence in the currency and the banking system. In order to
restore confidence in the banking sector several measures were introduced by the government
under an IMF financial restructuring program. A key feature of the program was the
establishment of the independence of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) to conduct and
manage monetary policy. This was followed by a new Banking Law that gave the CBA’s
supervisors sufficient authority to enforce prudential rules, regulations, and sanctions, and the
power to regulate financial markets, and to liquidate banks. These expanded powers
strengthened the legal and regulatory framework for banking in general. Under the IMF
program, technical assistance was provided to the CBA’s banking supervision department to
help strengthen its supervisory and regulatory capabilities.

10.       The preparation team also demonstrated that credit resources flowing to the rural
sector were well below the levels which the estimated credit worthiness of the sector would
justify (SAR, paragraph 1.15). A pre-project survey (SAR, p.7) found that the constraints to
expanded bank lending to agricultural sector in mid-1990s remained formidable, including:

       a lack of clear legal protections for creditors in the execution of judgments against
        defaulters, which limits the range of assets which borrowers can offer and banks will
        accept as collateral; this limits borrowers’ capacity to obtain debt and is particularly
        evident in the case of residential real estate from which residents effectively cannot
        be evicted, even after due process of law;
       legal confusion caused by the issuing of rural land titles in the name of a family and
        not of a particular individual;52
       very shallow real estate markets with high price uncertainty that compel banks to
        require very high collateral coverage ratios (collateral worth three to four times the
        amount of the loan);
       high profits in trading, which tended to exclude lower yielding agricultural and
        industrial borrowers from the very shallow market for formal credit; and
       centralized management procedures in at least some of the former state banks which
        limited the ability of branch managers to mobilize deposits and make loans under
        their own authority.

52. This constraint was removed under the Bank-supported Title Registration Project, a companion operation
originally prepared as an integral part of ARSP.

11.       Following independence in 1991, the number of banks climbed rapidly—reaching
80 by 1994. Many banks were poorly performing and undercapitalized. However, with
assistance from the IMF and the Bank, the Government tightened up regulation, and many of
the weaker banks closed. Adoption of the Basel convention’s capital adequacy requirements
led to recapitalization of surviving banks, while a loan provisioning program helped clean up
bank portfolios. The rapid restructuring of the sector also hastened bank privatization, which
was largely complete by 2000. Foreign bank ownership was permitted from 1995 onwards.
By 1998 (when the project was approved), there were 38 banks; although following the IMF-
Bank supported Financial Sector Action Plan this number fell to 20. The ten largest banks
continue to account for considerably more than half of total assets and nearly three-quarters
of loans.

12.     By 2000—midway through the process of regulatory reform and the shake-out in the
commercial banking sector53 —most banks were on a sound financial footing.
Recapitalization increased capital to risk–weighted assets ratios (Table 2). While Armenia’s
commercial banks had large numbers of non-performing loans, significant progress was
made in improving the quality of loan portfolios in 1996-97. The level of nonperforming
loans had fallen to around 6 percent by December 2000.54

13.      Armenia’s banking sector (and the financial sector at large) remains small. The ratio
of banking sector assets to GDP was still only 19 percent in 2004, substantially below the
CIS average (30 percent in 2003). Fifty-four non-bank financial intermediaries accounted for
3 percent of total financial system assets, while capitalization on the stock market was only 1
percent of GDP. The small size of the financial sector limits its ability to act as an engine of
growth.

Project Objectives & Design
14.     Appraised in December 1997 and approved in January 1998, the Agricultural
Reform Support Project (ARSP), was the first Bank-assisted investment in Armenia aiming
to enhance agricultural and agribusiness services, and to offer a credit line for small farmers.

15.     According to the appraisal report the project’s “overall objective” was “to increase
agricultural productivity in Armenia by supporting the development of private sector farming
and agro-processing”. The development credit agreement identifies three specific objectives
that will be used by this PPAR.55 They are:

         Support the development of private sector farming and agro-processing,
         Improve and expand credit in the farming sector, and
         Increase the efficiency of providing agricultural services relating to research,
          education, information and extension.

16.       The project originally had three components:

          Component 1: Agribusiness Development Center (ADC): (Appraisal amount
          US$ 1.3 million, $0.3 million actual) – designed to assist entrepreneurs and managers
          in upgrading their financial management, strategic planning and marketing skills in
          Armenia’s post-privatization restructuring. The ADC was intended to be the focal
          point for technical assistance and training to the agro-industrial sector, assisting
          especially with the preparation of feasibility studies, business plans and loan
          applications.

          Component 2: Credit to Farmers: (US$ 7.5 million at appraisal, $9.4 million actual )
          – intended to increase access to working capital and investment credits for small
          farms and businesses, and facilitate the development of a sustainable rural finance
          system. Through a line of credit, it was to provide critical access to long-term
          financial resources for the Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Armenia (ACBA) and
          other Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) which were then facing great
          difficulties in mobilizing medium- and long-term deposits.

          Component 3: Strengthening Agricultural Institutions: (US$ 8.6 million at
          appraisal, $7.8 million actual) – designed to finance critical investments needed to
          make adjustments in key agricultural technology, knowledge and information
          institutions. This component focused on services directly relevant to the newly
          emerging private farmers and included sustained support in the areas of rural advisory
          and information services as well as short-term assistance for research and higher
          agricultural education institutions.

17.    Additionally, a Project Implementation Unit was organized, staffed and equipped
(US$ 1.3 million at appraisal, $1.2 million actual), charged with responsibility for
coordination, procurement and monitoring and evaluation.

18.  During implementation, the original project components were not formally adjusted.
However, severe weather in December 2002 led to the de-facto addition of a fourth

55. The completion report notes that: “During the preparation stage the project was envisaged to include also a
title registration component, and Project Preparation Facility funds were used to prepare it, but at negotiations in
December 1997 it was agreed to make this a stand-alone project. The Armenia Title Registration Project (Credit
3135) was subsequently approved and successfully implemented from 1999 to 2004” (ICR, p. 3).

component, Frost Damage Rehabilitation (n/a at appraisal, US$ 1.3 million actual) for
which project funds were initially reallocated in 2003, then replenished by a Supplementary
Credit (CR-30351) which was approved in May 2004. Unusually harsh and prolonged frost
in late December 2002 severely damaged about 10,000 ha of vineyards and more than 13,000
ha of orchards in much of the Ararat Valley. This component financed (i) the importation of
nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers for distribution on a grant basis to affected smallholders to
rehabilitate trees and vines not irreparably damaged56, and (ii) the procurement of grape vine
seedlings and fruit tree saplings for replanting vineyards and orchards destroyed by the frost.
Around 30,000 small farms, employing roughly 10% of Armenia’s farming population, were
severely affected by the frost, whose income from farming would be reduced for a prolonged
period in the absence of emergency measures.

Relevance
Relevance of Objectives

19.     The development objective was consistent with the Government’s and the Bank’s
strategic approaches in the sector and was based on a substantial body of analytical work and
project experience. A report (“Armenia: The Challenge of Reform in the Agricultural
Sector”), prepared by the Bank in 1993/94, evaluated the early years of agricultural and land
reform in Armenia, and made policy recommendations for the next phase of market-oriented
reforms. The ARSP was the Bank’s second rural sector project in Armenia (after the
Irrigation Rehabilitation Project), and it built on the experiences gained from this earlier
operation.

20.     The overall objective of the ARSP project was to promote private sector development
in Armenia’s rural areas, while reorienting the state’s role to one of strengthening the general
framework for market development by providing public goods (market information and
research results), as well as increasing the supply of neglected services (agribusiness
education and agribusiness restructuring skills). The project also addressed the CAS
objective of developing financial markets in the agricultural sector.57

21.     The specific objectives responded to constraints faced by Armenia’s agriculture
sector and agroindustries in the late 1990s. Rural financial markets were poorly developed. A
pre-project survey showed that people in rural areas made little use of formal banking
services. Lack of bankable collateral and high loan interest rates and transaction costs kept
formal lending to farmers at minimal levels. According to data provided by surveyed banks
and the Central Bank of Armenia, monthly loan interest rates ranged from 7 to 9 percent. The
limited bank credit available was concentrated on large loans to the food industries.58 There
was substantial unmet demand for credit among farmers and enterprises; and a considerable
number of potential clients were creditworthy and could afford to borrow at the prevailing
market rates of interest for secured loans.

22.     There was also a need for an agricultural technology system capable of supplying
small-scale private farmers with science based, market-oriented research and extension
advice, responsive to the changing consumption and export requirements of a rapidly
developing economy. When the project was appraised, it was government policy that the
functions of research, education and extension would eventually be integrated and managed
by the Armenia Agricultural Academy—then under the Ministry of Agriculture.59 The
project sought to integrate these functions by 2001.

23.     The ARSP project objectives were well conceived and tailored to the constraints
facing Armenia agriculture in the mid- to late-1990s. The relevance of objectives is therefore
rated high.

Relevance of Design

24.    Design relevance varied between the project components: it rates high for the first
component (which supported the Agribusiness Development Center) but only modest for the
other components. Initially established as a government owned non-profit corporation under
the Ministry of Agriculture, the business development services provided by the ADC
responded to managers’ need for knowhow and was intended to provide detailed guidance in
the development of business plans and the preparation of loan proposals. This was a timely
and much needed intervention. It was also appropriate that the project design anticipated the
eventual privatization of ADC.

25.     The design of the credit to farmers component proposed a set of eligibility criteria for
participating banks that were to a large degree ‘lowest common denominator’, intended to
accommodate the weak position of most commercial banks at the time. This approach led to
implementation problems. The “gold standard” was well known: banks should ideally satisfy
the BASEL 1 requirement for capitalization, as well making adequate provisions for liquidity
and adopting international accounting standards. Even if full compliance with these
demanding standards was not feasible in the Armenia of that time, the Bank should have set
the bar higher at the outset. On the other hand, the uncertainties at appraisal surrounding the
legal definitions of immovable property and movable chattel were tackled through parallel
Bank-supported operations, the Enterprise Development Project and the Title Registration
Project.

26.     The agricultural institutions component was designed to provide support for the
immediate reform and restructuring of agricultural research and the further development of
education, extension, and information institutions. At appraisal, all of these functions fell to
the Ministry of Agriculture and the intention was to improve the coordination among them.
There were few prospects for even limited privatization of these services: private providers
would probably have been deterred by the difficulty of getting farmers to pay for applied
research and field trials. It was reasonable for the project to focus on strengthening public
sector service provision. It could be argued that what was lacking was a unified strategy for
agricultural research, education, extension and information. Rather than tackling this under

the auspices of one project (ARSP) a multifaceted approach was taken calling for careful
donor coordination. This involved, first, a major push by the United States Department of
Agriculture, followed up by a substantial sectoral review and strategy development effort by
UNDP/FAO. Therefore, shortcomings in the performance of this component reflect more on
problems with donor coordination than the intrinsic weakness of ARSP.

27.   Balancing out this with the previous considerations, the relevance of design is rated
modest.

28.    Despite the design limitations, the project concept was valid and responded well to
the needs of the country. The overall rating of relevance is substantial.

Efficacy
29.     The overarching objective of the project was to increase agricultural productivity and
there was, indeed, a trend in this direction. Coincident with the project implementation
period, per capita agricultural value added grew steadily; at the second highest rate of the five
countries assessed in this report (Figure 3, main text). The project probably contributed to
this outcome but it is impossible to say by how much. The mixed performance on progress
toward specific objectives suggests that it would unwise to attribute too much of this
productivity growth to the project.

30.      Supporting the development of private sector farming and agro-processing
(Rating: Substantial). The Agribusiness Development Center was privatized in 2003, as
intended when the project was prepared, and now operates as a private consulting company.
It also provides general services to processors, traders and farmers under contract with the
Ministry of Agriculture. The assessment mission confirmed that the ADC has been effective
in providing market information and facilitating exports. It performed well in staging trade
fairs in Yerevan and supporting the participation of Armenian agribusinesses at international
exhibitions in Russia, China, and Latvia. In general, its work has strengthened links between
suppliers and with buyers. In 2000, the ADC helped establish a national agro-input dealers
association (“AgriInput”), which made available an increased supply of safe and effective
agro-chemicals.60 Overall, the ADC has successfully responded to the training and
consultancy needs of agro-processors and farmers, supplying the business planning, financial
management, and market advisory services needed to perform well under free market
conditions.

31.      Improving and expanding credit in the farming sector (Rating: Modest). The
initial plan was to work exclusively with the Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Armenia but,
following appraisal, other qualifying banks were allowed to participate. The performance of
the eight banks that participated in the project was uneven (Table 3). Five of these
institutions were liquidated or restructured in the banking shake-out of 2001-2002 following
deterioration in the quality of their portfolios; the three other banks maintained strong
portfolios. To put this in perspective, more than half of all banks in Armenia failed during

this period, not merely the five participants in ARSP. Also, at project close, the repayment
rate by final borrowers was over 97 percent and only 1.2 percent of sub-loans at the three
surviving PFIs were overdue. Over the course of the project, ARSP supported lending
amounted to 16 percent of lending to the agriculture sector. Project targets were exceeded, a
total of 17,500 loans were made during the life of the project, compared to an appraisal target
of 11,130. 687.

  Table 3. Lending Under the ARSP Credit Line (US$ - as of June 30, 2005)




Source: ICR Table 4.3, p. 8


32.     Apart from the ACBA, whose prequalification was certified by the Bank’s
preparation team, the other participating banks appear to have been declared eligible for
tendering rather hastily. Although the Bank deployed banking experts at the critical moments
of appraisal and supervision eligibility criteria were not as sharply defined or rigorously
enforced as they might have been. This resulted in 18 percent ($1.7 million) of project funds
that had gone to the credit component remaining to be recovered by the Ministry of Finance
and Economy when the project closed.

33.     At appraisal the intention was to recruit an international consultant to serve as Rural
Credit Advisor, responsible for assisting the implementing unit in verifying the eligibility of
would-be participating banks and monitoring the credit program. For reasons not explained
in the ICR nor made clear during the assessment mission, this consultant was never engaged.
This made it imperative that Bank staff supervise the prequalification for tendering process;
and all the more serious when this supervision failed to materialize.

34.      It is important to put the project’s long-term contribution in perspective. Accounting
as it did for 16 percent of all lending to agriculture ARSP made a small but significant
contribution to nurturing a credit culture in Armenia’s rural areas. It was part of a broader
effort, involving parallel government reforms of the financial sector and the support provided
by the Bank to Armenia’s central bank (NBA) and commercial banks. ACBA’s credit clubs
                                                      41


proved a useful venue for funneling short-term loans to farmers and other rural beneficiaries.
But now that ACBA is offering investment and working capital credits from its own
resources, the usefulness of credit cooperatives has all but disappeared and ACBA’s portfolio
is shifting rapidly towards approvals based on normal creditworthiness investigations of the
individual household or business applicants.61 This shift is consistent with the philosophy of
ARSP; but this positive development was only partly driven by ARSP.

35.     Increasing the efficiency of agricultural service provision (Rating: Modest). The
project met with limited success in strengthening agricultural research. In 1998, before the
credit became effective, the country’s 14 agricultural research centers were combined into
five and staff numbers were cut by 32 percent. Although spending was pruned the
effectiveness of the new framework was undercut by the lack of any systematic rethinking of
agricultural research strategy (despite support for this from FAO). This was partly the
consequence of tensions between the Armenian Agricultural Academy (AAA), created in
1994, and the Ministry of Agriculture. Transfer of AAA to the Ministry of Education and
Science in 2002 did not fundamentally strengthen the research system.

36.     The introduction of a competitive grant scheme for agricultural research failed to
have the catalytic effect that was hoped for. Forty-five grants were awarded between 1999
and 2004, totaling US$745,000. Although the scheme made some contribution to increasing
competition and accountability it would have been more effective if the competition had been
opened to include institutions and individuals outside the government agencies. Government
agricultural scientists, schooled exclusively in the collectivist tradition of agriculture, were
ill-placed to devise solutions for the issues facing small-scale farmers in an evolving market
economy. The ICR notes62 that the competitive scheme lacked the strategic focus needed to
effect a comprehensive strengthening of agriculture research. But it was probably too much
to expect that, by itself, the competitive scheme could have this systemic impact. As
evaluations of similar schemes in other countries have found, competitive grants are useful
complements to a wider system of agricultural research but they are no substitute for core
funding of that system.63 The limited assistance to this initiative was not sufficient to
compensate for years of under-funding or for the lack of a longer-term strategy for
prioritizing expenditures on agricultural research.

37.     The project contributed to the decentralization of service provision by promoting the
Marz Agricultural Support Centers (MASCs). The MASCs were launched in 1997 in three
marzes, with support from USAID. Under the assessed project MASCs were extended to all
ten marzes in the country. Initially somewhat top heavy, by project completion the MASCs
had significantly more field staff than center-based specialists. Since 2002, to strengthen
client responsiveness, each MASC has been supported by an advisory council in which
representatives of local governments, farmers and private agri-business discuss the annual
work program and set priorities; and by an advisory group of 5 to 7 farmers in each village.64

The Bank sought, in the course of implementation, to restructure the MASC system, reduce
the number and cost of the MASCs, make them more client-focused and initiate fee-for-
service arrangements—but the Ministry of Agriculture resisted this initiative. By the
project’s closing date, the MASCs had begun to cover some of their operating costs by
entering into contractual relations with community councils, from the sale of publications
and even from the provision of individualized services. However, this could not be sustained
under the follow-on RESCAD project. Once more MASCs are now almost entirely
dependent on funding from the central government budget. Since 2002, oversight of the
MASCs has rested with a central agency created by the Ministry of Agriculture, the
Republican Agricultural Support Center (RASC). The RASC has developed into a competent
service provider for the MASCs and the Ministry, producing television and radio programs,
operating a central website and helping MASCs to develop their own websites.

38.     It was intended that the MASCs would also collaborate on extension methodology
and content and on staff training with the agricultural extension arm of another central
agency, the Armenian Agricultural Academy (AAA). This collaboration suffered from
considerable institutional friction because of a persistent failure to agree on the role of the
AAA extension department (AgroGitaSpure) in the evolving national rural extension system.
When the AAA was removed from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Science and
Education it lost focus. (ARSP had no say in this transfer.) By project closing, the staff of
the Agricultural Academy—starved of resources—was no longer contributing to project
activities and project objectives.65 This was less a reflection on the performance of the Bank-
supported project and more a consequence of problems with a large parallel operation
involving funding of AAA by the United States Department of Agriculture. The USDA
project consultants were not keen to coordinate, had a very different outlook on how
agricultural research and extension should be run and funded, and were eventually terminated
by USDA.

39.     Emergency Rehabilitation of Frost Damage (Rating: Substantial). The assessment
concurs with the ICR that response to the 2002 emergency was tardy and procurement was
poorly handled, owing to attempted interference by senior government officials. The
contracts for replacement fruit trees were only signed in late November 2004, and
distribution to the target beneficiaries did not take place until the spring of 2005. The
opportunity to introduce new frost-resistant grape varieties was not seized as all contracts
were awarded to local suppliers of traditional (non-frost resistant) varieties. Nonetheless,
when it eventually materialized, the assistance was well targeted—all of the 11,700 recipients
were among the poorest farmers—and made a significant contribution to replenishing capital
stocks.66

40.    Overall, efficacy is rated modest. Achievement of two of the four objectives was
rated modest. The components underpinning these objectives (credit and agricultural

66. ICR, p. 19.

services) accounted for 85 percent of project costs, so it is reasonable that they drive the
overall rating.67

Efficiency
41.     Neither the appraisal documents nor the ICR attempted to calculate an economic rate
of return for the entire project. However, the ICR did estimate an ERR of 38 percent for
replanting of frost-damaged vineyards and 72 percent for the fertilizer distribution
program—both under Frost Damage Rehabilitation component, which accounted for less
than 15% of project costs Improved farming methods promoted through the technology
assessment program (TAP) also demonstrated high ERRs: a number of the TAP initiatives
were assessed during the recent preparation of the RESCAD project, and their ERRs ranged
from 24 to 267 percent.68

42.     Although the ICR did not make a detailed analysis of farm models there are
indications that the subprojects financed under the credit line component represented an
efficient use of resources. Only sub-projects with a financial rate of return exceeding 15
percent were eligible for financing, and the credit line achieved high repayment rates,
suggesting that these investments were sound.69 However, five out of eight participating
banks were liquidated and at project closure $1.7 million of their agricultural credit portfolio
supported by the project (9% of total project costs) remained to be recovered by the Ministry
of Finance and Economy.

43.     On balance, efficiency is rated substantial.

Outcome
44.    Based on the assessments of relevance (substantial), efficacy (modest) and efficiency
(substantial), the outcome of this project is rated moderately satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
M&E Design

45.      The project design for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was fairly schematic. At
appraisal, responsibilities for M & E were assigned to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
which was to base its monitoring on data furnished by the implementing agencies –both
central and local – and by the participating banks. A foreign expert was to be engaged to
assist the PIU in establishing the coordination and monitoring arrangements for the credit to
enterprise component. Baseline surveys were to be designed and carried out to facilitate
impact monitoring.

67 The cost breakdown on p.34 of the ICR lumps together frost rehabilitation with agricultural services but p.17
indicates that US$1.3 million was spent on frost rehabilitation; thus, the cost of the agricultural services
component was US$7.8 million. Added to the credit component (US9.4 million), this amounts to 85 percent of
the total actual project cost of US$20.1 million.

M&E Implementation

46.     Implementation was uneven. The Ministry of Agriculture’s former Director of
Extension was transferred to the PIU to coordinate the M&E. The PIU failed to engage a
foreign expert to assist with credit component, with the result that some indicators needed to
assess the performance of the participating banks were never fully developed. The baseline
surveys were not carried out, reducing the scope for rigorous impact evaluation.

M&E Utilization

47.    There was a regular exchange of monitoring data between the participating banks,
ADC, the MASCs and RASC as well as involved departments within the Ministry of
Agriculture and the central bank’s supervision department. But the Armenian Agricultural
Academy was dropped from the loop once it was transferred to the Ministry of Science &
Technology.

48.    Overall, M&E is rated modest.

Risk to Development Outcome
49.     Assessing the Risk to Development Outcome requires consideration of (i) the
continued performance of the main project components, which were modified and to some
extent scaled up in the RESCAD repeater operation, as well as (ii) secondary or spin-off
effects that successful implementation of the main components in the project under review
has had on the nexus of public and private sector institutions serving Armenian farmers and
agribusiness enterprises at large.

50.     Credit. Under RESCAD, different arrangements were introduced for managing
credit. Government created an autonomous Rural Finance Facility (RFF) to coordinate the
credit components of RESCAD and IFAD’s concurrent Rural Areas Economic Development
Program. It also administered credit reflows, a task earlier assigned to the participating
banks. Monitoring of the credit component in the RESCAD was separated from the PIU and
assumed by RFF.

51.     The two commercial banks that had agreed to administer project funds (ACBA and
Converse Bank) pursued different courses. ACBA, which now offers financial services as a
joint venture with France’s Credit Agricole, withdrew from the project, partly because RFF
insisted that it provide sub-loans at highly concessional interest rates; and also because
ABCA was reluctant to comply with the Bank norms and safeguards typically applied to line
of credit operations in this region. On a positive note, ABCA resumed rural lending (outside
of the project) on commercial terms, drawing on its own (substantial) resources. It could be
argued that this favorable outcome was facilitated by the credit culture that ARSP helped to
nurture. Converse Bank continued to participate under RESCAD and agricultural lending has
become a core business for this bank.
                                              45


52.    Agricultural Services. The MASC’s were the centerpiece of the project’s
contribution to institutional strengthening but, for the following reasons, these agencies have
become less relevant:

      Rural clientele are reluctant to pay for MASC advisory services. This has caused
       Government to consider adjusting the self-financing ratios mandated for the
       MASCs—and to ponder whether extension services should be offered free-of-charge
       and funded from the budget;
      At present, MASC’s are able to retain staff by permitting extension agents to accept
       personal service contracts on projects financed by other donors, or to work informally
       with commercial farmers and private agribusinesses—arrangements that are not
       sustainable;
      MASCs are failing to provide the assistance that farmers need with loan proposals;
      Armenia’s new class of commercial (and better educated) farm owners and managers
       generally rely on private agencies for obtaining technical advice—MASCs and other
       public agencies are less well-placed to supply timely information about input supply
       contracts or market intelligence.

53.    The MASC’s loss of relevance reflects the development of the more market-friendly
environment that the Bank had sought to promote all along. The restructuring introduced
during the project (with farmer councils and fee-for-service payments) was intended to
achieve, over time, this market-oriented outcome. The Bank also tried to reduce the number
and cost of the MASCs, to give the remaining ones a better chance of success, but the
Ministry of Agriculture resisted this.

54.     Strengthening of extension services has been hampered by the transfer of oversight
for the Armenian Agricultural Academy (AAA) from the Ministry of Agriculture to the
Ministry of Science and Education. The responsibilities of AAA for extension—and
particularly the division of labor with the MASCs and the RASC—have become blurred,
despite attempts under the follow-on project to clarify AAA’s role. Nevertheless, the
significance of these inter-agency rivalries may dwindle over time as the take-off of
commercial farming brings private extension advisors and veterinarians more to the fore.

55.      Conflicting Donor Approaches. The assessed project attempted to promote the
principle of self-financing agricultural services, an approach that does not square with the
initiatives taken by other donors. Through its Rural Areas Economic Development Program,
IFAD is financing new credit lines at highly concessional interest rates to sub-borrowers, and
has sanctioned Rural Finance Facility (RFF) reflows on similarly concessional terms. This is
one of the reasons why ACBA withdrew. The RFF Board refused to approve the non-
concessional terms that ACBA sought to apply to its rural lending operations under the
project. Meanwhile the Millennium Challenge Corporation is offering advisory services on a
grant basis. MCC’s support for irrigation rehabilitation also involves on-lending to project
beneficiaries on highly concessional terms. Neither of these donors is promoting financial
sustainability, which runs counter to the approach pursued under ARSP and the follow on.
                                                        46


56.     The Risk to Development Outcome is rated significant. While the decline of the
project-supported MASCs is desirable as part of the transition to market-oriented agricultural
services (and consistent with the spirit of ARSP), the emergence of alternative service
providers is still incipient; and movement in this direction may be thwarted as long as other
donors pursue policies conflicting with the goals of financial sustainability.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

57.     Despite considerable efforts by staff during the project’s 2.5 years of preparation
period and careful diagnosis of the risks70 the quality of entry was wanting on several
counts.71 On the one hand, the ADC component was well-designed; its successful
privatization was the ultimate design vindication. On the other hand, the credit to farmers
component had several shortcomings. The prequalification criteria for banks interested in
tendering were poorly specified. It was a mistake to turn over certification responsibilities to
the PIU and Government once Bank staff had prequalified ACBA (the participating bank of
choice). It was unwise to delegate tendering to Government without ensuring Bank oversight
of the evaluation and award process.

58.      The design of the agricultural technology component was overambitious. The
restructuring of research and the reorganization of the 14 research institutes into five regional
centers would have benefited from a more clearly articulated long-term vision. Several of the
prerequisite conditions for appraisal and negotiations were satisfied—but to the letter, not in
spirit. For example, the Agricultural Research Council was duly established but never
functioned as intended. The proposals for linking applied research and extension conflicted
with the approach being followed by the USDA sponsored TAP program—a conflict that
was not resolved during implementation, probably reducing the diffusion of findings from
competitive grant subprojects and undercutting the MASCs. Finally, the design of monitoring
and evaluation was too schematic.

59.    Because it appears that the project was not fully ready for implementation in 1997,
Quality at Entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

Quality of Supervision

60.     Supervision had to contend with the legacy of incomplete project design, external
shocks leading to macroeconomic instability and budgetary shortfalls, and the devastating
frost damage in 2002 and 2004. The Bank supervision process arguably tackled these
problems as well as could be expected. However, it could have done more to remedy an
important design failing: the lack of provision for adequate monitoring and evaluation.


70. These included: (i) lack of experience in handling broad based and multidisciplinary projects in Armenia,
(ii) continuation of the economic blockade, (iii) delays in functioning markets and financial institutions, and (iv)
inadequate budgetary resources (ICR pp. 25-26).
71. The quality at entry for this project was not rated by QAG.
                                               47


61.     In two respects, Bank supervision was flexible and pragmatic. First, in response to
shortfalls in counterpart funding, the Bank agreed in December 2002 to continue financing,
all ARC research contracts and the operating costs of project institutions at 40 percent, rather
than at 20 percent, the level envisaged at appraisal. Second, the Bank was quick to approve a
new project component to address frost damage once the severity of the emergency became
clear. This new project component was initially financed by a reallocation of existing project
funds; these were then replenished by a supplementary credit.

62.     There were some shortfalls in the Bank’s supervision of the prequalification and
tendering process for participating banks. The consequences were felt early on, with five of
the eight participating banks declared insolvent. This set back progress toward the objective
of developing a sustainable rural finance system. However, the prime responsibility for
banking oversight rested with the Enterprise Development Project (EDP) rather than with
ARSP.

63.    In view of the severity of the challenges faced and the commitment to tackling them,
Bank supervision is rated satisfactory.

Overall Bank Performance

64.     Consistent with the OPCS/IEG guidelines on aggregating sub-ratings for Bank
Performance, the lowest sub-rating determines the overall outcome: a modestly satisfactory
rating on quality at entry and a satisfactory rating on supervision Bank performance add up to
an overall performance rating of moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government Performance

65.    The government showed commitment to preparation but less so to implementation.
Competent and experienced counterparts worked with the Bank’s preparation team, making
an important contribution to project design. During the preparation and piloting phase, the
government made a capital contribution of US$2 million to ACBA, the main participating
bank.

66.     Momentum occasionally faltered during implementation. Project effectiveness was
delayed by about six months because of the complex ratification requirements and
procedures in Armenia. Similar delays were encountered in attaining effectiveness of the
“emergency” Supplemental Credit, which caused delays of up to two years in getting
seedlings and saplings to farmers after the destructive frost of December 2002. During the
first years of the project, counterpart funding was provided only after long delays and fell
well short of requirements for effective project implementation. It was only from late 2002
onward (four years after the project was declared effective) that sufficient counterpart
contribution finally became available. Also, implementation was delayed by the attempts of
senior government officials to intervene in the procurement process relating to the frost
response component.
                                                        48


67.     The government was responsible for the decision to transfer the Armenian
Agricultural Academy and its research faculties and extension department from the Ministry
of Agriculture (MOA) to the Ministry of Science and Education (MSE). This was highly
disruptive causing problems even once the counterpart funds began to flow—because direct
disbursements to MSE were not authorized under the project. There were disagreements
between MOA and MSE about how research priorities72 should be determined, and how
extension might best be organized. The outcome was MOA’s need to create a parallel
structure in the form of the RASC, which thereafter functioned as a budgeting and
coordinating agency for the agricultural technology component.

68.     The government also imprudently chose not to engage an international rural credit
specialist to assist the PIU and advise Government on the prequalification and tendering by
commercial banks.

69.    On a positive note, the government successfully privatized ADC, which continues to
provide valuable business services to agribusiness processors, traders and commercial
farmers.

70.      Overall, the Government’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Implementing Agency Performance

71.      The PIU effectively administered most project components. It provided sound
coordination between, on the one hand, the Ministry of Agriculture and cooperating agencies
at the central level and, on the other hand, the local government departments. The PIU made
a solid contribution to the agricultural service centers and the Agribusiness Development
Center. (It remains to be seen if it will ultimately be absorbed by a government department.)

72.     However, the PIU shares responsibility with government for the failure to hire an
international credit consultant. It also failed to develop an appropriate agenda once research
responsibilities were transferred from MOA to the Ministry of Science & Education. The PIU
also shares responsibility with the Bank for the limited development of monitoring and
evaluation.

73.      Implementing agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Overall Borrower Performance

74.     Because the weaknesses in government performance were substantial and played such
a large part in limiting project outcome, overall Borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory.


72. For example, with support from the project, the ARC was intended to be the coordinating body for
consolidating research institutes into regional bodies and for setting (and vetting) research priorities. However,
it only met a few times before going dormant.
                                                49


Lessons Learned
75.       This project assessment suggests three broad lessons.

76.     Lesson 1: Projects that involve a major restructuring of financial institutions and that
face limited Borrower capacity need to meet the following conditions:

         Clear and rigorous criteria for determining whether commercial banks are eligible for
          tendering in the project;
         “Prequalification” of financial intermediaries deemed eligible to participate in
          tendering for loan proceeds, on the basis of a thorough prudential examination —
          supervised by the Bank where necessary;
         Continuous monitoring by the Bank to ensure that eligibility and performance criteria
          are met;
         Hiring of banking or credit specialists to oversee the processes for determining
          eligibility and carrying out tendering.

77.     Lesson 2: In order to provide the right incentives it is important to allow participating
financial intermediaries to administer credit reflows in accordance with their own terms and
conditions. Provided that participating banks meet the regulatory requirements approved by
the Bank, and articulated through the project design, there is no case for paternalism in
dictating how they should employ the returns to their lending activity.

78.     Lesson 3: Projects that are designed to support reform of the national agricultural
technology system need to be based on a clear agreement with the various concerned
government agencies about the implementation strategy and arrangements for coordination;
this agreement needs to be reached before the loan or credit is made effective.

ANNEX 2: GEORGIA - AGRICULTURAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT-C2941)
Summary
This Performance Assessment Report reviews the Georgia Agricultural Development
Project (ADP), which was the first Bank-assisted investment project to support the
transition of Georgian agriculture following Independence and rural decollectivization.
The ADP Credit was approved on February 28, 1997. It closed on June 30, 2005, 38
months after the original closing date.

The ADP’s original overarching objective was to increase agricultural productivity in
Georgia by supporting the development of private sector farming and agro-processing.
Following a formal project restructuring in March 2002, the revised overall objective was
“to remove key constraints to increasing incomes in rural areas of Georgia”. Specific
objectives were: (i) to increase the access of agribusiness firms to investment credit; (ii)
to increase the access of farmers to rural credit; (iii) to increase liquidity in land markets;
and (iv) to identify, through a series of studies and pilot operations, an agricultural
development and investment program to address other major constraints to increased
agricultural productivity. Project components consisted of credit to agro-enterprise,
support for the development of credit unions, consolidation of land registration and
studies in support of project preparation and agriculture policy reform.

Outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Project objectives continue to be relevant to
Bank and Borrower strategy and are well supported by sector analysis. The land
registration objectives were substantially achieved. The project modernized two regional
land offices (and partially equipped Georgia’s remaining 9 offices), by upgrading
facilities and providing computers, software, and a digitized information system that
improved the accuracy of land mapping and facilitated quick retrieval of land records and
titling. The results of these pilots were subsequently extended nationwide.

But these positive results were more than offset by the limited achievement of objectives
relating to rural finance and policy reform. The two poorly-performing credit components
accounted for 72 percent of total project costs. Although the credit to enterprises
component disbursed the intended level of funds little ground was laid for scaling up: the
project objective would have been better served if participating banks had been offered a
longer repayment period; and if the project legal documents had specified that credit
reflows be recycled. Instead, the Government transferred the recovered funds to the
budget following the completion of loan recovery. Under the credit union component
there was a rapid and undisciplined expansion of these institutions, a process that became
politicized and proved to be unsustainable. At the peak there were around 150 credit
unions; about three years after the project closed, only seven remained in operation and
only two of these are considered truly viable. With respect to the fourth objective, there
was a shortfall in the production of relevant studies and options for a national agricultural
and food export improvement program were never developed
                                            58


M&E performance is also rated modest, owing to the lack of progress with impact
monitoring.

The Risk to Development outcome is rated significant. On the one hand, the project
achievements in relation to land registration will be maintained. The National Agency for
Public Registry (NAPR) has been established as a Legal Entity under Public Law, and is
the single authority for land registration and cadastre management. It is fully operational
and financially sustainable. Significant revenue has been generated from the rapid rise in
registered transactions. But this positive evidence of sustainability is offset by the less
promising outlook for rural financial institutions. Although participating banks have
begun lending again to farms and agro-enterprises the market is very shallow (loans to
agriculture from all sources account for only 1.2 percent of sector GDP).The prospects
for establishing credit unions on a new and sounder footing are limited because
government has failed to pass the necessary laws and regulations

Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Quality at entry was generally sound
and the quality of supervision was adequate in the final years of implementation. But
earlier on the Bank should not have acquiesced in the unregulated proliferation of credit
unions and could have resisted the Ministry of Finance’s transfer of revolving fund
balances to the state budget.

Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The government had more
control than the Bank over the reckless expansion of credit unions and the use of credit
reflows and this explains why the rating for the Borrower is lower than that of the Bank.
The performance of the implementing agency was uneven.

Experience from this project points to the following lessons:

      The legal and regulatory underpinnings for successful financial sector
       operations need to be spelled out in the project legal documents. In the ADP an
       opportunity to scale up lending to rural enterprises was missed because the
       Development Credit Agreement failed to provide for the recycling of reflows.

      The eligibility criteria for sub-borrowers need to be clearly defined and well
       enforced. In this project the Bank should have taken more steps to enforce such
       criteria and to contain the reckless expansion of credit unions. It should have
       suspended disbursements until order was restored.

      The staffs of partner financial institutions need to be trained to rigorously
       appraise loan proposals. The experience of ADP shows how important it is for
       staff to be able to assess market prospects for the commodities to be produced and
       to develop repayment schedules consistent with income streams.

      Start-up village-based credit cooperatives should not be expected to deliver large
       amounts of credit in the early stages. It takes time to build up capacity and scale,
       and this should be done with appropriate safeguards, training, reporting and
       oversight in place.

Background
1.      The decollectivization that followed Georgia Independence in 1991 led to a near
collapse in agricultural production, productivity, and exports. In the mid-1990s, when
project preparation was initiated, agricultural GDP was less than one-half of its 1990
level, having suffered one of the largest declines in the ECA Region.

2.      A recent Georgia Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE)73 records that
“Agriculture has traditionally been the mainstay of Georgia's economy. The country was
a net supplier of vegetables, fruits, tea, wine, and brandy to the rest of the Soviet Union.
In 1990, the sector employed nearly one-third of the labor force and accounted for 33
percent of GDP. The shocks that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in a
sharp decline in output and exports, reducing them in 1993 to about one-third of 1990
levels. The state order system, which underpinned agricultural trade and production, had
collapsed, and was abolished in 1995. By that time, key constraints to sector growth were
unfinished privatization, lack of access to credit, weak management capacity, poor state
of infrastructure (irrigation, drainage, roads), and unreliable energy supply.”

3.      Agricultural GDP growth fell considerably between 1994 and 2000, recovering in
2001-2006; but the sector share of overall GDP slumped (Table 1). Still, in 2002-2004
agriculture continued to provide part- and full-time employment to 54 percent of the
country’s labor force. The CAE74 concurs with this assessment: “Overall, progress in
increasing agricultural growth and productivity and in alleviating rural poverty (in
Georgia) has been limited.”

4.      Output performance is mixed. The volatility of wheat production reflects weather
variations (Figure 1). The overall stagnant trend is partly the result of a slump in the
availability of tractor services (Table 2) and privatization of collective farm lands into
small, non-contiguous plots. The expansion in milk production mainly reflects a
systematic effort by Georgian authorities to improve cattle breeds and feeding regimens
for smallholders; and to augment the availability of veterinary services and control the
outbreak of disease, especially in the private sector.

5.       Irrigation is vital in Eastern Georgia but less so in western regions, where the
presence of convection rainfall makes drainage more of a priority. According to a recent
survey, 52 percent of Georgian communities require irrigation for the whole arable land
area. In two-thirds of these communities, 50 percent or less of the land requiring
irrigation actually benefits from a functioning irrigation system. Where irrigation is
installed it is often in disrepair.75 This constrains growth in agricultural value added and
the productivity of grains and other field crops.

6.      Meanwhile, the incidence of rural poverty remains high in Georgia. According to
government data, 43.5 percent of the rural population fell below the income-based
poverty threshold in 2003, and 22.3 percent were in extreme poverty.76 By 2006, the
respective ratios had declined slightly to 40.5 and 20.2 percent, showing only a modest
reduction in rural poverty in this period of substantial economic growth.77

7.    It is noteworthy that the progress of Georgia’s agricultural transition and reforms
was consistently rated amongst the middle group of Central and East European and
Former Soviet Economies being tracked by ECSSD, but that it had fallen from a middle

position in this group in 2000 to the bottom of the group by 2005.78 This reflected the
stalled reform of agriculture service institutions and the weak business climate for agro-
processing industries.

8.       The outcome of Georgia’s agricultural reforms is aptly summed up by the recent
Country Assistance Evaluation: “Progress in increasing growth and productivity and in
alleviating rural poverty has been limited… Productivity is low and a number of
institutional issues remain unresolved: small farmers do not have easy access to credit;
the agricultural market is underdeveloped; and the research, extension, and education
systems are not consistently able to help farmers in adopting modern technology and
practices. The irrigation and drainage system is incomplete and food safety issues
continue to impede export. It needs to be noted, however, that agriculture sector
outcomes were affected by many external factors, including political events and natural
disasters (droughts and floods).”79

Project Objectives & Design
9.      The analytical underpinning of the Bank’s strategy for Georgia agriculture was set
forth in its agriculture and food sector review.80 The strategy had three objectives: first,
sustain agricultural and food production conditions; second, permit an increase in exports
both to Western markets and former markets in the FSU, thus increasing hard currency
earnings from food and agriculture; and third, assist the Government in the
transformation of agriculture and food processing from a centrally planned economy to a
market oriented environment. Its four main pillars were to:

          Complete land reform and collective farm restructuring, begun under the
           1992 land reform decree;
          Develop a working competitive domestic market for agricultural products and
           agriculture sector services;
          Create a financial services system that could meet the rural sector's credit
           needs; and
          Develop an institutional framework consistent with the needs of a market-
           based agriculture that included changing the Government's role from one of
           direct management of the sector’s production and marketing activities, to a
           more hands-off role of supporting the needs of privatized agriculture through
           regulation, research and analysis, and the provision of public services.

10.     These four elements of strategy were reflected in the design of the Agricultural
Development Project (ADP), which was the Bank Group’s first credit to Georgia’s
agricultural sector. Approved in FY97, the project’s strategic aim was to help deepen and
diversify the sources of growth and reduce rural poverty. Co-financed by the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the overarching project
objective was to increase agricultural productivity in Georgia by supporting the

development of private sector farming and agro-processing. The specific objectives were
to:

         Develop an agricultural credit system;
         Facilitate increased liquidity in land markets;
         Identify, through training, a series of studies and pilot operations, and an
          agricultural development and investment program to address major constraints to
          increasing agricultural productivity.

11.     In the interests of greater clarity, following the mid-term review in March 2002,
the project’s objectives were reworded to read: “to remove key constraints to increasing
incomes in rural areas of Georgia by increasing the access of agribusiness firms to
investment credit; increasing the access of farmers to rural credit; increasing liquidity in
land markets; and identifying, through a series of studies and pilot operations, an
agricultural development and investment program to address other major constraints to
increased agricultural productivity”.81

12.       The project had five components.

          Component 1 - Credit to Enterprises: (US$12.0 million, actual $13.0 million).
          This component aimed at providing private enterprises in rural areas, with loans at
          market prices through private commercial banks, plus technical assistance in
          preparing business plans and loan applications. The credit was to be disbursed
          through participating banks which would sign subsidiary loan agreements with the
          Ministry of Finance. A participating bank would be accredited by IDA to
          participate in the project after meeting a set of predetermined accreditation
          criteria, which would assess the bank's financial viability measured against
          international accounting standards, adequate management strengths, capability to
          assess credit and risks, credit absorptive capacity, and adherence to the National
          Bank of Georgia's prudential banking standards. The line of credit to enterprises
          would finance fixed investments and associated working capital.

          Component 2 - Credit Unions: (US$ 7.5 million, actual $6.3 million).82 This
          component aimed to develop a network of 120 rural CUs that would mobilize
          savings and provide loans and financial services for small farmers, micro-
          enterprises and the general rural population. Support for the development of the
          legal and regulatory framework for the establishment of Credit Unions (CUs) was
          intended, as well as establishment of a Credit Union Development Center
          (CUDC), to provide supervision, training and monitoring of CU operations. The
          plan was to create a maximum of 120 CUs during the five years of project
          implementation. However, achieving high prudential standards and sound
          management took precedence over this numerical target. The project would also
          support the regulatory body for CUs, the Credit Union Development Center


81. ICR, paragraph 3.2.
82. The ICR, Annex 2 for this project records the costs at appraisal at US$8.4 million. No explanation is
given for this discrepancy.

         (CUDC) which would regulate and supervise the operations of the CUs, provide
         training to the staff of the CUs once they become eligible to participate in the
         program, and assist farmers to join the CUs and to take advantage of the services
         being provided by the CUs. The CUDC was expected to monitor CUs compliance
         with interim prudential regulations developed by the appraisal team. At appraisal
         it was expected that a law regulating the establishment of CUs and the
         development of a more permanent set of prudential requirements would be
         prepared and submitted to Parliament for approval within the following two years.
         Credit unions that met eligibility criteria would be able to obtain grants from the
         project to cover their establishment and operating costs, and to capitalize an
         insurance fund until sufficient member equity could be accumulated. They would
         also be eligible to receive project funds on a loan basis for on-lending to
         members.

         Component 3 - Land Registration: (US$ 6.0 million, actual $5.6 million). The
         project planned to support the land registration program through the establishment
         of an institutional framework and the development of implementation capacity to
         register and issue land titles to individuals and firms. Pilots implemented in
         Gardabani and Mtskheta rayons would concentrate on privately held rural lots and
         farm lands. Experience from these two rayons would inform subsequent
         expansion of land registration in other parts of the country. Land parcels in the
         project area would be regularly surveyed. Sporadic surveying of individual
         parcels would also be conducted on a trial basis outside these two districts at the
         land holder’s expense. All parcels in the area would be surveyed by private survey
         companies that would be set up and trained under the project. Land Registration
         Offices would be established in each of the two project rayons and would be
         responsible for registering the holdings. Expenses associated with this first phase
         of the program would be financed in parallel by the IFAD and IDA credits.
         However, land owners in the area would contribute in the form of registration
         fees. To prepare for the next phase of the land registration program, the project
         also aimed to finance aerial photography over other parts of Georgia.

         Component 4 - Agricultural Services: (US$ 0.5 million, actual $0.3 million).
         This component was designed to assist the government in formulating the next
         phase of its development strategy and investment program for the agriculture
         sector through a series of studies to identify priority agricultural services as well
         as to define private and public sector roles.83 Activities to be financed under this
         component included: (a) the formulation of options for developing a national
         export improvement program; (b) a pilot program to improve the collection and
         publication of agricultural statistics by government agencies, (c) the design and
         testing of pilot research and extension modalities for small private farmers using
         mainly private service providers, and of farm management training programs, (d)
         studies to monitor the land reform and evolution of land markets, and options for


83. These were in the areas of exports, agricultural statistics, agricultural extension and research, farm
management and irrigation and soil amelioration.
                                            65


       establishing a deposit insurance scheme for rural CUs, (e) training for government
       economists in agricultural policy analysis, and (f) prepare a proposal for an
       irrigation and soil amelioration program. It was intended that the net result of
       these activities would be a strategy and investment program, acceptable to IDA,
       for the next phase of the agricultural development program. The report outlining
       the program would be presented to IDA by the mid-term review.

       Component 5 - Project Coordination Unit: (US$0.3 million, actual $1.6 million).
       The project also provided financial support for office establishment, procurement
       of equipment, operating costs and staff training for the Project Coordination Unit
       (PCU), with operating costs being funded via a Special Account for Project
       Administration.

Relevance
13.     The relevance of project objectives is rated substantial. Agriculture was identified
as a primary source of expected growth during Georgia’s early transition. This
assessment concurs with the ICR, that the ADP’s development objectives were consistent
with the CAS objectives which emphasized sector reform programs and promoting
private sector development and recognized that the agriculture sector would need to be
one of Georgia's primary sources of economic growth. Realizing this potential, however,
was contingent on the completion of farm restructuring and land reform, the existence of
competitive domestic markets, the development of financial systems to meet rural credit
needs and the improvement of the institutional framework to make it consistent with the
needs of market-based agriculture. All were specific development objectives for the
project. Also, the project supported the implementation of specific policy reforms that
were incorporated in the Structural Adjustment Program.

14.    The relevance of project design is also rated substantial. There was a need to
formulate a rural and agricultural investment program, and provide the training and
investment support to achieve the project’s development objectives. The several
components described above were tailored to provide institutional support and
development financing for rural enterprises and Georgia’s new cohort of smallholders. At
appraisal, ADP was probably the most feasible design possible. The design was flexible
enough to facilitate adjustments at mid-term and earlier, allowing for the macroeconomic
uncertainties, which had a strong impact on both sector performance and the availability
of counterpart funding; and also making allowance for the political uncertainties of the
time.

15.    The project's overall relevance is rated substantial.

Efficacy
16.     The aggregate data on agricultural productivity growth show modest progress
over the period coinciding with project implementation (Figure 3, main text). It is
impossible to say how much the project contributed to this outcome. Owing partly to the
deficiencies of the M&E framework (see Section 4 below) it was not possible to ascertain
what contribution the project made to revised overall objective of increasing rural
                                             66


incomes. IEG’s discussions with project personnel and beneficiaries yielded a highly
mixed picture on the overall trend in incomes; this evidence in considered inconclusive.
The rest of this section discusses progress made toward the project’s specific objectives.

17.      Objective 1: Increase the access of agribusiness firms to investment credit
(Rating: Modest). The ICR reported that 48 loans were made to agribusiness enterprises,
a total of US$8.6 million being channeled through 8 participating commercial banks. The
loans were used for investment and working capital in six fruits and vegetable canneries,
ten wineries, four wheat flour mills, five mineral water and soft drink plants, seven hazel
nut production and processing factories, two tea processing factories, eight livestock
production farms, two meat processing plants, one wood processing factory and three
crop production farms. Of the 48 sub-projects, 73 percent were export-oriented and 27
percent were for the domestic market. Only four sub-loans were closed before maturity
(either because they were used for unapproved purposes or because of managerial
problems).

18.     With regard to the participating banks, the ICR states that the project has
contributed in significant ways to the development of the Georgia banking system, and
has helped to attract commercial banks to the rural sector. The banking system is
considerably stronger than it was when the project started: the total assets of the banking
sector have increased from US$183 million in 1997, to US$390 million at mid-term
review and to US$931 million in December 2004. The participating bank approval
process benefited the whole banking system during the early stages of the project by
establishing a set of prudential standards for the upper echelon of Georgian Banks. To
remain eligible these banks were required to adopt international accounting standards and
new operating procedures. This has helped to raise standards in the banking system as a
whole.

19.     Compared with the period before project start up, the enterprise loan facility led to
an increase in medium-term commercial bank lending to the agro-processing sector.
Demand for credit remains high. Also, bank liquidity has risen in recent years. On the
other hand, the short-term nature of deposits has served to constrain long-term
agricultural lending. Recently several leading banks have resumed lending to the rural
sector, while micro credit organizations have established a substantial rural presence with
low default on their agricultural loan portfolio. The upturn is reflected in the interest
Georgian banks have shown in the follow-on RDP agricultural credit line.

20.     Nonetheless, two of the eight participating commercial banks were liquidated
after the Russian financial collapse, with outstanding debt to the project of US$1.7
million. On the advice of the auditor, the Project Implementing Unit asked the Ministry
of Finance to write off the debt. Additional lending was made using reflows from the
project’s revolving fund, until the government transferred the remaining balances to the
state budget. Unfortunately, this transfer was in violation of the terms of subsidiary loan
agreements signed with the participating banks, undermining plans to scale-up the
enterprise credit component with reflows. The ICR referred to this transfer but
understated the disruption it caused. Additional safeguards were employed in the design
of the follow-on Rural Development Project (RDP) to encourage the mainstreaming of
credit reflows.
                                                   67


21.    Shortcomings in the performance of the Credit to Enterprises component were as
follows:

       the staff of participating banks were not well trained to deal with rural lending
        and, in particular, the investigation of creditworthiness was not sufficiently
        thorough;
       the technical and marketing aspects of sub-loan appraisals were weak;84
       the repayment obligations of participating banks restricted the scope for term
        lending to sub-borrowers; and
       the use of credit reflows was not spelled out in the Development Credit
        Agreement.

22.      Objective 2: Increase the access of farmers to rural credit (Rating:
Negligible). A parallel effort to route credit to rural households via an untested network
of credit unions (CUs) performed poorly. At the outset, ten CUs were established and
performed well. But there was then a rush to create a multitude of CUs, partly
encouraged by the Bank’s enthusiasm for scaling-up. (On a visit to Georgia the Bank
Group’s President delivered a message to this effect). The expansion process was subject
to political interference, with campaign promises about bringing a CU to every village.
Between 1998 and 1999 164 CUs were set up, with 12,231 members. The project was not
able to ensure adequate oversight; monitoring systems and capacity building programs
for CU management were inadequate. In this environment, mismanagement, fraudulent
activity and failure were inevitable.

23.     Lacking proper legal sanction and technical supervision, and perhaps
disadvantaged by increased direct lending to rural clientele by Georgia’s commercial
banks, the CU movement quickly deteriorated. By November 2008, a mere seven CUs
remained in operation, of which only two are considered viable today by the PCU/PIU.85
The ICR reported that a Credit Cooperatives Law had been enacted before the project
closed. This was not the case. A law to govern non-bank financial intermediaries was
approved by Parliament in 2005, but it did not extend to regulation of CUs. At the time of
this assessment mission (November 2008), a CU Law was being drafted by the National
Bank of Georgia and one of the two remaining CUs but had not yet been submitted for
review by the Parliament’s Banking Committee.

24.    Summing up, the performance of the Credit Unions component suffered the
following shortcomings:

       There was a failure at the outset to anticipate the likely consequences of rapidly
        introducing state supported financial services into a rural society lacking a credit
        culture and any real notion of personal financial responsibility beyond obligations
        to friends and neighbors;
       Local authorities treated the new credit institutions as a conduit for the transfer of
        central government largess and, partly for electoral reasons, the central

         government did little to correct this perception or to regulate the expansion of the
         credit unions;
        Eligibility criteria for prospective CU managers were not spelled out and training
         was insufficient; and
        CU legislation was weak and poorly enforced and the regulatory body established
         in the National Bank of Georgia following the mid-term review was ineffective.

25.     Objective 3: Increase liquidity in land markets (Rating: Substantial). The
land registration system was piloted and is now being used throughout Georgia. An
independent and self-financing land registration and cadastre agency was successfully
promoted. The 2004 Law on State Registry established the National Agency for Public
Registry (NAPR), which has achieved financial self-sufficiency and shows every
prospect of being sustainable. The follow-on project supported the expansion of the
NAPR's communication system, and made additional investments in computerization,
office infrastructure and public awareness, leading to full consolidation of the apparatus
of land registration.

26.     Other donors also have programs to assist Georgia with land registration. German
bilateral aid (KfW) helped develop land registration, land improvement and cadastre
management software and this is now being used nationwide. The Bank supported
software continues to be used as a backup in the central office and the ADP’s two
regional offices. Although the initiatives by other donors were intended to complement
the Bank program there is some indication that coordination could have been better.

27.     Objective 4: Ease other constraints to agricultural productivity (Rating:
Modest). The project financed four studies that were broadly consistent with the objective
of boosting agricultural productivity. Two of these studies were designed to support
project preparation, leading to the Bank-supported Irrigation and Drainage Community
Development Project and the Agricultural Research, Extension and Training Project. Two
other studies were intended to help strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture. A Risk
Assessment Study audited Ministry accounts and reviewed outstanding legal cases. A
separate study examined accounting procedures, training and software requirements.
Building on this an attempt was made to train staff in International Public Sector
Accounting Standards and introduce accounting software. However, restructuring of the
Ministry led to the loss of many project-trained accounting staff, although the software
survived. Nevertheless, a follow-up EU project reinstated many of the processes first
championed by the Risk Assessment team.86

28.    At appraisal various policy studies linked to agriculture productivity enhancement
had been envisaged but none of these materialized; nor did the related training. For
reasons not satisfactorily explained by Georgian authorities during the assessment
mission, options for a national agricultural and food export improvement program were
never developed. Also, the anticipated pilot program to improve the collection and
publication of agricultural statistics was not launched. Similarly, options for establishing

86. ICR, pp. 7-8.
                                           69


a deposit insurance scheme for rural CUs were not pursued, and no program was
developed to train government economists in agricultural policy analysis. Project-
sponsored studies to monitor the land reform and the evolution of land markets were not
conducted.

29.    Overall, IEG rates efficacy as modest.

Efficiency
30.     No economic rate of return was calculated, either at appraisal or for the ICR. The
land registration component, which made up 21 percent of total project costs, produced
significant results and had a positive spill-over on non-participating rayons. Also, total
project costs did not exceed appraisal estimates. But, all-in-all, the ICR appears to have
overstated project benefits. Although financial rates of return above 25 percent were
recorded for a small sample of larger enterprises, the ICR notes that by project
completion most of the enterprises that had borrowed under the credit to enterprises
component had been restructured, sold or merged. Only 11 of the 47 enterprises were still
in the same business for which they had obtained loans. Possibly the assessments of
creditworthiness were not well done. Possibly the business environment altered
dramatically and unexpectedly after the credits were given. Either way, the credit to
enterprise component did not yield sound results.

31.     In conclusion, the land registration component is likely to have had a high
economic rate of return, based on international experience with similar initiatives. The
very high demand for land registration that was experienced under the project is itself an
indicator of expected high benefits. But if an ex-post economic rate of return had been
calculated based on the credit to enterprises component and the Credit Unions component
it would likely have been less than the opportunity cost of capital. Taking the three
components together, efficiency is rated modest.

Outcome
32.     On the basis of the ADP’s substantial relevance, modest efficacy and modest
efficiency owing to the questionable performance under the two credit components
(which accounted for 72 percent of total costs) the project’s outcome is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
M&E DESIGN

33.    At appraisal, responsibilities for M&E were assigned to the project
implementation unit, which would draw on data from three sources: the Credit to
Enterprises Unit (CEU), the Credit Union Development Center (CUDC) and the Land
Registration Units (LRUs). A specialist, hired by the PIU, would be responsible for
coordinating M&E in the project. Baseline surveys were available to facilitate impact
monitoring in the two rayons slated to implement the pilot land registration component.
These surveys included household demographic characteristics, production and financial
                                                    70


information. There would also be two follow-up socioeconomic surveys that would
include monitoring of gender bias in registration, dispute resolution, and the volume of
land transactions.

M&E IMPLEMENTATION

34.     Soon after the loan became effective the PIU engaged an M&E specialist who
was responsible for making periodic progress reports to the Bank. Implementation
monitoring was very uneven, in part owing to the disparate capabilities of the responsible
agencies. Although the M&E indicators were hardly complex, the CUDC was unable to
adequately monitor the CUs’ performance, especially during and after the period when
the CU system became politicized and over-extended. CUDC was slow to install an
adequate loan monitoring system. Positioned within the PIU, the CEU carried out its
responsibilities for monitoring implementation of the project’s Credit to Enterprises
component satisfactorily. The LRUs effectively monitored implementation, while the
social impact study was satisfactorily updated in 2004 and is now being used in the
follow-on project to help evaluate impact.

M&E UTILIZATION

35.     M&E was largely limited to tracking project implementation and—save for the
CU component—was carried out satisfactorily. The PIU received regular reports from
the CEU and the National Agency for Public Registry (parent agency for the LRUs) as
well as relevant departments in the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, the
National Bank of Georgia, and the central bank supervision department. Except for the
Land Registration and Titling component, impact evaluation was overlooked (not having
been anticipated in the project design).

36.      Based on these considerations the overall rating of M&E is modest.

Risk to Development Outcome
37.     Several achievements of the ADP are likely to be sustainable. After a hiatus
caused by tight economic conditions and a lack of liquidity the participating banks (or
their successors) are, with support from the RDP, again venturing into agricultural
lending, principally to established agribusiness enterprises.87 Many of the assets financed
under the ADP continue to contribute to Georgian agricultural sector productivity,
although ownership has altered substantially following asset sales and company mergers
and/or restructuring.

38.      The assessment mission confirmed that the National Agency for Public Registry
is fully established and financially sustainable. Databases have been digitized. Customer
assistance is now more timely and responsive. Fees for land registration services have
been kept down but revenues are burgeoning owing to the sharp uptick in the number of

87. The impact of the global financial crisis on Georgia’s financial markets could dilute these encouraging
developments.
                                             71


registered transactions. The two regional offices that were set up by the project are well
equipped, perform well and are financially self-sufficient. These offices have served as
the model for the nine other regional offices established under the follow-on project.
Land surveys have been conducted in ten more regions and the results have been cross-
checked with landowners and added to the national cadastre.

39.     In other respects, prospects for sustainability are more mixed. On the one hand,
the two Bank-supported projects based on preparatory studies funded by ADP are
performing well. Also, thanks to the project’s Risk Analysis initiative, all outstanding
court cases against the Ministry of Agriculture have been resolved. In addition, the
Ministry now conforms to international accounting standards and has the requisite
software. On the other hand, project failings with respect to policy studies and training
left government staff ill-prepared to cope with the nuances of agricultural policy making
and the approach to this is unsystematic.

40.     The biggest risks to development outcome center on the credit to enterprises and
credit union components. In particular, there are legal impediments to a revival of credit
unions. A 2002 law for Non-bank & Depository Institutions treats CUs as non-bank
financial institutions, reducing their ability to organize, accept member deposits and
develop a capital base. The restrictions in the law regarding the legal status of NBFI
founders (physical persons only) and limitations on the kinds of financial services CUs
can offer (loans and deposit taking only) have hampered the transformation of otherwise
viable CUs into full-service rural financial institutions.

41.    The design of ADP failed to provide for satisfactory transition arrangements to
CU self-sufficiency. The follow-on project addressed the issue. It sought to consolidate
and expand the CU network and to establish, by 2010, an apex structure that would be
owned and managed by the member CUs. But there has been little progress on this front.

42.     The project did, however, serve as a magnet for additional lending to rural
enterprises by non-participating banks. The National Bank of Georgia’s aggregated data
on loan approvals and outstanding balances does not bear out the suggestion in the ICR
that there was a retrenchment in rural lending soon after the project closed.

43.      On the other hand, the monetization of the Georgian economy was still limited,
even when the follow-on RDP was appraised. Banking system assets amounted to only
17 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the PAD for the follow-on project noted that in 2005,
agricultural lending by commercial banks, NGOs and microfinance institutions (adding
up to US$15 million) was equivalent to a mere 1.2 percent of agriculture GDP. Among
the banks that were pre-qualified to participate in the RDP, Bank Republic had
substantially reduced its rural portfolio once project funds had been disbursed and repaid,
while agricultural lending by the Bank of Georgia was a mere 2 percent of its total
portfolio. The same was true for the United Bank of Georgia: its pilot agricultural
portfolio, initiated in February 2004 as the ADP was about to close, amounted to only 0.7
percent of its total lending in 2005. Only the ProCreditBank, which continued to enjoy
access to medium and long term resources from partner international financial
institutions, had significant outreach to rural areas: loans to agriculture had grown to 10
                                              72


percent of its portfolio by 2005, lending routed mainly through processors who financed
producers under contract farming arrangements.

44.      IEG rates the overall risk to development outcome as significant.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY

45.     At the time it was approved the project was consistent with the borrower's
agricultural development strategy and with the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy. Also,
project design was closely linked to recommendations contained in the Agriculture and
Food Sector Review published by the Bank in 1995. These documents emphasized the
need to remove constraints to agro-enterprises and private farmers and to develop rural
technical and financial infrastructure for production, processing and marketing. The
project also drew on the available Bank experience with land and rural credit reform in
transitional economies. The project was prepared in collaboration with IFAD, which
provided sound assistance with the design and co-financed the credit union and land
registry components.

46.    Given the difficult economic and political environment, the Bank managed ADP
preparation as well as could be expected. But, as the ICR notes, project design could have
been more specific about exit strategies for the CU and land registry institutions.88 Also,
with respect to the credit to enterprises component, participating banks should have been
given a longer repayment period. The Development Credit Agreement should have made
more explicit provision for the recycling of credit. Failure to do so allowed the
government to transfer recovered funds to the budget, reducing the scope for
consolidation.

47.      Overall, quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

48.    Bank supervision was relatively intense, involving 15 missions over 8 years, but
there were some shortcomings. The Bank acquiesced in the rapid expansion of CUs
without adequate assurance that the savings base was sufficient to allow for
sustainability. There was some inattention to the refinancing of ailing, but well managed
CUs, and a recommendation to increase interest rates should have been made at this
juncture. The Bank could also have taken more steps to remove overlap and
inconsistencies in donor support for land registration. It should have done more to
address the pre-2003 inefficiencies in the project implementing unit.

49.    The supervision teams failed to anticipate the eventual shake-out among
beneficiaries of the Credit to Enterprises component, as well as the demise of two

88. ICR, p. 12.
                                             73


participating banks. Although the provision for recycling was not made by the
Development Credit Agreement, the Bank could have taken a stand on the matter once it
became clear that the Treasury intended to appropriate sub-loan repayments rather than
allow these to finance additional borrowing. This undercut efforts to scale-up financing
for rural enterprise development.

50.      On the other hand, the supervision team did ultimately build sound linkages to
other donor programs and—making up for weak specifications at the design phase—did
at last develop exit strategies for the CU and land registry programs, strategies that have
been taken up by the follow-on project. It helped to bring about the substantial
achievements under the land registration component. The supervision team helped to
engineer two extensions that were essential to accommodate changes wrought by the
Rose revolution and to ensure continuity with the follow-on project. Overall, supervision
is rated moderately satisfactory.

51.     Based on sound quality at entry and mixed performance on supervision of the two
credit components, the overall rating of Bank performance is moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

52.      The government showed commitment during project preparation and coped well
despite a lack of experience. Circumstances during project implementation were more
challenging. There was a lack of continuity in personnel—there were four Ministers of
Agriculture and numerous changes in leadership at other ministries and agencies, partly
attributable to the 2004 Rose Revolution. In three respects, government actions were not
supportive of project objectives. First, it should not have absorbed credit repayments into
the budget but, in line with the spirit of the project (if not the letter of the development
credit agreement) it should have promoted the recycling of these funds in order to permit
the scaling up of lending to enterprises. Second, with respect to the credit unions the
government failed to provide the necessary regulatory oversight. Partly for reasons of
political expediency (vote getting) it acquiesced in the undisciplined expansion of these
institutions. Third, the government was partly responsible for the failure to implement a
number of the studies envisaged at appraisal, studies that had a vital role to play in
contributing to policy and institutional reform. For these reasons, government
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

53.     The rapid initial progress with the credit to enterprises component, with the
establishment of CUs and with land registration reflects well on the commitment and
capacity of the project coordinating unit (PCU). However, by 2000, the growing scale
and complexity of the CU initiative overwhelmed the unit: the staff complement
envisaged at appraisal proved inadequate. Also, the unit suffered from conflicting advice
received from the six donors working on land registration. The effectiveness of the PCU
was undermined by internal divisions and by tensions with the Ministry of Agriculture.
These issues were not resolved until late 2001 when the Project Coordination Center
                                            74


(PCC) was established by Presidential Decree No. 149 as a legal public entity and a
(smaller) Project Implementation Unit (PIU) substituted for the PCU. The PIU was
responsible for managing day-to-day business under the auspices of the PCC.

54.     The new PIU team quickly reinvigorated project implementation, but was initially
constrained by weak Bank supervision. The PIU did not become fully effective until early
2003 when a new Bank supervision team urged government to refocus its vision for the
project and followed up by reallocating project resources. From then on the PIU worked
effectively, with one exception. The PIU strove to restructure the CU program—and to
prosecute defaulting CUs—but to little avail. Adding to its problems was the failure of
government to devise a supportive legal framework for the CUs and the difficulty of
reversing the legacy of widespread mismanagement. Given the unevenness of the record,
implementing agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

55.     In view of the moderately unsatisfactory rating of project outcome, overall,
Borrower performance is also rated moderately unsatisfactory. The achievement of
project objectives was significantly thwarted by government actions during
implementation and this negative effect outweighed the more positive performance of the
implementing agency.

Lessons
56.     Lesson 1. The legal and regulatory underpinnings for successful financial
sector operations need to be spelled out in the project legal documents. In the ADP an
opportunity to scale up lending to rural enterprises was missed because the Development
Credit Agreement failed to provide for the recycling of reflows.

57.      Lesson 2. The eligibility criteria for sub-borrowers need to be clearly defined
and well enforced. In this project the Bank should have taken more steps to enforce such
criteria and to contain the reckless expansion of credit unions. It should have suspended
disbursements until order was restored.

58.     Lesson 3. The staffs of partner financial institutions need to be trained to
rigorously appraise loan proposals. The experience of ADP shows how important it is
for staff to be able to assess market prospects for the commodities to be produced and to
develop repayment schedules consistent with income streams.

59.     Lesson 4. Start-up village-based credit cooperatives should not be expected to
deliver large amounts of credit in the early stages. It takes time to build up capacity and
scale, and this should be done with appropriate safeguards, training, reporting and
oversight in place.

OBJECTIVES

The main objective of the Farm Privatization Project (FPP) is to accelerate the Government's
program for land privatization and farm restructuring of representative state and collective
farms in a systematic manner and to provide models which could serve as a basis for wider
geographical replicability. This objective would be achieved through the provision of: (i)
essential support services which are necessary to sustain privatized agriculture at the raion
[district] and farm levels. These are: land registration, farm information and advisory
services, credit services, and rehabilitation of critical irrigation and drainage infrastructure;
(ii) an enabling environment which would help build linkages between key institutions, viz.,
Ministry of Agriculture, State Land Committee, State Irrigation Committee, Agrarian Reform
Commissions and agricultural banking institutions; and (iii) community based social services
and formation of village groups in support of land privatization and farm restructuring.

PPAR SUMMARY

[Refers to both projects]

“This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews two projects that supported
Azerbaijan’s comprehensive land and agricultural reform program. Between them the
projects pioneered Azerbaijan’s reform program over its first ten years (1997-2006). The
Farm Privatization Project (FPP, 1997-2003) was a pilot operation. I t s objective was to
accelerate the Government’s program for land privatization and farm restructuring of
representative state and collective farms in a systematic manner to provide models which
could serve as a basis for wider geographic replicability and subsequent development o f a
national program. On six ex-Soviet collective farms in different regions, the land was
distributed to individual families, agricultural extension and credit services were initiated,
and irrigation was rehabilitated.

The Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP, 1999-2006) was the first phase of
a three-phase Adjustable Program Loan. ADCP sought to raise agricultural productivity by
consolidating the land reform, agricultural extension and credit elements o f FPP, covering a
wider geographic area. Bank support to this program is continuing under ADCP II and other
related projects.

The FPP’s Outcome was Satisfactory. The project was highly relevant because nothing short
of radical reform made sense. By 1995 agricultural productivity had fallen by nearly 50
                                               85


percent from the already low productivity o f Soviet era farming. Input and output markets
had collapsed, technical expertise had dissipated, credit had evaporated, irrigation was in
disrepair, and farming was still collective, with little incentive for improvement. All of FPP’s
main activities achieved their physical targets. The project’s greatest contribution was the
establishment o f models to guide the broader reform process. Agricultural extension, credit,
and water user associations were created for the first time in Azerbaijan. The land reform
achievements were remarkable. In 1997, less than two years into project implementation,
Government decided to scale up land privatization nationwide. By 200 1, two years before
FPP closed, some 95 percent o f Azerbaijan’s agricultural land had been divided up into
private family farms. Data deficiencies due to inadequate M&E preclude estimation of an
economic rate o f return, although proxy indicators suggest positive economic impact.

Risk to Development Outcome is rated Moderate. The reform is unlikely to be reversed and
the only significant risk is the sustainability o f irrigation-water user associations need to
collect more funds to finance operation and maintenance. The Bank’s performance is rated
Satisfactory. Other than the M&E arrangements, the project was well designed, and, during
preparation and supervision, the Bank provided cutting edge expertise, and motivation and
advice to guide the reform program. The Borrower’s Performance is rated Highly
Satisfactory. Government was fully committed to reform, the nation’s most senior political
leaders were effective champions, and the implementing agencies were largely effective.

The ADCP’s Outcome is rated Satisfactory. Its objective o f consolidating the reform
program and enhancing agricultural productivity was highly relevant, and the project’s
physical targets were met. As with FPP, incomplete data due to weak M&E preclude
estimation o f an economic rate of return, although alternative indicators suggest positive
economic impact. ADCP’s most significant achievements were to develop private
agricultural extension services and to establish field offices for recording land transactions.
The ADCP also pioneered farmer credit unions and informal borrower groups. However, the
credit apex agency was ineffective, partly due to the decision at project design that it should
contribute 20 percent of its own capital to investments. The agency became risk-averse and
paid little attention to developing farmer institutions. Risk to Development Outcome is rated
Significant, mainly because a problem-free model for the credit program is yet to be found.
Bank performance was Satisfactory. Quality at entry was good except for the farmer credit
management arrangements and design of M&E. During supervision, the reformist and
collegiate partnership with Government established under FPP continued. The Borrower’s
performance is also rated Satisfactory. Government continued to champion the reform
program, and, except for the credit agency and implementation o f M&E, the implementing
agencies performed well.

The two projects are significant because-compared to the other 11 Commonwealth of
Independent States countries that emerged from the 1989 break-up o f the Soviet Union-the
land reform that FPP and ADCP supported was more sweeping. All 12 CIS countries
declared Independence at the same time (1991), all shared the Soviet heritage of state
managed collective farms, and all attempted some degree of land reform from the early to
mid-1990s onwards. But there are differences between the countries in the reform paths
chosen and the progress made.

Azerbaijan adopted a broad-based land privatization agenda. Land was transferred from the
collectives to fully autonomous privately owned holdings-common practices elsewhere were
leasing of land by the state or imposition of crop production quotas. Also, land in Azerbaijan
was distributed to individual families rather than to corporate or cooperative farms-a
common practice in other CIS countries. Such multi-family enterprises have tended to differ
little from the collectives they were meant to replace. Additionally, land was fully
transferable and could be sold, rented or leased without restrictions (not the case in some CIS
countries). Land reform was also packaged with provision of agricultural extension and
credit. Another feature was that land was privatized rapidly-at a single stroke rather than
through intermediate steps (which might become permanent rather than temporary
arrangements). Finally, land was shared out evenly via transparent lottery, all persons
receiving equal areas.

Azerbaijan’s agricultural productivity has increased, although it is impossible to attribute
how much this was driven by the Bank-supported projects. Data are weak and inconsistent
between sources. ADCP project farmers increased yields by 30-40 percent in four years
(2002-06) while the yields o f non-project farmers increased by only 10-15 percent.
Nationwide data from 1994-96 (before land was privatized) to 2003-05 show a more than 50
percent increase in cereal yields, and rapid expansion of high-value horticultural crops. The
productivity of the new family farms is twice that of corporate farms. The agricultural
productivity increases in Azerbaijan closely follow the progress of land privatization
corroborating the views of farmers on the benefits from the land reforms.

The assessment of these projects suggests the following lessons of broad application:

      Azerbaijan’s largely successful land reform program has been characterized by full
       and individualized (ownership by families) privatization of land, a package approach
       combining agricultural services with land reform, and a rapid and single-step change
       rather than gradual or phased implementation. While the great diversity o f
       experience across countries indicates that there is no uniquely right land reform
       model, Azerbaijan’s approach is an option for other countries to consider.
      Equitable land distribution and access to agricultural support services helps to ensure
       that vulnerable groups such as women and the poor share in the benefits from land
       reform. By far the most important action for social inclusion was the distribution o f
       collective lands equally and transparently. For support services, Azerbaijan offers
       equal access to extension, training and credit-but more effort i s needed to encourage
       women and poor people to take advantage o f the available services.
      The reform process is critical for determining whether land reform works. In
       Azerbaijan’s case, client focus, transparency and stakeholder involvement were
       central to reform implementation, and a learning-oriented and innovative culture was
       fostered.
      Privatized service delivery reduced requirements for extra government staff.
      Land reform needs powerful champions to succeed. Exceptional commitment by
       champions in the Government and the Bank were critical to the success under the
       projects evaluated here”.

PPAR SUMMARY

[Refers to both projects]

“This Performance Assessment Report reviews two projects, one that supported the
development of Romania’s land markets, and another that supported the transition of
Romanian agriculture from a centrally planned and publically owned sector to privately
owned commercial farming: The General Cadastre and Land Registration Project (GC-
LR) and the Agricultural Support Services Project (ASSP).

GC-LR was a large scale pilot program to introduce a general cadastre for private
holdings in Romania and to systematize and create a considerably more efficient land
registration and titling system. This project was approved December 9, 1997 and closed
on June 30, 2006. Its main features are now being extended nationwide, with support
from a semi-repeater being financed with Bank assistance.

The ASSP provided support to a first phase o f reforms to Romania’s agricultural
technology system. It introduced private contracting for both applied research programs
and farmer information (extension) services to quickly augment farm-level productivity.
It was approved January 27, 2000 and closed on December 31, 2005. Its main features
also are being scaled up under a follow-on Bank-assisted loan.

The land system reform that GC-LR supported was arguably the most far-reaching
amongst former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries in Central
and Eastern Europe. Romania’s agricultural sector plays a far more significant role in its
national economy than in any other EU member state and ASSP’s support for the
agricultural technology system was critical to the sector’s development.

In Romania, during the two years following the events of 1989, lands were restituted
mainly to previous owners or their offspring, often following procedures conjured locally
without much preparation or coordination among localities. The process was a rapid one
and had several desirable features: (i) the state and collective farming system was
completely broken up and their lands were converted to privately owned holdings, (ii) the
new private holdings could in principle be inherited, sold or leased in and out, (iii) farm
land could be employed for whatever purpose the new owners chose - there were no
longer official dictates on what could be produced and what might be sold. The very
rapid process o f restitution effectively truncated the ability of rural influentials from the
ancien régime to retain control, as has been so evident in many parts of the Former Soviet
Union. But it also introduced issues which the GC-LR Project was designed to address.
Principal among these was the need to unify and harmonize the two land registration
systems then being practiced in Romania, each being legate from Romania’s pre-socialist
era. The authorities eventually decided to create a land book system, patterned on the
system adopted in Transylvania, but modified (in the project) to ease harmonization with
the inscription/transcription system being applied elsewhere in Romania. Second, a
systematic general cadastre was needed to provide a firm basis for creating land records
and verifying titles. Lastly, the entire registration and titling process needed to be
streamlined and digitalized in order to save costs and markedly reduce the unreasonably
long delays infused in pre-project titling procedures.
                                             91



The GC-LR’s outcome is rated Satisfactory against the ICR Review rating of Highly
Satisfactory. This downgrade was made taking into account the substantial lag in project
implementation, essentially until end FY04 when major (and successful) adjustments in
project organization and implementation arrangements were introduced. As the GC-LR
project got underway it became quickly evident that placement of the cadastral function
and land registration responsibilities under two separate heads was not going to work.
(This was a reflection of the Austro-Hungarian approach, which foundered on the shoals
of Romania’s two distinct land recording systems once implementation of the operation
commenced.) Nonetheless, bureaucratic inertia, in-fighting and institutional pride
prevented the consolidation o f these inter-related functions within the purview o f a
single, task focused agency. However, following the unification o f the project’s cadastre
and land registration systems under the purview of a semi-independent and self-financed
agency, implementation literally took off.

Bank performance was Satisfactory. Project design fundamentals were the subject of hot
debate within the Romanian government and with and within civil society during the
mid-1990s prior to the Bank becoming directly involved. It is to the credit o f staff, that
once recognition of the need for the project had gelled, staff was able to promote the
views of those protagonists supporting the more needed elements of project design and
project management in a sensitive and effective manner. The Borrower’s performance
over the life of the project was Moderately Satisfactory. Agency directors and deputy
ministers assigned to the project constantly changed and this made implementation
progress difficult. The Government also failed to achieve a timely resolution o f the
major implementation issue, especially the need to unify responsibilities. The excellent
progress made after 2003 once unification had been achieved helped counterbalance the
limited initial progress and i s reflected in this rating.

The ASSP’s outcome is rated Satisfactory. The project faced some implementation
challenges arising from weak and politicized leadership in the project management unit
which was ultimately overcome. The project’s risk to development outcome is Negligible
to Low. The technologies disseminated through the Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS)
component are sustainable, because these are simple, low-cost technologies, which
require exclusively inputs (seeds, plant nutrients and animal medications) and services
(artificial insemination, quality controls) available in the country. They provide high rates
of return and substantial incremental net incomes. It is therefore highly unlikely that
farmers will revert to previous practices. By contributing to the building up and
strengthening of NGOs and farmers’ associations, the Project has also enhanced the
ability of farmers to maintain and further promote the disseminated technologies, as this
will enable increased exchanges of experience and accelerate spillovers. Both Bank and
Borrower performance was Satisfactory. Despite initial teething problems, the
Government was committed to the project, and was proactive in the preparation process.

Building on the completion report, the assessment of these projects suggests the
following broad lessons:
                                           92


For the GC-LR Project:
    Borrower commitment and ownership can turn even the most difficult of projects
        around. Sometimes this commitment can come from political events which have
        nothing directly to do with the project.
    A key success factor for a viable land administration system is the establishment
        of a workable institutional structure. The experience of Romania shows that the
        single agency model and the creation of a semi-autonomous self finance agency
        appears to work best and this could have wider applicability in the Central and
        East European context.
    The building of public confidence in the system and ensuring the public has
        access to the professional support services (notaries, real estate agents) is
        necessary not only for successful implementation, but for truly achieving the
        objective of secure property markets.
    Projects may place too high expectations on automation and underestimate the
        complexity o f large scale information technology system development.
    Sustainability needs to be built into project design; and this is largely about
        human capacity.

For the ASSP Project:
    Farmers and rural business owners will respond enthusiastically to innovative
        technologies corresponding to their needs. There has to be consultation and a
        demand driven element in any serious research and extension endeavor”.

OBJECTIVES


   (a) Develop procedures and institutional mechanisms at the state level and in selected
       regions to ensure fair, secure and equitable transfer of land and other farm assets
       to private individuals or groups;
   (b) Test and implement these procedures in ten selected former state and collective
       farms in order to provide representative models which could serve as a basis for
       wider geographical replicability; and
   (c) Create sustainable private family farming units and provide them with the
       enabling conditions to operate independently in a market economy.

   A Supplemental Credit of US$3.0 million was approved by the Board in February
   2001. This supported the three objectives above and added a fourth:

   (d) Mitigate the effects of the severe 2000 drought by providing emergency
       agricultural inputs to the families affected by the drought.

PPAR SUMMARY

“Under the Soviet Union, Tajikistan’s collective and state farms received their farming
inputs from Moscow and delivered cotton in return. After independence in 1991, the flow
of inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, farm machinery, and spare parts, as well as wheat and
energy stopped. A five-year civil war ensued between 1992 and 1997, during which time
irrigation systems became dilapidated, and many specialists knowledgeable about
operating irrigation pumps left the country. By the time o f the 1997 peace agreement, the
agricultural sector was in poor condition, with irrigation systems in disrepair. During the
appraisal process the project evolved away from one that would finance the rehabilitation
of irrigation systems, toward a focus on restructuring the large state and collective farms
                                             95


in which they operated. Farms would only be profitable when farmers made the key
investment and farming decisions, and increasing farm profitability was expected to
allow the systems’ users to finance infrastructure maintenance.

The Farm Privatization Support Project (FPSP) was approved in June 1999 with the
objectives to (i) develop procedures and institutional mechanisms at the state level and
selected regions to ensure fair, secure and equitable transfer of land and other farm assets
to private individuals or groups; (ii) test and implement these procedures in ten selected
former state and collective farms in order to provide representative models which could
serve as a basis for wider geographical replicability; and (iii) create sustainable private
family farming units and provide them with the enabling conditions to operate
independently in a market economy. In 2001, a Supplemental Credit in the amount of
US$3.0 million was approved with the objective to (iv) mitigate the effects of a severe
2000 drought by providing emergency agricultural inputs to the families affected by the
drought.

Overall this PPAR rates project outcome as moderately satisfactory. The project was
relevant to what the 2005 CAS described as the Government’s priorities in the
agricultural sector. With respect to the drought intervention, distributing genetically
improved seed for wheat, fertilizer, and other chemical inputs has led to an impressive
increase in wheat production over the last seven years. The project effectively
restructured ten pilot farms into 5,782 individual and family farms. The procedures used
in this farm restructuring experience are being replicated in a follow-on project, which
involves 300 additional farms.

However, project design was overly ambitious and not tailored enough to the
circumstances o f a country that was just emerging from five years of civil war. In the
cotton-growing areas of Tajikistan, quotas for cotton and wheat production are enforced.
Local governments have the authority to take land away from farmers who do not achieve
their cotton production quotas, even if farmers could make more money with other crops.
Unfortunately, about 80 percent o f the project’s efforts took place in cotton quota areas.
While the project offered farmers a package o f support to serve as an incentive for
restructuring, the PPAR concludes that the package provided necessary but not sufficient
enabling conditions. The package included rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure, the
establishment of water users associations for their maintenance, a one-time grant for farm
inputs, and access to credit, and training. While in some farms restructuring resulted in
increased farm profitability, in others, restructuring met with significant local resistance.
Local governments have constrained the farmers’ right to choose their own crops and
credit institutions have preferred other borrowers over farmers. Many farms have been
unable to avail themselves o f even rental tractors and other agricultural machinery. Some
associations established to maintain irrigation systems lack operating funds to keep the
rehabilitated structures operating and farmers’ groups have been organized in a way that
creates disincentives to working together.

Risk to development outcome is rated as substantial. Tajikistan is still confronting
fundamental legal, cultural, and social barriers to farm restructuring. Bank performance is
rated moderately satisfactory because of an overly ambitious project design and in spite
of highly dedicated supervision. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory because of
                                           96


the strong support from the highest levels of government and a dedicated and creative
Project Implementation Unit team.

Among the lessons suggested by the project experience are the following:

      Land tenure security and farmers’ freedom to make their own management
       decisions are vital for successful farm privatization. In the case of Tajikistan,
       strong support from the highest levels o f government was not enough to
       restructure and privatize state and collective farms throughout the country. In
       cotton-growing areas, local governments were more interested in profiting from
       cotton production than sharing benefits with newly independent farmers.
      International experience may enrich project design, but only when local
       conditions are fully taken into account. In the case of Tajikistan, project design
       was overly ambitious and not tailored enough to the local circumstances,
       including five years of civil war and the remaining aspects of a command
       economy.
      Care must be taken to identify all the factors constraining the achievement o f
       project objectives, and then something needs to be done about each one of them.
       While some of the barriers to farm restructuring (such as improving access to
       water and credit), were dealt with at appraisal, the lack of farm machinery was not
       recognized as in issue, even though it was a high priority for farmers.
      Donor coordination can assist with the propagation o f major reforms. In
       Tajikistan, it took the Bank until 2003 to realize that if donors would speak with
       one voice to the government on land reform, it might create conditions more
       favorable for the project restructured farms”.
