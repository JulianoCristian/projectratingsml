context, the\n            Agricultural Support Services Project will promote public,\n            and private services, to support the development of\n            research, and extension services for private farmers.\n            Agricultural productivity, and sustainability will be\n            increased, providing needed technology, information, and\n            training for private farmers, and agro-processors. The two\n            main components: 1) applied research, and extension, will\n            support agricultural research, and extension on priority\n            problems, by means of a Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS). It\n            will ensure a close association between research\n            scientist/extension specialists, and the needs of newly\n            emerged private farmers, particularly in the formulation,\n            and evaluation of research, and extension proposals. CGS\n            will extend the range of research and extension grant\n            participants, to include universities, NGOs, private\n            industry, and extension services. Funding will be provided\n            to meet priority needs, marketing, and efficient input, and\n            low cost options, for production, and processing.\n            Proposals' evaluation criteria will include farm\n            utility, experience, and transfer of technology, as well as\n            environmental impacts; 2) institution building, will\n            administer the CGS, and implement a rapid impact program to\n            deliver extension messages, and conduct applied research.\n            Technical assistance, and training will be delivered for\n            capacity building, and future restructuring services."}, "docdt": "1999-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
