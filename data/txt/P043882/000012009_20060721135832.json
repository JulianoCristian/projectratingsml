The project has demonstrated the high response from\n            farmers to innovative technologies corresponding to their\n            needs. It has also demonstrated the high response from\n            farmers associations and Research Institutes to partnership\n            opportunities, and the beneficial impact of such\n            partnerships on efficiency and client relevance of\n            agricultural research and extension. It has shown that a\n            strong commitment from Government is a crucial success\n            factor for a reform of the agricultural research and\n            extension system. It has also confirmed that, in order to\n            become fully responsive to the demand for new technologies,\n            the agricultural research and extension system needs\n            institutional strengthening, and an in-depth restructuring.\n            As regards management of agricultural research and extension\n            projects, it has shown that a Project Management Unit (PMU)\n            contributes to the success of such projects in Romania,\n            provided it is deeply integrated within the Ministry as the\n            implementing agency. The PMU facilitated a close monitoring\n            of activities, linkages with the private sector, and an\n            inter-ministerial approach. Finally, the project has further\n            confirmed the importance of a well designed monitoring and\n            evaluation system, which should be set up at an early\n            project stage."}, "docdt": "2006-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
