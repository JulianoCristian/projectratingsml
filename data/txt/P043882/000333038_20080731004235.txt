About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bankswork is producingthe
expectedresults,and second,to helpdevelop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As partof this work, IEGWBannuallyassessesabout25 percentof
the Bank's lendingoperationsthroughfield work. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those
that are innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments;and those that are likely to generate
importantlessons.
       To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWBstaff examine project files and other
documents,interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountry to discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-country stakeholders,and interview Bankstaff and other donor agency staff both at headquartersand
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subjectto internalIEGWB peer review, Panel review, and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe commentsas
relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors.After an assessmentreport has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
       IEGWB's use of multipleevaluationmethodsoffers both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, projectdesign, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto
arrive at their project ratings. Followingis the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additionalinformationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved,or are expectedto
be achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions:relevance,efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevanceof objectivesand relevance of design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistentwith the country's current developmentprioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoral assistancestrategies and corporategoals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers, OperationalPolicies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved,taking into account their relative importance.Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved,or is expected to achieve, a return higherthan the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives.The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained(or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome:High
Significant,Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which servicesprovided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supportedeffective implementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transition arrangementsfor regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of developmentoutcomes. The rating has two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenants and
agreements,toward the achievementof development outcomes.The rating has two dimensions:government
performanceand implementingagency(ies) performance.Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory,Satisfactory,Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly
unsatisfactory.

This is a ProjectPerformance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the General Cadastre and Land
RegistrationProject and the Agricultural Support Services Project inRomania. The General
Cadastreand LandRegistrationProject (Loan 4258) for US$25.5 million equivalent was
approved on December 9, 1997. The loan closed on June 30,2006,30 months behindschedule.
At project closure US$24.5 millionor 96 percent ofthe original loanhadbeendisbursed. An
Implementation CompletionReport was submitted on December 19,2006. The Agricultural
Support Services Project (Loan 4533) for US$ 11.O million equivalent was approved on January
27,2000. The project closed on December 31,2005, 12 months behind schedule. At project
closure US$ 10.8 million or 98 percent o fthe original loan had beendisbursed. An
Implementation Completion Report was submitted June 23,2006.

This report was preparedby the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)basedonthe
Implementation CompletionReports, Staff Appraisal Reports, LoanAgreements, as well as a
review of Bank files. An IEGmissionwas inRomaniainMarch2008 and held interviews with a
number of stakeholders including representatives of Government and the implementingagencies,
Parliamentarians, donor agencies and civil society organizations inRomania, agribusiness
representatives and private contractors engagedby the project authorities, and local staff and
beneficiaries. The cooperation and assistance of all stakeholders and government officials is
gratefully acknowledged.

Following standardIEGprocedures, a copy of the draft PPARwas sent to government officials
and agencies for their review and comments. No comments were received.


Summary

This Performance Assessment Report reviews two projects one that supported the
development o f Romania's landmarkets and another that supported the transition o f
Romanian agriculture from a centrally plannedand publically owned sector to privately
owned commercial farming: The General Cadastre and LandRegistration Project (GC-
LR) and the Agricultural SupportServices Project (ASSP).

The GC-LR was a large scale pilot program to introduce a general cadastre for private
holdings inRomania and to systematize and create a considerably more efficient land
registration and titling system. This project was approved December 9, 1997 and closed
on June 30,2006. Its main features are now being extended nationwide, with support
from a semi-repeater being financed with Bank assistance.

The ASSP provided support to a first phase o f reforms to Romania's agricultural
technology system. It introduced private contracting for both applied research programs
andfarmer information (extension) services to quickly augment farm-level productivity.
Itwas approvedJanuary 27,2000 and closed on December 31,2005. Its mainfeatures
also are being scaled up under a follow-on Bank-assisted loan.

The land system reform that GC-LR supported was arguably the most far-reaching
amongst former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) countries in Central
and Eastern Europe. Romania's agricultural sector plays a far more significant role inits
national economy than inany other EUmember state and ASSP's support for the
agricultural technology system was critical to the sector's development.

InRomania, duringthe two years followingthe events of 1989,lands were restituted
mainly to previous owners or their offspring, often following procedures conjured locally
without much preparation or coordination among localities. The process was a rapid one
and had several desirable features: (i)the state and collective farming systemwas
completely broken up and their lands were convertedto privately owned holdings, (ii)       the
new private holdings could inprinciple be inherited, sold or leased inand out, (iii)   farm
land could be employed for whatever purpose the new owners chose -there were no
longer official dictates on what could be produced and what might be sold.

The very rapidprocess o frestitutioneffectively truncatedthe ability o frural influentials
from the ancien regime to retain control, as has beenso evident inmany parts o f the
Former Soviet Union. But it also introduced issues which the GC-LR Project was
designedto address. Principal among these was the need to unify andharmonize the two
land registrationsystems then beingpracticed inRomania, each being legate from
Romania's pre-socialist era. The authorities eventually decidedto create a land book
system, patterned on the systemadopted inTransylvania, but modified (inthe project) to
ease harmonization with the inscriptiodtranscription system beingapplied elsewhere in
Romania. Second, a systematic general cadastre was needed to provide a firm basis for
creating landrecords and verifying titles. Lastly, the entire registration and titling process

needed to be streamlined and digitalized inorder to save costs and markedly reduce the
unreasonably long delays infusedinpre-project titling procedures.

The GC-LR's outcome i s rated Satisfactory against the ICR Reviewrating o f Highly
Satisfactory. This downgrade was made taking into account the substantial lag inproject
implementation, essentially untilend FY04 when major (andsuccessful) adjustments in
project organization and implementation arrangements were introduced. As the GC-LR
project got underway it became quickly evident that placement o f the cadastral function
and land registration responsibilities under two separate heads was not going to work.
(Thiswas a reflectionofthe Austro-Hungarian approach, which foundered on the shoals
o f Romania's two distinct land recording systems once implementation o f the operation
commenced.) Nonetheless, bureaucratic inertia, in-fightingand institutional pride
preventedthe consolidation o fthese inter-related functions withinthe purviewo f a
single, task focused agency. However, following the unification o fthe project's cadastre
and landregistration systems underthe purviewo f a semi-independent and self-financed
agency, implementation literally took off.

Bank performance was Satisfactory. Project design fundamentals were the subject of hot
debate within the Romanian government and with and withincivil society during the
mid-1990sprior to the Bank becoming directly involved. Itis to the credit o f staff, that
once recognition o f the need for the project had gelled, staff was able to promote the
views o fthose protagonists supporting the more needed elements o fproject designand
project management ina sensitive and effective manner.

The Borrower's performance over the life o fthe project was Moderately Satisfactory.
Agency directors and deputy ministers assigned to the project constantly changed and this
made implementationprogress difficult. The Government also failed to achieve a timely
resolution o f the major implementation issue, especially the need to unify responsibilities.
The excellent progress made after 2003 once unification hadbeenachieved helped
counterbalance the limited initial progress and i s reflected inthis rating.

The ASSP's outcome is rated Satisfactory. The project faced some implementation
challenges arising from weak and politicized leadership inthe project management unit
which was ultimately overcome. The project's risk to development outcome i s Negligible
to Low. The technologies disseminated through the Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS)
component are sustainable, because these are simple, low-cost technologies, which
requireexclusively inputs (seeds, plant nutrientsand animal medications) and services
(artificial insemination, quality controls) available inthe country. They provide highrates
o f returnand substantial incremental net incomes. It i s therefore highly unlikely that
farmers will revert to previous practices. By contributing to the buildingup and
strengthening ofNGOs and farmers' associations, the Project has also enhanced the
ability o f farmers to maintain and further promote the disseminated technologies, as this
will enable increased exchanges of experience and accelerate spillovers.
BothBankand Borrower performancewas Satisfactory. Despite initial teething
problems, the Government was committed to the project, and was proactive inthe
preparationprocess.

Buildingonthe completion report, the assessment o fthese projects suggests the
following broad lessons:

For the GC-LR Project
       Borrower commitment and ownership can turn even the most difficult o fprojects
       around. Sometimes this commitment can come from political events which have
       nothing directly to do with the project.
       A key success factor for a viable land administration system is the establishment
       o f a workable institutional structure. The experience o f Romania shows that the
       single agency model and the creation o f a semi-autonomous self finance agency
       appears to work best and this could have wider applicability inthe Central and
       East Europeancontext.
    0  The building of public confidence inthe system and ensuringthe public has
       access to the professional support services (notaries, real estate agents) i s
       necessary not only for successful implementation, but for truly achieving the
       objective o f secure property markets.
    0  Projects may place too highexpectations on automation and underestimate the
       complexity o f large scale information technology system development.
       Sustainability needs to be built into project design; and this is largely about
       human capacity.

For the ASSP Project:
    0  Farmers and rural businessowners will respond enthusiastically to innovative
       technologies corresponding to their needs. There has to be consultation and a
       demanddriven element inany serious research and extension endeavor.

1.BackgroundandContext


OVERVIEW
1.1     Romania i s amiddleincome country that endureda wrenching (but
inevitable) decline inincomes at the onset o f its transition in 1989from a
centrally plannedeconomy to a fully functioning market economy. Through most
of the 1 9 9 0 GDP
               ~ ~ stagnated following an initial decline but beganto recover in
the late 1990's after Romania beganits European Union(EU) accessionprocess
under Commission tutelage. Since the turnofthe century, the country's real GDP
growth has beenvery encouraging, between4-5 percent p.a. in2000-2005, and
fully 7.8 percent in2006. According to the most recentpoverty assessment, the
share of the population living beneaththe poverty line has fallen markedly from
41 percent inthe late 1990sto about 12percent in2005. .

1.2      Agriculture activities inthe country remain animportant source o f rural
household income, employing 33 percent o fthe country's labor force infull- and
seasonalfarm operations. Followingthe collapse of communism, Romania
institutedone of the most rapid and ambitious landreformprograms among the
transitioning countries inEurope andthe Former Soviet Union. Grounded inland
restitution to former owners, the landprivatizationprogram, effectively destroyed
the state and collective farm system almost overnight, and impaled the sources of
rural politicalpower previously availed by socialist farm managersandthe rural
cadre. The effects on production and productivity were profoundlynegative,
however, as a very large number of small and fragmented farms replaced the far
larger industrial farming units o fthe Ceaucescuera. State-ownedmarketing and
inputsdistribution channels dissolvedas well. The outcome inthe 1990swas a
reversion to semi-subsistence farming for muchof the decade, and a very sluggish
recovery ofproduction andproductivity. Inmore recent years, with some land
consolidation under lease-holding, with investments inrural infrastructure, the
appearanceofprivate marketing channels, openings for exports anda strong
recovery inconsumer incomes, agricultural has experiencedmoderate growth -
3.5 percent in2006. Meanwhilethe share o f agriculture in GPD has declined
from about 23 percent in 1990to 10.5 percent in2007.

THEWORLD BANK INROMANIA
1.3     The World Bankresumed lending in 1991during the beginning o f
Romania's transition to amarketeconomy. BetweenFY91 and FY06, the Bank
approved atotal of 50 IBRDfinanced operations with commitments o f US$ 5.0
billion, about $300 million a year. Lendingvolumes were higher inthe 1990sat
$335 million ayear, comparedto FY00-05 at $288 millionper year. Adjustment
operations accountedfor about 40 percent o ftotal lending since 1991. The Bank's
financial assistanceaccountedfor about 30 percent of all net multilateral
assistanceover the 1992-2004 period, and 16percent of all net inflows, public
and private. At end-2004, debt to IBRDrepresentedabout 15 percent o f all

                                          2


 external debt outstanding. Table 1provides an indicationo fthe effectiveness of
 Banklendingbasedonthe 2005 Country Assistance Evaluation bythe
 IndependentEvaluation Group (thenthe Operations Evaluation Department
 (OED)). Approval and implementation of the Agricultural Support Services and
 the General Cadastre and LandRegistration Project (the two projects being
 assessed inthis report) took place withinthe fiamework of three sequential
 Country Assistance Programs, as recorded inCAS documents issued in 1997,
 2001and (for the General Cadastre& LandRegistration Project) in2006 (Annex
 A for details onthe development andCAS context).

 1.4     The two operations were designedandimplementedinarapidly changing
 economic environment. The chaos anduncertainty ofthe 1990sfollowing the
 collapse of Communism inRomania gradually gave way towards the latter half of
 the decade to the new structure of market mediated economic activity, guided by
 requisites for accessionto the EUper the Community's acquis communitaire. In
 the presentcentury, Romania's agricultural sector benefitedduring the accession
 process from a sizable and growing inflow o f cohesion and structural funds from
 the EU, which are now being substantially augmented by disbursementsunder the
 two pillarsof the common Agricultural Policy (CAP) following Romania's formal
 acceptance as anEUmember state inJanuary 2007.

 THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR CONTEXT
 1.5      Inthe secondhalfofthe 1990s,whendesignsfor the two projects being
 reviewedwere finalized, agriculture remained amajor contributor to the
 Romanian economy. The sector contributed 20 percent of GDP and provided
 about 35 percent of total employment inthe country. Romania had and still has
 about 14.8 million ha of good agricultural land.Despite a richnatural resource
 base, however, Romania's agricultural production hadbeen performingwell
 beneathits potential. Average yields of major crops likewheat, barley, and sugar
 beets had declinedsubstantially following the break-up of Romania's collective
 farms in 1989 and 1990. Since 1990, productivity of livestock inRomania also
 fell off dramatically. Exacerbatedby falling demand as household incomes fell in
 the wake of de-collectivization, these declines inagriculture typically ensued
 from:

                                          3


        the sudden(though not unexpected) collapse ofthe farm inputs supply
        system,
        a breakup of distribution channelspreviously operatedunder state
        procurement orders,
        a growing vacuum inthe provisionof production andmarketing credits as
        the capitalization of state banking channels collapsed,
        the replacement of large state-owned industrial farming operations with an
        extraordinarily large numberof smallholders cultivating very small,
        fragmented farmsteads, often as semi-subsistenceoperations, and
        an inability to adapt andrapidly expand the agricultural technology system
        to serve Romania's muchlarger post-land reform clientele.

1.6     By the mid-1990s, little progresshadbeenmade to reduce land
fragmentation inthe agricultural areas andcreate functioning landmarkets.
Similarly, attemptsto create state managedresearchandextension advisory
systemswithinthe Ministryof Agriculture hadmerely resulted inan enlarged
public payroll with little demonstrableeffect on yields and incomes at the farm
level.

1.7     Recognition that non-traditional remedial action would be requiredhad
gained adherents both ingovernment andthroughout civil society inrural areas,
especially among commercial farmers andnascent agribusiness enterprises who
desiredbotha more stable andbusinessfriendly environment and structural
changes that would allow them to expandoperations.

1.8     Bankassistancewas requestedto helpthe bythenfairly influentialreform
element ingovernment to strengthen and restructure programs intendedto
improve agricultural performance and incomes. Beginning in 1997, the Bank
respondedwith three operations focused on the agricultural sector, plusthematic
support for privatization, PSD, financial sector reformand strengthening of
Romania's social safety net. The agricultural operations included anAgriculture
Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) designedto rectify and promote the
liberalization of incentives programs for agriculturalists, while supporting
associatedimprovements inthe legal and regulatory environment, andthe two
projects being assessed inthis report:

        the General Cadastre and LandRegistration (GC-LR) Project, designedto
        record and secure rights inorder to foster development of rural andurban
        landmarkets; and
        the Agriculture Support Services(ASSP) Project, which was designedto
        rapidly augmentthe diffusion of available agricultural technologies andto
        fund contracts for adaptive research projects, contestedby demonstrable
        needanddemand.

2. Project Objectives, Designand Implementation


PROJECTOBJECTIVESANDDESIGN

General Cadastre and Land Registration (GC-LR) Project
2.1     The GC-LR project design supportedthe objectives ofthe 1997CAS, by
fostering the creation of an efficient system for securing landtitles and a cost-
effective mechanism for landtransactions. By facilitatinglandtransactions, the
project sought to help consolidate economically non-viable agriculture farm units
andfacilitate the sustainable, efficientuse of land, other natural resourcesand
infrastructure.

2.2     Theproject specifically aimedto: (a) Establish an efficient system for
securing landtitles of real estate owners which can be expandednationwide; (b)
Create a general cadastre systemwhich provides clear and current definition of
real estate parcels which form the basis for real estate registration; and (c) Set up
a simple, safe and cost effective procedure for landtransactions.

2.3     To support the development objectives, financing and advisory assistance
was provided inthe project through its three components:

Development of the General Cadastre:
        to include support for aerial photography, base map development,
        cadastral surveys anda landinformation system, and
        to strengthen the National Office for Cadastre, Geodesy and Cartography
         (ONCGC) andthe local cadastre offices (OJCGCs).

Establishment of LandBook System:
        to operationalize 76 landbook offices in 18judets insuitably equipped
         offices with an automatedlandbook system;
        train staff inthe newlandbook system; and
        provide institutional support for the local landbook offices.

General Institutional Strengthening:
        via the provisionof technical assistanceto guide the implementationtrials
         andto enhancethe planning andmanagementcapacity ofthe project
        agencies;
        informationsystem design and development for the cadastre and land
        book; and assistanceto carry out cost recovery studies.

2.4     The first two componentswould support the development ofthe key
institutionsinvolved inlandadministration inRomania the cadastreandthe land
                                                          -
book offices. The third component would bring together the two parts o fthe
systemwith technical assistanceand development ofthe IT system.

                                           5


2.5      The Project was appraised inJuly 1997 and approved December 9, 1997.
A loaninthe amount of US$25.5 million equivalent was declared effective May
20, 1998, and closed June 30,2006 following a 2% year extension of the closing
date. The target populationincludedcurrent and future real estate owners, private
investors inagriculture, housing and industry, commercial banksand other users
of landownership information. The project was estimatedto cover about 3
million hectareso frural landand 75,000 hectares ofurbanland.

AgriculturalSupport ServicesProject (ASSP)
2.6      The ASSP hadtwo development objectives: (a) to boost agricultural
productivity, sustainability and incomes by providing immediately needed
technology, information andtraining for private farmers and agro-processors, and
(b) to improve efficiency, cost effectiveness and client relevance inthe
managementof researchand extension.

2.7      The project's components included the financing of a Competitive Grant
Scheme (CGS) that would be responsive to the needs of farmers and agro-
processors; test a number o f locally formulated projects to design, select, fund and
deliver extension programs; andbuildcapacity to create farmer confidence in
researchand extension systems, learnfrom pilot experiences and feed experience
gained into the reformprocess. The CGS was not intendedto fully absorb core
fundingfor the researchcomplex. However, it would (should have, anddid)
require areallocation of limitedbudgetary funds to relevantandeffective
institutions.

2.8      A secondproject component fosteredthe design and creation ofmore
effective extension deliveryto private farmers andagro-processors. The curricula
encompassedfarm management skills, organization and mobilizationo f small
farmers for input supply, mechanization and marketing,and low or reduced cost
options for small farmers incrop and animal production and on-farm processing.
The extension component also featured the testing andmonitoringmethods of
extension newto Romania. The delivery mechanismstestedwould include: (i)
farmer to farmer extension; (ii) private-public partnerships; and (iii) media.
                                                                       mass

2.9      The project's institution buildingcomponent supported The National
Agency for Agricultural Consulting (ANCA) -a semi-autonomous agency within
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) -incarrying out
innovative programs, including a rapid impact extension program using"off-the-
shelf' results of available research, the creation of a ruralradio program, andthe
preparation anddistributiono f farm managementhandbooks. A final component
featured support for developing anaction planand capacity to reformthe
Romanian Agricultural Knowledge and InformationSystem (AKIS), inthe form
oftechnical assistance andtraining.

2.10     The project was appraised inOctober 1999 andapproved on January 27,
2000. A loan inthe amount o f US$l1.O million equivalent was declared effective

                                          6

on August 24,2000. The Project closed on December 31,2005 following a one
year extension ofthe original closing date.

IMPLEMENTATION
2.11 During the implementation period, neither the development objectives nor
the project componentshadto be adjustedfor either ofthe two projects under
review. However the structure for implementing the GC-LR project was adjusted
in2004, nearto the originalclosing date, while closing ofthe ASSP hadto be
extendedby a year.

General Cadastreand Land RegistrationProject
2.12    The most significant change during the implementation ofthe GC-LR
project was inthe institutional structure. At the start of the project there were two
implementing agencies -the Ministryof Justice through the landbook courts and
the separate National Office for Cadastre, GeodesyandCartography. This dual
agency landadministration system, common inCentral and Eastern Europe
especially inthe former territories of the Austro- Hungarian Empire, effectively
split the project intwo.

2.13    In2004, the government ofRomaniarecognizedthe inherent difficulties
inthis dual landadministration systemand agreedwiththe Bank expertsthat a
single landadministration agency    - inline with international good practice - was
the best way forward. The Bankteam hadmade severalpresentationsto
government officials to explain the rational for this change. The newNational
Agency for Cadastreand Real Estate Publicity (ANCPI) was officially established
by government decree inMay 2004 andbeganoperating inJanuary 2005. While
this changedidnot affect the scope ofthe project or numberofcomponents, itdid
requiresignificant change inthe project management arrangements including
                                                                        -
going from two Project ManagementUnits(PMU) to one. Amendments to the
loanagreementwere necessaryto makethese changes inproject management
arrangementsandto modify the very inflexible Schedule 1to allow for the one
agency to make disbursementsfor all components.

2.14    Itshouldbenotedthat this change represented a statesmanlikemove by
the MOJto forego significant financial interest (from the registration fees), which
has been anobstacle inother countries inthe regionto such areform. The MOJ
also realized that staff, space and other valuable court resourceswere being used
for essentially uncontested, routine real estate transactions andhindering the real
business of the courts andjudiciary. The importance of this achievement for the
project and for Romania cannotbe overstated.

2.15    The originalproject closing date was December 31,2003. The loanwas
extendedinthe third quarter of 2003, for another 18months untilJune 30,2005.
The extension was agreedinrecognition of the difficult start-up periodo fthe
project and frequent changes inmanagementof the implementing agencies

                                           7


resultingina two-year delay inimplementation. At the time o fthe request for
closing date extension, the project was moving forward with several important
activities including systematic cadastre services intwojudets andthe joint
information system development. A further 12month extension o fthe closing
date was agreed inlate 2004 as part o fthe loan agreement amendments. This final
extension was granted due to the merger and establishment o f the new unified
agency and the opportunity this afforded to complete the institutional reforms
under the project.

2.16    The patterno f disbursements for the GC-LR Project very muchreflects
the slow pace o f implementationbefore 2004, and the pronounced acceleration
that developed after responsibilities had been combined andtransferred to the
ANCPI (Figure 1 and Table 2). By end FY03,4 years after the project was
declared effective, only 28.2 percent o f the Bank's funds had been disbursed. But
by end FY06,the project's closing date, the remaining 71.8 percent hadbeen
disbursed.

TheAgricultural Support ServicesProject
2.17     The ASSP project initially suffered from weak management inthe PMU
and resistance from bureaucratic interests withinthe Ministryo f Agriculture.
However, in2001 a reformist State Secretary o f Agriculture was appointed whose
tenure lasted an unprecedented 4 years. The present dynamic Director o f the PMU
was appointed inMarch 2002 and obstruction to the P M U andproject activities
from within MARD was over-ridden. Inturn, the CGS literally took off, andthe
very large majority o f the sub-projects it supported (through provision o f
technical advisory services only) are still inoperation today.

2.18     The provision o f rapid impact advisory services, through A N C A proved
far less successful, largely becausebudgetaryresponsibilitiesfor financing the
operations o f ANCA's regional offices were transferred from MARDto the
Ministryofthe Interior andAdministration throughout most ofthe project's
implementationperiod. This reassignment placed defacto control over the local
offices withinthe purview of municipal mayors andjudet level officials, thereby
politicizing their operations andvitiating any control over their activities that
mighthave beendesired byANCA andthe MARD. Itwas only towards the end
o f the implementation period that budgetingresponsibility was returned to
MARD. Theresponse (interms ofservingproject objectives) was both
immediate and strong. But on the ANCA side o f the operation, it was a bit late to
have muchimpact.

2.19     A minor reallocationo f funds took place inthe ASSP's institutional
support component at the request o f MARD, inorder to extend, because o f its
success, the Young Scientists Program (YSP), and respond to a specific request o f

the Ministryfor technical assistance onpolicy-makingand sector agricultural
policies.

2.20    The ASSP was far less seriously handicappedat project start-upthan the
GC-LR project. Followingthe assignmentof the new PMU director,
implementation anddisbursements from the Bank loanproceededaccording to the
formally revised disbursementplan(Figure 2 and Table 2).

3. Analysis


RELEVANCE
3.1     Eachproject, through its design(s), componentsandmodalities, supported
the development objectives stipulated inthe project documentation. Inturn, their
development objectives were governedby and closely linked to applicable
elements of the Bank's 1997 country strategy for Romania, and - while under
implementation -to the two subsequent CASs. Inother words, the objectives of
the GC-LR andASSP projects were consistentwith the CASs, which had
identifiedagriculture as apriority area onthe grounds of goodprospects for a
supply response, andwith Government policy for the agricultural sector, which
aimed at transforming small and fragmented farmsteads into profitablefarm
enterprises.


General Cadastreand Land RegistrationProject

Relevance of Objectives
3.2      The project objectives were highly relevant to conditions inRomania.
Romaniabeganamajor land restitution andprivatizationprogram inthe early

                                          10


1990s.By July 1997, almost 70 percent ofthe 4.3 million applicants who applied
underLaw 18/1991 for restitution of landandproperty inthe former collective
farms had been issued property titles (titluri deproprietute) confirming the
transfer of landinto private ownership. Nearly all residential apartments had also
been privatized. However, as there was no functional national landadministration
systeminplace, the records ofreal estate ownership were disorganized and
fragmented, andpartly as a result, there was little landmarket development in
either urbanor rural areas. Inthe Bank'sprogram to assist Romania inimproving
the macroeconomic fiarnework, supportingprivate sector development, and
creating a better policy environment, one of the key elements was to support the
development of landmarkets and establishment o f secure landregistration and
titling mechanisms.

3.3     The GC-LR project was centrally focused on Romania's ongoing
privatizationefforts, especially inthe realm of real estate transactions andthe
privatizationof state enterprises. By facilitating landtransactions, the project
aimed to consolidate economically non-viable farming units andpromote the
sustainable, efficient use of land, other natural resources and infrastructure. In
doing so, the project was intendedto encourageprivate sector development in
rural areas, andequally important, byproviding opportunities for local private
companies inmapping, surveying, IT/data entry and processing and the
involvement o fprofessional notaries.


Relevance of Design
3.4     Relevance o f design was substantial. Two systems of landregistration
were operating inRomania --a Civil Code system ofinscriptionandtranscription
which is a deeds registration systemthat was adaptedfrom the Frenchproperty
code, andthe landbook or GrundBuch system, inherited from the Austo-
HungarianEmpire     - a titleregistration system. Both systems fell into disuse
during the communist regime as most of the landwas collectivized and no records
of parcels and of ownership were maintained. Although boththe systems have
beenrevived, the lack of uniformitybetweenthe two, and inadequate and
outdated cadastralmaps have constrainedproperty registration. The LawNo. 7 of
1996for General CadastreandReal Estate Publicity recognized the advantages of
the landbook system, whichregistersproperties rather thanindividual
transactions, and providedthe legal fiamework to establish a uniform systemto
be introduced progressively throughout the country.

3.5     Government was keento introduce the uniform parcel-basedland
registration systeminas many parts of the country as possible. Sevenof
Romania's 42judets (counties) were selectedinthe project to receive the initial
tranche of project-type benefits.

3.6     The two mainapproachesto landmapping andregistration inthe project
were the method of registration basedon systematic generalcadastre, athorough,
cost-effective and systematic approachforeseen inLaw 7 of 1996, but also atime

                                          11


consuming approach, and the demand responsive but more costly sporadic
cadastre and registration, to be introduced wherever LandBook Offices hadbeen
established under the project. The cost effectiveness andpublic acceptance o f
each method was to be monitored andthe proportions o f each adjusted
accordingly.

3.7     Under Law 18 o f 1991,agricultural land, which had been collectivized in
uneconomically large units, has beenredistributed to the previous owners and
their heirs into uneconomically small and fragmentedparcels. About one third o f
the new landowners were living intowns and had little interest infarming
themselves. The project was intended to rely eventually uponthe operation o f the
market to consolidate landinto economic units, to move underutilized assets into
more intensive use, andto provide an exit route for owners who want to sell or
lease, else proveduncompetitive as farmers or businessmen.

3.8     When the project was being formulated, a major issue was whether to rely
upon public agencies or private contractors for execution o fmapping, cadastral
survey and other related work. As the public sector could not matchthe salaries
andbenefits that e.g. surveyors and notaries could earn inprivate practice, itwas
agreed that the project should depend heavily on the private sector for mapping
and data entry work, that licensed surveyors would execute the cadastral surveys
andthat private notaries (who are boardcertified professionallawyers) would be
engaged to handle conveyancing. As a side benefit, it was expected that engaging
private professionals would allow the ONCGC andMOJto concentrate on
strategic issues, quality control, standards, supervision, andrecords maintenance.

3.9     Prior to the creation o f ANCPI and the unification o f responsibilities for
cadastre and the landbook system, the project design was clearly flawed and is
ratedModest. Followingthe unification, the commendable implementation
progress reflects the outcome o f a muchmore robust design, which i s ratedHigh.

3.10    Overall Relevance o f the GC-LRproject on the basis o f objectives and
design is considered Substantial.

Agricultural SupportServicesProject


Relevanceof Objectives
3.11    The project objectives were highly relevant to conditions inRomania. The
ASSP was designed inthe late 1990s to address six major challenges then facing
Romania's agricultural research, extension and educational system:

        to re-orient the system to make it serve private agriculture based on market
        principles; to adopt socio-economic, ecological, andbusiness criteria in
        planning,priority setting, monitoring and evaluatingthe agriculture
        knowledge system;

                                           12


        to restructure, selectively rehabilitate, decentralize and consolidate the
        systemto make it efficient, effective and financially sustainable;
        to develop and strengthenthe linkages between researchersandusers, and
        among research, extension and training activities; and
        to facilitate increasedinvestment inagricultural knowledge and
        information system(AKIS), bothpublic andprivate.

3.12    These reforms are longterm and the appraisal document appreciatedthat
these might require 10-15 years to achieve.

3.13    As a first step, there was aneedto selectively support the researchand
extension systemto serve private agriculture with already available technology
andinformation. This becameknown as the "rapid impact" approach, which
intendedto bringincreasedproductivityof crop and livestock, increased
profitability through better farm managementand collective bargaining for inputs
andmarkets, andincreasedsustainability through more ecologically-sound
technologies andpractices. At the same time, there was a longer term need for an
action planto reformthe agricultural knowledge system.

3.14    The ASSP was conceived to address anurgent needfor the generation,
acquisition and dissemination of appropriate agricultural technology, to improve
agriculture output andits quality. The continued application by farmers of dated
crop and animal production technologies, inherited from the Communist Era, was
a major constraining factor, as was apoorly equippedand unresponsive research
complex and an under-fundedand demoralized extension service. Intheir training
and orientation, bothservices were inadequateto meet the rural challenges ofthe
emerging market economy.

3.15    A few specifics: In1997there were 22 Central ResearchInstitutes, 98
regional stations and 5 agricultural universitieswith varying responsibilities for
agricultural research. Since the mid-l970s, however, there had been little new
investment inagricultural research. At project inception, the agricultural research
system sufferedfrom an excessiveemphasis on basic science over applied
research; on farm output over efficient farm production; narrowly focused
scientists; lack of client orientation; professional isolation; public sector
dominance; doubtful financial sustainability; and only marginal accountability to
intendedbeneficiaries.

3.16    Prior to decollectivization, technology was transferred directly from
researchinstitutes to managers andtechnicians employed by the state and
collective farms. There was little need for extension or advisory services for
private farmers. Once the state and collective farms hadbeen broken up, the
MinistryofAgriculturepostedseveralthousandagriculturists to 41judets (to all
counties except Bucharest) to initiate a farmer advisory service. Though most
possessed specialized technical skills, their diagnostic, farm management and
extension skills were quite limited.They also lacked experienceworking ina
client-responsive environment. A differentapproachto extension was clearly

                                          13


requiredto serve the needs o f Romania's now numerous and quite inexperienced
small farmers. Moreover, the farming population continued to distrust any
Government effort (however well meaning) to promote the formation o f
cooperatives or farmer associations as means to simplify extension outreach and
buttress the farmer's market power and facilitate credit processing and approvals.

Relevanceof Design
3.17    The project designwas substantiallyrelevant. The project design featured
a two pronged approach: (i)   support targeted, priority activities inresearch and
extension that will provide immediate benefit to farmers and agro-processors
which will serve as a catalyst to jump start the reformprocess; and (ii)   provide
assistance indeveloping an action planto reform AKIS that could be supported
through investments inthe next phase.

3.18    The project assisted a first phase ina long-term programto reform
Romanian agricultural research, education and extensionto respondbetter to
newly emerging realities and opportunities.

3.19    Prior to project approval, a number o f extensionproposals had already
been developedby farmer groups, non-government organizations and industry
associations. The extensioncontracts to be signed inthe project with these
stakeholder groups would explore ways to shift the cost o f some advisory services
from government to users, input suppliers and marketing organizations, and also
develop linkages among agriculture sector institutions to improve the
accountability andrelevance o f advisory services to farmers.

3-20    Prior to appraisal, the Government, with encouragement o f EU-PHARE,
had recently formalized the National Agricultural Advisory Agency (ANCA,
Ordinance dtd. November 1998), a governmental agency responsible for
agriculture advisory services. Considering budgetary constraints andthe already
increasing role o f the private sector inthe provision o f extension services, it i s
noteworthy that Government recognizedthe needto keep A N C A small and
decentralized. ANCA brought together about 1,3 00 technical staff, mostly at
communal level, who were previously employed inState and collective farms.
Judet level staff were made responsible for the planning andprovision o f
extension services based on a needs assessment to be carried out periodically with
farmers. As Government hadplans to privatize ANCA inthe future, the ASSP
furnished direct support for ANCA's extensionprograms, whose judet and
commune-level offices could also compete for funds from the CGS to finance
extension plans developed for their respective areas.

3.21    The Overall Rating for the ASSP project for Relevance on the basis o f
objectives anddesigni s Substantial.

EFFICACY

GeneralCadastreand Land RegistrationProject
3.22     Recordedreal estatetransactions more than doubled between2003-2006,
then doubled again in2007. The number of mortgage loans has increased from
1,948 mortgage loans recorded by the NationalBank of Romania in2001 to
82,675 in2005. A truly vibrant real estate market i s developing at long last in
Romania, largelydue to the project's impact. Annex Bpresents a summary o fkey
performance indicators inlog frame matrix format.

3.23     As anewmemberstate, Romania is receiving transfers of some 2 billion
annually inagriculture subsidesfrom the EU. The project has established the
technical base for the Land Parcel Identification System(LPIS) neededto identify
farmers eligible for direct payments under the EUCAP'SPillar 1.This has been
done by strengtheningthe geodetic control network anddeveloping national
standardsandproceduresfor orthophoto and other geographic information. The
project produced orthophotos covering 40 percent o fthe territory o fRomania and
the balance was produced using GOR funds according to the norms developed
withinthe project. The project hasprovideda solid basis (legal, technical,
institutional) for a secure and transparentlandmarket, for systematic cadastre and
registration activities inurbanandrural areas, and for forests restitution.

3.24     Importantly, a secure landbook systemhas beenestablished throughout
the whole country. A simple cadastre systemis also inplace andhasnow been
integrated with the landbook to provide a one-stop-shop for property transactions
(simple, efficient andcost effective). The overall processingtimes have been
significantly reduced and the quality o fthe processing has significantly increased.
The public are more aware ofthe needfor registration, andthe processhas been
professionalized. 80 percent of the applications are submitteddirectly by notaries
or surveyors on behalfo f clients. The average time requiredto process a standard
transaction (sale) i s now down to an average of 10 days from 30 to 60 daysjust
two years ago. The transaction processesare now simpler andmore transparent.

3.25     The GC-LR operation fully attained its objectives. As indicated inAnnex
Byall ofthe projects' quantitative objectives were exceededbythe closing date.
Indoingso, theproject developed fundamentalpublic infiastructure neededto
underpinthe transition to a marketbasedrural economy, thus serving its
development objectives quite well.

3.26    For example, by end FY06, whenthe project closed, (i)   cadastral and land
book offices hadbeen openedinall 42judet.s -per the target set forth inthe
appraisal document (ii) than 3 million landbooks had been opened (titles
                         more
registered), againstthe target at appraisal of about 1million, and (iii) number
                                                                        the
of real estate transactions recorded annually increasedto more than435,000 -
more than double the increasetargetedinthe appraisal document Inaddition, the
new system is muchmore efficient anduser friendly. For example, the
processing time for standardproperty registration has beenreduced from several

                                         15


months on averagewhenthe project was appraisedto an average of 10 days (the
appraisal document's target for processingwas only three days, butwith the
benefitofhindsight, this seems too optimistic). By project component:

3.27    General Cadastre.ANCPI now has complete digital orthophoto coverage
of the whole country, which exceeds the appraisaltarget by a factor of eight. The
Agency has also introduced the concept of cadastralindexmapping to allow it to
provide a geographical reference for all parcels, though without precise field
boundaries. Cadastre services are carried out by the 42 regional offices involving
3085 cadastralunits. The numberof sporadic registrations (on demand) entered
into the cadastre has increasedfrom 165,258 in 1999to 594,783 in2005. It i s
estimatedthat the numbers in2006 were another 20-30% higher. This growth can
be seen inTable 3 below.

 Table 3. Numberof cadastral registrations(1999-2005)

3.28   By project's end, 4,741,391 property units were entered inthe cadastre
database, against the appraisal document target of 3.1 million, while more than
670,000 parcels had beensurveyed, against the original target of 650,000.

particularlynotable inrecent years as entry into the EUprovides an impetusfor
landmarketactivity inrural areas. A unifiednational registration systemhas been
established inall 42judets,per the target at appraisal, with professional registrars
(119licensed registrars) inplace throughout the country. There are 163 offices
throughout the country providing efficient, integrated registration and cadastre
services.

3.30   Three million new landbooks have beenopened inthe former
transcription-inscription areas (south and east ofthe country). This points to both
an increaseinlandmarket activity, as well as more recognition o fthe needto
register private properties. Standardapplications are registered insome ten days,
and alterations to landparcels are processedin 15-20 days. ANCPI is managing
some 4,000 cases per day (2007)   - bothcadastre  and registry transactions. Most
transactionsare beingregistered with ANCPI andthis i s supported by the growth
innumbersrecordedbythe Agency.

3.3 1   Joint Information System. International IT consultants were engagedto
develop a uniform, digitalized informationsystem which was developed and
tested for the project. The systemwas neededto both insure consistency among
the landbooks andthe informationthese contained, andto measurably speedup
the rate ofprocessingapplications for title andthe retrieval ofcadastraldatato
certify parcel locations, boundariesandplot sizes. By end FY03, the systemhad
beencontracted anddeveloped, andby the project's closing date, it hadbeen
rolledout andpiloted in7judets, 2 of whichwere completed. (The target at
appraisal was completion of 7 pilots, though the system architecture and design
hadto be modifiedwhen the cadastre andlandbook offices were unified, causing
some delay). Itpresently is being installed nationwide using GOR funds with the
assistanceo f database managementconsultants, who also are engagedinsystem
redesignto work out some kinksinthe original design.

3.32    The JIS was originally conceived as a dual architecture systemsupporting
cadastral and landbook applications across two institutions. This complicated the
workflows. Followingthe institutional merger, the JIS essentially retains the
cadastraland landbook components though the level o f integration is higher. The
cadastre module includes functions to manage the cadastralinformation(textual
andgraphical), provide updates andmaintenance, andsupportthe servicing of
requests for informationas well as maintaining the geometry of boundaries. The
landbook module supports intake of applications, checking of documents,
registration andreceipt to client, all with built-inelectronic workflow.

3.33    Related Outcomes. Other agencies have beenable to use the data
generatedby the project for their ownpurposes. This includes use of the
orthophotos by the Agriculture Ministryinthe preparation of the IACS/LPIS
systemnecessary for EUsubsidy payments. One happily unexpectedoutcome has
been the growth and growing sophistication of the private sector inRomania. The
private sector has grown with the project providing numerous and increasingly
sophisticated services - cadastre surveying, data entry, digitizationo f cadastre
plans, document scanningandindexing. This is apositive development for the
future programs and projects of ANCPI inthis sector but also for Romania as it
enters the EUand foreign investment increases along with the needfor
sophisticated andwell managedsurveying (for road construction, housing
development), scanning and data entry services and others. Detailed outcomes are
listed inAnnex B.

3.34    Owing to the substantial lag inproject implementation, essentially until
end FY04whenmajor (and successful) adjustmentsinproject organization and
implementation arrangementswere introduced, a rating ofSubstantiali s assigned
using the procedure establishedby IEGand OPCS for restructured projects.

Agricultural SupportServicesProject
3.35    Project Objectives. The project hadtwo objectives (i)   increase agricultural
productivity, sustainability andincome by providingimmediately needed

                                                  17


technology information andtraining for private farmers and agro-processors, and
(ii)improve efficiency, cost effectiveness andclient relevance inthe management
of researchand extension.

3.36      The Government andBank staff involvedinproject preparation
recognized the urgent need to adapt existingproventechnology to support private
farmers. The role of agricultural extension neededto berationalized and
developed withina framework where the roles of the public andprivate sectors in
technology dissemination were clearly defined. Giventhe prevailing and severe
budgetary limitations for bothresearchand extension, these two aspects of
agricultural knowledge transfer bothneededto be developed inparallel so they
could be closely linkedand be financially sustainable.

3.37      The design ofthe project also reflectedimplications from Romania's
pending accessionto EUregarding the organization andmanagementof
agricultural researchand extension. Inthe OECD countries, a large and increasing
share of agricultural researchand extension is managedthrough private
companies and farmer organizations. The project's focus on private farms,
including small farms, was critical as this group urgently required appropriate
technologies and information for the uptakeof agricultural practices that were not
only productive, but also profitable. The project thus aimed to build institutional
andhumancapacity to undertakerelevant researchand extensionactivities for
newfarmers, conforming with the agricultural and environmental standards
requiredby the EU.

3.38      While no quantitative performance targets were established by the
appraisal team (which i s difficult to do for this kindof operation)', the project's
achievements suggestthat the ASSP fully satisfied its development objectives.
The project contributed to improvedproductivity of crops and livestock
productionand raisedincomes ofthe beneficiaries. Therewas considerable
improvement inmilk quality and increaseinquantity.Production o f forage crops
and field crops also increased. For example,the introductionof superior seed on
3600 ha. ina seed potato subproject i s reported to have ledto an 11%increase in
yield. Further,the disseminated technology has ledto quality increase, which has
generatedan increase inprice of 32%. The effects of these achievements are
reflected inthe individualERRSestimated for the CGS sub-projects as notedin
the section on efficiency. Keyperformance indicators are shown inAnnex B. By
component:

3.39      Competitive Grant Scheme. The CGS has beenimplemented from the
start basedon a rigorous set of criteriaand indicators that were set out inthe
'Both  ex-ante and ex-post quantification o fnet benefits from research and extension investments
(rates o freturn) is usually not undertaken since it i s difficult, ifnot impossible to anticipate with
any degree o f precision the outcome o fthese activities. This is mainly due to difficulties inlinking
cause (costs) and effect (outcomes), because so many exogenous influences from the meta-levels
andthe macro-economy that are both difficult to identifyand capture usually govern the success
or failure o ftechnology transfer investments (such as those inthe ASSP).

Operational Manual and whichhavebeenmodifiedand adjusted as experience
was gained. A total of sevencalls for proposals were organized, the first inJune
1999and the final one inNovember 2004. Some 2575 proposals intotal were
received. Following screeningby the CGS Secretariat for quality and
responsivenessto establishedpriorities, successful recipients were invited to
submitfull project proposals, whichwere alsopre-screenedbythe Secretariatand
thenforwarded to localpeer reviewers for evaluation, prior to submission to the
Agricultural Services Board (ASB) for final selection. A total o f 329 proposals
were fully evaluated, and 154 sub-projectswere approved bythe ASB for
financing. Out of these, 149were successfully implemented, and only 5 (Le. 3%)
were consideredunsatisfactory during implementation; three of which were
cancelled. The implementation periodfor the sub-projects has averaged 3 years,
butdecreasedrapidly inthe later tranches. A large majority of sub-projects
promoted the transfer of available technologies, as % of projects had extension
componentsonly, while the remainder combined applied researchand extension
activities.

3.40    Start-upofthe scheme was slower than expected, as the first
disbursementstook place only inSeptember,2001,morethanone year after the
project became effective. This was due to lack of experience inprocurement and
financial managementproceduresof the initial project team, as well as by the
Ministry ofAgriculture. This initialdelay, followed by slow disbursementinthe
following two years, was responsible for the needto extend the project by one
year. Remarkable progresswas made, however, duringthe last years by the PMU
team, which was finally able to carry out the sub-projects and fully disburse the
funds under this component by the extendedclosing date ofthe project.

3.41    The grant schemewas successfulingeneratingpartnerships between
public sector and private sectors operators, as 334 public agencies and 227 private
organizations (farmers' associations, NGOs, commercial companies) were
involved insuchpartnershipsfor the implementation ofthe 154 sub-projects.
Indeed, 58% ofthe grant fundshadbeenawardedto private organizations. The
scheme has also contributed to establish links with agro-processing andmarketing
companies, as 23 sub-projects were implementedby such companies or in
partnership with them (among which 15 inthe milkproduction sector).

3.42    A K A Related Programs. The Rapid Impact Program was designedto
assist ANCA inimproving its capacity to transfer rapid impact and on-the shelf
available technologies. The program was initiated in2000. Altogether, brochures
covering 86 differenttechnologies were publishedwith atotal printing of 410,000
copies. Also, an electronic database comprising available technologies was built
upwithinANCA, which was anadditional activity recommendedbythe mid-term
review. ANCA's Rural Radio andMass Media Programproduced agricultural
radio programs, andtrained ANCA inmass media communication techniques.

3.43    Although considerable time was requiredto implementthe program, due
to managerial andprocurement delays, ithelpedimprovethe communication

                                         19


skills of ANCA and its regional personnel. Radio broadcastinghas continued in
some counties after termination of the air-time contract, beingfinanced mainly by
revenues from advertising. A contract has recently beensignedby ANCA with
the nationalradio station for aregular agricultural informationbroadcasting
service.

3.44    TheAKIS Action Plan. A free standing component inthe project -the
action planprovidedlocal and internationaltechnical assistance for a wide-
rangingreviewofthe Agricultural KnowledgeandInformationSystemthat
providedthe basis uponwhich a semi-repeaterproject (MAKIS) for modernizing
the systemwas preparedandapproved bythe World Bank.This component also
enhanced, throughtechnical assistance, study tours andworkshops, the awareness
of stakeholders on best practices, and facilitated, a consensus on the broad
objectives o fthe newMAKISproject.

3.45    TA and Training. Featuring fellowships inforeign countries, a "Young
Scientists" program enhancedthe knowledge of young Romanianresearchersin
agriculture and food safety issues. Co-funded by USAID, a total of 34 scientists
benefittedfrom enrollment instudies at Iowa StateUniversityandthe University
o f Wisconsin. The program i s reported to be successful, taking into account the
influential positions acquired by many applicants upontheir return to Romania,
and because it ledthe way to the creation of a new scholarship program financed
by USAID,the "Norman BorlaugInternational Science and Technology Fellows
Program"   - in September 2004. Becauseofthe good feedback received from the
Young Scientists Program, the project financed three additional trainingprograms
not identifiedat appraisal.

3.46    Overall, the CGS was managedinan efficient manner. The administration
cost of the scheme was less than 10percent of the total cost ofthe CGS sub-
projects. For the CGS component, a highly effective monitoring and information
management systemwas set up. According to the project's M&Edata base 58,000
farmers have benefited, through the 154 sub-projects. The number of farmers
having adopted at least a part ofthe technologies proposed is reported by the
implementation reports ofthe sub-projects at 46,000, an average adoption ratio o f
nearly 80%. Further evidence of a high adoption rate was brought, for instance
through discussions with dairy plants, which confirm a noticeable improvement in
the quality of milk inareas where milk quality improvement sub-projects took
place; the same evidence was brought forward for potato seeds sub-projects.

3.47    The Institutionalsupport component exceededexpectations as far as
training activities are concerned. While selectively improvingthe capabilities o f
ANCNOJCA staffto practice demand drivenextension and improve their
communication skills, the assistancebrought to ANCA through the component
was not sufficientto significantly improve the performance ofANCA as a whole,
which would have requiredrestructuring measuresnot foreseenat appraisal that
ultimately lay beyond the scope of the project.

3.48    The overall rating for Efficacy ofthe ASSP Project is Substantial.

EFFICIENCY

General CadastreandLand RegistrationProject
3-49 Efficiency i s consideredSubstantial.No attempt was made to estimate an
ERRat Appraisal. Project economic benefits at completion were estimatedinthe
ICRwith referenceto: (i) onproperty; (ii)
                           impact                  environmental impact;
(iii)beneficiary savings from streamlining the registration process and, (iv)
impact on the banking system. On the costs side of the ledger, the total project
investment costs were included inthe analysis. It is noteworthy that actual costs
are some 40% less than planned. .Annual incremental operating costs of ANCPI
are estimated at 5% of total annual cumulative investment costs. On the basis of
very conservative assumptions regardingthe quantification of project benefits and
taking into account the overall project investmentcost, the post-project ERRhas
beenassessedat 13.7percent.

3.50    At the time ofproject design, the Government of Romania didnothave a
generalpolicy on cost recovery inpublic sector service provision. However,
ANCPI is now on strong financial footing andthe Agency continuation seems
assured. Its financial surplus is beingutilizedto meet the needs of future
investment programs of the Agency, principally its participation inthe Bank
assisted CESAR Project (also a semi-repeater) and mainly including expanding
space andbuilding facilities for staff.

3.5 1   This assessment has reviewed andagrees with the methodology and
assumptions behindthe ERRcomputations and financial results presented inthe
ICR. While the expectedproject benefits hadbeen fully achieved by the project's
closing date, most accrued following the creation of ANCPI in2004 andthe
unification of implementation responsibilities within this new agency. Also, a 2%
year extension of the project's original closing data was requiredfor these
benefits to accrue. The rating again was assignedper the procedure established
by IEGand OPCS for restructuredprojects.

Agricultural SupportServicesProject
3.52    Efficiency is ratedHigh. An overall economic analysis to determine the
Net Present Value (NPV) and the Economic Rate of Return(ERR) i s very
difficult to perform for an applied researchand extension project, especially when
includinga competitive grant scheme and an institutional support component. At
appraisalno attempt was madeto compute summaryNPVFs, ERRsor financial
ratios. Inthe ICR, however, a detailed economic and financial analysis of a
sample of completed sub-projects financed under the CGS (which represents 82
percent o fthe project cost) was carried out. The ERRsfor CGS sub-projects
amenable to an economic impact analysis vary from 46 percent to more than 200
percent. The resulting ERRfor the entire project was 103 percent, well above the

 assumedopportunity cost of capital, andwould be even higher were net benefits
 from spill-overs and other externalities factored in.The methodology has been
 reviewed, it was done professionally and is endorsedby this assessment.

 OUTCOMES

 3.53    Basedon an assessment of relevance, efficacy and efficiency, the outcome
 o f boththe projects is ratedSatisfactory.

 MONITORING AND EVALUATIONRESULTS

 GeneralCadastreand Land RegistrationProject

 M&E Design
 3.54    The project design for monitoringandevaluation was fairly general.
Responsibilities for M& Eat appraisalwere as assignedto the Project
Coordinating Unit, which would base its monitoring on data furnishedby the local
cadastraland landbook offices. A foreign M&Eexpert was to be assignedto
assist the PCU during year 1to design a simple management information system
for M&E, reporting formats for each component, includingtargeted annual
performance objectives and monitoringindicators using a somewhat general
results framework set forth inAnnex 1of the PAD. During the mid-termreview,
the project M&Edesignwas to be adjusted, ifneeded.


 M&E Implementation
 3.55    The uptake of effective M&Ewas hamperedby the dual institutional
 structure of the project, andthe lack of cooperation betweenthe agencies. There
 was also a lack of understanding on the part of the borrower of the importance of
 monitoring data for project management anddecision making. Reliance was
 therefore placed on the routine control statistics generatedby the landbook and
 cadastre offices, and on output basedreporting. No baselinedatawas collected
 during project preparation as there was little data available. The newAgency
 which is already operating on a self-financing basis, has recognized the need for
 regular performance monitoring and a great deal o f monitoringdatahas been
 collected inthe last year ofthe project, which has continued with Agency funds.
 Regular quarterly M&Ereporting, which had ceased in2002, were restartedin
 2004 andANCPI continues this function today.


 M&E Utilization
 3.56    Bythe project's closing date, the design of a far more robust electronic
 M&EsystemhadbeeninstalledbyANCPI, andutilizationhadbegun. Itis
 expectedthat utilizationwill really advance under the follow-up Complementing
 EUSupportForAgricultural Restructuring (CESAR) (FY08) project, in
 conformance with E.U.standards. ANCPI already producesregular monitoring

                                          22


reports to management and their database contains most of the data requiredfor
CESAR performance monitoring. However, this systemwill be expandedunder
CESAR to track the advance of capacity building activities, the geographic
expansion of systematic title registration, andthe evaluation of customer
satisfaction. CESAR M&Ewill consist of a combination o fprocessmonitoring,
ad-hoc andex-ante assessments, and impact evaluation. Itwill be conducted both
at the Project level and at the regional and local level, using bothadministrative
and survey datacollection mechanisms, includingrapidassessments (such as
community profiling). Outcomes are being monitored boththrough the ANCPI's
internal M&E as well as through independentevaluationheneficiary assessments
commissioned by the Agency.

3.57    Onthe basis of M&Edesign, implementation andutilization, an overall
rating of Modest is assigned.

AGRICULTURALSUPPORTSERVICESPROJECT

M&E Design
3.58    The originaldesign featured three types of M&Einthe project:
(1) monitoringthrough quarterlyandprogress reports preparedby the PMU,
basedon inputprovided by ASB and ANCA; (2) evaluation of the CGS funded
programs to be undertakenby the ASB inconjunction with outside agencies; and
(3) ex-post evaluation of the overall project by an outside agency (agricultural
universities, economic institutes, local and foreign). Utilizing a very detailed
results framework as set forth inAnnex 1of the appraisal document the overall
project evaluation was to assess ifproject-assistedactivities achieved intended
results interms o ftechnology development, dissemination, and adaptation; actual
andpotential impact on farm incomes; institutional capacity development; human
resource development; etc mainstreaming successful extension messages and
deliverymechanismsand indesigning future initiatives for strengthening and
reformingresearchand extension systems. A foreign expert was to assistthe
PMUduring Year 1to design a simplemanagement informationsystem for
M&E, reportingformats for eachcomponent, includingtargetedannual
performance objectives. The project design would be adjusted, ifneeded,
following recommendations made inthe mid-termreview.


M&E Implementation
3.59    The progress o fthe CGS grants was closely monitored by the PMU,
utilizing routine electronic reporting and frequent andvery professional analysis
andevaluation underthe direction ofanM&E/IT consultant onlong-term hireby
the PMU. The monitoring systemhasproved very useful inidentifying both
results andthe problem sub-projects, inleading to rapid corrective measures, and
for planning the activities of the PMU. As a result of close monitoring, the status
of the portfolio improvedmarkedly from the thirdtranche onwards. According to
the project monitoringdata base, 58,000 farmers have benefited, through the 154

                                          23


sub-projects and also from training courses averaging 2.5 days. CGS grants also
financed 3,000 demonstration days for 36,000 farmers on 1,700 demonstration
fields, and 745 local workshops for 50,000 participants. The grant recipients
publishedabout 1,000 brochuresandleaflets with print-runsof 700,000 copies, as
well as 680 press andjournal articles. Onethird of sub-grants also preparedradio
and TV informationbroadcasts.Brochures were published(4,000 copies intotal)
presenting the results of 20 CGS sub-projects, and an impact analysis (200 copies
on DVDs) was distributedcovering a sample of 30 sub-projects.

3.60    An average adoption ratio ofnearly 80 percent was recorded among CGS
sub-project beneficiaries. The high adoption rate was also evidenced anecdotally
through discussionswith dairy plants, which confirmed a noticeable improvement
inthe quality ofmilkinareaswheremilkquality improvement projectswere
sited. Inthose sub-projects where genetically improvedanimals were bredand/or
imported and support was provided for marketing there was a significant
improvement inmilk quantity also. For the potato seeds projects, superior
cultivars andtraining inappropriate cultivationand storagetechniques raised
output andreduced spoilage.


M&E Utilization
3.61    The success ofthe CGS component helpedto change attitudes towards
researchfunding priorities, stimulated new partnershipsbetweenresearch
institutes, universities, extension agents and farmers, as well as betweenthe
public andprivate sector agencies, andpromoted farmers' associations. The
mainstreaming of the CGS under the recently approved ModernizingAgricultural
Knowledge And Information Systems (MAKIS), (FY05) project provides an
opportunity to scaleup these achievements and fully mainstreamthe CGS'
component's features within the Ministryof Agriculture.

3.62    Onthe basis ofthe effective design for monitoring the ASSP's large CGS
component, its implementation anddiligent utilization, an overall rating for M&E
ofSubstantial is assigned.

FUSKTO DEVELOPMENTOUTCOME
3.63    Perhapsthe most significant outcome is that these projects have truly
taken-off. Key features from the GC-LR project have been incorporated inthe
recently approved CESAR project (FYOS), which was designedto facilitate
harmonization ofthe tested componentsof the new cadastre andregistration
system with EUrequirements while extending systematic cadastre andthe
digitalized information systemto several additionaljudets. The parallel Bank
assistedMAKISproject (FY05), aims to scale-up the competitive grants scheme
from the ASSP and also promote agri-food marketing, again inharmony with
Community requirements.

                                          24


3.64    Significantly, during the inter-regnum between formal closure ofthe GC-
LRandASSP andapproval ofthe two semi-repeaters, the Government continued
implementation of bothproject designs from its own resources, while main-
streaming several aspects ofthe ASSP. (With establishment ofthe ANCPI in
2004, the cadastre and digitalized landrecording systems had already been
mainstreamed.) It is worthy ofnote that implementation arrangementsfor the two
semi-repeaterswill feature coordination betweenthem at the central and local
levels inorder to maximize beneficiary impact. This was lacking for the most
part inthe two projects underreview, owingmainly to the still nascentpresence
of systematic cadastre inRomania's 42judets, save for the 7 that were the focus
of the project.

 General Cadastreand LandRegistrationProject
 3-65   ANCPI has been firmly establishedas the single registration and cadastre
agency (self-financed). Any changeto this institutional outcome would be costly
andinstitutionallyquite difficult. The landbooks havebeenphysically transferred
as have many o fthe staff, The newintegratedbusiness processesare inoperation
inall offices and clients are generally satisfied. The newinformationsystemthat
includes integrated workflows for registration and cadastrewill further seal the
marriage o fthese two functions. ANCPI rolled out the new systemto six offices
in2006 bringingthe totalto 13of42, includingBucharest, Brasov andsomeof
the largest, busiest offices. The rollouthas continued in2007 and2008 to all 42
judets. This will further improve the quality andefficiency ofthe registrationand
cadastre servicesprovided.

3.66    The private surveyors, notaries, banksandother interestedkey stakeholder
groups are generally pleasedwith ANCPI and interested inincreasedcooperation.
Their support is crucial as they are the maincustomers ofthe Agency inthe
future.

 3.67   ANCPI is self-financing, allowing it a greater amount of autonomy. The
mainweakness and vulnerability o fthe system is that the Director of ANCPI is a
political appointee andtherefore subject to changes at the ministerial level. The
newAgency has already hadfive directors infour years andthis instability at the
top continues to be a concern. ANCPI's senior technical managersjoined the
agency from the former ONGCG whenANCPI was establishedin2004. Their
continued involvement inthe project andthe further development of ANCPI's
activities during the post-project periodhave contributed to the stability and
ultimate success of the unified management system. However, the management
needs be stabilized to consolidate the agency's successes.

3.68    There are two developing issues which couldimpedethe smooth operation
of ANCPI's services at the county level and a more rapid accrual of project
benefits. These include (i) difficulty inreplacing authorized title
                              the
investigators, many of whom are moving into private practice, and (ii)   an
escalating number o f landandtitle disputesthat are landing before the courts.

                                          25


3.69    The title investigators play an important role inthe finalizing o ftitles.
They verify that the surveyors have accurately located and delineated registered
properties whose putative owners have applied for title. When they do their job
competently (and most do), proper verification can head o f fmost disputes and
leadto a quick resolution. ANCPI's authorized investigators have had some
professionaltraining, and it was the agency's intentionto retainthis function and
capability on staff. Over the past two years, however, the lure o f private practice
has depleted their ranks inmany country offices, who have had little success in
recruiting replacements as even ANCPI's reasonably generous pay-scale has
proved insufficient inthe face o f earnings from private practice. This has resulted
inthe occasional shoddy verification byuntrained staff, andmightbecontributing
to a bulge incourt cases in2007, following several years o f decline (Table 4
below). The Agency's management team i s aware o fthe issue, andmight consider
a contracting out o f verification services should the loss o f trained staff continue.

3.70    Inits briefexistence, ANCPI's superb technical managershave
demonstrated a capability and willingness to address emerging problems and
issues head-on, andbefore these cause major difficulties. There is every reason to
expect that ANCPI will continue to do so, both inthe context o f the CESAR semi-
repeater, and o f continued harmonizationwith the EU's policy, technical and
administrative requirements o f member states. The overall risk to development
outcomes appears to be slight, at most, and is assigned a rating o fNegZigibZe to
Low.

AgriculturalSupportServices Project
3.71    Regarding the first development objective o fthe Project, the technologies
disseminatedthrough the CGS component are sustainable, because these are simple, low-
cost technologies, which require exclusively inputs (seeds, plant nutrientsand animal
medications) and services (artificial insemination, quality controls) available inthe
country. They provide high rates of returnand substantial incremental net incomes. Itis
therefore highly unlikely that farmers will revert to previous practices. The principal
uncertainty relatesto the promotion andcertification o f organic farming, the long term
sustainability of which will depend on the competitive advantage of Romaniaversus
other EUmember states, where organic farming is often heavily subsidized. This risk i s
however limited, considering the small weight of organic farming sub-projects inthe total
CGS portfolio (7 percent).

3.72    Bycontributing to the building upandstrengthening ofNGOs and farmers'
associations, the Project has also enhancedthe ability o f farmers to maintain and further
promote the disseminatedtechnologies, as this will enable increasedexchangeso f
experience and acceleratespillovers. The ASSP initially was targeted at poor, subsistence
small farmers, which are unlikely to be sustainable within the context of accessionto EU.
Very small farms will probably not survive long, because of competitive pressures and
newsanitaryEUrequirements.Fieldsurveys show however that, although not initially
targeted, farmers who attendedmost regularly the training and demonstration sessions
organized through the CGS program, andwho drewthe highest benefits from the project,
were medium size or progressive farmers, who have the best chancesto adapt to the new
future context.

3.73    A factor that could soonaffect severalproject beneficiaries is the forthcoming
allocation of the EU's milkmarketing quota for Romania, currently set at 1million liters
per year. Although Romanian farmers currently produce at twice the levelthe EUwill
allow on the market, muchis consumed inthe producer's household or otherwise does
not meet EUstandardsfor intra-community trade. Unfortunately, many project
beneficiaries who now husbandimproved breeds or operate modern dairy plants andmilk
collection centers face great uncertainty about the volume of production that might be
authorized as the quota is parceled out to individualcooperatives and enterprises.

3.74    Chances are, inthe short runat least, the quota won't be fully utilized as many
farmers and dairy need to upgrade their production before qualifying for an allocation.
Over time, however, the competition for allotments couldbecome intense.

3.75    The sustainability ofthe improvements brought by the Project to the efficiency,
cost effectiveness and client relevanceof the managemento fresearchand extension will
depend, as far as public institutions are concerned, on their ability to capitalize uponthe
experience gainedthrough the Project. These endeavors will be strongly supported by the
newMAKISproject, which has beendesignedto expandactivities initiatedunder ASSP
and to support agricultural researchinstitutions andadvisory systems.

3.76    The overall risk to Development outcomes is thus deemedNegligible toLow.

BANKPERFORMANCE

3.77    There i s no question that the Bank played an extremely important role duringthe
design stage o f the two projects and once these were under implementation. The design
fundamentals o f both projects were the subject o f hot debate withinthe Romanian
government andwith andwithin civil society inthe mid-1990s prior to the Bank
becoming directly involved. It i s to the credit o f staff, that once recognition o f the need
for bothprojects had gelled, staff was able to promote the views o f those protagonists
supporting the more needed elements o f project design, ina sensitive and effective
manner.

3.78    This was no small accomplishment, as Romania was still reeling from the post-
Ceauqescu economic collapse and from a level o f civil unrest that at one stage threatened
to leadto civil war. Among potential foreign donors, the Bank also very muchplayed a
leadrole, althoughthe Bank's Resident Manager Bucharest kept the international
community informed o f progress and difficulties duringperiodic and frequent meetings
o f donor representatives inthose years. EU-PHARE, offered limited support for the
ASSP, by encouraging Government to create ANCA as a semi-independent agency in
1998, and financing a strategic review o f AKIS as a prelude to formulating an action plan
for AKIS. USAID provided pre-project bridge financing untilthe project was declared
effective.

QUALITYAT ENTRY

General Cadastre and Land Registration Project
3.79    At the time o fproject preparation, the landmarket inRomaniawas not operating
according to market norms. Indeedit was hardly operating at all. Nationwide, the number
o f transactions was significantly below what would be expected ina modern market
based economy. The procedures were not consistent across the country, were time
consuming, generated a significant number o f disputes and involved several agencies
with manybureaucratic steps. Previouspolitically driven landreform programs had
resultedinlarge numbers o funregistered titles (from the Law 18 restitution for instance)
supported by weak field sketches (parceling plans). Further,there was a general lack o f
transparency inreal estate dealings. The public found it difficult to obtain advice and
assistance resulting inincomplete applications, rejections, multiple visits and general
dissatisfactionwith the reliability o f services.

3.80    Though this project was one o f the first o f its type inthe E C A region, experience
from other Bankprojects suggested that for any real progress to be made certain elements
mustbe inplacebefore a large investment can be expected to yield results. These factors
included a clear legal framework, a simple institutional structure and government
commitment. The project at design stage was built on the legal andinstitutional changes
created in 1996 which were considered acceptable by the Bank at the time. The following
supportive steps were taken at the time o f project preparationand demonstrated
government commitment to the project going forward:

                                              29


        The Law 7/1996 providedthe legal basis for a single landregistration system
        across the whole country able to support both sporadic (demandbased) and
        systematic registration.
        The creation of the newNational Office for Cadastre, Geodesy andCartography
        inNovember 1996pavedtheway for the establishment ofanational systemof
        cadastre, bringingtogether the urbanandrural data into a single agency.

3.81 Though the legal and institutionalstructures were considered sufficient to move
forward with the project, itwas also recognizedthat a simpler, pilot-orientedproject was
necessaryto further solidify the reforms. Therefore, the project was designedto focus on
a limitednumber ofjudets selectedbasedon pre-determinedcriteria includingthe
economic potential ofthe area and the number oftransactions and landdisputes.
Systematic cadastre would bepilotedin7judets; and sporadic registration would be
supportedin 18judets (76 landbook offices). The project was plannedto be implemented
progressively over the 5 years, beginning with trials to test methodologies and
operational procedures for both systematic andsporadic processes.

3.82    Quality at Entrywas considered satisfactory by QAG. The project preparation
team was aware that legalbasis for land administration was newly established and that,
especially on the cadastral side, there was a newinstitutionto be created, skilledup and
professionalized. On the registration side, a major overhaul o fthe legal procedures was
necessitatedby the adoption ofthe landbook systemacross the country.

3.83    For these reasons, the project designers took a step by step approach to identify
the three components for support: (a) development of the cadastre; (b) establishment of a
landbook system; and (c) institutionalstrengthening. The first two components would
allow the two implementingentities (ONCGC and MOJ) to focus on their own needs and
issues, while the third component would focus on technical assistance and the
development of thejoint information systemdesignedto bringthe two parts of the system
together. The risk of the dual agency approachwas known at project entry, however the
World Bankteam recognized that both institutions were facing considerable internal
changes (new laws, procedures, extensive data capture/data conversion programs) and it
was expectedthat the technical integration would proceed downstream once these initial
issues were resolved.

3.84    To minimize risk of poor integration and connectivity, it was decided to
implementa digitalizedJoint InformationSystemandto have anon-site TA contractor to
respondmore quickly to the clients' needs. The project also recognized the lack of skilled
staff inthe public sector and the recruitment difficulties posed by low public sector
salaries, thus opted to rely on the private sector for mapping, cadastre surveyingand data
entry work.

3.85    Several key risks were identifiedat entry, including institutionalcapacity and
skills to complete the project and institutional cooperation between the two implementing
entitles. However, the risk o fpoor institutionalcooperation was considered to be
moderate.

                                              30


3.86    Eventsevidencedthe flaw inthe Project's dual structure for implementation. The
quality at entry is assignedarating ofModerately Satisfactory.

Agricultural SupportServicesProject
3.87    Although the project was not subject to QAG assessment the quality at entry was
clearly satisfactory. The project design andobjectives provided an adequate and well
balanced strategy to remedyinthe short term the deficiencies ofthe researchand
extension systemand, inthe longer term, to prepare for an in-depthrestructuring ofthe
knowledge transfer systeminagriculture. It is worth noting that the Project didnot aim at
achieving during its lifetime the necessaryreforms o fthe agricultural researchand
extension system, butwas viewedas a first step ina longterm processtowards this end.
A numberof institutional andorganizational potential risks hadbeen adequately
identifiedduring appraisal (non professionalmanagementofthe CGS, favoritismin
provisionof grants, lack of availability o f competent management staff, lack of
experienceo f contractors, difficulties for ANCA to implementits activities) although
most of these, save for the last one, either didnot materialize, else were successfully
handledduringimplementation.

3.88    The Bank`s overall performance inthe identification, preparationassistance, and
appraisal o fthe project is ratedSatisfactory. The preparation processwas adequately
performed ina reasonabletime, leading to awell designedproject addressing
Government priorities as outlined inthe CAS.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

General Cadastreand Land RegistrationProject
3.89    As the GC&LR project got underway itbecamequickly evident that placement of
the cadastralfunction andlandregistration responsibilities undertwo separate heads was
not going to work. (This was areflection of the Austro-Hungarian approach, which
foundered on the shoals of Romania's two distinct landrecording systems once
implementation of the operation commenced.) Nonetheless,bureaucratic inertia, in-
fighting and institutional pridepreventedthe consolidation of these inter-related functions
withinthe purviewof a single, task focused agency. Matters cameto aheadin2003,
when ajoint portfolioreviewofall Bankproject recommendedto the Prime Minister
(PM) that an independentand largely self-financed agency be createdtojointly
administer the cadastral and landregistration aspects of the project, else cancel the
outstanding balance of the loan. The P Mwas presentedwith four short briefingpapers
which outlined the advantagesof a unified systemwhile showing how poorly the land
recording side o fthe project was performinginits then current incarnation as a step-child
withinthe MinistryofJustice. The P Magreedwiththe Bankand orderedthat
implementation responsibilities be unified.

3.90    What followed was not an easy implementation situation. The (new) Ministero f
Justice realized that he needed300 additional judges to administer the existing land
recordingdeed book system, ifthe Ministryof Justice was also to carry out its primary
androutinejuridical responsibilities. Hethenagreedin2004 amidst considerable angst
                                                               -

withinMOJandthe legalprofession at large to transfer MOJ's land book

responsibilities to the newly created ANCPI and also signed o f f on this new agency's
authorization to assess fees for service. It was a genuine exercise o f political will, and as
events later proved, one that spelled the difference betweenproject success and failure.

3.9 1    The Bank undertook regular supervisionmissions. Missionstaff includedthe
appropriate technical experts andthe client was pleased with the advice and guidance
provided. The project was declared a problem project (Implementation status rated
unsatisfactory) once inlate 1999 due to slow implementation progress and weak
management withinONCGC. Implementation progress was rated satisfactory duringthe
following mission inmid-2000. Curiously, the project remained satisfactory from then
on. Inlight o f events, it appears that the supervisionteam was a bit kindinits supervision
ratings as implementation delays and weak management continued to plague the project.

3.92     There could have been stronger information technology expertise early on inthe
development o fthe Joint Information System which might have mitigated some o fthe
difficulties with the long contract implementationperiod. Development o f complex IT
systems requires depth and experience which the client was lacking. The team, though
experienced, also would have benefited from more specialized IT expertise insupervision
o f the IT system. The procurement method used       - combined hardwareand software bid
was, inhindsight, not the best method. Again, the project, as one o f the first o f its kindin
the region, provided good lessons learned for other projects inthe region.

3.93     After several years o f difficult project implementation and lack o f inter-agency
cooperation, the Bank team strongly advocated for changes inthe institutional set-up to
move toward a single agency. This advice was listenedto andthe GOR'sdecision to
establish a single agency for registrationand cadastre i s considered a significant outcome
o f the project. The Bank team promptly adjusted to the changes ininstitutional structure
andproject management arrangements andmobilized significant expertise to advise the
new agency.

3.94     The Bank`s overall performance insupport o fthe GC-LR Project is rated
Satisfactory, Save for problems supervisingthe ITcomponent, goodtechnical expertise
was provided andthe client was appreciative o fthe advice and guidance.

Agricultural SupportServicesProject
3.95     Inthe course ofimplementation, the Bankconductednine supervisionmissions
(almost two per year) and a midterm review. Ingeneral, the composition o f the Bank
missions interm o f appropriate skill mix, expertise, and staff continuity was assured, with
consultants mobilized for specific areas when needed. The project implementation
progress was carefully monitored by the supervision team, andwas recorded inthe
Implementation Status Reports (ISR). The supervision mission ratings for achievement o f
the project's development objective andimplementationprogress have all been
satisfactory, with the exception o f unsatisfactory ratings for project monitoring/evaluation
in2002, for procurementdelaysinlate 2003 andfor projectmanagement early inthe
project's life.

                                              32


3-96    The Bank showed flexibility and reactedpromptly to the requests o fthe
implementing agency. The Bankwas supportive to the project management, and
generally intervenedwhen necessary, for instance to draw the attention o f the
implementing agency when changes were needed inthe project team, to draw the
attention o f ANCA on delays inthe implementation o ftheir sub-components, andto
explain the project concept to new Ministryofficials inorder to gain their support
following changes inGovernment.

3.97    Though the quality at entry was clearly satisfactory, the Bank should have
opposed with greater vigor the Government's decisionto transfer the administrative
responsibility for the local extension offices from the Ministryo f Agriculture to the
Ministry o f Interior. Inpractice this vitiated the ability o f the local extension offices to
carry out ANCA's rapid impact program. The Bank'soverall performance insupport o f
the ASSP Project i s ratedSatisfactory.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE

GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

General Cadastreand Land RegistrationProject
3.98     The Government o f Romania (GOR) was committed to achieving the
development objectives throughout implementation, however the Agency directors and
deputy ministers assigned to the project constantly changed and this made
implementationprogress difficult. Though these changes were sometimes inresponse to
lack o f implementationprogress andunsatisfactory ratings by the Bank team, it i s clear
that implementationwould have been faster and smoother hadthere been more consistent
management and highlevel leadership.

3.99    Inthe first 5 years o fthe project, the Government also failed to achieve atimely
resolution o f implementation issues, especially the need to unifyresponsibilities, the
M&Earrangements initially were inadequate and M&Edata were notreadily available
(or even used) indecisionmaking, while the coordination betweenthe cadastral agency
and the Ministry o f Justice was intermittent and weak.

3.100 Owing to these factors, the Government's performance i s ratedModerately
Satisfactory.

Agricultural SupportServicesProject
3.101 The sequence o f events surrounding implementation o f the ASSP were happily
less dramatic but nonetheless filled with consequence. This project faced two major
hurdles inimplementation. Staff involvement inboth instances helped keep the project
focused on its DOs. The first instance, following project inception, involved very weak
and politicized leadership o f the PMU, whose first incumbent was simply not in
agreement with the ASSP's design andmodalities. Inparticular, this person was more
attuned to preserving MARD's then existing research and extension services (limited
though they were, both innumbersandmotivation as well as capabilities), than to

                                              33


revitalizingthese functions through the project's contracting-out andpartial fee-for-
service features.

3,102 With the appointment of a new and dynamic State Secretary withinMARD in
2001,support for the PMU and the project moved center stage inMARD's program
agenda, and a new, equally dynamic PMUdirector was appointed who quickly managed
to get things moving inthe project's large CGS component.

3.103 However, throughout most of the ASSP's implementationperiod, the rapid impact
extension component administered by ANCA generally lagged. This was due mainly to a
decision by GOR to transfer administrative andbudgeting responsibilities from MARDto
the Ministryo f Interior's line, which effectively placed control over ANCA's regional
offices under Romania's municipal mayors.

3.104 The results were dysbctionalto say the least. It was only in2004, following
repeatedentreaties from the MARDandpressure from the Bank, that the Council of
Ministers decided to transfer line andbudgeting responsibilities back to the MARD. By
the time the ASSP project closed, a fairly rapidturnaround inANCA's extension
outreach activities hadbegun, however the effort begantoo late and was still too limited
for the component to really be labeled a success. On the other hand, the revitalized CGI
following the change inPMU leadershipearlier inthe decade, moved into the advisory
gap causedby ANCA's administrative problems, andbecame as mucha rapid impact
program as it was an applied researchfacility. The results are admirably recorded by
findings from this component's computerized M& E system.

3.105 The Government was highly committed to the project, andwas proactive inthe
preparationprocess. Inparticular, itwas able to get financial support from USAIDto start
project activities before disbursementswere made possible on the Bank loan. All
institutional arrangementso fthe project were inplace and operational before the project
was approved by the Board.

3.106 Inview of the importance of the highly successfulCGS scheme, which accounted
for more than 80 percent ofthe total project investment, the Government's performance
i s ratedSatisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

General Cadastreand Land RegistrationProject
3.107 Instability at the leadership level inthe government was somewhat mitigatedby
the skilledstaffinthe project PMUs, especially the one responsiblefor the general
cadastre. The GOR came to recognize the difficulties of the dual agency model and made
the necessarydecision to mergethe cadastre and landbook offices in2004. This was an
important decision andpolitically quite brave o fthe Ministry of Justice and Ministryof
Administrationand Interior giventhe vested interests involved.

3,108 Followingthe unification of agency responsibilities, The NationalAgency for
Cadastre and Real Estate Publicity (ANCPI) worked hardover final two years o fthe
project to ensure the integration ofthe cadastre and landregistry offices inall 42judets,

                                              34


to integrate the business processes to improve service to customers, to complete the joint
information system, and to complete the project to meet its intended development
objective. After the project closed, ANCPI's program continued using its own resources
andsome government funding, andnow is receiving support as a major component inthe
Bank assisted CESAR project (FY08). Implementing Agency Performance i s therefore
ratedSatisfactory.

Agricultural SupportServicesProject
3.109 Despite its lack o f previous experience with World Bankprojects, MARD
provided a dedicated coordination and oversight o fthe project, andreacted adequately to
the slow start of P M U activities by replacing the key management staff. Throughout the
project life a satisfactory financial management system has been maintained. The PMU
has respected the relevant loan financial covenants, by submittingto the WB quarterly
financial monitoring reports and annual audit reports. All audit reports have been
submittedtimely and all the audit opinions havebeenclean. Overall, the financial
management capacity built throughout the ASSP has been successfully transferred and
scaled up inthe newproject, MAKIS, with the systems, procedures and staffing
satisfactorily used as part o fthe new project's institutional arrangements. Throughout the
project life procurement management was done at satisfactorily level. The Borrower
maintained a good procurement monitoring system and, as most o f contracts were below
prior review threshold, was able to implement project at efficient level and with good
quality. There were no deviations from the Guidelines requirements noticed duringpost-
review. As incase o f financial management, capacity built throughout the ASSP has been
successfully transferred and scaled up for MAKIS, with the systems, procedures and
staffing satisfactorily used as part o fthe new project's institutional arrangements.
Performance i s ratedSatisfactory.

OVERALLBORROWERPERFORMANCE
3.110 Though there were extreme difficulties inthe early years o f the project with
consistency o f management and inter-agency cooperation, the final outcome o f a single,
off-budget agency i s a successful one andto the credit o f the Romanian government for
making the decision to integrate the registry and cadastre. The new Agency - ANCPI -
has worked hardover the final two years o f the project to complete all o f the work and
commit and spend almost half o fthe loan funds. This has been done successfully without
sacrificing quality. Overall the borrower's performance for the GC-LRproject is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.111 Overall borrower performance for the ASSP project is ratedSatisfactory.

nothingdirectly to do with the project. InRomaniathe EUAccession ledto buildingof
commitment towards the project. Itfacilitated the all important restructuring o fthe land
registration systemwhich was a prerequisite for the development o f a landmarket. The
resultant amalgamation of holdings enabledthe commercialization of farming and
allowedfarmers to avail themselves ofthe EUcommonagricultural policy subsidies. The
influence ofthe EUwas indirect, though Romanianofficials agree that beginning in
2002-2003,when the pre-Accession process and harmonization procedures got
underway, a sea change inattitudes amongstthe government's policy advisory bodies
and line administrators occurred. This most sobering realization ledto a muchmore
constructive approach to policy reform, once the promises from Accession becamemore
widely known, and consequences of a failure to reform became increasingly evident.

Lesson2

A key success factor for aviable landadministrationsystem is the establishmentof a
workable institutionalstructure.The experienceof Romaniashows that the single
agency modelandthe creationof a semi-autonomousself financeagency appearsto
work best and this couldhavewider applicabilityinthe CentralandEastEuropean
context.The GC-LP projectexperienced severe problems due to the historic institutional
structure and lack of institutionalcooperation. These were not fully known at the time of
project designandwere only overcome by the establishment of a single agency
responsible for boththe title registration and cadastre. The Romanian situation was
further complicated inthat there was apriorhistory of separateresponsibility for urban
and rural cadastres. This experience suggeststhat where systems are immature and
responsibilities diffusedacross several organizations the adoption of a single agency
structure withinthe early phasesof the project is critical for successful implementation.
Inthe case ofRomania, itwas a combination ofpolitical will onthe partofthe
government, strong support from the Country Director, and soundtechnical advice ofthe
Bankteam that came together to establishthe singleagency.

Lesson3

The buildingof publicconfidenceinthe system and ensuringthe publichas access
to the professionalsupport services (notaries, real estate agents) is necessarynot
only for successfulimplementation,butfor truly achievingthe objectiveof secure
propertymarkets.

InRomaniathere hasbeena significant increaseinthe use ofprofessional servicesbythe
public inlandmarkettransactions. Inmanyregions the notaries are responsible for
managingthe transaction on behalfofthe clients andthis leads to better preparation of
documents, fewer rejections and faster solution of cases. The establishment ofthe unified

                                               36


system, merging the land registrationand cadastre functions, has also improved public
confidence as the public observes better and faster service delivery.

Lesson 4

Projects may place too highexpectations on automation and underestimate the
complexity of large scale IT system development. The project (like many land
administrationprojects) involved the creation o f an information system to manage real
estate records and support transactions across the country. The information system
development component experienced difficulties andwas severely delayed. The original
scope called for a systemto be established intwo institutional structures but exhibit a
large degree o f integration. Simpler i s better and a phased approach to development, with
a first generation system being upgraded later to a more sophisticated one, may be
preferable incountries where ITmanagement is weak and system requirements are
unclear or undecided. Finally, more attention must be paid inboth design and
implementationto buildingsufficient IT andmanagement capacity inthe beneficiary
agencies to manage such large IT systems development, rollout andmaintenance.

Lesson 5

Sustainability needs to be built into project design; and this is largely about human
capacity. Inview o f its highly technical nature, it is highly desirable that leadership o f
the responsible agency be a technically trained person. Similarly, there are real
advantages to assigning program management to a semi-independent and preferably self-
financed agency such as ANCPI. When the legal profession andnumbers of qualified
surveyors inthe country reach a minimumthreshold, the handlingo f major functions
relating bothto mapping as well as registration and titling should be contracted out infull
to privately organized associates and organizations.

AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT

Lesson 6

Farmers and rural business owners will respond enthusiasticallyto innovative
technologies corresponding to their needs. There has to be consultation and a
demand driven element in any serious research and extension endeavor. The
competitive grant approach provedto be an excellent vehicle both for generating applied
research findings and extending these to farmers. Farmer distrustandreluctance to form
associations can be overcome, especially when residents and local influentials (e.g. the
local mayors andpriests) serve as point persons and main advocates. As a result,
stakeholder assumption o f responsibility for financing the on-farm investments and
capitalization o f processing facilities ensued. This contributed considerably to the
sustainability o f the sub-projects, most o f which either remain inoperationtoday or have
been broadened into new areas and lines o f production andmarketing.

Annex A. The CAS Context

Features of the 1997 CAS.The Bank's role and strategy insupport of Romania's economic
development similarly evolved, as reflectedinthe above-noted CAS documents. The 1997 CAS
was established following three years of declining GDP growth, political instability and a
seemingly stalled andfitfultransition.

The CAS document notedthat Romania, through the endo f 1996, had lagged behindmany other
Central European countries inits transition to a market economy, and was failing to capitalize on
the development potential offered by its large market size, naturalresources and well-educated

macroeconomic performance. Poverty also increased sharply - as much as 20 percent of the
labor force. Structuralreforms were slow and shallow, resulting in erratic and unstable

populationwas deemedpoor in 1996, five times that recorded in 1989 when the transition began.
Popular dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reform helpedproduce, following the November
1996 elections, a new Government which withinthree months had announced and initiated an
"ambitious and far-reaching" reform program.

Designedto support reform and govern Bank Group operations inFY98-FY00, the centerpieces
of the CAS aimedto promote the resumption of growth and the reduction o f poverty. The strategy
hadthree broad strands, which are worth recountinghere:

        over the near-term, the Bank Group would provide substantial advice and finance
        for the ambitious reform program launched by the new administration;
        over the medium-term,priority would be given to advice and financing for EU
        accession-relatedsector programs; while
        throughout the CAS period, the Bank Group would expand its development
        assistancemanagementrole inRomania andbroaden and deepenpartnerships
        with the EU, foreign and domestic foundations, privatebusiness andthe NGO
        community.

The detailed aims o fthe Bank Group's financial and advisory assistancewere (not surprisingly)
to promote structural reforms and private sector development. The main supportingvehicles were
three adjustment operations, including an Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL). The
ASALwas to be supported by projectsdesignedto (i)      develop rural financial intermediaries while
the shell of the state-owned BancaAgricola was sold-off to commercial banking interests, (ii)
improve the functioning of the land market inthe wake of a somewhat hasty and ill-prepared land
reform, and (iii) improve marketing channels and raise product standards to EUnorms.

The CAS document notedthat difficulties with earlier Bank financedprojectshad arisen because
the projects were designed and approved inadvance ofthe accompanying policy framework.
Thus the needfor placing a renewed emphasison macroeconomic and sector reforms was
recognized, inorder to provide the right environment for Bank supported investments. Further,
some of the earlier projects had been overloaded with detail and unclear objectives. Inthe future,
project preparation and approval were to be streamlined and kept tightly focused on specific
development objectives.

The 2001 CAS. The internationalfinancial crisis of 1997-98, continuedpolitical instability and
perhaps also an inadequate cohort o f entrepreneurial and administrativetalent quickly vitiated the
reform processwhich the 1997 CAS aimedto support, resultinginthe following rather sobering
assessment in2001:

Annex A                                            40


"The startingpoint for the transitionprocessinRomaniawas, inmanyrespects, more difficult than inother
countries inCentraland EasternEurope.Pre-transitionpoliciesemphasizedself-reliance, which resultedin
excessive focus onheavy industry and large infrastructureprojects.Duringthe 1980s, the rapidrepayment
ofthe US$11billion foreigndebt (20 to 30 per cent ofgross domestic product(GDP)) imposedsevere
strains onthe population, with deep cuts inimportsand awideningofthe technologicalgap. Towards the
end ofthe 1980s the Romanianeconomywas onthe verge of collapse andno attemptsto reformhadyet
beenmade."

Giventhis difficult legacy, the Romanianauthorities duringthe 1990stook a gradualist and
piecemeal approach to reform. The imposition o f hard budget constraints and privatizationo f
state-owned enterprises were significantly delayed. While social concerns were understandable,
this strategy failed to produce sustainable gains ineither economic or social conditions (poverty
increased sharply, with the share o fthe population living below the national poverty line doubling
inthe secondhalfofthe 1990s, from 20 to 41 percent).

The CAS document concluded that "Lack of political will to reform, and constrained institutional
and governance capacity are at the root o f Romania's less-than-satisfactory economic
performance and worsened social conditions." Frequent changes inlegislation, with a strong
reliance on emergency measures and few efforts to buildthe institutional capacity to enforce the
new legislation, or to carry out newresponsibilities; resulted inan instability inthe legal
framework and the delays inbuildingneededadministrative capacity. Bythefin de siecle, nearly
all sectors, including farming and the agribusiness sector were laboring under a very unattractive
business environment, one that discouraged foreign direct investment andprivate sector
development.

The 2001CAS was hopefulthat the reformist program o f another newly elected Government had
identified the right priorities, and that its program would at long last lay the bases for a pragmatic
approach to reforming the economy and raising livingstandardsby improving the quality o f
Government services and creating an attractive business environment.

Important development challenges remained, however, particularly with regard to further
enterprise privatization, reform o f the banking and financial sector, restructuringand deregulation
of the energy sector, fiscal decentralization, land privatization and continuedreform of the
agriculture sector, access to quality education inrural areas, and reform of the pension systemto
ensure sustainability inthe context of an aging population. Cognizant of the limitations of the
broad basedadjustment lendinginstruments featured inthe 1997 CAS, the Bank Group sought to
addressthese challenges inFY02-FY04 with a more balanced and focused mix o f fast disbursing
loans (e.g. PALS)and investment project instruments, IFC and MIGA facilities and enhanced
training and knowledge transfer activities.

The structural change agendawas a primaryfocus for this CAS. Central for the rural economy
were land privatization and agricultural sector reforms. The CAS noted that while land
privatization began early inthe transition process(1991) through the restitution of landusedby
large cooperatives to the former owners, almost two-thirds o fthe land transferred through
restitutionwent to elderly farmers, with the remainder to younger, generally poorer households.
Most farms in2001 (and even today, though less so) are small semi-subsistence unitsof about
two hectares, runby owners with limitedfarming skills and with weak integration into factor and
commodity markets. The CAS emphasizedthat these structural problemswould requirepublic
and private investment inrural marketinginfrastructure, and increased research and extension
aimed at integrating small households into commodity and input markets. Meanwhile, the
privatization o f state farms, which were chronic loss-makers, remaineda critical unfinishedtask.
State owned farmlands continued to tie up substantial portions o f arable land (17 percent inlate
2000) that is the best inthe country. While the agricultural subsidy allocation was improved

Annex A                                           41


through the establishment of an input-voucher scheme, the 2001 CAS recognized that the new
Government's decision to allocate most o fthe budgettransfers to "advanced producers" with no
ceiling on the transfer per beneficiary will benefit primarilylarge landholders.

Pre-Graduation - The 2006 CPA. Technically a Country Partnership Agreement (CPA), the 2006
CAS document was issuedjointly by the Bank and IFC. It's strategic directions were
substantially modified from the broader and more comprehensive strategic agendas o fthe earlier
CASs, inrecognitionthat (i) requisites of Romania's then imminent EUAccession were
                              the
determining the Government's development policy and program objectives, and (ii) sheer   the
volume o f Cohesion and Structural Fundsbeingavailed from the EUinthe form o f pre-accession
support had rapidly become Romania's most important source of official external finance.
Harmonizationof Romania's development policies, programs and legal and regulatory
infrastructure with EUrequirements and the continued implementation o f associated structural
reforms were thus adopted as the guidingprinciple for future Bank Group assistance.
The Government agreedin2006 that assistancefrom the Bank Group under the FY06-FY09 CPA
would initially focus on implementing the unfinishedaccessionagenda, then would be recast
upon Accession to support Romania's post-Accession policy and structural reforms needs as an
EUmemberstate.

Notingthat EUaccessionaspirations have enhanced macroeconomic stability and spurred
renewed Romanian commitment to reforms inrecent years, the economy grew robustly at 4 to 5
percent per year during2000-05, with inflation declining from above 40 percent in2000 to 8.6
percent in2005, the lowest level since the start of transition. Furthermore, structuraland
institutionalreform accelerated duringthe same period. The private sector's share o f GDP has
moved closer to EU-8 levels, with e.g. more than 90 percent of bankingassets beingheldby the
private sector, and a substantial reduction of quasi-fiscal deficits. The independence of the
judiciary had been strengthened. Insum, the prospect o f Accession witnessed a sea-changein
public attitudes towards modernization and vastly strengthened the hands of politicians and
leaders incivil society favoring reform, structural change and less pervasive public sector
intervention andmanagement.

Nonetheless, the Government agreedthat Romania still has to complete the ongoing reform
agenda which it will have to pursueto underpingrowth and improve living standards.The CPA
observes that restructuringof the enterprise sector is by no means complete. Financial
intermediation is still low compared to that o f EU-8. Increasingproductivity inthe agriculture
sector remains a major development challenge. Further improvements inthe business
environment include increasing labor market flexibility and reducing labor taxation., A skills
mismatch with market needs will requirea reorientationof the educational system. Poor
governance and weak institutional capacity continue to be key concerns.

Importantly, the CPA emphasizes that the agricultural sector continues to present a major
development challenge. It made note that 67 percent of the poor continued to reside inrural areas
(though their numbers were falling sharply), and that the 4.8 millionRomanians working in
agriculture (part and full-time) constitute fully 72 percent o fthe agricultural labor force inall EU-
 15 countries combined. However a weak policy framework and the slow pace o f restructuring
(especially o f land) hadresulted in low productivity, thoughthe sector remains potentially quite
competitive given its ample endowment o f arable land and moderate climate.

The CPS was thus constructed onthree pillars: (i)    accelerating structural and institutional reforms
to support sustainable growth; (ii) addressing fiscal vulnerabilities and modernizingthe public
sector; and (iii)targeting poverty reduction and promoting social inclusion. The CPS lists a set of
principles that will govern the choice and design of Banklendingoperations. Key amongst these

Annex A                                          42


is a commitment to flexibility - inprogramemphasis, inchoice of financial instruments and
indeed inthe selection of components -movement towards alignment o f Bank procedures with
country systems.Bankprograms inRomaniawill continue to incorporate elements ofthe Middle
Income Country (MIC) agenda, including reducing project preparation time, accelerating project
completion, and introducingnew products and approaches. With reference to the project being
assessed, this altered modus operandi has already had important (and actually quite beneficial)
influences on the design o f semi-repeaters (discussed below), where a menuo f components
proposed by Bank staffwas revisedat the project identification and pre-appraisal stage following
government consultations.
