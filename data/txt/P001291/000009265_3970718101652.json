"The main objective of the Kiambere\n            Hydroelectric Power Project is to assure a firm source of\n            reliable electricity generating capacity to meet the growth\n            in demand which is expected by 1987 to exceed the\n            capabilities of existing generating facilities.  The project\n            will develop indigenous renewable energy resources and\n            create new job opportunities, particularly during the\n            construction period, and reduce the country's heavy\n            dependence on imported oil.  The main project components\n            are: (i) a rock and earthfill dam (approximately 100 m high\n            with a crest length of about one km), a saddle dam with a\n            concrete-lined spillway, and two diversion tunnels; (ii) an\n            intake, a concrete and steel-lined shaft and a tunnel to\n            connect the reservoir to an underground powerhouse, and a\n            reinforced concrete surge shaft near the downstream end of\n            the tunnel; (iii) an underground powerhouse with two 70 MW\n            vertical turbines, and a short tailrace tunnel; (iv) a\n            220-kV switchyard; (v) 80 km of 220-kV transmission lines to\n            connect the powerhouse to the existing grid; and (vi)\n            consultants' services for detailed design and\n            construction supervision, project team leader, and a panel\n            of experts to advise on civil works."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
