                         communities and local governments in selected pilot sub-watersheds.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All 26 Communes Rurales (CRs) targeted by the project have local development plans that include natural resource management/sustainable land management concerns. Of these
                         CRs, 21 have received financing for their annual investment program (AIP) and the remaining 5 will be financed by the end of the year. The financed AIP’s contain 64 NRM / SLM
                         micro projects totaling USD 1.1 million. Micro-projects financed include rock bunding, communal forest creation/protection, sustainable intensification of bas-fonds, reforestation,
                         improved pasture management.
