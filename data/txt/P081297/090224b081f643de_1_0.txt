                         The development objective of the Project is to reduce land degradation through the integration of SLM practices into the overall development planning process of
                         communities and local governments in selected pilot sub-watersheds.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made steady progress since the last reporting period. The number of micro projects completed has increased from 29 to 109 and the number of hectares under
                         sustainable land management practices has increased from 3,727 to 4,145. Activities to establish the community-based institutions and capacity necessary had been lagging, but are
                         now underway (e.g. sub-watershed management committees have been established, sub-watershed development plans are being prepared, the number of inter-community joint
                         micro-projects to improve sub-watershed management has increased).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A one year extension of the closing date (to December 31, 2014) and a reallocation of grant proceeds (to increase the allocation for community micro-projects and training) will be
                         necessary to reach the PDO target and complete/consolidate the institutional strengthening necessary for sustainability.
