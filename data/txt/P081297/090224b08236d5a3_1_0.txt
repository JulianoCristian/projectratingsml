                         The development objective of the Project is to reduce land degradation through the integration of SLM practices into the overall development planning process of
                         communities and local governments in selected pilot sub-watersheds.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been making solid progress and is poised to reach its development objective. A total of 145 sustainable land management micro-projects have been financed
                         (compared to 29 at the time of the mid-term review in 2012). The number of number of hectares under sustainable land management practices has increased from 3,727 to 9,440
                         (against an end-of-project target of 10,000). Activities to establish the community-based institutions and capacity necessary for sustainability had been lagging, but are now well
