                         The development objective of the Project is to reduce land degradation through the integration of SLM practices into the overall development planning process of
                         communities and local governments in selected pilot sub-watersheds.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last ISR the project has consolidated its performance and has created the conditions for the attainment of its development objective. A total of 169 sustainable land
                         management micro-projects have been financed (compared to only 29 at the time of the mid-term review in 2012). As of September 30, 2014 - three months prior to the closing date
                         - the number of hectares under sustainable land management practices is 9,614 ha (against an end-of-project target of 10,000) translating an attainment of 96% of the target.
                         Activities to establish the community-based institutions and capacity necessary for sustainability have been implemented satisfactorily during this last year of project implementation:
                         (i) five sub-watershed management committees (against a target of 4) have been established and trained; all are functional vis Ã  vis criteria established in the results framework; (ii)

                         sub-watershed action plans have been prepared and are being implemented; and (iii) the percentage of 'Commune Rurales' who have identified and financed joint inter-community
                         joint micro-projects to improve sub-watershed management has increased from 23% to 35% since the previous ISR (against a target of 40%).
