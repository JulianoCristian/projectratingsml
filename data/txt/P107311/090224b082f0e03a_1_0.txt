Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This ISR is prepared on the basis of the findings of two recently conducted implementation support missions in February and May 2015. The project has
 disbursed 99.49% of IDA proceedings. All for project development objective (PDO) have been met, and ten out of sixteen intermediate indicators have
 been achieved. The disbursement deadline is October 30, 2015 and the end of project procedures have been initiated.

         The end of project target for this indicator has been met. The number of participants in training offered by the course has reached 27,223
         participants from district government. However the project monitoring system is not designed to avoid recording multiple participation of the
         same person in different trainings. It is worth noting that additionally, the project training registered 39,000 participants from local
         community councils.

               This indicator has fallen slightly short of the target. Most of the remaining districts that have not yet an operational plan (PESOD) approved
               and disseminated are in the process of concluding the process. The factors that have contributed to the delays in these districts include the
               floods which adversely affected many districts in the center and north regions of the country in early 2015, and the general elections that
               took place in late 2014, which often disrupt the normal administrative functions.

               The target for this indicator has not been met. This indicator is composed of two sub-indicators: (i) number of district councils with 30%
               female representation, and (ii) number of districts that have held two district council meetings annually accordingly to Law. While most
               districts have organized two or more council meetings, only 41 district councils have 30% or more representation of women. The councils
               are elected for a four year mandate, and thus this indicator will only change in the next election.

               Although there are substantial improvements in this indicator since the project started, the target of this end of project indicator has not
               been met. Whereas all districts have closed their financial plans from the end of the financial year, not all districts have been able to enter
               the required information and approval through the e-SISTAFE system. Severe floods at the beginning of 2015, affected the provinces of
               Cabo Del Cado, Zambezia and Tete with major infrastructure damages including electricity outages that lasted for more than a month,
               which were among the districts that had the worst performance.

               The target for this end of project indicator has not been met. There was a significant decrease in the number of districts with an annual
               increase of 10% in revenue collection for the fiscal year 2014. Several factors contributed, including the elections which disrupted revenue
               collection, slow down in the economy due to low commodity price which impacts on local business taxes. Moreover, due to lack of capacity,
               not all districts register all revenue collections in e-SISTAFE.

               While the target for this project indicator has not been met, there is a remarkable progress in the number of districts that submitted their
               financial reports to the Administrative Tribunal , from only 7 in 2010 to 75 by the end of the project. The main reason for the shortcoming of
               this indicator is related to the timely submission of financial statements to the Administrative court. Out of 128 districts, 118 have closed
               their financial statements, 105 districts sent them to the responsible administrative court but only 75 have sent it within the deadline.

               The target for this indicator has not been met. The indicator refers to the number of districts that inform their consultative councils on their
               audit results. This target was ambitious due to lack of a legal mandate for districts to publish the audit results and inform the local
               consultative councils. Although considered a good practice (and was documented as a best practice of the NDPFP) there is no legal
               requirement, hence districts (without clean audit reports) may not want to disclose that information. In addition it should be noted that the
               target cannot be higher than the number of the audit reports. Of the 42 audit reports, 27 were shared.
