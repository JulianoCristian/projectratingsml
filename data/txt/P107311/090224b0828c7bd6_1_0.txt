                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to show sustained improvement since the Mid-Term Review in September 2013 and it is on track to meet its PDO and the targets for the majority of its Key
                         Performance Indicators (KPIs) by Project closure in June 2015. At the time of the mission the targets for the 3 Program KPI’s and those for 12 out of 16 component indicators are
                         being met. Notable progress since the last mission of April 2014 includes the integration of 175 district technicians, and a substantive improvement in the knowledge management

                         component resulting from the hiring of a TA advisor in this area. Most program activities are well underway and no new procurements are envisioned. Based on this improved
                         performance and the current disbursement ratio of 98.3%, the rating for implementation progress is now being upgraded to Satisfactory.
