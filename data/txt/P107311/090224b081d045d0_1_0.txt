                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, project implementation progress is moderately satisfactory, and despite lack of progress in the oversight and knowledge management components, main program activities
                         are underway and likely to meet the end of project targets. Previous challenges derived from the use of country systems have substantially improved. Specifically, during the first half
                         of 2013 solutions were found to some critical procurement and financial management issues linked to the use of country systems which were slowing down disbursements, including:

                         (i) contracts of provincial and central level staff paid by the project received prior review and clearance by the independent control body (Administrative Tribunal – AT), and (ii) The
                         Program Budget was inscribed into e-SISTAFE in a timely manner by the of end January.

                         All project components are rated either Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory, with the exception of the Knowledge Management component, which despite progress in some of its
                         activities, this has not been reflected in the component indicators. The activity that has seen the fastest progress since the last supervision is the roll-out of a National District
                         Performance Monitoring System (SMoDD for its acronym in Portuguese). More than a standalone project monitoring tool, SMoDD was developed into a planning tool for district
                         administrations, but also for provincial and central administrations. In January 2013 the system was migrated to an online platform (eSMoDD), which is now fully functional, with
                         central, provincial and district staff trained in the use of eSMoDD and physical infrastructure (servers) installed at the Ministry of State Administration (MAE).

                         Despite these advancements, some challenges remain, specifically the recruitment of district technical staff financed by the project which has been delayed due to changes in
                         legislation. This and other challenges will be thoroughly reviewed at the project’s Mid-Term Review scheduled to take place in September 2013.
