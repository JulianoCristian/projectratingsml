Decentralized\n            Planning and Finance Project for Mozambique were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            providing support only for capacity building without linking\n            it to monitoring of the delivery of infrastructure and\n            services reduces the Bank\u2019s and partners\u2019 influence in\n            ensuring funds for these purposes are used efficiently and\n            effectively for district development. All development\n            partners supporting decentralization in Mozambique have\n            worked closely together to learn from each other and develop\n            a common approach to decentralization. This resulted in a\n            memorandum of understanding bringing all partners together\n            in support of the national program. This is best practice\n            and has enhanced the effective of assistance for capacity\n            building for local government. However, it must be noted\n            that reaching agreement on an effective approach is itself a\n            time-consuming and challenging process that should not be\n            underestimated. Also, when working through country systems,\n            it may be less cumbersome for development partners to\n            provide their funds bilaterally to the Government. In the\n            future, a more effective approach could be for the\n            government to prepare its national program and ask each\n            development partner to support it using the modality that it\n            preferred. Establishing a multi-donor trust fund at the Bank\n            could be another model that will reduce transactions costs\n            for all."}, "docdt": "2015-12-22T00:12:05Z"}
