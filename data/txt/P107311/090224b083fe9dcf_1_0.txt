1.           Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.1        Context at Appraisal
1.      Country and sector background. Despite sustained high economic growth rates in the
2000s and concomitant reduction in absolute poverty, Mozambique remains a low-income country.
Access to public services is severely limited in many rural areas and human development, although
improving, remains low compared to other countries in southern Africa. To address these
challenges, the Government of Mozambique committed to decentralized planning and finance in
the early 2000s, in particular in its First Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty
(PARPA I, 2001–05) and its 2001 Global Strategy for Public Sector Reform. It reiterated its
commitment for decentralized service delivery in PARPA II (2006–09) that, among other things,
aimed to: (a) accelerate poverty reduction by increasing provision of basic infrastructure and
services in rural areas; (b) increase the transparency, accountability, and quality of public sector
planning and execution to ensure that the resulting investment choices responded to local
preferences and that the projects were implemented efficiently; and (c) raise the efficiency and
effectiveness of the public service.

2.      At the time of appraisal, the decentralization process in Mozambique was however still at
a nascent stage and the Government did not yet have a broader decentralization strategy that was
embedded in the PARPAs I and II. Unlike in countries with British colonial legacies, there was no
strong tradition of local government and local capacity after the peace accord was almost non-
existent. The concept of local governance in Mozambique was based on decentralization under the
municipal framework law of 1997 on the one hand and deconcentration under the law on local
state organs (LOLE) of 2003 on the other. The former established municipalities with locally
elected governments and transferred responsibilities in 33 areas with urban features,2 while the
latter set up 11 provinces and 128 administrative districts3 as deconcentrated entities with
administration appointed by the national government and limited responsibilities. The LOLE
designates the district government as the local state body empowered to carry out the government’s
program and its annual economic and social plan at the local level. The LOLE regulations of 2005
required each district to elaborate, through a participatory process, a five-year strategic and
development plan (PEDD) and its annual operational plan and budget (PESOD). At the time of
appraisal, these were recent requirements for the districts, planning instruments were still limited
in coverage and quality, and most districts had limited capacity to meet the demands.

3.      The LOLE also gave districts the status of ‘budgetary unit.’ As a result, districts became
the recipients of small direct fiscal transfers to support their recurrent and investment budgets and
deconcentrated sector funds for the first time in 2006, replacing the previous discretionary
allocation of funds by provinces. In order to ensure that districts received and used the funds as
intended, the Government also started rolling out a computerized public financial system (e-
SISTAFE) to all districts at the time of appraisal. As Mozambique pursued decentralization
through deconcentration of resources and competencies, the districts were becoming an
increasingly important government sphere, but with low capacity to fulfill their core functions.

																																																								
2		   The elections of 1999 allowed for the first time elected municipal governments as part of the reform to provide representative
government and to promote the decentralization of political authority. In 2008, the municipalities were expanded to 43.
3 In 2013, 22 new districts were created.



                                                                 1
	
4.       Rationale for World Bank involvement. The World Bank and other development partners
had been supporting the government’s decentralization and local government capacity program
since the late 1990s, but the initiatives were scattered across the country and followed different
approaches. The Bank-financed Decentralized Planning and Finance Project (DPFP-Centro, 2004-
2009) supported decentralized service delivery in four provinces in central Mozambique4 building
on the experience of a decentralized planning and finance pilot in Nampula Province funded by
the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), and the Netherlands, while other development partners were assisting
decentralization capacity building in other provinces5. Encouraged by the success of these
initiatives, the government requested the Bank and development partners in March 2008 to finance
its National Decentralized Planning and Finance Program (NDPFP), which would scale up the
decentralization approach to cover all districts in the country. In addition, it was intended to
complement the ten-year Bank-financed public sector reform program that had started in 2003, by
focusing on technical assistance and capacity building of local governments. The program was
designed as a single strategy based on harmonization of the experiences and methodologies made
under the preceding programs. The Government and other development partners considered the
Bank a key partner, as it brought global experience with public sector reform, decentralization,
local governance, participatory planning, and accountability, as well as substantial financial
resources to support these processes in Mozambique. In addition, the Bank was well placed to
take a leading role in the process given its broad engagement with multiple line ministries and
relevant governmental agencies at central level, but also to coordinate and support cross-cutting
sectoral participation at provincial and district levels.

5.      Contribution to higher-level objectives. The project was a central element of the Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mozambique for 2008–11, discussed by the World Bank’s
Board of Directors on May 22, 2007. It contributed in particular to its pillar on increasing
accountability and public voice, by supporting the formation and operation of district consultative
councils and the participatory planning and budgeting processes in which they were involved. It
also strengthened district financial management systems, procurement, internal control
mechanisms, and external audit capabilities. Finally, it helped to improve government information
and communication systems by establishing a rigorous district performance monitoring system,
demanding public posting of the annual report of execution of PESODs, and by promoting
identification and dissemination of good practices in district administration.

1.2          Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators
6.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve the capacity of local
government to manage public financial resources for district development in a participatory and
transparent manner.

7.           The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) specified three key performance indicators:

																																																								
4	Zambézia,        Sofala, Tête, and Manica, which had a total of 49 districts.	
5 UNDP and UNCDF, with support from Ireland, Netherlands, Norway and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), were
financing the implementation of the DPFP-Norte in the provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado. The German Society for
International Development (GIZ) was supporting several district-focused capacity building projects in the provinces of Inhambane,
Manica, and Sofala.

                                                                 2
	
                     Districts with more than 90 percent budget execution of their district operational plan
                      and budget (PESOD) (number)
                     Districts with annual PESOD execution report publicly displayed and discussed by
                      district councils in accordance with guidelines (number)
                     Districts that report on district performance in decentralized planning and finance
                      through the district performance monitoring system (SMPD) (number).

8.     A table in annex 3 of the PAD provided further information on the project’s monitoring
framework, including intermediate outcome indicators, baseline and target values, and sources of
information to track progress towards outputs and outcomes.

1.3          Revised PDO and Key Indicators
9.      The project’s PDO was not revised. However, shortly after the project was approved, the
Bank’s core indicator “direct project beneficiaries (number), percent female” was added as a PDO-
level indicator to the results framework. A restructuring approved in January 2014 revised the
results framework again: Three of the intermediate level indicators were reworded for clarity to
reflect changes in legislation during project implementation. In addition, the baselines for several
intermediate results indicators, which had originally been based on a sample of only 32 districts,
were revised to reflect more complete information arising from the rollout of the district
performance monitoring system. Finally, 2014 targets for eight intermediate results indicators were
replaced with 2013 targets to formalize a decision taken during the implementation support
mission in August 2011 due to the nine-month delay at the start of the project. No changes were
made during the restructuring with respect to the PDO level indicators.

1.4          Main Project Beneficiaries

10.     The PAD specified as the primary target beneficiaries the civil servants at provincial and
district levels who would gain from opportunities to upgrade skills and improved working
conditions. It noted that central government officials from participating ministries and agencies
would also benefit from training and technical assistance provided under the project. The PAD
noted that the ultimate beneficiaries of the project were the residents of rural communities who
would enjoy better access to basic infrastructure and services.

15.          Original Components

11.     The project comprised seven components: (1) improving national support systems, (2)
strengthening participatory planning and budgeting, (3) enhancing management and
implementation capacity, (4) strengthening oversight and accountability, (5) knowledge
management, (6) effective project management and coordination, (7) activities funded outside of
the Common Fund.6


																																																								
6    Financing for components 1 to 6 was pooled in a Common Fund that went into a national treasury account (Conta Unica de
Tesouro) managed by the MPD. The co-financiers that pooled their financing in this Common Fund were IDA, Switzerland, Ireland,
and the Netherlands and are also referred to as Common Fund Partners. In contrast, GIZ and UNDP, the Non-Common Fund
Partners, financed activities under component 7 through in-kind contributions and cash contributions.

                                                              3
	
12.     Component 1: Improving national support systems (US$3.9 million, of which
International Development Association (IDA) US$3.2 million). This component financed
technical assistance at the central and provincial levels to strengthen national systems in support
of decentralized planning and finance and the integration of local planning processes into the
national planning cycle. It also supported studies and technical assistance to inform the policy
dialogue and the development of policy and legal instruments. It assisted with preparation of
methodologies, guidelines, manuals, and the system for monitoring and evaluation of district
planning and finance processes. Finally, it supported the development of training programs,
curricula, and the training of trainers aimed at strengthening the core processes at the district level.
13.      Component 2: Strengthening participatory planning and budgeting (US$13.2 million,
of which IDA US$10.4 million). This component financed training and technical assistance to help
districts prepare high-quality five-year district strategic development plans (PEDDs) and the
annual PESODs and budgets. It financed training and facilitation of the consultative councils to
enable them to participate effectively in the district planning and budgeting process.

14.     Component 3: Enhancing management and implementation capacity (US$11.6
million, of which IDA US$9.2 million). This component financed training and technical assistance
in core elements of public administration, including financial management, own-source revenue
collection, procurement, contract management, compliance with environmental and safeguards,
and operations and maintenance. It also supported the implementation of the national system of
monitoring and evaluation at the local level. This component further supported the integration of
training modules and manuals on preventing and treating HIV/AIDS as part of the district and
provincial planning process.

15.     Component 4: Strengthening oversight and accountability (US$0.4 million, of which
IDA US$0.3 million). This component financed experts and equipment to enhance the capacity
of the provincial inspectorates and the Administrative Tribunal to carry out inspections and audits
in provinces and districts. It also supported training and technical assistance to strengthen the
internal control system in provinces and districts. Further, it supported the preparation and
dissemination of materials to raise awareness of communities of the district plans, financial reports,
and audit and inspection findings. Finally, it supported meetings, peer-learning opportunities, and
training workshops for representatives of the inspection and audit agencies involved with district
audits and accountability.

16.     Component 5: Knowledge management (US$0.5 million, of which IDA US$0.4
million). This component financed technical assistance to identify good practices, to prepare
knowledge material, and to disseminate the knowledge through measures such as good practice
notes, a website, case studies, use of other ICT options (such as, radio) and peer review
mechanisms. The aim was to ensure that the development of national policies and strategies was
increasingly based on tried and tested practices and accumulated knowledge at the local level.

17.    Component 6: Effective project management and coordination (US$4.8 million, of
which IDA US$3.9 million). This component financed technical assistance to strengthen the
capacity of the decentralized planning department within the Ministry of Planning and



                                                   4
	
Development (MPD).7 Since it was a new department, long-term technical advisors were needed
to strengthen its capacity to plan and manage the project and effectively monitor and evaluate
implementation and results. This component also supported activities to coordinate key sector
ministries in their management and participation in the project.

18.    Component 7: Activities funded outside of the Common Fund (non-IDA US$8.6 million).
This component supports technical assistants to build capacity building in selected provinces for
decentralized planning and finance at the provincial and district levels. The activities under this
component were intended to be fully integrated into the work program and budget of the NDPFP.

1.6          Revised Components

19.          The components were not revised.

1.7          Other Significant Project Changes

20.    There were no significant changes in the project’s design, scope and scale, implementation
arrangements, schedule, or funding allocations, but the Financing Agreement was amended twice.
The first amendment of December 21, 2010 allowed the implementing agency six additional
months to meet three dated covenants.8 The second amendment of July 19, 2012 offered the
implementing agency additional time to meet three additional dated covenants.9

2.           Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1          Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

21.     Soundness of background analysis. The design of the NDPFP was based on robust
background analysis that incorporated lessons learned from the implementation of the DPFP-
Centro and two similar district government support initiatives financed by other development
partners10. Strengthening government systems to sustain capacity built under the project was
recognized as key by embedding the project implementation unit within the government structure
and supporting it by advisors who transferred knowledge and skills to government staff. The
project also financed technical experts at provincial level to train provincial and district officials,
who in turn trained others, and drew upon government training institutes and sector ministries to
provide specialized training in their respective technical areas. In addition, it recruited new
graduates with scarce technical skills under Bank-financed contracts while they were undergoing
the lengthy vetting process required to become a civil servant, which had proven as an effective
																																																								
7     With the appointment of the new government in January 2015, the former Ministry of Finance and the MPD were merged into
the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) that was then the main implementing agency for the project. For ease of readability,
this document refers to MPD with the implicit understanding that it also refers to MEF for activities after January 2015.
8 The amendment extended the deadline from December 31, 2010, to June 30, 2011, for preparing (a) a district-level infrastructure

operations and maintenance strategy, (b) district-level core manuals, and (c) district-level safeguards frameworks.
9 The amendment extended the deadline (a) from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to prepare an evaluation of the application

by districts of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Management Framework, (b) from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013
to prepare the first study of community participation in the district planning processes and from December 31, 2014 to May 1, 2015
to prepare the second; and (c) from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013 to prepare an evaluation of the impact of technical assistance
under the project.

approach to increase district capacity quickly. The project also helped strengthen government
systems by providing funding directly to subnational implementing entities based on approved
annual work and procurement plans, and involving communities in the annual planning processes
to ensure that chosen projects reflected their priorities. It also promoted accountability and
transparency by strengthening internal and external audit functions, establishing a robust district
performance monitoring system, and supporting the preparation and dissemination of annual
progress reports.

22.      Coordination among donors. Responding to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness
and the Accra Agenda for Action, a key element of the project design was the integration of all
development partner-funded initiatives to support decentralization into a single national program,
underpinned by a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the partners and the government
that laid out the roles and responsibilities of each party. The Bank’s previous experience in working
in partnership with other development partners was key to establish an adequate coordination
framework. However, it should also be noted that harmonizing the agendas of multiple donors
required considerable time. Reaching agreement on the MOU took nearly two years, which
prolonged project preparation.

23.     Lack of indicators to measure outcomes of participatory process. A key element of
the preceding DPFP-Centro was the provision of grants to districts for the implementation of small
rural infrastructure investments that were consistent with specified criteria and included in
approved district development plans. This design feature allowed to assess whether projects funded
were the priorities of the communities as identified through the participatory planning process,
were executed efficiently and effectively, and were delivering the intended services. The same
approach was initially also under discussion for the NDPFP but ultimately discarded due to a shift
in policy regarding intergovernmental transfers.11 While this decision was valid at the time, it
would still have been important to include in the project design tools or indicators to assess the
outcomes of the participatory planning process and public financial management systems that the
project strengthened. The disconnect between the participatory planning process and its
effectiveness to improve local service delivery could have been remediated by monitoring the use
of public infrastructure investments funds transferred to districts, conducting beneficiary surveys
or more in-depth reviews of annual reports from the districts.

24.     Usefulness of dated covenants. The Financing Agreement (FA) included ten dated
covenants intended to ensure that the project met its objectives. Some of the covenants were useful,
but many were not. The studies included as covenants could have been included in the project’s
annual work plan and procurement plan, which would have provided for greater flexibility in their
execution. The deadlines for nearly all the studies were ultimately extended through amendments
to the FA. A covenant relating to incorporation Bank-financed technical assistants into the civil
services payroll was not enforceable as written, as the district governments are not required to
incorporate consultants who are not a good fit. Instead of a covenant, the Bank could have stated


																																																								
11 During project preparation, the Government was reforming its policy for	budget	transfers to districts shifting	from	a	focus	on	
public	infrastructure	investments	to	an	emphasis	on	providing lines of credit for private	investments managed by districts to	
support	income‐generating	activities. The latter	would	have	been	more	difficult	to	monitor	and	potentially	more	vulnerable	
to	misuse.	

                                                               6
	
it would finance such contracts for only two years, and encouraged their incorporating in the civil
service payroll through dialogue.

25.     Assessment of risks. The document generally foresaw the risks that the project would face
and identified adequate mitigation measures, although it includes two risks the realization of which
were not tracked under the project, so there is no way to know whether the mitigation measures
specified in the PAD were effective. These were (a) corruption at the local level increases with
the provision of funds for income generating activities, and (b) the timeframe is too short to see
comprehensive improvement in planning and budgeting, especially for operations and
maintenance, at the local level. Both risks were judged high before mitigation but moderate
afterwards.

26.        In summary, the design was moderately appropriate to meet the project’s objectives.

2.2        Implementation

27.     Role of Administrative Tribunal. The involvement of the Administrative Tribunal (AT)
in approving contracts contributed to an initial delay of project implementation by 15 months.
Despite an agreement that Bank procurement guidelines apply (captured in both the FA and the
MOU) and an exemption provided by the Ministry of Finance in September 2010, the AT insisted
that the procurement under the Common Fund must adhere to the government’s regulations, which
require all proposed contracts to be submitted to the AT for review and approval prior to signing
(“visto”). The Bank and other Common Fund partners worked with MPD to resolve the issue.
However, it was not until January 2012 that the first contracts with the technical advisors for the
project were signed after having received the AT approval; and it took another year until the
approvals for all 59 contracts were obtained after several rounds of resubmission of documentation
to the AT. While technical advisors with contracts in provinces under Non-Common Fund partners
had been able to work from the start of the project, implementation of the full project only started
in earnest with the approval of the last contracts in early 2013, almost halfway through its
implementation period.12 	

28.           Use of country financial management systems. While the use of Mozambique’s own
financial management systems under the project was important to strengthen government systems,
it also contributed to delays in implementation. Delays in the initial inscription of the project in
the government’s electronic budgeting system e-SISTAFE meant that payments from the project
account could not be made until May 2011, 10 months after effectiveness. This delayed
procurement of consultants to undertake various studies, which led to the request of the MPD to
amend the FA to extend the due dates of several of the studies (legal covenants). A similar delay
occurred the following year, and payments could not be made until April 2012. The partners
proposed several measures to eliminate the delays and ensure program harmonization with the
state planning and budget cycle. These included: (a) using the same data for the e-SISTAFE
programming and execution modules, and (b) advancing the presentation of the draft annual work
plan and budget to the third quarter of the year, from the fourth quarter. By late 2012, the issue
had been resolved, and the annual work plans and budgets for 2013 had been loaded into the e-
SISTAFE on time, making funds available by mid-January 2013. Another challenge related to the
																																																								
12   These were Inhambane, Manica, and Sofala (under GIZ) and Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and Gaza (under UNDP).

                                                            7
	
use of e-SISTAFE were temporary liquidity problems at the district level throughout
implementation, in particular in those districts where e-SISTAFE only became fully operational
during the course of the project.

29.     Government ownership. A critical factor that helped to resolve issues and keep
implementation on track was the MPD’s strong ownership of the project. As noted above, the
ministry led in the efforts to find solutions to the challenges presented by the requirements that the
AT approve all contracts. The MPD also assigned experienced and well-qualified staff to the
Directorate of National Planning, including its head and specialists in procurement, financial
management, engineering, and monitoring and evaluation, who were responsible for project
implementation. The head of the Directorate sought and implemented advice on ways to improve
its overall performance.

30.      Technical advisers. Another important factor that assisted implementation was the
experienced team of technical advisors that supported the Directorate of National Planning in
coordinating the project and helped build capacity at all levels of government. They included many
of the people who had already supported the DPFP-Centro, DPFP-Norte, and PRODER. Despite
the initial delays in contracting, and the uncertainty that this had provided, they remained with the
project until its conclusion. On the other hand, the project faced difficulties in identifying qualified
staff to fill key advisory positions at the provincial level, particularly experts in district finances.
Contracts under the Common Fund for advisors to work in the provinces of Niassa, Tête,
Zambezia, and Maputo were filled in January 2012. Positions for district finance experts in some
other provinces were never filled.

31.    Donor coordination. The NDPFP partners’ working group was critical in bringing all
partners together in support of the national program. During implementation, it was coordinated
by several development partners (first the Netherlands, then the World Bank, Ireland, and finally
the GIZ) who were in charge of organizing regular NDPFP partners meetings to ensure that all
Common Fund and non-Common Fund partners effectively communicated and coordinated with
each other. The coordinating development partner also assumed the leading role in officially
communicating NDPFP related issues with the government. The Bank took the lead in organizing
the implementation support missions and tracking progress in aide memoires throughout
implementation.

32.     Midterm Review. The midterm review, which took place in September 2013, a year later
than initially planned due to the start-up challenges of the project, was thorough and proposed
some actions to improve implementation performance. It was enriched by three studies associated
with dated covenants: (a) an evaluation of the impact of technical assistance provided by the project,
(b) a study of the measures taken by district governments to ensure community participation in the
planning process, and (c) an evaluation of the implementation of the Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF). It was further informed by two program assessments prepared by
the Directorate of National Planning and an independent consultant firm. The midterm review
confirmed the overall relevance of the project, its objectives and key performance indicators,
design, activities, budget, and project management arrangements. It recommended that the
government should hire a senior technical advisor for community participation to build the
capacity of the provinces and districts to facilitate engagement of communities in planning and
oversight. It also noted a need for the technical advisors to more effectively transfer knowledge
                                                   8
	
and skills to government staff, and to include this aspect in their evaluations. Further, it advised
the implementing agencies to prepare sustainability/transition plans laying out how they will take
over the responsibilities and tasks then being handled by the technical assistants.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation
33.     Design. The results framework was complete, with PDO and intermediate results
indicators covering the core areas of district administration that the project supported, and with
baseline and target values. All participating government entities, the Bank, and development
partners reviewed and finalized the results framework during a workshop held in June 2009, which
ensured that it reflected outcomes and outputs that all stakeholders were committed to achieving.
The three original PDO outcome indicators were designed to allow assessment of the improvement
in district capacity to manage public resources for district development in a participatory and
transparent manner. However, the omission of any indicators on the execution of infrastructure
projects included in the PESOD or on beneficiary satisfaction more broadly made it impossible to
know if projects that were implemented reflect the priorities of the communities, were executed
efficiently and effectively, are being operated and maintained, and are delivering the intended
services. The PDO indicator “number of districts that execute at least 90 percent of their budget”
does not provide this information, because much of the budget is provided to groups for income-
generating activities, staff salaries, and operating costs.

34.     Most of the intermediate outcome indicators were appropriate for tracking improvements
in district capacity, but some were poorly specified and did not permit full assessment of
achievements. For example, the indicator on the “annual increase of at least 10 percent in local
revenue collection” measures the increase over the previous year only. A cumulative indicator
would have allowed the observation of overall trends in revenue mobilization by districts over the
five-year implementation period of the project. This indicator could have been revised during the
MTR, but was not. Another example of an indicator with limited value is the one on the “number
of districts that inform their local consultative councils about the results of internal and external
control exercises”. Although this is considered best practice, there is no legal mandate for districts
to publish audit results and incentives for districts to do so are lacking. Finally, the use of
indicators to measure compliance (yes/no) limits the possibility of analyzing any significant
achievements and trends at district level over time.

35.      Following the midterm review, the baselines and targets for some outcome indicators were
revised. Baselines in the results framework of the PAD reflected information from a sample of 33
districts and were revised to reflect more complete data collected through the District Development
Monitoring System (SMoDD) during its rollout. In addition, most targets originally intended for
2013 were shifted to 2014 due to the delay in project start-up. Three intermediate outcome
indicators were reworded for clarity. These changes were formalized through a level 2
restructuring approved on January 14, 2014.

36.    Implementation. Tracking of most indicators was to be done through the SMoDD that
was being rolled out under the project. Data during the early years of implementation hence came
from a subset of districts, which were taken as representative. It was only by 2013 when the
SMoDD was rolled out to all 128 districts that good quality and comparable data were collected
and reported in annual monitoring reports. The establishment and use of the SMoDD in all districts

                                                  9
	
is one of the project’s most notable achievements. Districts are required to use the SMoDD to
report on performance in the full range of areas related to district administration (such as budgets
and expenditures), economic activity (agricultural output, number of new business licenses
approved), services (including health and education), and infrastructure development (construction
of housing and water points). Districts were generally reporting on their performance through the
SMoDD, using appropriate data collection methods to ensure comparability across districts. The
data from the SMoDD are used to generate the districts’ annual reports on the execution of their
PESODs. Without such a system, collecting adequate quality information across 128 districts
covering the entire country would not have been possible. Information on issues not covered in
the SMoDD, such as the number of external audits carried out on district financial reports and the
gross number of participants in training, came directly from the institutions providing the service.
The Bank team reported on the development of the SMoDD and on the value of the indicators in
each aide memoire, noting progress and continuing challenges.

37.     Utilization. The national government and the provinces use the information in PESOD
execution reports to understand which districts are doing well and which need additional support.
Indeed, the president uses the information from the SMoDD when he travels to districts. The
development partners and the program’s supervisory committee—comprising representatives of
the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of State Administration, Ministry of Public Works and Housing,
Ministry of Environment, and Ministry of Public Service, the AT, as well as provincial and district
governments—met three times a year to review the program’s implementation progress and results
and to agree on the plans for the next year’s activities. One of these meetings focused on the mid-
year progress report, one on the annual report, and one on the program’s audit report and mid-year
financial report. Participants received the reports at least ten working days prior to the meeting to
allow them to identify issues for discussion and action. District administrations provided both the
provincial administrations and their consultative councils with their annual reports for review and
discussion. Both provide feedback on performance and proposed measures for improvement in
the coming year.

2.4    Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

38.      The project was classified appropriately as safeguards category C and did not trigger any
of the Bank’s safeguard policies, as it did not finance any infrastructure works. However, legal
covenants required the government to: (a) update the ESMF and the resettlement policy framework
prepared for the DPFP-Centro to ensure that investments made with district budgets were carried
out in an environmentally and socially sound manner, and (b) assess the extent to which the
districts effectively used the frameworks when undertaking infrastructure investments. The
Ministry of Environment led the work updating the frameworks (completed by June 30, 2011) and
encouraging the districts to adopt them. It also provided training to key district staff. The
assessment prepared for discussion during the midterm review showed that most district works are
very small and unlikely to result in environmental damage. However, the study also found that
district administrations have limited knowledge of the relevant regulations and frameworks, and
little capacity to implement them with technical rigor. Building capacity in this area requires
focused attention in the future.




                                                 10
	
39.     Implementing agencies generally complied with the Bank’s fiduciary policies. The project
was one of the first stand-alone Bank-financed projects in Mozambique to pioneer the full use of
the country’s financial management systems, particularly the government’s budgeting, single
treasury account, civil servants, the government’s integrated financial management information
system, e-SISTAFE, and the supreme audit institution, the AT. Audited interim financial reports
were submitted on time and were of satisfactory quality. Although the first audit report for the
project was submitted nearly two months after the deadline of June 30, the audits for the
subsequent years were submitted on time. However, the audit reports identified some ineligible
expenditures, which were reimbursed. The issues included: (a) payments without complete
supporting documents (for example, invoices and trip reports), (b) payment of fees to personnel
whose contracts had not been approved by the AT, and (c) payment of travel expenses and per
diems without adequate evidence of attendance at workshops (lists of participants). Financial
management was rated moderately satisfactory during most of project implementation, including
at closing.

40.     The MPD was responsible for procuring the major consultancies and goods under the
project. It generally complied with the Bank’s procurement procedures, although with some delays
in the early years of implementation due to the involvement of the AT in reviewing and approving
contracts. Procurement was rated moderately satisfactory during the first three years of
implementation. The rating was raised to satisfactory in the July 2013 implementation status
report, reflecting the satisfactory findings of a post-procurement review. Nearly all planned
contracts had been procured by the time of the midterm review, and procurement was rated
satisfactory for the rest of the project life.

2.5          Post-completion Operation and Next Phase

41.      The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)13, the Bank and other development partners
only started discussions regarding a possible follow-on project in early 2015 and NDPFP closed
without a phase-out strategy, raising serious concerns about how the technical assistance to the
districts will continue in the short term. In the absence of a clearly defined common strategy at
closing, some development partners decided to continue providing support bilaterally. Both UNDP
and GIZ will continue to finance the contracts of the technical advisors in the provinces for which
they have provided long-term support. UNDP is also financing a knowledge management advisor
based at the MEF. GIZ is implementing a technical cooperation program to strengthen financial
management capacities of districts and municipalities in the provinces for which they have been
providing long-term support. In addition to the advisors in the provinces, the program includes
advisors at the national level in the Ministry of Public Works, AT, the Ministry of State
Administration and Civil Service (MAEFP), and for internal control institutions.

42.     In the medium-term, the MEF aims to bring together donor efforts to support a new national
program that would work with provinces, districts, and municipalities. According to the concept
note that the MEF has started to prepare the future program would focus on: (a) broadening the
SMoDD by including indicators that cover all government programs at the district level; (b)
fostering greater integration of local plans and budgets (PEDDs and PESODs); and (c) enhancing
																																																								
13	With
      the appointment of the new government in January 2015, the former Ministry of Finance and MPD were merged into
MEF that was the implementing agency from then on. 	

                                                           11
	
own source revenues and strengthening of internal control functions. At the central level, policy
areas and priorities for the period of 2016–2020 envisage overall implementation support of the
National Decentralization Strategy.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory

43.      Objectives. The objectives of the NDPFP were and remain relevant. They reflect the
importance of institutional strengthening, capacity building, and systems development at the
district, provincial, and central levels to effectively deliver services and infrastructure to widely
dispersed rural populations and support districts to serve as growth poles. The NDPFP promoted
accountability and public participation at government’s lowest levels through support for the
establishment and operation of district consultative councils (which comprise representatives of
the administrative posts, localities, and local forums) and through assistance for improved planning
and budgeting, internal and external control, fiduciary management, contract management, and
monitoring and evaluation at all levels of government. Building on achievements and lessons learnt
from predecessor projects, it also supported the better integration of district planning and
budgeting into the national systems and the scaling-up, institutionalization, and mainstreaming of
best practices. The objectives of NDPFP were consistent with those of Mozambique’s PARPA I
(2001–05), PARPA II (2006–09), and PARPA III (2011–14), all of which aimed to reduce poverty
by increasing provision of basic infrastructure and services in rural areas, and increasing the
transparency, accountability, and quality of public sector planning and execution to ensure that the
resulting investment choices responded to local preferences and that they were implemented
efficiently. The objectives of NDPFP also remain relevant for the strategic priorities set out in the
Government’s new five-year plan (Plano Quinquenal do Governo) for 2015–2019 that replaced
the PARPA as the main poverty strategy document. The project remained a key aspect of the
Bank’s CPS for 2012–15. By helping to improve the capacity of district governments to carry out
their mandates, it specifically contributed to the CPS pillar on governance and public sector
capacity building.

44.     Design. The design remains moderately relevant. The NDPFP was the first country-wide
approach to systematically support district capacity using country systems and also successfully
brought together several development partners under a common funding mechanism. Responding
to the country’s incipient decentralization and limited responsibilities of deconcentrated entities,
the project focused on strengthening provincial and district governments to fulfill their mandates
in relation to core functions in public financial management, participatory planning, and
transparency. However, the relevance of the design to build capacity and bring about institutional
change could have been improved by more closely linking the technical assistance to the
investment funds transferred to districts from the central government. This or the inclusion of other
tools, such as beneficiary surveys, would also have allowed to assess whether: (a) the infrastructure
projects undertaken by districts were in line with community priorities, (b) contracts were procured
in accordance with government regulations, (c) works were executed efficiently and in compliance



                                                 12
	
with the government’s safeguard policies, and (d) works are being operated, maintained, and
delivering services.

45.     Other aspects of the design remain appropriate to build capacity of provincial and district
governments to manage public financial resources for district development in a participatory and
transparent manner. This experience showed the importance of: (a) working through and
strengthening country systems, rather than creating parallel structures for project implementation;
(b) bringing all development partners together in support of a national program, (c) using a variety
of approaches to build capacity (technical assistance to provide hands-on guidance in specific
areas, training, and provision of office equipment and vehicles); and (d) maintaining a focus on
community participation.

46.     Implementation. Implementation arrangements were relevant. Implementation largely
took place through country and local government systems. The MPD (later MEF) continued in its
role as the main project-implementing agency, which smoothed implementation. Despite adding
to the complexity of the project, the inclusion of various line ministries, the AT, and the provinces
as implementing agencies was necessary to ensure that they are able to play their roles in
supporting districts. The supervisory and coordination arrangements were appropriate. The
supervisory committee, which was responsible for the overall strategic direction of the project and
its oversight, comprised representatives of all the implementing agencies, including the ministries
of finance, state administration, public works and housing, environment, public service, and the
AT, as well as the provincial and district governments. It met with the development partners three
times a year to review implementation progress and achievement of results, and to discuss and
agree on the activities for the coming year. A technical group, comprising technical officers from
the implementing agencies provided technical input on policy and methodological issues, work
plans, budgets, progress reports, and the like. A partners’ group, comprising all development
partners supporting the NDPFP, met four times a year to review project implementation progress,
discuss challenges and possible solutions to them, propose topics for discussion at the supervisory
committee meetings, and ensure overall harmonization of partners’ approaches and positions.

47.      Implementation arrangements at the provincial and district levels were also relevant. In
each province, the provincial directors of planning and finance were responsible for day-to-day
management of the project. This was appropriate, given their role as coordinators of line ministry
activities in the province. District administrators were responsible for implementation of activities
at district level, under the guidance of the provincial directors. Provincial supervisory committees
(CdSP), with membership mirroring that of the central supervisory committee, was responsible for
providing oversight of implementation at the provincial level, reviewing progress of districts
towards results, and endorsing district’s project related annual work plans and budgets. However,
performance of the CdSP varied across provinces with different degrees of ownership to support
the program. Provincial technical teams comprised technical staff of the implementing agencies
participating in the project at the provincial level, and had responsibilities similar to those of the
central technical teams. Arrangements for coordinating activities between provincial and district
levels worked reasonably well. The project financed advisors attached to the provincial project
coordinating units to support districts in financial management, works supervision, participatory
planning, management of training, and monitoring and evaluation.

3.2         Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48.      Overall, the NDPFP achieved its objective to improve the capacity of local government to
manage public financial resources for district development in a participatory and transparent
manner. In many areas, the project achieved or over-achieved what it set out to do, and, in general,
districts across the country are now more capable of participatory planning and budgeting,
financial management, procurement, and monitoring and reporting than they were prior to the start
of the project. By the end of the project, all districts were using the computerized SMoDD to report
on achievements across a range of areas, including progress in executing their PESODs. Some
116 districts were making available to the public their annual PESOD execution reports and
presenting the highlights to meetings of the consultative councils for discussion. A slightly smaller
number of districts, 110, were executing 90 percent of their budgets, up from 85 districts at
baseline. The project also contributed to better compliance with the regulations on financial
management at district level more broadly. In addition, over 27,200 local government staff and
39,000 members of consultative councils benefited from training provided under the project,
enhancing skills in core areas of district administration; and 515 school graduates were integrated
in the local government civil service. The promotion of community participation in planning and
budgeting and oversight was another key achievement of the project. According to the project’s
review of participation, citizen engagement improved substantially under the project. In newly
participating districts, formal approaches to citizen engagement were undertaken for the first time.
These included organizing councils at three levels of administration that included diverse
stakeholders (youth, seniors, women, disabled) and convening two meetings a year, one to agree
on priority investments and another to review execution of the previous year’s plans. Districts that
had participated in the preceding DPFP-Centro, DPFP-Norte and PRODER further strengthened
and institutionalized these processes.

49.    All the PDO outcome targets and most of the intermediate results were achieved.
Specifically:

         Some 110 districts (100 percent of target) out of 128 districts14 executed more than 90
          percent of the budget presented in their PESODs. This is a meaningful improvement
          from the baseline value of 85 and meets the end of project target. A total of 119 districts
          executed at least 80 percent of their budget and 122 executed at least 70 percent. The districts
          receive funds from the central government and from line ministries, much of which are
          earmarked for specific activities and for salaries of staff based in districts. The districts’
          funds and expenditures are recorded in the e-SISTAFE, so performance in executing the
          budget is carefully tracked.

         Some 116 districts (101 percent of target) out of 128 districts prepared an annual
          PESOD execution report, made it available to the public, and presented the report to
          the district councils in accordance with the guidelines. This is up from zero at the start of
          the start of the project and is slightly greater than the target of 115. The PESOD execution
          report is comprehensive, covering all activities undertaken in the district during the year,
																																																								
14   At project appraisal Mozambique had 128 districts, but in 2013 22 new districts were created.

                                                                 14
	
      including health and education services, agricultural production, business activity,
      construction of housing, district infrastructure, and others. It provides a very useful
      assessment of districts achievements and challenges faced.

     All 128 districts (100 percent of target) covered by the project reported on district
      performance in decentralized planning and finance through the district performance
      monitoring system (previously known as SMPD, now called SMoDD). This is up from
      zero at the start of the project and matches the target. The establishment and operation of
      the SMoDD is one of the most significant achievements of the project, and a model that can
      be replicated in other countries. The SMoDD has allowed the government for the first time
      to track the performance of all districts across a range of areas. Districts for the first time
      can see how they are performing in comparison with others. They can learn from those
      performing better than themselves in some areas, while teaching those that are lagging.

     Some 27,223 (262 percent of target) local government staff participated in training
      workshops provided under the project. This is much higher than the target of 10,368 staff
      (30 percent female) that was anticipated when this indicator was added to the results
      framework in December 2010 to meet the Bank’s requirement that all projects track the
      number of beneficiaries. In addition, some 39,000 people from district consultative councils
      participated in training provided under the project. However, the project’s monitoring
      system does not allow for the tracking of unique individuals undergoing training (the core
      indicator is meant to count people only once, regardless of the number of ways they have
      benefited), and some staff probably benefited from more than one training opportunity.
      Therefore the actual number of unique individuals benefiting from training is certainly less
      than 27,233, but still likely to be well above the target. The project’s monitoring system did
      not report on the proportion of people participating in the training were female.

50.    The intermediate results are as follows:

Intermediate result 1: Improving national support systems
     All 128 districts received all final and all available updated district process dossiers and
      implementation manuals. The dossiers include various guidelines for the preparation of
      integrated plans and budgets for the district as a whole covering all sectors (including
      guidelines for community participation and consultation in district planning). The MPD had
      finalized most guidelines prior to project appraisal and sent the final dossiers to the provinces
      in 2010, which in turn distributed them to the districts. Data are lacking on when exactly the
      districts received these, but they are likely to have received them early in project
      implementation.

     The district performance monitoring system, SMoDD for decentralized planning and
      finance was developed and rolled out to all 128 districts. This indicator measured the
      extent to which the system had been implemented in districts.

     Some 463 provincial trainers in relevant areas of NDPFP were recognized by the
      pertinent ministries by the end of the project. This is four times the revised target of 100

                                                  15
	
          (and eight times the original target of 50). The original project design envisaged that that
          government training institutes for the public administration would train and accredit trainers.
          However, this approach proved challenging and the government decided instead to draw on
          the project-financed technical assistants to train trainers in the five core areas of district
          administration—community participation, strategic development planning, operational
          planning and budgeting, implementation management (including financial management,
          procurement, and public works), and internal/external control of district processes—and to
          seek their certification through the ministry or agency responsible for training in specific
          areas (for example, a person developing a competency in implementation of public works
          would receive certification from the Ministry of Public Works).

Intermediate result 2: Strengthening participatory planning and budgeting
         Some 110 districts received approval in 2015 for their operational plan (PESOD) and
          disseminated it in accordance with (selected criteria) in established planning guidelines.
          According to selected criteria, the PESODS must be (a) posted on a public noticeboard at
          three levels of local government (district headquarters, administrative posts, and localities),
          which was later changed to dissemination through the SMoDD; (ii) discussed with the
          consultative councils at the three levels of local government; and (iii) disseminated through
          radio, television, and other means. The achievement of 110 districts is well above the
          baseline of 28 (which was revised when data became available mid-way through the project
          implementation period), but slightly below the target of 114. In 2014, 126 districts approved
          PESODs; 119 disseminated them through the SMoDD; 121 discussed them in participatory
          meetings with their consultative councils; 116 disseminated them through radio, television
          or other media; but only 110 met all three criteria.

         Only 43 district councils in 2015 operated in accordance with (selected criteria) in
          current legislation. According to the selected criteria, (a) consultative councils must exist
          at the district and the sub-district levels (administrative post and locality), (b) all must meet
          at least twice a year at all levels, and (c) at least 30 percent of the members must be female.
          While the achieved result is below the target of 78, it is a substantial improvement compared
          to the baseline of 715 and an additional 61 districts councils complied with two of the three
          criteria, meaning that a total of 104 districts councils met all or most of the criteria. Moreover,
          many councils have 25–29 percent female members. Overall, 29 percent of the members of
          all district councils in 2013 were female, according the data presented in the semi-annual
          project progress reports. However, the project’s monitoring system does not report on these
          subtleties. More disaggregated information would better reveal improvements in
          performance than the current indicator.

Intermediate result 3: Enhancing management and implementation capacity

         Some 91 districts closed their financial processes in e-SISTAFE for the 2014 financial
          year. This is much higher than the baseline of 50 but below the target of 128. Although 115
          districts closed their financial processes at the end of the financial year (which ends
          December 31), some districts did not enter the required information into the e-SISTAFE
																																																								
15   The baselines and targets were revised following the MTR.

                                                                 16
	
          system until after the deadline of January 15, 2015. However, entering the data into the
          system and obtaining approval is a requirement to receive the following year’s budget,
          creating a strong incentive to comply.

         About 63 percent of procurement contracts for public works planned by the districts
          in 2014 received either prior approval or post approval from the AT.		Some 1,595 public
          works contracts valued up to 175,000 meticais were prepared, 1,260 were sent for prior
          review, and 1,006 were approved. This is well above the baseline of 13 percent, and above
          the target of 50 percent. Improving performance in this area over time shows that the districts
          are enhancing their capacity to comply with the government’s procurement regulations.

         Some 515 local government technical staff strengthening the intervention areas of the
          program have been integrated in civil service personnel system and payroll. This is
          greatly above the baseline of 98 and ahead of the target of 444. Bringing so many school
          graduates into the district civil service has greatly strengthened district’s capacity in core
          areas of administration, including financial management, procurement and public works
          management, and participatory planning and budgeting. It is one of the project’s major
          achievements.

         Only 33 districts in 2014 increased their own-source revenue by 10 percent over the
          2013 level, as registered in e-SISTAFE. This is below the revised baseline of 65 and the
          target of 85. A key challenge with this indicator is that it only shows how districts performed
          compared to the previous year, rather than showing trends in improving own-source revenue
          over time. In 2013, 59 districts vis-à-vis target of 75 managed to increase their own-source
          revenue by 10 percent. In addition, the target was not based on an in-depth analysis of
          district’s potential to collect own-source revenues. The Bank team noted the challenges with
          this indicator early during project implementation, but did not revise it during the MTR.

Intermediate result 4: Strengthening oversight and accountability
         Some 75 districts in 2014 submitted their annual financial statements to the
          Administrative Tribunal by the deadline specified in current legislation16. This is far
          above the baseline of seven. Although it is below the target of 110, it is none-the-less a
          remarkable achievement. In 2015, of 128 districts, 118 had prepared their 2013 financial
          statements, but only 75 had sent them to the AT within the deadline of March 31, 2014. A
          total of 99 had sent them by July 1, 2014. All had submitted them by March 31, 2015, one
          year after the deadline.

         The AT audited the 2013 financial accounts of some 42 districts. This is well above the
          baseline of 17 and above the end of project target of 39. The project supported the AT with
          an advisor and with funds to enable it to increase its capacity to undertake audits. These funds
          were mainly used for training, revision of the legislation related to external control, and
          revision of operation manuals with mandatory guidelines for district administrations.


																																																								
16   Funds to districts are not released until they submit their financial statement to the AT.

                                                                    17
	
         Only 27 districts informed their local consultative councils about the results of the 2013
          internal and external control findings. This is below the 2010 achievement of 29 and far
          below the end of project target of 110. This target was difficult to achieve due to lack of a
          legal mandate for districts to publish the audit results and inform the local consultative
          councils of their findings. Although considered a good practice (and documented as a best
          practice of the NDPFP), there is no legal requirement that districts do this, and districts,
          especially those without clean audit reports, may not want to disclose information. The Bank
          team noted the issue in the implementation status report of July 2013, and proposed
          reviewing the target during the MTR. However, no specific action was taken regarding this
          indicator during the revision of the results framework that followed the MTR.17 In addition,
          it should be noted that the target of 110 for this indicator seems unreasonable as it
          significantly exceeds the target for audit reports prepared by the AT (see previous indicator).
          Of the 42 audit reports assessing the 2013 district financial reports, 27 were shared with local
          consultative councils.

Intermediate result 5: Knowledge management
         By the end of the project, the NDPFP webpage in the government (initially MPD, later
          MEF) portal had been updated with 12 best practices and the summary district
          performance reports. This matches the target of 12. However, progress in this area was
          slower than expected and best practices were entered into the webpage only in 2013.

         By early 2015, 126 districts were using at least three established best practices in
          decentralized planning and finance. This is above the target of 100. Districts report their
          use of best practices through a questionnaire, and provinces confirm the claims.

         By the end of the project, 12 best practices had been identified and disseminated. This
          matches the target. In addition to dissemination through the website, a glossy publication
          was prepared with the best practices and launched at provincial level workshops. All districts
          now have a district planning library containing all relevant program documents and available
          for public consultation. The fifth program bulletin was issued in September 2014.18

Intermediate result 6: Effective project management and coordination
         All five consolidated project annual work plan and budget and monitoring reports were
          presented on time. This matches the target. The team at MPD was responsible for preparing
          and submitting these documents and did so effectively throughout the project life.

51.       As part of the results chain, the project supported a large number of outputs in four broad
areas: participation, fiduciary management, and other core district administrative functions. The
full list of outputs is presented in annex 2.


																																																								
17 As with other intermediate results indicators the target for 2014 for this indicator was replaced with the previous 2013 target,
but no further adjustments were made to address the challenges related to this indicator.

        related to their annual investment plans, budgets, execution, contracts and audits.
        Development and operationalizing the SMoDD in 128 districts.
       Fiduciary. Guidelines for forecasting and enrolment of district budgets within the general
        state budget, for procurement procedures for goods and services, and for management of
        property. Training manuals for processing revenues and expenditures, for conducting basic
        internal audits, and for conducting audits based on risk.
       Other core district administrative functions. Training manuals for provision of district
        services, for the operation and maintenance of public buildings, and for supervision of
        construction; assessments of compliance with environmental and social safeguards; training
        for district staff in all areas of core administrative functions; vehicles and office equipment,
        both of which are essential to permit the districts to deliver on their mandates; and publication
        and dissemination of 12 good practices.

3.3          Efficiency

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

52.     The PAD did not estimate economic or financial analyses against which the project
efficiency could be measured at closing. Efficiency can therefore only be inferred in textual terms
considering expected impacts of project activities and the administrative efficiency (procurement
and financial management processes) with which it was implemented. The following evidence
points to moderate efficiency of the project.

53.     The project improved participatory planning and budgeting processes as well as
transparency in all of Mozambique’s 128 districts that existed at the start of the project to ensure
that investments presented in the district strategic and operational plans reflected the priorities of
communities.19 It was also key in establishing the web-based district performance monitoring
system SMoDD that is now operational across the entire country and used to monitor results under
the National Development Plan. The project is also likely to have strengthened local governments
to obtain adequate value for money by improving their procurement processes. Procurement at
the project level was through international or national competitive bidding procedures or shopping
to ensure value for money in procuring goods. Consultant services were procured through quality
and cost based procedures, with single sourcing used to procure services of consultants who had
already worked at the MPD and whose skills had been proven. Most procurement at local
government level was carried out in accordance with government regulations, with nearly 80
percent of contracts presented to the AT for prior review, of which 63 percent were approved.
Transparency and accountability were assured through making available to the public the PESODs
and the annual reports on their execution. Moreover, governments at all levels maintain complaints
handling mechanisms to allow citizens to bring suspected cases of fraud and corruption to the
attention of the authorities. However, there were considerable delays at the start of project
																																																								
19   22 additional districts were created in 2013 when the project was under implementation.

                                                                 19
	
implementation due to the use of country systems. As a result, following the MTR, targets for
some indicators were revised downwards, so that the 2014 targets were replaced with the former
2013 targets. With no corresponding reductions in the overall project budget, this would imply a
reduction in the project’s efficiency relative to the original plans. However, the project ultimately
achieved many of the original 2014 targets and overall project benefits seem to justify the project
costs, yielding a rating of moderate efficiency for the project.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

54.     Achievement of the objectives of the NDPFP is rated moderately satisfactory overall. The
three elements that contribute to the overall outcome rating – (a) relevance of objectives, design,
and implementation, (b) achievement of the development objectives, and (c) efficiency – are all
rated moderately satisfactory. This justifies an overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory
for the operation.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

55.     The NDPFP supported citizen engagement and voice in several ways. First, it financed
experts in community participation at the central and provincial levels, who helped in mobilizing
women and traditionally disadvantaged groups to participate in consultative councils. The project
also financed training for members of the consultative councils to inform them of the regulations
requiring 30 percent female representation and other matters. The project’s measures to promote
broad citizen participation in selecting projects and in overseeing their implementation is likely to
be increasing the transparency and accountability of the use of public resources, and of promoting
social development more broadly.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

56.      The project supported key institutional reforms intended to increase the capacity of the
local governments to manage public financial resources for district development in a participatory
and transparent manner. Specifically, through development of guidelines, templates, best
practices, mentoring, and training, it supported improvements at the district and provincial levels
in the areas of participatory planning and budgeting. Thus by its conclusion, the great majority of
districts were able to prepare comprehensive district investment and operational plans in a
participatory manner and execute them largely in accordance with intentions. The project
promoted transparency by tracking compliance with government regulations to make publicly
available all operational plans and annual reports of their execution, and by establishing a
computerized district performance monitoring system that all districts are required to use in
reporting on progress in all areas of district development. It helped to strengthen public financial
management by supporting the rolling out and making operational the e-SISTAFE system across
all 128 districts, by building capacity of the internal and external audit offices, and by helping
districts comply with Mozambique’s procurement regulations. It further strengthened institutions
by developing manuals and providing training on management of public works, including

                                                 20
	
compliance of social and environmental safeguards. These reforms are likely to be resulting in
improved infrastructure and services for residents and businesses of the districts.

       (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

57.          The project did not result in any significant unintended consequences.

4.           Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate.

58.     The risk to development outcomes is rated Moderate. Since the project supported
strengthening of the existing government structure, the benefits of much of the capacity building
support are likely to be sustained. This includes in particular the increases in capacity for financial
management, with all districts now having the equipment and staff to record their budgets and
expenditures in the e-SISTAFE in according with government regulations. Despite some staff
turnover, most of the staff recruited, trained, and mentored under the project in budgeting,
participatory planning, public works management, and monitoring and evaluation are likely to
remain for some time in the district administrations, as they have been appointed to the civil
service. The measures to increase transparency are likely to be sustained, as the planning
regulations require districts to organize participatory forums and to publicly disclose planning
documents and their annual execution reports.20 Knowledge in many areas is likely to be sustained
through UNDP’s ongoing support for creation of knowledge centers in provinces. All districts
have a planning library that is made up of relevant documents and available for public consultation.
At the central level, the program website was revitalized and adapted to a more user-friendly design
and features core documents as well the five editions of the program’s bulletin. In addition, the
Government will maintain the web-based District Performance Monitoring System (SMoDD)
housed at the MAEFP, whose establishment in all districts across the country was one of the
project’s major achievement. The SMoDD is expected to continue generating information required
to monitor implementation and results of Mozambique’s new National Development Plan as well
as in assessing performance of the general budget support operations. At the time of the last ICR
mission, MAEFP was still in the process of finalizing the budget to ensure proper operation of the
SMoDD in the future and the latest national report from the SMoDD was not yet available, but the
continued use of the system enjoys the backing of the president and other key officials of the
government.

59.     The Government did not have a mature plan for phasing out the technical assistance of
NPDFP at project closing, but expressed commitment to continue providing support to districts in
the future and has started preparing a concept note for a follow-up national program. Yet, in the
meantime, the provincial and district governments may have to allocate funds from their own
budget to support some activities for participatory planning that the project previously supported,
such as funding for the travel and living expenses for members of the consultative counsels. While
the district administrators interviewed said that they would support the consultative councils at the
headquarters level, they expressed doubt that they could support the process at the lower levels.
Resources for technical assistance and training in the core areas of district administration must

                                                              21
	
come from the overall government budget. The district administrations have much more qualified
staff now than at the start of the project (due both to the training and to the recruitment of new
staff under the project), but training must be continued to ensure that existing staff maintain and
upgrade their skills, and that new staff acquire necessary skills.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

60.     The Bank’s overall performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately
satisfactory as there were moderate shortcomings in project design and the long preparation phase.
Specifically, the Bank’s performance in identification was satisfactory as the team built on the
experiences of the preceding DPFP-Centro project and similar decentralization support projects
funded by other development partners and worked to further strengthen government systems. In
addition, it worked with all development partners supporting decentralization to establish a
common framework in support for the government’s program. However, the Bank’s performance
in preparation and appraisal was moderately satisfactory, mostly due to weaknesses in the
monitoring and evaluation framework. The most important shortcoming was the decision to not
explicitly link the technical assistance to the intergovernmental transfer systems of infrastructure
investment funds that would have allowed the assessment of whether districts were improving
their performance in responding to community priorities (see also discussion under Section 3.1
paragraphs 44 and 45). In addition, the relevance of some indicators was not clear. Another issue
was the large number of dated covenants relating to studies, which could have been included in
the project’s work plan instead.

61.     All other aspects of the design were satisfactory. The government and the development
partners had agreed on a draft MOU, which described the arrangements through which all partners
would coordinate their support of the government’s program. The Bank team played a key role in
advancing donor coordination by taking the lead in preparing and seeking endorsement for the
MOU. The arrangements for development partner harmonization under the NDPFP were
considered best practice in the country and increased the effective of aid for decentralization.
However, it is worth noting that achieving this high level of donors’ coordinating was significantly
time consuming, particularly during project design, and contributed to a preparation time of nearly
four years spanning from the government’s request in 2006 until approval in 2010. Arrangements
for monitoring and reporting had been agreed. Appraisal of implementation arrangements was
satisfactory, with agreements reached on the roles and responsibilities of MPD, other line
ministries, the AT, and provincial and district administrations. Further, the effectiveness conditions
were limited in number and appropriate.

      (b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.



                                                 22
	
62.     Bank performance in supervision is rated moderately satisfactory considering that regular
supervision activities were generally carried out satisfactorily, but the Bank team missed an
opportunity to improve monitoring and evaluation during implementation and importantly did not
proactively initiate discussions on phase-out/follow-up arrangements until a few months before
project closing. Another issue was that the project had five task team leaders21, a turnover which
likely affected supervision of the program, as each new task team leader required time to build a
relationship with the counterparts and to fully understand the complexities of the project. The
team was bolstered midway through implementation with a consultant who provided general
supervision support, a senior institutional consultant who provided strategic support, and a Bank
staff member to help with the knowledge management component of the program. GIZ also
appointed a staff member to supervise implementation of GIZ-financed activities, which helped
improve performance during the second half of implementation.

63.      The Bank and partners fielded nine implementation support missions during the five years
of implementation, which means that missions took place twice a year. Missions lasted about two
weeks each and typically comprised six or more members, including foreign and local consultants
with expertise in local government administration, knowledge management, procurement, and
financial management. Many implementation support missions included visits to provincial and
district administrations. The ICR missions visited three provinces and six districts. Aide memoires
were generally of high quality, thoroughly covering all key issues and providing practical
recommendations on how to address challenges. They routinely reported on overall
implementation progress; compliance with legal covenants; implementation of activities by
component; performance with procurement, financial management, and monitoring and
evaluation; developments with respect to partner coordination, and progress towards outcome
indicators.

64.     The Bank and development partners responded to challenges when they arose and tried to
find effective solutions to them. In particular, when it became clear that the AT was demanding
the right to review and approve contracts, even though the project had received an exemption from
the government’s procurement regulations from the Ministry of Finance, the team worked closely
with the MPD to find a solution, offering advice on how to move forward. Also, when it became
clear that the government’s training institutes for the public administration did not have the
capacity to accredit trainers of trainers, the Bank and partner teams proposed enlisting participating
ministries instead to undertake and certify the trainers. In addition, the Bank and partners
established an audit task force aimed at findings ways to improve the timeliness and quality of the
project financial audits prepared by the AT.

65.           The Bank team generally rated project performance indicators realistically during
implementation. The final implementation support mission downgraded the progress towards the
PDO from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory due to the recognition that a number of the
intermediate outcome indicators would not be achieved by the end of the project, and emerging
concerns about the sustainability of some of the project achievements, since the government had
not yet formulated a new program that could sustain the achievements. Implementation progress
was upgraded in December 2014 from moderately satisfactory to satisfactory to acknowledge the
																																																								
21		 Two from preparation until October 2011, the third until June 2012, the fourth until December 2014, and the
fifth through closing.	

                                                        23
	
notable progress made to reach indicator targets, in particular in the knowledge management
component, and the good disbursement ratio.

66.     Despite this generally satisfactory performance, the Bank team missed an opportunity to
improve the information gathered under the project to demonstrate results. Although team
members had earlier noted weaknesses with some of the results indicators, the team did not revise
them during the restructuring that followed the midterm review. Moreover, the Bank team never
commented on the omission of data on the proportion of direct project beneficiaries that are female.
The Bank team also lacked an M&E specialist who could have helped improving the results
framework. Moreover, MEF staff were of the view that, in contrast to the excellent technical
support during preparation, the Bank team focused much more on procedural issues during
implementation, and seemed more interested in closing the project, than with what would happen
after the project closed.22 The discussion regarding sustainability was revived only when the new
task team leader took over in early 2015.

      (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

67.     The Bank’s overall performance was moderately satisfactory. In lending, the Bank worked
closely with the MPD and other implementing agencies to design and prepare a project that built
on the lessons learned from the early Bank and partner-funded initiatives in support of local
government capacity building. However, the ultimate design contained several weaknesses, as
noted above. During implementation, the Bank played a critical role keeping implementation on
track and the project closed on time. Supervision regularly reviewed implementation progress,
issues requiring attention, compliance with financial management and procurement, and progress
towards results. The Bank responded effectively to find solutions to challenges. A rating of
moderately satisfactory for ensuring quality at entry and a rating of moderately satisfactory for
supervision justify an overall rating of moderately satisfactory for Bank performance.

5.2          Borrower Performance

      (a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
68.      The government’s performance in implementation was moderately satisfactory. The
Ministry of Finance issued an exemption from the government’s procurement regulations in
September 2010, shortly after the project became effective. However, it did not intervene on behalf
of the project when the AT insisted that the project had to comply with government regulations.
It also failed to formally respond to a request by the AT that it offer a waiver to the project. This
issue was only resolved nearly one and a half years after project effectiveness as a result of a high-
level dialogue between the MPD and the Prime Minister. Procurement of many key technical
assistants could take place only after the issue was resolved, which slowed implementation of the
project in its early years. The Ministry of Finance was also slow in inscribing the project’s annual

																																																								
22 Discussions during ICR missions took place with staff from MEF that had replaced the former Ministry of Finance and
MPD with the appointment of the new government in January 2015. 	

                                                            24
	
work plan and budget in the e-SISTAFE. This meant that no payments could be made under the
project until May 2011, delaying the start of project activities. Finally, the government did not
issue the audit report covering the project’s 2010 expenditures under the project preparation
advance until nearly two months after the deadline. This delayed the meeting between the partners
and the supervisory committee, during which the findings of the audit report were discussed and
actions to address deficiencies agreed. The government improved its performance in this area the
following year, and all other audit reports for the project were delivered on time.

      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

69.     The performance of the MPD (later MEF) was satisfactory. It complied with the four
effectiveness conditions within the 90-day deadline following signing of the credit agreement. It
took strong ownership of the project, and led the dialogue that eventually resulted in an agreement
with the AT that the Bank’s procurement procedures would apply to the project. It appointed and
managed a solid team of technical advisors—which included experts in decentralized planning and
finance, operational planning, community participation, monitoring and evaluation, financial
control, procurement, public infrastructure, and others—to support its Directorate of National
Planning in overall issues of project management. It also adequately handled the procurement of
teams of advisors at the provincial level, and of the office equipment, pick-up trucks, motorcycles,
and bicycles to be distributed to provincial and district administrations. It compiled the semi-
annual progress reports, and presented them at meetings with the partners, the supervisory
committee, and others. It complied with the covenants, although with some delays, due to start up
challenges. The MPD also effectively led the coordination of activities being undertaken by the
various ministries and agencies participating in the project. Throughout implementation, the MPD
demonstrated high levels of commitment to the project, which was critical in keeping the project
moving towards its objectives. However, it did not proactively seek authorization to start preparing
a new project in time to ensure that no gap would exist between old and new. Although it has
started consultations with the Bank and development partners, it was not considered that at least
two years will be required for preparation and approval of a follow-on project.

70.      Several line ministries were responsible for implementing activities to strengthen district
capacity in specific areas related to their mandates under the overall coordination of the MPD.23
The performance of most line ministries participating in the project was satisfactory. They
successfully carried out their activities, as presented in the annual work plan and budget.
	
71.      The performance of the provincial governments and districts were also largely satisfactory.
All provincial administrations assigned staff to work with the NDPFP advisors, which helped to
strengthen the capacity of the civil servants themselves. All compiled provincial implementation
progress reports and annual work plans and budgets were sent to MPD for preparation of
consolidated reports, but degrees of commitment and ownership varied across provinces. All
districts sent staff to participate in various training workshops that facilitated operational skills in
																																																								
23For example, the Ministry of Environment prepared and disseminated the ESMF to provinces and districts through its
deconcentrated offices, which also provided training on its use. The Ministry of Public Works prepared manuals for construction
and operations and maintenance of small infrastructure projects. The Ministry of State Administration supported the roll-out and
operational trainings of the SMoDD. 	

                                                              25
	
preparing PESOD execution reports, the use of e-SISTAFE to record budget and expenditures and
its submission to the AT for auditing purposes. Most districts took advantage of the opportunity
offered under the project to recruit recent school graduates with skills in planning, accounting, and
public works management, while seeking their permanent civil service appointment that further
contributed to sustained capacity.

     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.     The overall performance of the recipient was moderately satisfactory. The Ministry of
Finance provided an exemption from government procurement regulations, but did not follow
through with the AT to ensure it was put into place, which caused delays in the start of many
activities. The MPD maintained a strong team at the directorate that effectively oversaw
implementation of project activities, coordinated effectively with other implementing agencies,
took the lead in resolving challenges, and complied with effectiveness conditions, covenants, and
the Bank’s financial and procurement guidelines. Participating line ministries, agencies, provinces
and districts all performed satisfactorily. A rating of moderately satisfactory for government
performance and a rating of satisfactory for implementing agencies’ performance justify an overall
rating of moderately satisfactory for Borrower performance.

6.      Lessons Learned

73.     Providing support only for capacity building without linking it to monitoring of the
delivery of infrastructure and services reduces the Bank’s and partners’ influence in
ensuring funds for these purposes are used efficiently and effectively for district
development. Because the capacity building and institutional strengthening supported under the
program was not aligned more closely with the inter-governmental transfer system nor any other
tool to monitor the outcome of the participatory planning process at district level, the Bank and
partners could not review if the district’s funds for investments were actually spent on citizens’
priorities. Nor did they assess district performance in procurement, financial management, or
compliance with the Bank’s safeguards policies. This makes it difficult to confirm that the project
achieved its objective of improving the capacity of local government to manage public financial
resources for district development in a participatory and transparent manner, without relying on
proxy indicators.

74.     Working through country systems is good practice, but key systems should be in place
from the outset to avoid implementation delays. The use of Mozambique’s financial
management and procurement systems was an important design element of the project that
contributed to strengthening government systems. However, the reliance on country systems can
also become a bottleneck for implementation. It is therefore important to ensure that key country
systems that the project depends on are operational by effectiveness to avoid delays in
implementation as evidenced by the delays in the inscription of project funds in the government’s
electronic budgeting system e-SISTAFE and the additional AT clearance process.

75.     Effective mechanisms for development partner harmonization increase the
effectiveness of aid. All development partners supporting decentralization in Mozambique have

                                                 26
	
worked closely together to learn from each other and develop a common approach to
decentralization. This resulted in a memorandum of understanding bringing all partners together
in support of the national program. This is best practice and has enhanced the effective of
assistance for capacity building for local government. However, it must be noted that reaching
agreement on an effective approach is itself a time-consuming and challenging process that should
not be underestimated. Also, when working through country systems, it may be less cumbersome
for development partners to provide their funds bilaterally to the Government. In the future, a
more effective approach could be for the government to prepare its national program and ask each
development partner to support it using the modality that it preferred. Establishing a multi-donor
trust fund at the Bank could be another model that would reduce transactions costs for all.

76.      Commitment and provision of resources for creation of a user-friendly computer-
based performance monitoring system allows for tracking of project outcomes and outputs
across a large number of project entities. The implementing agency started to develop the
district performance monitoring system under the previous project and maintained its commitment
throughout the NDPFP project period. As a result, an effective system of tracking and reporting
on district performance is in use by all 128 districts, which is generating a wealth of information
on the performance of districts across a range of indicators, of great value for better managing
resources.

77.    Reviewing and revising the project’s results framework midway through
implementation would help ensure that the indicators being monitored are appropriate in
tracking the project’s achievements. Project teams often select indicators without having had
experience in their ease of tracking and their relevance in revealing the project’s achievements.
Once they have gained this experience, they should use the opportunity of the mid-term review to
thoroughly review the relevance of the indicators to track progress and replace those with limited
relevance with better ones.

78.     Institutionalizing community participation requires a long-term commitment by
government and an appreciation of its benefits. Community participation is an expensive
undertaking, especially in rural areas, where people must travel great distances to participate in
meetings. Such an expense must be justified in terms of better decision-making and more satisfied
citizens. Teams should consider undertaking citizen satisfaction surveys periodically to assess
how effective the measures promoting participation have been. This information could then be
used to design better approaches.

79.     Building capacity of local governments requires a long-term engagement. The Bank
and other development partners have been supporting the Government of Mozambique in
strengthening provincial and district governments for the past 15 years. They have provided
technical assistance through a series of projects supporting the Government’s program, each of
which has built on the achievements and the lessons learned of the previous ones. This has helped
in sustaining and scaling up the gains of the previous engagement. However, capacity of local
governments in Mozambique is still relatively weak, and technical support will likely be required
for some time before they can perform well without such support. Ensuring the continuation of the
decentralization support program based on the lessons learned under the NDPFP, in particular with
regards to how to further improve the effectiveness and impact of the technical assistance at

                                                27
	
provincial and district levels, can help ensure that the capacity built so far is sustained and further
strengthened.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

     (a) Borrower/implementing agencies
A Project Completion Report prepared by MEF was received by the Bank on October 20, 2015,
and served as input into the preparation of this ICR. Annex 5 includes the full report in Portuguese
as well as a summary in English. A draft of this ICR was shared for comments with the
Government on December 1, 2015, and subsequently discussed with representatives from MEF,
other key national agencies and some provincial governments during an ICR review workshop
held in Maputo on December 9, 2015. The workshop participants expressed their overall
satisfaction with the report and MEF highlighted that the NDPFP represented an important
milestone in the consolidation of previously scattered support to district administrations. They
generally agreed with the findings and assessment of the draft ICR and confirmed that the
experience with the project at both the national and sub-national levels is adequately reflected. The
representative from the AT underscored that, as part of its legal mandate to monitor and audit the
legality of public expenses, the AT had to conduct a prior review of all procurement processes
surpassing the stipulated threshold. He further explained that the significant delays in obtaining
the prior approval (“visto”) experienced during the project were also attributable to incomplete
original requests and the need for several rounds of resubmission. Paragraph 27 of the ICR was
revised to capture this aspect. The representatives from the provincial governments reaffirmed the
need for continued technical assistance to districts to sustain the achievements of the project. The
full set of comments they provided during the workshop is included in annex 6.

     (b) Cofinanciers
A draft of this ICR was shared for comments with all development partners that co-financed the
NDPFP on December 1, 2015. Representatives from GIZ, the Irish Aid, and UNDP participated
in ICR review workshop on December 9, 2015. All present development partners agreed with the
storyline and the assessment of the draft ICR, but provided some factual clarifications and
precisions, in particular regarding donor coordination and past and ongoing activities supported
by them. These comments have been incorporated in the final ICR. They also emphasized the
importance of finding better donor coordination mechanisms to provide more efficient support to
the Government’s decentralization support program going forward. The full set of comments they
provided during the workshop is included in annex 6.

     (c) Other partners and stakeholders
No comments were received from other partners or stakeholders.

                                                           Annex 3: Economic Analysis

The PAD did not estimate economic or financial analyses against which the project efficiency
could be measured at closing. Efficiency can therefore only be inferred in qualitative terms
considering expected impacts of project activities and the administrative efficiency (procurement
and financial management processes) with which it was implemented. The following evidence
points to moderate efficiency of the project.

The project improved participatory planning and budgeting processes as well as transparency in
all of Mozambique’s 128 districts that existed at the start of the project to ensure that investments
presented in the district strategic and operational plans reflected the priorities of
communities.24The project also financed and supported the Government in establishing the web-
based district performance monitoring system SMoDD that is now operational across the entire
country and used to monitor results under the National Development Plan. The project is also likely
to have strengthened local governments to obtain adequate value for money by improving their
procurement processes. Procurement at the project level was through international or national
competitive bidding procedures or shopping to ensure value for money in procuring goods.
Consultant services were procured through quality and cost based procedures, with single sourcing
used to procure services of consultants who had already worked at the MPD and whose skills had
been proven. Most procurement at local government level was carried out in accordance with
government regulations, with nearly 80 percent of contracts presented to the AT for prior review,
of which 63 percent were approved.

Transparency and accountability were assured through making available to the public the PESODs
and the annual reports on their execution. Moreover, governments at all levels maintain
complaints handling mechanisms to allow citizens to bring suspected cases of fraud and corruption
to the attention of the authorities.

However, there were considerable delays at the start of project implementation due to the use of
country systems. As a result, following the MTR, targets for some indicators were revised
downwards, so that the 2014 targets were replaced with the former 2013 targets. With no
corresponding reductions in the overall project budget, this would imply a reduction in the
project’s efficiency relative to the original plans. However, the project ultimately achieved many
of the original 2014 targets and overall project benefits seem to justify the project costs, yielding
a rating of moderate efficiency for the project.




																																																								
24   22 additional districts were created in 2013 when the project was under implementation.

                                                                      33

           Annex 5: Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

                                  Summary of Borrower’s ICR

The Government of Mozambique prepared a Project Completion Report for the NDPFP in
Portuguese, which was shared with the World Bank on October 20, 2015. The below is a summary
of the key points raised in the government’s completion report.
Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes
The report noted positively that NDPFP was the first program that consolidated several scattered
donor efforts into one national program, covering all 128 Mozambican districts that existed at the
time. However, the report also raised concerns about the long preparation phase of the project from
the government's request in 2006 until the actual effectiveness of the project in 2010, recognizing
the complexity of the project design regarding the large number of actors involved on the side of
both the government and the development partners. In addition, the government felt that the
responsibilities and competencies of the involved actors were not clearly enough defined.
The report points to several difficulties during project implementation, in particular the first year,
which initially delayed planned activities significantly. On the one hand, disbursements of funds
from the Common Fund were delayed due to delays in the inscription of the project resources into
e-SISTAFE, the government’s electronic budgeting system budget. These delays, in turn, had a
negative impact on the implementation of activities within the districts. Similarly, delays in placing
technical advisors at the provincial level to support the implementation of program activities and
in putting in place the necessary equipment in the districts affected the overall performance of the
program in the early years of implementation. According to the government, the main reason for
this was the divergence in the interpretation of national rules for procurement versus the Bank’s
procurement rules. Procurement processes often had to undergo additional approvals at national
level after having received the Bank’s no objection. This caused considerable delays in project
implementation. In addition, the report points out that the Bank's procurement rules are often far
from the countries’ reality, particularly related to the capacities at district level.
Assessment of Outcomes
Comparing the program’s development objectives to the actual results achieved, the government
highlights the importance of the actual outcomes but also concludes that these do not entirely
correspond to the results that were originally stipulated in the project documents. For the
government, the most important achievements of the program were: (i) the vast improvement in
the overall performance of the processes led by the districts (PESODs), (ii) the creation and
functioning of local consultative councils, (iii) improved domain of e-SISTAFE and financial
processes closed at the end of fiscal year, (iv) considerable increase in the numbers of prior
approvals (“vistos”) of the Administrative Tribunal in the procurement processes, (v) increase in
annual own source revenues of district governments, (vi) Increase in districts that submitted their
annual financial statements to the Administrative Tribunal in accordance with current legislation,
and (vii) increase in human and technical capacity within the districts (technical integration).
Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
With regards to the performance of the Government and the Bank, the report highlights that the
long duration of the preparation process brought about certain challenges regarding the

                                                 36
	
management of evolving expectations. While the report indicates that the Bank and other
development partners showed a high degree of professionalism and provided solid technical
assistance during preparation, it also notes that negotiations were somewhat rushed and some
aspects were incorporated in project design without having full consensus, under a big pressure to
finalize the project. Regarding implementation, the government’s assessment finds that there were
not enough joint technical discussions with the Bank and other development partners to deepen
relevant issues for the project. It also deplores that the frequent change of Task Team Leaders was
a source of discontinuity in project implementation.
Lessons learned
Finally, the government highlighted the following lessons learned in the report: (i) the
communication flow between the government and development partners could be improved
through a clearer definition of roles and responsibilities of each actor; (ii) the number of
implementation support missions could have been specified in the project documents and the fact
that the missions were mainly concentrated at central level limited the partners' territorial vision
of the project; (iii) the government recommends to reduce the number of implementing institutions
and to focus on institutions with greater impact in local governance; and (iv) advocates for a
strengthening of national systems in place (e-SISTAFE).

                     Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Introduction
A workshop to review the draft ICR was held on December 9, 2015, in Avenida Hotel in Maputo,
Mozambique. Participants included representatives from the main implementing agency MEF
(formerly MPD), other line ministries and national agencies involved in the preparation and
implementation of the NDPFP, several provincial governments, as well as three development
partners that co-financed the project (see the full list of participants below). The workshop started
with an opening by MEF and a presentation on the key findings of the draft ICR by the Bank,
which were followed by an open discussions during which representatives from government and
development partners shared their feedback on the draft ICR.

Comments received from the Government
The feedback on the draft ICR from the government was positive overall. Participants expressed
their general satisfaction with the report and confirmed that it adequately captures the preparation
and implementation experience, achievements, and lessons learnt of the project at both the national
and sub-national levels. Specifically the following comments were provided:
    - Representatives from MEF thanked the Bank team for carrying out a candid evaluation and
      for the close interaction with the government during preparation of the draft ICR. They
      highlighted that the draft ICR already included previous comments from MEF and that they
      fully agree with its findings and conclusions. They asked the Bank team to include in the
      annexes of the ICR the full text of the government’s Project Completion Report in Portuguese
      in addition to the summary in English.
    - The representative from the Administrative Tribunal emphasized that the legal mandate of
      the AT includes the surveillance and audit of the legality of public expenses and revenues,
      in particular through prior review of contracts. He explained that Article 8 of Decree 15/2010
      stipulates the possibility for projects financed by multilateral sources to use norms different
      from the national procurement rules, when the adoption of these norms is explicitly stated in
      the financing agreement and authorized by the Minister of Finance. Moreover, the granted
      exceptions need to be clearly include in any tender documentation used under the project that
      was granted different procurement rules. However, even when different procurement rules
      are adopted, the prior approval of the AT still has to be obtained before signing contracts
      surpassing the established national thresholds. In these cases, the AT checks the exception
      of rules granted and reviews the process based on them. If the special norms that were
      authorized by the Minister are not explicitly stated in every single request submitted to the
      AT for prior review, the AT has to reject the request asking for required revisions and a
      revised package needs to be resubmitted as the AT is not allowed to grant conditional
      approvals. This process may be repeated several times until the AT receives all appropriate
      documentation required for prior review. The representative from AT concluded that, in
      many cases, inadequate preparation of the documentation for prior review requests is hence
      responsible for significant delays in receiving AT approval for procurement processes.
    - Representatives from the Provincial Governments thanked for the report highlighting that it
      adequately reflected their experience during project implementation overall. They did,
      however, point out that when the project was first presented to them the use of national

                                                 51
	
     systems was underlined and they were surprised when they found out during implementation
     that additional requirements from the World Bank applied as well. They also criticized that
     the MTR came too late in project implementation as to have sufficient time afterwards to
     effectively implement adjustments. Lastly, they noted that the SMoDD is not yet completely
     functional/ being used to the fullest extent in all districts without external technical support
     as some local administrations still face capacity-related challenges to use all modules of the
     system.

Comments received from the Development Partners
The representatives from GIZ, the Irish Development Cooperation, and UNDP thanked the Bank
team for a frank assessment and a well-written, comprehensive ICR. Overall, they agreed with the
storyline and assessment of the draft ICR, but provided several factual clarifications and
precisions. Specifically, there comments were the following:
    - The representative from GIZ explained that, after project closing of the NDPFP, GIZ
      continues to provide support to decentralization in Mozambique through the
      implementation of a technical cooperation program to strengthen financial management
      capacities of districts and municipalities in the provinces for which Germany has provided
      long-term support. In addition to the advisors in the provinces, this program also finances
      advisors at the national level. In this regard, GIZ clarified that it does not only continue to
      support an advisor to the Ministry of Public Works, but is also financing advisors to the AT,
      the MAEFP, and for the internal control institutions.
    - The representative from UNDP commented that the DPFP-Centro was only one of several
      initiatives that supported capacity building at the district levels and its role as predecessor
      of the NDPFP should hence not be overstated in the ICR. She clarified that the first project
      to support district development was the pilot project in Nampula financed by UNCDF and
      UNDP, with support from the Netherlands, which was later replicated by other donors,
      including the Bank-financed DPFP-Centro. Similarly, with regards to donor coordination,
      she also pointed out that the leadership of the development partner group rotated during
      implementation and the role of the other development partners should be recognized in the
      ICR, not only GIZ who coordinated the group during the last year of implementation. Lastly,
      she commented on the lessons learnt regarding donor coordination and the use of national
      system. She pointed out that donor coordination was often slowed down by internal
      procedures and requirements of each development partner and suggested to explore to what
      extent internal fast-track measures could be used going forward to speed up preparation of
      coordinated projects. Finally, she suggested that future projects could include some type of
      contingency funds to be used to resolve possible bottlenecks that may arise regarding
      national systems on an as-needed basis.
    - The representative from the Irish Development Cooperation reiterated the clarification
      regarding the rotating leadership of the development partners group during project
      implementation. He also explained how the use of the national financial management
      system (e-SISTAFE), while being important, also led to challenges in project
      implementation as it sometimes caused temporary liquidity problem at the district level, in
      particular in those districts where e-SISTAFE was only made operational during project
      implementation. Further, he reaffirmed that the completion and roll-out of the SMoDD is

                                                 52
	
      one of the major achievements of the program, but expressed his concerns regarding the
      sustainability of the system remarking that the final national report for 2014 from SMoDD
      is still not available, while it used to be available much earlier in the year when the NDPFP
      was still under implementation. Regarding the implementing agencies, he agreed with the
      overall satisfactory performance but also pointed out that the ownership and performance
      of the provincial governments in project implementation varied across the country. Some
      provincial governments seemed to have been more interested in receiving material benefits
      offered by the program (such as vehicles) than providing oversight of implementation of the
      technical assistance activities, evidenced by a lack of documentation of regular meetings of
      the CdSP in some provinces. Lastly, with a view to future district development support
      projects, he suggested to take a closer look at the lessons learnt regarding the technical
      assistance provided by the NDPFP (referencing the evaluation of the technical assistance
      carried out during MTR), to understand how the activities contributed to improve capacity
      at the local level and how its effectiveness and impact at provincial and district level could
      be further improved in a future program.

                       Annex 8: Glossary of Key Systems and Institutions

SMoDD. District Performance Monitoring System. This is a web based system through which
districts record their performance across a range of areas critical for district development.
Indicators cover processes, such as when consultative forums are held, and results, such as the
number of children enrolled at primary school.

PESOD. District Economic and Social Operational Plan and Budget. This is the annual plan
and budget that districts prepare to implement their five-year district strategic development plan.
It covers all areas of district development, including agriculture, health, education, infrastructure,
and income-generating activities.

e-SISTAFE. This is the integrated financial management information system. It contains
modules on budget execution module, budget formulation, revenues, payroll and assets
management.

Administrative Tribunal. This is the supreme audit institution of Mozambique. It also plays
a role in overseeing public procurement, a legacy of its history as a Portuguese colony.

District consultative council. Also known as district councils, these are legally mandated bodies
that operate at three levels of government: district headquarters, localities, and administrative
posts. They are required to have a minimum number of members, 30 percent of whom are female.
Members must also represent diverse groups, including youth, seniors, and the disabled. They are
required to hold two meetings a year, one to discuss and agree on district priorities and one to
review performance in executing the district social and economic plan and budget.
