A. SUMMARY
The proposed changes affect the Results Framework and Monitoring of the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) of the National Decentralized Planning and Finance Project
(NDPFP). During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) which took place 18-27 September,
2013, Government and IDA agreed to pursue the following changes: 1) Rewording of
three intermediate outcome indicators; and 2) Change of baselines and targets for 2013
and 2014 (End-of-Project) values of some intermediate outcome indicators. The proposed
changes only affect intermediate outcome indicators and do not alter the Project
Development Objectives (PDO) indicators.

B. PROJECT STATUS
NDPFP is on track to meet its project development objectives. Based on the Project
disbursement, progress of implementation and accomplishments of targets of key
indicators, the overall implementation of the Program is considered moderately
satisfactory. This is despite significant initial delays during 2011-12 resulting from
project management constraints. The key strategic objective of the Project—to improve
the capacity of local government to manage public financial resources for district
development in a participatory and transparent manner—is being accomplished. One
main challenge of the project was to harmonize ‘project-based’ approaches financed by
specific donors into one National Project. These efforts have succeeded and resulted in
one single program supporting the development and implementation of numerous
instruments and processes aiming to strengthen the decentralization process in country
and consolidating the districts as poles for resource management and service delivery.

Ratings and fiduciary performance. The PDO indicator is currently satisfactory and the
IP indicator is moderately satisfactory. The Project is currently at mid-term, but already
exceeds the target number of total Project beneficiaries. All component and fiduciary
performance ratings range between moderately satisfactory and satisfactory. At this point
there are no outstanding audits and there is full compliance with the legal covenants.

Performance of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). At MTR, 2 out of the 3
Project Indicators (PDO Indicators) are currently being met. From the component
indicators, only 4 out of 16 are being met (25%) but IDA and Government verified during
the recent MTR Mission that the Project is on track to meet the majority of the Project
KPI targets for the end of project (EOP) in June 2015.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/indicators
   1) Changes to intermediate outcome indicators’ wording: The MTR Mission
       concluded that because of changes in legislation during project implementation
       the Results Monitoring Framework must be adjusted. Specifically, the wording of
       three intermediate outcome indicators was revised. The original and revised
       wordings are presented in Annex 1a. Please note that the new wordings do not
       change in any way the Development Objectives of the Project.

   2) Changes to intermediate outcome indicators’ baselines and targets: Because
      numerous constraints at project start, mostly related to the use of country systems,
      Project implementation right after effectiveness was slow. From early on, it
      became evident that the slow project start-up would compromise the attainment of
      the targets of some program indicators. Hence, during the Project’s Supervision
      Mission of August 22-26, 2011, it was decided to shift forward the targets of the
      project indicators by one year. However, this change was never formally
      processed. The MTR reviewed the yearly and end of project (EOP) targets and
      baselines of all program indicators. As a result of this review, the baselines and
      targets for 2013 and 2014 (EOP) of some intermediate outcome indicators were
      adjusted according to the values presented in Annex 1b.


   Please refer to Annex 1a and Annex 1b for details of the Results Framework and
   Monitoring.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

The proposed changes only affect the results framework and monitoring of the project
and do not have other impacts in any other aspect of the Project (Costs, Disbursements,
Economic and financial analyses, Technical, Social, Environmental, Risks, or others).
