                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Based on the Project disbursement, progress of implementation and accomplishments of targets of key indicators, the overall implementation of the Program is considered
                         moderately satisfactory. Disbursements have picked up since the last mission and they are now at a satisfactory level. The mission went over all KPIs and verified that the Project is
                         on track to meet the majority of the Project KPI targets for the end of project (EOP) in June 2015.

                         All project components are rated either Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory, with the exception of the Knowledge Management component that is still underperforming. Notable
                         progress since the last mission happened in the roll-out of a National District Performance Monitoring System (SMoDD for its acronym in Portuguese). More than a standalone project
                         monitoring tool, SMoDD was developed into a broad planning and reporting tool. In January 2013 the system was migrated to an online platform (eSMoDD), which is now fully
                         functional, with central, provincial and district staff trained in the use of eSMoDD. Activities that will receive special attention for the remaining of the Project include: Knowledge
                         Management to ensure the dissemination of the instruments, procedures and good practices implemented during the Program; a sustainability strategy for technical assistance; and a
                         focus on training to ensure effective knowledge transfer before the end of the Project.
