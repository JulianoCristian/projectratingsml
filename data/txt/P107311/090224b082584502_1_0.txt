                         considered Moderately Satisfactory. Disbursements are at a satisfactory level and performance on the KPIs has improved since the Mid-Term Review. The mission maintains the

                         Notable progress since the last mission includes the hiring of two national technical advisors in community participation and knowledge management, and the consolidation of the
                         National District Performance Monitoring System (SMoDD for its acronym in Portuguese). More than a standalone project monitoring tool, SMoDD was developed into a broad
                         planning and reporting tool, which is now producing national reports on performance and service delivery for the country's 128 districts. Activities that will receive special attention for
                         the remaining of the Project include: Knowledge Management to ensure the dissemination of the instruments, procedures and good practices introduced by the Project; a
                         sustainability strategy for technical assistance; and a focus on training to ensure effective knowledge transfer before the end of the Project.
