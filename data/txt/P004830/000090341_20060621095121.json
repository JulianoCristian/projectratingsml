Lessons learned\n            from the project: The influence of IDA's support of\n            this project extended well beyond the specific benefits\n            arising from the project itself, substantial though they\n            were. The financial analysis of the project was based on the\n            accounting concept of depreciation of historic assets, which\n            makes somewhat arbitrary assumptions about assets that are\n            difficult to value. For very good reasons, the project\n            design minimized procurement by including all of the works\n            in each sub-project in a single contract. The systemic issue\n            of multi-level, often redundant reviews of all stages of\n            project processing (designs, cost estimates, procurement\n            plans, bidding documents, evaluation of bids, and approval\n            of contract award) remains a problem for the portfolio in Vietnam."}, "docdt": "2006-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
