facilities in order to satisfy demand up to 2000 of about\n            2.5 million people in the cities; (ii) ensure sustainability\n            of the physical investments by developing the institutional\n            capabilities of water supply agencies, facilitating their\n            commercialization, and upgrading their staff skills through\n            training; and (iii) assist in preparation of a future\n            investment program to satisfy water demand after 2000.  The\n            project will include the following components: 1) renewal\n            and upgrading of water supply facilities in the urban\n            districts of Hanoi, Haiphong and Danang, and Halong/Cam Pha\n            in Quang Ninh province; 2) institutional measures to ensure\n            sustainability of the physical investments; 3) support\n            activities consisting of various studies, advisory services,\n            supervision of construction and training; and 4) resettling\n            and rehabilitating of population affected by the project."}, "docdt": "1997-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
