{"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that a\n            Development Support Credit (DSC) type operation is not the\n            best vehicle to achieve long-term structural change, but it\n            can be a good catalyst to initiate it. Likewise, a DSC can\n            serve a the final push to implement other reforms that have\n            been on the agenda for a long time. The triggers for the\n            follow-on DSC 2 were relevant to deepening the program, but\n            later needed significant revisions to reflect evolving\n            conditions. There was little overlap between the programs of\n            the two institutions. The Bank might have had a stronger\n            hand in some areas, such as energy pricing, if the IMF had\n            had cross conditionality. In the case of time bound\n            conditions such as the awarding of the financial advisory\n            contract for Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs), the\n            contractor may take opportunities to increase fees. The\n            current Bank timeframe for Bangladesh for public sector bank\n            restructuring is about 4 years, whereas in Pakistan, as a\n            comparison, it took almost 10 years for a similar financial\n            restructuring to take place."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
