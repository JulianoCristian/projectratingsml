"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Development Support Credit for\n            Bangladesh supports the implementation of the\n            Government's poverty reduction strategy (PRSP), which\n            focuses on: 1) Acceleration of pro-poor growth: The I-PRSP\n            aims to raise the economy's growth rate from about 5\n            percent per annum to 6-7 percent, in order to attain the\n            poverty reduction target in the Millennium Development Goals\n            set for 2015. This will be accomplished by (a) ensuring a\n            stable macroeconomic environment; (b) relying on the private\n            sector as the engine of growth; (c) establishing a sound and\n            well-functioning financial system and ensuring that the poor\n            have access to financial resources; (d) taking advantage of\n            the opportunities provided by globalization, (e) developing\n            rural areas and accelerating rural non-farm growth; (f)\n            creating the conditions needed for an expanding and dynamic\n            manufacturing sector; and (g) substantially augmenting the\n            capacity and quality of infrastructure services. 2)\n            Promoting Good Governance: The Government's strategy of\n            improving governance focuses on addressing three major\n            areas: (a) improving the investment climate by creating a\n            competitive environment across all segments in society; (b)\n            establishing and enforcing clear rules and regulations for\n            public sector administration; and (c) promoting voice and\n            participation of the civil society, including women, the\n            poor and disadvantaged groups, as a step toward a\n            transparent and 'open' government. 3) Investing in\n            Human Development: This is to be done through targeted\n            public expenditures in health, education, and nutrition, and\n            radically improved system of incentives for public service\n            providers. Within the health sector, although some success\n            has been achieved in preventive health care, a small\n            proportion of poor people have access to public health care\n            services. The strategy thus gives priority to completing the\n            unfinished agenda and addressing the pro-poor concerns in\n            health and nutrition. The introduction of a national\n            nutrition program to address the malnutrition of children\n            under two as well as pregnant and lactating mothers through\n            the provision of food supplements, nutrition and health\n            counseling is a positive step to address the problem. In the\n            area of basic education, the plan is to improve quality,\n            while increasing access for the poorest segments o f\n            society. NGOs and private sector are envisaged as providers\n            of high-quality education along with the government. 4)\n            Promoting Women's advancement: While the gender-gap is\n            closing in Bangladesh for most social indicators, the\n            overall level of empowerment measured in terms of literacy,\n            work force participation, property rights, and credit\n            access, remains low. The strategy for furthering\n            women's advancement includes emphasis on policies and\n            institutional actions to combat continuing negative gender\n            ratios, violence against women, high maternal mortality, and\n            restrictions on women's employment and economic\n            opportunities; and policies to ensure formal equality;\n            supporting affirmative actions at all levels and in all\n            spheres; and creating a women-friendly institutional\n            environment overall. 5) Ensuring Social Protection: To help\n            increase the poor's crisis-coping capability and form\n            important risk-insurance policies for them, four sets of\n            policies would be emphasized for the poor to cope better\n            with various income (consumption) shocks. The first set of\n            policies will continue focus on social safety nets; the\n            second on policies that will address the vulnerabilities of\n            the 'new poor'; the third will emphasize the\n            development of social solidarity; and the fourth set\n            concerns risk insurance, including measures to mitigate\n            risks faced by the poor."}, "docdt": "2003-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
