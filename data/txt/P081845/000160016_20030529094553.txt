Summary 
Borrower: 
The 
People’s

Amount: 
SDR 
217.6 
million 
(US$300 
million 
equivalent) 
Terms:

terms; 
40-year

with

period 
Description: 
The 
proposed 
credit 
supports  the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Govemment’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy, 
which 
focuses on: 
. 
Acceleration 
of 
pro-poor 
growth. 
The 
I-PRSP aims 
to 
raise 
the 
economy’s 
growth 
rate 
from 
about 
5 
percent 
per 
annum 
to 
6-7 
percent, 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
MDG 
poverty reduction 
target 
set 
for 
2015. 
This 
is 
to 
be 
accomplished 
by 
(a) 
ensuring a 
stable macroeconomic environment; 
(b) 
relying 
on 
the 
private 
sector 
as 
the 
engine 
of 
growth; 
(c) 
establishing a 
sound 
and 
well-functioning 
financial 
system 
and ensuring 
that  the 
poor 
have 
access 
to 
financial 
resources; 
(d) 
talung 
advantage 
of 
the 
opportunities 
provided 
by 
globalization, 
(e) 
developing 
rural 
areas 
and 
accelerating 
rural 
non-farm 
growth; 
(f) 
creating 
the 
conditions 
necessary 
for 
an 
expanding and 
dynamic 
manufacturing 
sector; 
and 
(g) 
substantially  augmenting 
the 
capacity  and 
quality 
of 
infrastructure 
services. 
. 
Promoting 
Good Governance. 
The 
Govemment’s 
strategy 
of 
improving 
governance 
focuses 
on 
addressing three 
major 
areas: 
(i) 
improving 
the 
investment 
climate 
by 
creating a 
competitive 
environment 
across 
all 
segments 
in 
society; 
(ii) 
establishing 
and 
enforcing 
clear 
rules 
and 
regulations 
for 
public 
sector 
administration;  and 
(iii) 
promoting 
voice and participation 
of 
the 
civil 
society, 
including 
women, 
the 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged 
groups, 
as 
a 
step 
toward 
a 
transparent 
and 
‘open’ government. 
This 
is 
to 
be 
done 
through 
targeted 
public 
expenditures 
in 
health,  education, 
and nutrition, 
and 
radically improved 
system 
of 
incentives 
for public 
service 
providers. 
Within 
the 
health 
sector, 
although 
some 
success 
has 
been 
achieved 
in 
preventive health 
care, 
a 
small 
proportion 
of 
poor 
people have 
access 
to 
public health 
care services. 
The 
strategy 
thus 
gives 
priority 
to 
completing 
the 
unfinished 
agenda 
and 
addressing 
the pro-poor 
concerns 
in 
health 
and 
nutrition. 
The 
introduction 
of 
a national 
nutrition 
program 
to 
address 
the 
malnutrition 
of 
chldren 
under 
two 
as 
well 
as 
pregnant and 
lactating 
mothers 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
food 
supplements, 
nutrition 
and 
health 
counseling 
is 
a positive 
step 
to 
address 
the 
problem. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
basic 
education, 
the 
plan 
is 
to 
improve 
quality, 
whle 
increasing 
access 
for 
the poorest 
segments 
of 
society. 
NGOs 
and 
private 
sector 
are 
envisaged 
as 
providers 
of 
high-quality 
education 
along 
with 
the 
government. 
. 
Promoting 
Women’s advancement. 
%le 
the 
gender-gap 
is 
closing 
in 
Bangladesh 
for most 
social indicators, 
the 
overall 
level 
of 
empowerment 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
literacy, 
work 
force participation, 
property 
rights, and 
credit 
access, 
remains 
low. 
The 
strategy 
for 
furthering 
women’s 
advancement 
includes 
emphasis 
on 
policies 
and 
institutional 
actions 
to 
combat 
continuing 
negative 
gender 
ratios,  violence 
against 
women, 
hgh 
maternal 
mortality, 
and  restrictions 
on 
women’s 
employment  and 
economic opportunities; 
and 
policies 
to 
ensure 
formal 
equality; supporting 
affirmative 
actions at 
all 
levels 
and 
in 
all 
spheres; 
and creating 
a women-friendly  institutional 
environment overall.

Investing

Ensuring 
Social 
Protection. 
To 
help 
increase the 
poor’s 
crisis-coping capability 
and 
form 
important 
risk-insurance 
policies 
for 
them, 
four 
sets 
of 
policies 
would 
be 
emphasized 
for 
the 
poor 
to 
cope 
better 
with 
various 
income 
(consumption) 
shocks. 
The 
first 
set 
of 
policies 
will 
continue 
focus 
on 
social 
safety 
nets; 
the 
second 
on 
policies 
that 
will 
address 
the 
vulnerabilities 
of 
the 
‘new 
poor’; 
the 
third 
will 
emphasize 
the 
development 
of 
social 
solidarity; 
and 
the 
fourth 
set 
concerns 
risk 
insurance, 
including 
measures 
to mitigate 
risks 
faced 
by 
the 
poor. 
The 
actions supported 
by 
the 
credit 
will 
increase transparency 
and accountability 
in 
government, 
help 
restore 
public 
and 
private 
sector 
confidence,  and 
improve 
the 
investment climate. 
This, 
in 
turn, 
will 
contribute 
to 
accelerating the 
rate 
of 
economic 
growth,  employment creation and 
poverty 
reduction. 
Governance 
improvements 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
in 
particular, 
will 
help 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
delivery 
and 
make the 
services 
more 
affordable and 
accessible 
to 
the 
poor. 
The 
program 
entails 
significant 
risks. 
First, 
implementation 
may 
be 
slower  than 
planned 
because 
of 
limited 
experience, inadequate 
institutional 
and 
human 
capacity, 
and 
uneven 
support 
for reform 
within 
the 
Government. 
Second, 
given 
the 
powerful 
vested  interests 
who 
stand 
to 
loose 
from 
improvements 
in 
governance, 
existing 
political 
support 
for 
the 
medium-term 
reform 
program 
could 
erode 
if 
the 
distribution 
of 
gains 
from 
growth 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
equitable. 
Third, 
the 
reform 
costs 
to 
the 
budget 
could 
be 
higher 
than 
estimated 
if 
banlung 
and 
SOE 
reforms 
proceed 
at 
a 
slower 
pace. 
Fourth, 
fiduciary 
risks 
in 
Bangladesh 
are 
high 
as 
confirmed 
by 
various 
diagnostic 
studies 
done 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
Fund. 
Finally, 
there 
is 
a 
danger 
that 
the 
external  environment 
could  remain 
depressed 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
time, 
preventing 
an  acceleration 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
export 
and 
economic 
growth. 
Several 
specific 
measures are 
being 
implemented 
to 
minimize 
these 
risks. 
The 
reform 
effort 
is 
being 
led 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance and 
Planning, 
who 
has 
an 
established 
track- 
record 
and 
was 
instrumental 
in 
ushering 
in 
significant reforms 
in 
the 
early 
1990s. 
He 
is 
being 
supported 
by 
a group 
of 
reform-minded 
leaders 
who 
are 
endeavoring 
to 
build 
constituencies 
for 
change 
within 
the 
political 
leadership. 
The 
Government 
has 
already 
implemented  significant 
up-front 
actions, 
laying 
the 
foundation 
for 
subsequent 
reforms. 
The 
Government 
has engaged 
in 
substantive 
dialogue 
with 
labor 
leaders 
and 
workers 
to 
ensure 
that 
their 
concerns 
are 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
retrenchment program. 
Bangladesh 
enjoys considerable 
goodwill 
among 
the 
donor  community, 
which 
has 
indicated 
that 
their 
support 
to 
the 
country 
would 
increase 
if 
the 
reform 
effort 
is 
sustained. 
To 
mitigate 
against 
fiduciary 
risk, 
the 
Government 
has 
agreed 
to 
implement 
a  number 
of 
reform 
measures 
under 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Reform 
Program 
funded 
by 
the 
DFID-UK 
and Government 
of 
Netherlands 
and also 
the 
Bank 
funded 
Procurement 
Reform 
TA 
Project. 
Additional 
support 
to 
improve 
the 
fiduciary 
environment 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
IMF 
and 
by 
the 
Bank’s 
Central 
Bank 
Strengthening 
Project 
and 
IDF 
grant. 
The 
Bank 
will 
also 
reserve 
the 
right 
to 
audit 
the  deposit 
accounts. 
While 
the  above 
risk 
mitigation 
measures 
should 
provide 
adequate 
comfort 
that 
these 
risks 
are manageable, 
as 
an 
added 
risk-mitigation 
measure, 
the 
Bank 
will 
provide 
a 
credit 
acceleration 
clause that 
would  allow 
the 
Bank 
to 
demand 
immediate 
repayment 
of 
the 
proposed  credit 
amount 
by 
the 
Borrower 
in 
case 
if 
reforms 
are 
reversed 
or materially 
changed.

I. 
Introduction 
1. 
Although 
Bangladesh’s 
longer-term 
achievements 
are 
noteworthy, 
the 
economy 
has 
continued 
to 
perform below 
its 
true 
potential. 
While 
the economy 
moved 
to 
a 
higher 
growth 
trajectory 
of 
5 
percent 
per 
annum 
during 
the 
1990s, 
compared 
to 
the 
4 
percent annual 
growth 
achieved 
in 
the 
1980s, 
this 
is 
still 
below 
the 
potential 
6-7 
percent 
growth 
rate 
needed 
to 
achieve 
the 
country’s 
2015 
poverty 
reduction 
goal 
of 
halving 
the 
incidence 
of 
poverty 
from 
current 
levels.’ 
Limited 
structural 
reforms 
have  been 
implemented 
since  the 
mid-1990s’ 
and 
most 
observers 
believe 
that 
economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
could 
accelerate 
if 
the 
country 
were 
to 
undertake 
significant  structural 
reforms 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
governance, 
state 
owned 
enterprises, 
financial 
sector 
and 
infrastructure. 
Against 
this 
general backdrop, 
a 
new 
Government 
with 
a  strong  parliamentary 
majority 
was 
elected 
in 
October 
2001, 
with 
an 
overwhelming 
mandate 
to 
improve 
governance 
and 
law 
and 
order 
and 
to 
strengthen  economic 
management. 
The 
Government 
has 
taken 
quick 
actions 
to 
stabilize 
the 
macroeconomic 
environment, 
is 
implementing 
structural 
reforms 
to 
improve 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
in 
crucial 
sectors 
such 
as 
banlung, 
energy, 
and  telecommunications,  and 
is 
making 
encouraging  progress 
in 
implementing 
a 
medium-term 
program 
to 
improve 
governance. 
These 
actions 
are 
critical 
and  an  integral 
part 
of 
government’s strategy 
for 
accelerating 
growth 
and 
reducing poverty. 
2. 
Government’s 
reform 
efforts 
are 
being 
championed 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance 
and 
Planning, 
who 
established 
a 
record 
for 
implementing 
structural 
reforms 
as 
Finance 
Minister 
during 
the 
early 
1990s 
and 
is 
supported 
and 
encouraged 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister. 
These 
reforms 
are 
also 
backed 
up 
by 
a team 
of 
reform- 
minded 
political 
leaders 
and 
bureaucrats. 
Immediately 
after 
tahng 
office 
the 
Govemment 
formed 
a 
committee 
of 
five 
Secretaries and embarked 
upon 
a 
100-day 
program 
to 
address 
the 
most 
urgent 
issues 
facing 
the 
country. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Secretaries’ 
committee, the 
Government 
developed 
a 
time-bound 
implementation 
plan 
for 
future reform. 
The 
reform 
actions 
were 
discussed 
and 
endorsed 
by 
the Cabinet 
Committee 
on 
Economic Affairs, 
the 
country’s 
main 
economic 
decision-making 
body,  and 
implementation 
began 
shortly 
thereafter. 
The 
previously moribund 
process 
of 
preparing 
the PRSP 
was 
simultaneously 
accelerated, 
and 
an 
I-PRSP 
has 
been 
prepared. 
The 
Minister 
of 
Finance and 
Planning 
and 
his 
economic team 
visited 
Washington 
in 
December 
2002, 
and 
discussed 
their 
adjustment 
efforts 
with 
senior 
Bank-Fund 
management. 
3. 
To 
support the 
implementation 
of 
the 
I-PRSP, 
the Government 
has 
asked 
the 
IMF 
and 
the 
World 
Bank for 
financial 
support. 
In 
response, 
the 
IMF 
is 
working 
on 
a PRGF. 
The 
World 
Bank 
is 
considering 
a 
series 
of 
single 
tranche adjustment operations 
within 
a 
medium-term 
policy 
framework 
to 
complement 
the 
IMF’s 
PRGF. 
This 
memorandum 
outlines 
the 
first 
of 
the 
envisaged  adjustment  operations, 
a 
Development 
Support 
Credit 
(DSC), 
to 
the 
Government 
of 
Bangladesh 
to 
help 
support  broad-based 
structural and 
governance 
reforms. 
The 
Credit 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
objectives and 
strategy 
proposed 
by 
the 
Govemment 
in 
its 
I-PRSP 
and 
conforms 
to 
the 
Country 
Assistance Strategy 
(Report 
No: 
21326-BD, 
February 8,200 
l), 
which 
emphasizes 
strengthening 
govemance, 
sustaining 
human 
development 
gains 
and 
accelerating 
the 
pace 
of 
poverty 
reduction. 
It 
supports 
a 
subset 
of 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
agenda 
and 
will 
provide quick 
disbursing 
balance 
of 
payments 
assistance, 
complementing 
other 
initiatives 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
that 
are 
designed 
to 
contribute 
to 
the Government’s 
poverty reduction 
objectives. 
These 
include 
a social 
investment 
program, 
improvements 
in 
rural 
transport, 
reforms 
in 
the education and 
health 
sectors 
and 
assistance 
to 
strengthen 
the 
telecommunications 
sector 
and 
the 
central 
bank.

Development 
Performance 
Long-term 
Achievements 
5. 
As 
highlighted 
in 
the 
most 
recent 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy, 
Bangladesh’s 
development 
is 
a 
“mosaic 
of 
achievements 
and 
disappointments”. 
The 
country’s 
achievements 
are 
many, 
but 
so 
are the 
signs 
of 
performance 
falling 
far 
short 
of 
potential. 
Thanks 
to 
prudent 
macroeconomic 
management 
and 
generally 
sound 
policies 
for 
much 
of 
the 
past 
decade, 
indicators 
of 
economic 
and 
social 
well-being 
have 
improved 
steadily. 
Rapid 
integration 
with 
the 
global 
economy 
saw 
Bangladesh’s 
ratio 
of 
trade 
to GDP 
more 
than 
doubled over 
the 
1990s, 
contributing 
to 
real 
per 
capita 
income 
growing 
by 
about 
3 
percent 
per 
annum, 
exceeding 
the 
average

Bangladesh implemented a 
successful 
family 
planning 
program 
using 
voluntary 
methods only, 
that 
resulted 
in 
the 
population 
growth 
rate 
falling 
from 
over 
3 
percent 
in 
the 
1970s 
to 
1.5 
percent 
in 
the 
late 
1990s. 
The 
total 
fertility 
rate declined 
from 
4.3 
in 
1990 
to 
3 
in 
1998. 
Impressive 
gains were 
made 
in 
increasing 
the 
child 
immunization 
rate 
from 
10 
to 
70 
percent 
during 
the 
1990s. 
In 
education, 
enrollments 
at 
the 
primary 
level 
doubled 
from 
8 
to 
17.7 
million 
between 
1980 
and 
2001,  and  coverage  increased 
from 
65 
percent 
to 
84 
percent 
of 
the 
age 
group. 
The 
primary 
school 
completion 
rate 
increased 
to 
67 
Dercent.

secoidary 
education also increased 
significantly. 
Enrollment 
in 
secondary 
education 
increased 
from 
3 
million 
in 
1990 
to 
over 
10 
million 
in 
1999. 
Female enrollment 
increased 
from 
35 
percent 
to 
54 percent at 
the 
lower 
secondary 
level 
and 
from 31 
percent 
to 
49 
percent 
in 
grades 
M 
and 
X. 
Similarly, 
life 
expectancy  and 
infant  mortality  improved 
appreciably 
(Table 
1). 
Bangladesh  has 
continuously 
strengthened 
its 
disaster 
management 
capabilities. 
This 
enhanced 
capability, 
as 
well 
as 
people’s 
resilience, 
was 
in 
ample evidence 
during 
the 
country’s effective 
response 
to 
one 
of 
the 
century’s 
worst 
floods 
in 
1998. 
7. 
Headcount 
rates, 
based 
on both 
the 
upper 
as 
well 
as 
lower poverty 
lines, 
indicate that 
poverty 
in 
Bangladesh declined 
considerably 
during 
the 
1990s. 
Analysis 
of 
three 
Household 
Expenditure 
Surveys 
(HES) 
conducted 
by 
the 
Bangladesh 
Bureau 
of 
Statistics 
(1991-92,  1995-96, 
and 
2000)  shows 
real 
per 
capita 
incomes 
in 
Bangladesh increased 
by 
about one-quarter 
during 
the 
1990s. 
While 
inequality 
rose 
somewhat over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
decade 
(the 
Gini 
coefficient 
rose 
from 
0.259 
in 
1991-92 
to 
0.306 
in 
2000), 
poverty 
levels declined considerably over 
this 
period. 
Fifty 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
population 
was 
poor 
(i.e. 
below 
the 
upper 
poverty 
line) 
in 
2000, compared 
to 
59 
percent 
in 
1991-92. 
Similarly, 
34 
percent 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
population 
was 
very 
poor 
in 
2000 
(as 
measured 
by 
the 
lower poverty 
line, 
using 
the cost 
of 
basic 
needs 
method), 
compared 
to 
43 
percent 
in 
1991-92. 
Throughout 
the 
decade, 
rural 
poverty 
remained 
higher 
than 
urban 
poverty, 
but 
declined 
by 
roughly 
the 
same 
percentages 
over 
the 
period 
(around 
8 
percentage points). 
In 
2000, 
a 
little 
over 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
population 
resided 
in 
urban 
areas, 
where the 
incidence 
of 
poverty 
(around 37 
percent) was considerably 
lower 
than 
in 
rural 
areas 
(53 
per~ent).~ 
Notwithstanding 
this 
progress, data 
from 
the 
HES 
series 
indicate that 
the pace 
of 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
rural 
areas 
slowed 
down 
between 
1995-96 
and 
2000, 
with 
poverty 
in 
urban 
areas 
actually 
rising 
during 
this 
period. 
8. 
Much 
of 
the 
sustained 
economic 
progress made 
during 
the 
1990s 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
wide- 
ranging 
reforms introduced 
in 
the 
early 
1990s, 
by 
the 
present 
Minister 
of 
Finance and 
Planning, 
to 
remove 
the 
plethora 
of 
controls 
on 
economic 
activity 
and 
establish 
the 
private 
sector 
as 
the 
engine 
of 
growth. 
Import 
controls 
and 
many 
non-tariff 
barriers 
were  removed, 
while 
import 
procedures 
were 
simplified. 
The 
fixed 
exchange 
rate 
system 
was 
replaced 
by 
a 
more 
flexibly 
administered 
system; 
the 
investment 
regime 
was 
de-regulated 
to 
encourage 
private participation 
- 
both 
foreign 
and 
domestic; and 
market-oriented 
policies 
were 
introduced 
to 
create 
a supportive 
policy 
environment 
for 
the 
private 
sector. 
Power 
and telecommunications, 
sectors 
reserved 
for 
the 
state, 
were 
opened 
up 
for 
private 
investment. 
The 
investment 
regime, 
for 
both 
domestic 
and 
foreign 
investment, 
was 
liberalized 
to allow

without

spheres 
except 
those 
restricted

grounds; 
all 
restrictions 
on

were also 
eliminated. 
Emerging 
Challenges 
9. 
Under 
growing political 
pressure, 
however, 
the 
pace 
of 
reforms 
began 
slowing toward 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
1990s. 
Governance 
continued 
to 
deteriorate 
and 
is 
exacting a huge 
toll 
on 
the 
economy. 
In 
addition, 
fiscal 
outcomes worsened 
and 
contingent 
liabilities 
rose, 
largely 
as 
a 
result 
of 
state-owned 
enterprises’ 
long-standing 
poor 
performance. 
Adverse 
developments 
in 
the 
external 
environment, 
compounded 
by 
the 
events 
following 
September 
1 
1,200 
1, 
led 
to 
a 
significant 
erosion 
in 
foreign 
exchange 
reserves, 
with 
economic 
growth slowing 
down to 
slightly 
over 
4 
percent 
in 
2002. 
Sustaining 
and 
accelerating 
the 
growth 
necessary 
to 
absorb Bangladesh’s 
burgeoning labor 
force 
and 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
will 
require  improvements 
in 
macroeconomic 
management, 
investment 
efficiency, 
competitiveness, 
accountability 
and transparency. 
III. 
Recent 
Economic 
Developments 
10. 
Bangladesh’s 
vulnerability, 
which 
increased 
significantly 
following 
the events 
of 
September 
1 
1, 
2001, 
is 
largely 
the 
result 
of 
structural 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
economy. 
Although 
the 
rate 
of 
GDP 
growth 
remains 
respectable, 
averaging 
5 
percent 
annually 
over  the 
1990s, 
it 
remains 
much 
below 
potential. 
Weak 
governance 
and deteriorating 
law 
and order 
are 
major 
concerns, 
and 
the 
country 
faced 
two 
sets 
of 
macroeconomic imbalances 
when 
the 
new 
Government 
took 
office 
- 
low 
foreign 
exchange reserves 
and 
rising 
fiscal 
deficits.

of 
2001, 
barely 
sufficient 
to 
finance  about 
one 
month 
of

The 
downward 
trend 
in 
reserves 
was the 
result 
of 
a 
number 
of 
factors 
including 
(i) 
the 
surge 
in 
imports 
in 
FYOl, 
particularly 
resulting 
from 
fiscal 
pressures 
of 
an 
over-sized 
Annual 
Development 
Program 
(ADP); 
(ii) 
the 
slow 
down 
in 
export 
growth, 
particularly 
since 
November 
2000; 
(iii) 
the 
rising 
foreign 
exchange 
payments 
on 
account 
of 
power 
purchase 
agreements, 
production 
sharing 
contracts 
for 
gas 
exploration 
and 
costly 
suppliers’ 
credits; 
and 
(iv) 
falling aid 
disbursements.

The 
balance 
of

current 
account, 
which 
was 
in

in 
FYOO, 
deteriorated 
to 
a 
deficit 
equivalent 
to 
1.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FYO1, 
including 
current 
official 
transfers. 
The 
outlook 
for 
FY02 
was 
unfavorable 
until 
concerted 
action 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
new 
Government 
to 
reduce 
the 
size 
of 
the 
ADP 
dampened 
import 
levels 
while,  at 
the 
same 
time, 
steps 
taken 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
speed 
of 
private 
transfers 
helped 
increase 
workers 
remittances. 
Workers 
remittances 
through 
official 
channels 
increased 
33 
percent, 
from 
$1.9 
billion 
in 
FYOl 
to 
$2.5 
billion 
in 
FY02. 
Consequently, 
notwithstanding 
the 
decline 
in 
exports, 
Bangladesh achieved a current 
account 
surplus 
of 
$240 
million, 
including 
($69 
million) 
current 
official 
transfers, 
in 
FY02. 
The 
current 
account 
surplus 
increased 
to 
$564 
million 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
FY03, 
compared 
with 
a 
surplus 
of 
$56

While 
the 
recent 
increase 
in

is 
encouraging, 
reserve

are 
still

in 
January

it 
is 
envisaged that the I-PRSP 
will 
be 
finalized 
by 
mid- 
March 
2003. 
15. 
Key  thrust 
of 
the 
I-PRSP. 
Government’s 
overarching 
goal, 
as 
articulated 
in 
the I-PRSP, 
is 
to 
substantially 
reduce 
chronic 
poverty 
and 
invigorate 
social 
development 
in 
the 
shortest 
possible 
time. 
In 
addition 
to 
specifying 
social 
targets (Table 
2) 
in 
line 
with 
the country’s 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals, 
the 
I-PRSP 
commits 
the authorities 
to 
halve 
the 
proportion 
of 
population 
living 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
by 
the year 2015. 
The 
strategy recognizes 
the 
need 
for 
acceleration 
of 
economic 
growth 
as 
the 
engine 
to 
drive 
down 
poverty. 
In 
parallel, 
the 
strategy 
lays 
emphasis 
on 
human 
development 
by 
paying 
attention 
to 
the 
need 
for 
greater 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
education, 
health 
and 
nutrition, 
providing for 
greater 
social 
protection 
and 
empowering 
the 
poor 
through participatory 
processes 
that 
would 
give 
them 
voice 
in 
shaping 
their 
own 
destinies. 
16. 
Thus 
the 
Government’s 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
is 
a 
combination 
of 
key 
elements 
that 
are 
expected 
to propel 
growth, 
while 
making 
sure 
that the 
benefits 
of 
that 
growth 
are shared 
by 
the 
poor. 
The 
I-PRSP 
articulates 
this 
strategy 
as 
resting 
on 
five 
pillars: 
(i) 
acceleration 
of 
pro-poor 
growth; 
(ii) 
improvements 
in 
governance; 
(iii) 
investment 
in 
human 
development; 
(iv) 
women’s 
advancement; 
and 
(v) 
social protection. 
17. 
Acceleration 
of 
pro-poor 
growth. 
The I-PRSP aims 
to 
raise 
the 
economy’s 
growth 
rate 
from 
about 
5 
percent 
per 
annum 
to 
6-7 percent, 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
MDG 
poverty 
reduction 
target 
set 
for 
2015. 
The 
key 
building 
blocks 
of 
this 
strategy 
are 
summarized 
below. 
A 
stable  macroeconomic 
framework 
is 
proposed 
as 
the 
foundation 
on 
which 
to 
build 
a 
sustainable 
path 
of 
accelerated 
growth. 
This 
would 
entail 
maintenance 
of 
low 
inflation 
and 
sustainable 
fiscal deficits 
and 
external 
debt. 
To 
ensure 
macroeconomic 
balance, 
the 
medium 
term 
focus 
will 
be 
on 
four 
critical 
areas: 
(a) 
increased domestic resource 
mobilization; 
(b) 
rationalized 
and 
improved quality 
of 
public 
expenditure; 
(c) 
prudent 
monetary 
policy; 
and 
(d) 
improved 
foreign 
sector 
management. 
The 
strategy 
emphasizes 
the 
pivotal 
role 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
as 
an 
engine 
of 
growth. 
To 
enable 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
play 
this 
role, 
the 
Government 
proposes 
to 
withdraw 
from 
manufacturing 
activity 
and 
create 
an 
investment-fi-iendly  environment, 
by 
pursuing 
policies 
to 
ensure 
macroeconomic 
stability, 
improve 
law 
and 
order, 
promote 
good 
governance, 
and 
maintain 
competitiveness. 
The 
Government 
recognizes 
that a 
sound 
and 
well-functioning 
financial 
system 
is 
essential 
to 
achieve the 
desired 
acceleration 
of 
growth 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
poor 
have 
access 
to 
financial 
resources. 
The 
Government 
plans 
to 
address 
three 
critical 
problems 
facing 
the 
financial 
sector: 
(i) 
Bangladesh 
Bank’s 
weak 
regulatory 
power; 
(ii) 
poor 
governance 
of 
the 
public 
financial 
institutions; and 
(iii) 
deficiencies 
of 
the 
legal 
framework. 
There 
is 
also 
continued 
recognition 
of 
the 
important 
role 
of 
micro 
credit 
as 
an 
instrument 
of 
poverty 
reduction. 
Recognizing 
that 
globalization 
presents 
challenges 
as 
well 
as 
opportunities 
for 
Bangladesh, the 
proposed  strategy 
seeks 
to 
seize 
the 
opportunities 
by 
strengthening 
institutional 
capabilities, 
addressing 
structural 
weaknesses, 
and 
improving 
the 
policy 
regime. 
Building 
on 
the past 
record 
of 
trade reforms, 
the 
Government plans 
to 
move forward 
on 
the 
trade 
reform 
agenda 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
greater 
diversification 
of 
the 
export 
base 
and 
increase 
export 
competitiveness. 
Further, 
it 
intends 
to 
strengthen 
trade 
support capacity 
to 
cope 
with 
emerging 
changes 
in 
the 
global 
trading 
environment  and 
to 
ensure 
its 
effective 
participation 
in 
regional  blocks  and 
the 
WTO 
negotiations.

. 
For 
rapid 
poverty 
reduction, the Government’s 
priority 
is 
to 
develop 
rural 
areas, 
where 
most 
of 
the 
poor 
live. 
This 
requires 
accelerated 
growth 
of 
agnculture and 
the 
rural 
non-farm 
sector. 
To 
encourage 
agricultural 
growth, 
the 
Government 
proposes 
to 
improve 
the 
policy 
environment 
by 
encouraging 
the 
adoption 
of 
new 
technologies, 
strengthening 
extension 
services, 
the 
provision 
of 
credit 
to 
small 
farmers, 
and 
providing 
an 
appropriate 
mix 
of 
incentives 
to 
pursue 
profitable 
operations. 
For 
accelerating 
rural 
non-farm 
growth, 
measures are 
planned 
to 
strengthen 
both 
backward 
links 
e.g. 
agncultural 
equipment 
and 
repair 
services, 
marketing 
of 
fertilizer, 
seed 
and 
other 
inputs, 
as 
well 
as 
forward 
links 
to 
agricultural activities 
like 
processing and 
marketing 
of 
agncultural 
products. 
Emphasis 
is 
to 
be 
given 
to 
improve 
infrastructure 
to 
improve 
competitiveness 
edge 
and 
exploit growth 
potential. 
The 
National 
Rural 
Development 
Policy 
200 
1, 
which 
has 
been 
formulated to 
guide 
the 
comprehensive development 
of 
rural 
areas, 
attaches 
importance 
to 
creating 
efficient 
and 
effective 
local 
government 
institutions 
as 
the 
decentralized 
decision-making 
fiamework 
within 
a 
participatory 
mode. 
While 
agnculture 
and 
rural 
development 
will 
remain 
critical 
to 
sustained 
growth 
of 
the 
Bangladesh economy, 
the 
Government 
recognizes that acceleration 
of 
growth 
will 
have 
to 
come 
fiom 
the 
expansion 
of 
a 
dynamic 
manufacturing 
sector, 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
comparative 
advantage 
within 
an 
export-oriented 
policy 
framework. 
Thus 
the strategy 
is 
to 
pursue 
globally 
competitive 
industrialization 
dictated 
by 
“dynamic 
comparative 
advantage”, 
such 
that 
industrialization 
is 
employment-intensive 
with 
emphasis 
on 
small 
and 
medium 
enterprises 
(SMEs) 
and export-oriented 
industries. 
The 
strategy 
is 
to 
face 
the 
challenge 
of 
the 
impending 
phase 
out 
of 
the 
multi-fibre 
arrangement 
by 
taking 
concrete 
steps 
to 
sustain 
the 
economy’s 
export 
performance 
in 
the 
face 
of 
increased 
global 
competition. 
The 
Government 
recognizes that accelerated 
growth 
in 
all 
of 
the 
above components 
will 
not 
be 
feasible 
without 
substantial 
augmentation 
of 
the 
existing 
capacity 
and 
quality 
of 
infrastructure 
services, 
which 
serve 
as 
the 
backbone 
of 
a 
growing 
economy, 
while 
creating 
jobs 
for 
vast 
numbers 
of 
the 
poor. 
For 
instance, 
the 
impact 
of 
roads and bridges 
on 
poverty 
is 
well 
documented 
in 
Bangladesh. 
Thus 
there 
is 
strong 
emphasis 
in 
the 
proposed 
strategy 
on 
improving 
roads, 
electricity 
and telecommunications 
services. 
The policies 
will 
also 
support the development 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technology at 
all 
levels 
of 
education, 
including 
development 
of 
institutions 
to 
facilitate 
the 
transfer 
of 
technology. 
. 
. 
18. 
Promoting 
Good 
Governance. 
The 
second 
pillar 
of 
the 
Government’s 
growth 
and poverty 
reduction 
strategy rests 
on 
the 
broad 
realization 
that 
poor 
governance 
is 
a 
severe 
impediment 
to 
current 
poverty reduction 
efforts. 
Therefore, 
the Government’s 
strategy 
of 
improving 
governance 
focuses 
on 
addressing three 
major 
areas: 
(1) 
creating a 
competitive 
environment 
across 
all 
segments 
in 
society, 
along 
with 
an 
unhindered 
flow 
of 
information; 
(ii) 
establishing and 
enforcing 
clear 
rules 
and regulations 
for 
public 
sector 
administration 
supported 
by 
separation 
of 
power 
among 
three branches 
of 
governance 
along 
with 
pragmatic 
oversight 
arrangements; 
and 
(iii) 
promoting 
voice 
and 
participation 
of 
the 
civil 
society, 
including 
women, 
the 
poor 
and 
disadvantaged 
groups, 
as 
a 
step 
toward 
a 
transparent 
and 
‘open’ 
government. 
To 
achieve 
these 
objectives, 
the 
Government 
plans 
to 
implement 
a 
judicial reform 
program 
to 
guarantee 
citizen’s 
constitutional 
rights, 
execute 
fundamental 
reforms 
of 
the 
police 
force 
to 
improve 
law 
and 
order, 
undertake 
measures 
to 
establish 
effective 
planning 
and budgeting 
systems 
supported 
by 
transparent 
accounting  and 
auditing, 
and 
improve 
public 
procurement 
systems 
with 
full 
financial 
accountability. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
full 
independence 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General,  and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
fully 
functioning Public 
Accounts Committee. 
19. 
Investing 
in 
Human 
Development. 
Given 
the strong 
poverty reducing 
effects 
of 
human capital 
development 
in 
Bangladesh, 
a 
major 
emphasis 
of 
the 
Government’s 
strategy 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
is 
the 
development 
of 
basic 
capabilities and human 
resource 
development 
of 
the 
poor 
population. 
This 
is 
to 
be 
done 
through 
targeted 
public 
expenditures 
in 
education, 
health 
and 
nutrition 
and 
radically 
improved 
7 
Page  16
system 
of 
incentives 
for public 
service 
providers. 
Substantial resources have 
been allocated 
recently to 
the 
expansion 
of 
education, 
primary 
education 
in 
particular, 
but 
much 
remains 
to 
be 
done 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health 
and 
nutrition. 
Within 
the 
health 
sector, 
although 
some 
success 
has 
been 
achieved 
in 
preventive 
health 
care, 
a 
small 
proportion 
of 
poor 
people have 
access 
to 
public 
health 
care 
services. 
The 
strategy 
thus 
gives 
priority 
to 
completing 
the 
unfinished 
agenda 
and addressing the 
pro-poor 
concerns 
in 
health 
and 
nutrition. 
Despite 
some 
improvement 
in 
the 
last 
decade, 
child 
malnutrition 
in 
Bangladesh remains 
high, 
with 
adverse 
implications 
for 
future 
poverty 
reduction. 
The 
introduction 
of 
a 
national 
nutrition 
program to 
address 
the 
malnutrition 
of 
chldren

two 
as

as 
pregnant 
and 
lactating 
mothers 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
food 
supplements, 
nutrition 
and 
health 
counseling 
is 
a 
positive 
step 
to 
address 
the 
problem. 
Existing 
food-targeting 
programs 
such 
as 
VGD 
and 
RMP 
(Rural Maintenance Program) 
will 
also 
be 
used 
to 
reach 
the 
poorest 
and 
the 
most vulnerable 
with 
nutrition-support 
package. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
basic education, 
the 
plan 
is 
to 
improve 
quality, 
while 
increasing 
access 
for 
the poorest 
segments 
of 
society. 
NGOs 
and 
private 
sector 
are 
envisaged 
as 
providers 
of 
hgh-quality 
education 
along 
with 
the 
Govemment. 
20. 
The 
Government 
is 
fully 
conscious  that 
the 
burden 
of 
poverty 
falls 
disproportionately 
on 
women. 
The 
underlying 
factors 
are 
low 
literacy 
rate, 
low 
nutrition, 
low 
income 
with 
discriminating 
wage 
differentials 
compared 
to 
men, 
low 
life 
expectancy, 
and 
high 
morbidity. 
While 
the 
gender-gap 
is 
closing 
in 
Bangladesh 
for 
most 
social indicators, the 
overall 
level 
of 
empowerment 
measured 
in 
terms 
of 
literacy, 
work 
force participation, 
property 
rights, 
and 
credit 
access, 
remains 
low. 
The 
strategy 
for 
furthering 
women’s  advancement 
includes 
emphasis 
on 
policies 
and 
institutional 
actions 
to 
combat 
continuing 
negative 
sex 
ratios, violence 
against women, 
high 
maternal 
mortality, 
restrictions 
on 
women’s employment and economic opportunities; 
policies 
to 
ensure 
formal 
equality; 
supporting 
affmtive 
actions 
at 
all 
levels 
and 
in 
all 
spheres; 
and 
creating a 
women-hendly 
institutional 
environment overall. 
Finally, 
the 
Government 
proposes 
to 
actively promote 
policies 
for 
increasing women’s 
participation 
in 
all 
spheres 
of 
development 
under 
the 
poverty reduction 
strategy. 
Promoting 
Women’s  advancement. 
21, 
Ensuring 
Social 
Protection. 
To 
help 
increase 
the 
poor’s  crisis-coping 
capability 
and 
form 
important 
risk-insurance 
policies 
for 
them, 
four 
sets 
of 
policies 
would 
be 
emphasized 
for 
the 
poor 
to 
cope 
better 
with 
various 
income 
(consumption) 
shocks. 
The 
first 
set 
will 
continue 
focus 
on 
social 
safety 
nets 
for 
the 
poor through 
various 
food-assisted 
and 
cash-assisted 
programs, old-age 
pension 
schemes 
in 
rural 
areas, 
support 
for 
the 
female destitute, and 
traditional 
relief 
programs. 
These 
programs 
will 
address 
the 
specific 
problems 
of 
chronic 
poverty 
of 
socially 
disadvantaged groups 
(street 
children, 
elderly 
poor, the 
disabled population, 
to 
name a 
few). 
The 
second 
set 
will 
address 
the 
vulnerabilities 
of 
the 
‘new 
poor’, 
including 
the 
retrenched 
and 
displaced workers 
from 
privatized 
SOEs, 
market reforms 
and globalization. 
The 
third 
set 
emphasize the 
development 
of 
social 
solidarity 
by 
encouraging 
bonding 
and 
bridging 
across 
self-help 
groups 
under 
GOs 
and 
NGOs 
at the 
local 
level. 
The 
new 
Social Development 
Foundation 
(SDF) 
will 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
fostering  social 
capital 
formation 
by 
promoting 
CBOs 
and 
local 
associations 
in 
building 
and  maintenance 
of 
small-scale 
community 
infrastructures. 
The 
fourth 
set 
concerns 
risk 
insurance, 
including 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
faced 
by 
the 
poor 
by 
(a) 
providing 
access 
to 
credit 
in 
times 
of 
emergency, 
(b) 
improving public 
health 
services 
to 
reduce 
health 
hazard 
related 
to 
income 
and 
consumption 
shocks,  (c) 
strengthening  disaster 
prevention 
and 
mitigation 
mechanisms 
to 
enhance 
the 
poor’s  coping 
capability 
in 
times 
of 
natural 
disasters, 
and 
(d) 
adopting countervailing 
measures, 
to 
enable 
the 
poor, 
particularly 
women, 
to 
cope 
with 
the 
costs 
incurred 
as 
a 
result 
of 
violence 
and personal insecurity. 
V. 
Reforms Supported 
by 
the 
Proposed 
Credit 
22. 
The 
proposed 
credit 
will 
‘support 
a 
subset 
of 
the 
Government’s 
medium 
term 
reform 
program, 
discussed 
above. 
The 
Government’s  approach 
has 
been 
to 
launch 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
reforms 
in 
areas 
where 
broad 
consensus 
exists, 
with 
the 
expectation that 
these 
will 
begin 
to pay 
off 
shortly, 
creating 
momentum 
8 
Page  17
and 
public 
support 
for 
subsequent 
measures. 
Consequently,  Government’s  emphasis 
during 
the 
first 
phase 
is 
on 
actions 
that 
will 
improve 
the 
investment climate and stimulate 
economic 
growth. 
Government 
is 
also engaging 
its 
development partners, 
including 
the 
World 
Bank, 
in 
a 
parallel 
dialogue 
to 
deepen 
reforms 
in 
several 
sectors. 
So, 
while 
the 
proposed 
DSC 
is 
focused 
on 
supporting the near-term 
priorities 
identified 
by 
the 
Government 
as 
critical 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the I-PRSP, other 
related 
investment 
operations 
are 
supporting 
the 
implementation 
of 
reforms 
in 
health,  education 
and 
rural 
development, 
including 
water 
management 
(see 
Section 
VI 
on 
the 
Bank‘s 
strategy). 
A. 
The 
Growth 
Agenda 
23. 
Notwithstanding 
several exogenous 
shocks, 
average 
GDP 
growth 
in 
Bangladesh 
has 
shown 
a 
steady 
increase 
from 
2.8 
percent 
in 
the 
1970s 
to 
3.7 
percent 
in 
the 
1980s, 
to 
4.8 
percent 
in 
the 
1990s. 
All 
three 
broad 
sectors, 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
services, 
have 
contributed 
to 
growth. 
The 
acceleration 
in 
growth 
is 
attributable 
to 
increased 
private 
investment 
resulting 
from 
increased 
national 
savings 
and the 
opening 
up 
of 
the  economy 
to 
international 
trade. 
The 
initial 
stimulus 
to 
growth 
came 
in 
the 
late 
seventies and 
early 
eighties 
when 
Bangladesh launched 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
reforms, 
such 
as 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
food 
and 
apcultural 
subsidies, 
involving 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
irrigation 
equipment 
and 
the phasing 
out 
of 
the 
monopoly 
of 
the Bangladesh 
Agriculture 
Development 
Corporation. 
Reforms 
in 
the 
early 
1990s 
opened 
the 
economy 
further 
by 
removing 
non-tariff 
restrictions 
on 
trade, 
improving 
export 
incentives, 
deregulating 
private 
investment and 
relaxing 
exchange controls. 
During 
this 
period 
regulatory 
barriers 
to 
entry, 
exit 
and 
competition 
were 
significantly 
reduced. 
24. 
However,  although 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
1990s 
is 
heartening, 
Bangladesh 
has 
fallen 
short 
of 
its 
growth 
potential 
when 
compared 
to 
countries 
like 
China 
and 
India. 
Recent 
surveys 
and 
analytical work, 
including 
a recent 
survey 
of 
1000 
manufacturing 
firms 
jointly 
conducted 
by 
the 
Bangladesh 
Enterprise 
Institute 
and 
the 
World 
Bank’, 
have 
identified poor 
governance  environment, 
wasteful 
state-owned 
enterprises 
which 
crowd 
out 
private 
sector 
activity, 
a 
poorly 
performing  financial 
system, 
and 
an 
inefficient 
and 
loss-making 
energy 
sector 
as 
the 
key 
constraints 
affecting 
the 
investment 
climate. 
While 
there 
may 
not 
be 
any 
regulatory 
barriers 
to 
entry, 
the 
fact  that 
it 
can 
take 
several 
months 
to 
get 
a 
telephone 
or 
electricity 
connection 
or 
a 
construction 
permit, 
as 
revealed 
by 
the 
investment 
climate 
survey, 
provides 
some 
indication 
of 
how 
difficult 
it 
can 
be 
to 
start 
a 
business 
in 
Bangladesh. 
Moreover, although 
6 
permits 
are 
needed 
to 
set 
up 
a 
business, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
China 
and 
Indonesia, 
it 
takes 
much 
longer 
to 
get 
these 
permits 
in 
Bangladesh.  Businessmen 
therefore 
usually 
have 
no 
option 
but 
to 
resort 
to paying 
‘speed-money’ 
to 
overcome 
these 
bureaucratic 
hurdles. 
Macroeconomic 
Stabilization 
25. 
Early 
Actions. 
Creating a 
stable 
macroeconomic environment 
is 
a central 
pillar 
in 
Government’s 
strategy 
to 
accelerate 
economic 
growth. 
As 
a 
critical 
step 
in 
ensuring macroeconomic stability, 
and 
in 
light 
of 
the 
difficult 
foreign 
exchange  situation,  the 
Government 
took 
early 
actions 
in 
key 
areas 
of 
macroeconomic  management. 
When 
the 
Government 
was  formed, 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance  and 
Planning 
were 
put 
under 
one 
minister, 
to 
ensure 
better 
co-ordination 
between 
the  development 
and 
recurrent 
budgets. 
Revenue 
and Expenditure Commissions were 
established 
to 
make 
recommendations 
for 
improving 
fiscal 
management. 
Improving 
the 
Investment 
Climate 
in 
Bangladesh, 
Bangladesh Enterprise 
Institute 
and 
the

Bank, 
March 
2003. 
The survey 
was 
conducted 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
2002 
and 
included 
the 
following 
sectors: 
textiles, 
food 
and 
food 
processing, 
leather 
and 
leather 
products,  electronics, 
and 
chemicals 
and 
pharmaceuticals. 
The 
survey 
included 
firms 
in 
Dhaka 
(and 
surrounding 
areas) 
and 
Chittagong.

26. 
Several 
actions were taken 
to 
contain 
the 
FY02 
fiscal 
deficit 
and 
its 
domestic 
financing. 
The 
Annual 
Development Program 
was 
cut 
by 
about 
17 
percent, 
and 
current 
expenditures 
were 
cut 
by 
2 
percent, 
including 
the 
cancellation 
of 
the 
Non-Aligned 
Movement 
@AM) 
summit, 
which 
alone 
resulted 
in 
fiscal 
savings 
of 
about 
US$200 
million. 
Interest 
rates 
on 
National 
Savings 
Certificates were 
initially 
lowered 
by 
between 
1 
and 
3 
percent, 
and 
subsequently 
four 
savings 
certificate 
schemes 
were abolished 
altogether, 
to 
reduce Government’s 
debt 
servicing 
burden. 
The 
Government 
announced 
that 
all 
new 
project 
proposals 
to 
be 
funded 
by 
external 
suppliers 
credits 
would 
be kept 
in 
abeyance, 
and  strict 
expenditure 
control 
processes 
were 
established 
to 
control 
the 
release 
of 
approved development 
funds.

As 
a 
result 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
measures 
the revenue-to-GDP 
ratio 
increased 
from 
9 
percent 
in 
FYOl 
to 
10.2 
percent 
in 
FY02. 
Long 
overdue 
increases 
in 
fuel, 
power 
and 
gas 
prices were 
implemented. 
The 
withholding tax 
rate 
was increased 
for 
some sectors, 
the 
VAT 
base 
was 
widened 
by 
imposing 
regulatory 
duty 
on 
selected 
domestic  consumer 
goods, 
stamp 
duty 
collection 
on 
cigarettes 
was 
enhanced,  state- 
owned 
enterprises 
which 
had 
evaded 
payment 
of 
corporate 
taxes 
were  made 
to 
pay 
their 
dues, 
independent 
audit 
firms 
were 
recruited 
to 
assist 
tax 
collection, 
computerized 
assessments 
were 
introduced, 
the 
trade 
clearance 
system was 
strengthened 
and 
large 
tax 
payer 
units 
were 
established 
for 
both 
income 
tax 
and 
VAT. 
The 
combination 
of 
revenue 
and 
expenditure 
measures 
reduced the central 
Government 
deficit 
to 
4.7 
percent 
in 
FY02, 
with 
a 
commensurate 
decline 
in 
domestic 
financing

Building 
on 
the 
improvements 
in 
fiscal 
outcomes 
achieved 
in 
FY02, 
the 
FY03 
central 
Government 
budget 
deficit 
is 
projected 
to 
decline further 
to 
4.2 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
with 
domestic 
financing 
declining 
to 
1.9 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
To 
achieve 
its 
deficit 
target, 
the Government 
has 
embarked 
upon 
an 
ambitious 
program to 
enhance  revenues. 
Measures 
recently  implemented 
include 
lowering 
of 
the 
personal 
income 
tax 
exemption 
limit, 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
minimum 
income 
tax 
for 
individuals, 
withdrawal 
10 
Page  19
of 
tax 
holidays 
for 
expansion 
of 
existing 
enterprise 
units, 
additional tax 
on 
undistributed 
profits 
of 
listed 
companies, 
inclusion 
of 
all 
sources 
of 
NGO 
profits 
into 
the 
tax 
net 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
income 
from 
micro-credit 
operations, 
abolition 
of 
zero 
duty 
rate 
on 
many 
imports, 
withdrawal 
of 
several 
VAT 
exemptions 
and 
extension 
of 
VAT 
to 
additional 
areas 
of 
activity, 
and 
increases 
in 
travel 
and 
motor 
vehicle 
taxes. 
These revenue 
increases 
are 
expected 
to 
substantially 
offset 
revenue 
losses 
that 
could 
result 
from 
the 
reduction 
in 
the 
maximum 
tariff 
rate and 
the 
reduction 
in 
corporate 
tax 
rates 
by 
5 
percent 
each. 
Actual 
results 
for 
the 
first 
three 
quarters 
of 
FY03 
are 
encouraging, 
with 
revenue 
collections 
growing 
by 
about 
20.3 
percent over 
the 
same 
period 
in 
FY02. 
Budget 
deficit 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
FY03 
declined 
to 
Tk36.6 
billion, 
compared 
with 
Tk70.9 
billion 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
FY02. 
29. 
Improving 
Fiscal Transparency 
and 
Budget Management. 
Several actions have 
been 
taken 
to 
improve 
fiscal 
transparency and 
ensure 
that day-to-day 
fiscal 
management 
is 
put 
on 
a 
sounder 
footing. 
Monthly 
fiscal 
performance 
reports 
are 
now 
generated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
information 
gathered 
from 
a 
computerized 
budgeting 
and 
accounting 
database. 
Annual 
Development 
Program related 
fund 
releases 
are 
monitored 
on 
a 
daily 
basis, 
as 
is 
Government’s 
borrowing 
from 
the 
banking 
system. 
The 
performance 
of 
10 
major 
SOEs, 
which 
account 
for 
about  80 percent 
of 
total 
SOE 
contribution to 
GDP, 
is 
being 
monitored regularly 
as 
are 
inter-agency 
arrears 
owed 
to 
government. 
An 
inter-ministerial 
data 
monitoring 
and 
reconciliation 
task 
force 
has 
been 
formed 
to 
reconcile 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
data. 
By 
streamlining 
budgetary 
procedures,  the 
carryover 
of 
expenditures 
into 
the 
next 
fiscal 
year 
has 
been 
dramatically 
reduced 
from 
Tk. 
17 
billion 
in 
FY02 
to 
Tk.5 
billion 
in 
FY03. 
30. 
Medium-Term 
Macroeconomic 
Framework. 
The 
Government’s 
medium-term 
macroeconomic 
framework, 
jointly 
agreed 
with 
the 
JMF 
and 
the 
World 
Bank,  provides 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
sustainable 
fiscal deficits 
and 
targets an acceleration 
in 
the 
rate 
of 
economic 
growth. 
Table 
3 
summarizes 
the 
program’s 
key 
elements, 
details 
of 
which 
are 
discussed 
in 
Annex 
C. 
Fiscal 
projections 
are 
consistent 
with 
Bangladesh’s 
reform 
needs, 
with 
increased revenue 
mobilization 
and 
better 
prioritized 
expenditures 
being 
central 
elements 
of 
the 
budget 
strategy 
over 
the 
medium 
term. 
3 
1. 
Prioritizing 
expenditures. 
On 
the expenditure 
side, 
the 
medium-term 
expenditure 
framework 
is 
expected 
to 
continue 
Bangladesh’s 
long 
standing 
tradition 
of 
emphasizing investment 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
and 
in 
rural 
infrastructure. 
Health 
and education 
expenditures 
combined 
have averaged 23 percent 
of 
the 
total 
budgetary 
expenditures 
during 
the past 
10 
years 
and 
similar 
allocations 
are 
projected for 
the future. 
For 
FY03, 
the education 
sector gets 
top 
priority 
and 
accounts 
for 
15.4 
percent 
of 
total 
expenditures, 
while 
the 
health 
sector 
accounts 
for 
7 
percent. Defense 
expenditures 
remain 
low 
by 
developing country 
and 
South 
Asian 
standards, 
accounting 
for 
less 
than 
1.5 
percent 
of 
GDP or 
7.8 
percent 
of 
total 
expenditures. 
Nevertheless, 
further 
streamlining 
the 
ADP 
and 
strengthening 
MDG-related 
expenditures 
remains 
priority 
areas 
for 
action.6 
32. 
To 
provide 
an 
actionable 
plan 
for 
implementation 
of 
these 
priority 
measures, 
the 
Government 
has 
established 
a 
high-level 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
Commission 
which 
recently 
submitted 
its 
Interim 
report. 
The 
recommendations  focus 
on 
improving 
the 
project 
selection and 
project 
approval  criteria, 
stressing 
in 
particular 
the 
need 
for 
reduction 
in 
the 
number 
of 
unapproved 
projects 
(currently representing 
22 
percent 
of 
all 
ADP 
projects), 
and termination 
of 
low 
quality 
projects. 
The 
Commission 
deemed the 
following 
projects 
as 
low 
quality: 
projects that receive 
nominal 
allocations 
at such 
low 
rate that 
it 
would 
take 
many 
years 
to 
complete; 
projects 
that 
are 
better 
performed 
by 
the 
private 
sector 
(e.g., 
management 
of 
trucks 
and 
buses, 
ferries, 
motels, 
etc.); 
and projects prepared 
on 
unsound technical or 
financial 
grounds. 
Other 
recommendations 
pertain 
to 
improving 
the 
balance 
between 
capital and 
recurrent 
expenditures 
and 
unification 
of 
revenue 
and development 
budget, 
among 
others. 
It 
will 
be 
particularly 
beneficial 
to 
merge 
the 
Ministries 
of 
Finance 
and Planning.

these 
recommendations,  above

Expenditure 
Review,

priority 
projects have 
been 
dropped 
from 
the 
ADP. 
The 
Government 
is 
now 
in 
the 
process 
of 
reallocating 
the 
fi-eed 
funds 
to 
higher 
priority 
areas 
and 
implementing 
the 
other recommendations 
of 
the 
Expenditure 
Commission. 
Priority 
areas 
- 
MDG-related 
and 
social 
sector 
expenditures 
- 
need 
increased 
allocations 
together 
with 
improvements 
in 
effectiveness and 
targeting 
(discussed 
in 
more detail 
in 
the 
section 
on 
human 
development, Section 
V-C). 
In 
the 
education 
sector, 
the 
emphasis 
is 
on 
improvements 
in 
quality 
and 
equity. 
In 
the 
health 
sector, 
wages 
and salaries 
still 
preempt 
large 
share 
of 
the 
health 
revenue 
budget, 
squeezing non-wage 
inputs 
such 
as 
drugs 
and 
medicines. 
Non-wage 
inputs, 
such 
as 
medical 
and 
surgical 
requisites  and 
inputs 
for 
the 
essential  service 
package,  are 
therefore  expected 
to 
receive 
priority 
allocations. 
Spending 
for 
human 
capital 
development 
is 
targeted 
to 
rise 
by 
at least 
1 
percentage 
point 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY04. 
33. 
The 
projected 
higher 
fiscal deficits 
in 
FY04-06 
reflect 
increasing 
development expenditures 
and 
the  adjustment  cost 
of 
reforms 
that 
will 
be 
borne 
by 
the  government  budget. 
The 
increases 
in 
development expenditure 
are 
largely 
due 
to 
expenditures 
on 
additional poverty 
reduction 
efforts 
in 
line 
with 
the 
vision 
and 
strateges enunciated 
in 
the I-PRSP. 
The 
reform 
costs, 
largely 
on 
account 
of 
SOEs 
and 
NCBs, 
are 
estimated 
to 
amount 
to 
about 
Tk43 
billion 
(nearly  $750 
million) 
in 
FY04 
and 
FY05 
annually, 
both 
on 
account 
of 
cqrrent 
(severance 
payments, 
additional 
interest  cost) 
and 
capital 
(debt 
absorption, 
arrears 
settlement) 
costs.7 
The 
higher 
fiscal deficits 
are 
expected 
to 
be financed 
by 
increased 
external 
financing 
on 
concessional 
terms, 
with 
domestic 
financing 
remaining 
stable at 
around 
1.9-2 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
From 
FY06 
onward, the 
fiscal 
path 
is 
expected 
to 
show 
further 
consolidation, 
with 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
overall 
government 
deficit. 
This 
would 
be facilitated 
by 
the 
closure/privatization 
of 
manufacturing 
SOEs 
and 
the 
restructuring 
of 
energy  sector 
SOEs 
by 
FY05. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
SOE 
investment 
program 
included 
in 
the 
ADP 
had 
risen 
substantially 
since the 
early nineties 
to 
around 
Tk. 
5 
8 
billion, 
or 
almost 
one-third 
of 
the 
total 
ADP. 
The 
SOEs 
in 
manufacturing 
and 
energy together have 
been 
the 
highest 
claimant 
of 
budgetary financing. 
About 
95 
percent 
of 
their 
investment 
were 
financed 
under 
the 
ADP 
because 
these 
entities 
generated 
very 
little 
internal 
resources. 
With 
the 
completion 
of 
their 
privatization 
and 
restructuring 
program 
by 
FY05, 
the 
central  Government  budget 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
substantially 
relieved 
of 
this 
wasteful 
expenditure burden. 
34. 
With 
regards 
to 
the balance 
of 
payments 
outlook, 
the 
projections 
assume 
that, 
with 
the 
revival 
in 
the 
global 
economic environment, 
a 
flexible 
exchange 
rate 
regime 
and 
reduction 
in 
the 
domestic cost 
of 
doing 
business, 
Bangladesh 
will 
be 
able 
to 
improve 
its 
export 
growth 
performance 
gradually 
from 
modest 
single 
digit 
to 
high 
single 
digit 
levels. 
The 
balance 
of 
payments 
current 
account 
deficit 
is 
projected to 
widen 
to 
1.3 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY04, 
increasing 
further 
to 
1.6 
percent 
in 
FY05, 
as 
imports 
grow 
responding 
to 
higher 
growth 
and 
trade 
liberalization,  and 
declining 
thereafter 
to 
1.3 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY07. 
The 
framework 
projects a 
realistic 
increase 
of 
GDP growth 
rates 
from 
the 
expected 
5.2 
percent 
in 
FY03 
to 
5.5 
percent 
in 
FY04, reaching 
6.5 
percent 
in 
FY06. 
The 
Government’s 
I-PRSP 
envisages 
that 
these 
rates 
of 
economic 
growth, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
other 
pro-poor 
policies, 
will 
help 
achieve 
the target 
of 
halving 
the 
number 
of 
people 
living 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
by 
2015.  These 
projections 
are 
subject 
to 
significant 
downside 
risks, 
particularly 
higher 
oil 
prices, 
potential 
losses 
in 
worker’s 
remittances, 
disruptions 
in 
exports 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
prolonged 
instability 
in 
the 
Middle-East 
and loss 
of 
market 
share 
in 
RMG 
exports 
following 
the phase-out 
of 
MFA 
in 
2005. 
Liberalizing 
the 
Exchange 
and 
Trade 
Regime 
35. 
Trade 
policy 
reform 
in 
Bangladesh, 
particularly 
since 
1992, has 
emphasized 
the 
liberalization 
of 
imports 
through the 
removal 
of 
quantitative 
restrictions, 
a 
reduction 
in 
nominal 
and 
effective tariffs, 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
unified 
and 
moderately 
flexible 
exchange 
rate 
regime. 
By 
increasing competition and 
’ 
A 
large 
proportion 
of 
these 
costs are 
expected 
to 
be 
financed outside 
the 
central 
government 
budget, 
for 
example 
through 
the 
issuance 
of 
bonds.

raising 
productivity, 
these 
reforms 
have 
been 
largely 
responsible 
for 
Bangladesh’s greater 
integration 
in 
the 
global 
economy and 
have 
contributed 
to 
an increased 
pace 
of 
economic 
growth. 
36. 
The Government 
has 
resumed 
liberalizing 
the 
trade 
regme, 
a process 
which had 
stagnated 
during 
the latter 
half 
of 
the 
199Os, 
by 
reducing 
the 
maximum 
tariff 
rate 
by 
5 percentage 
points 
to 
32.5 
percent 
in 
FY03 
and 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
rates 
to 
5 
(including 
zero). 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
average 
operative 
tariff 
has 
fallen 
to 
about 
17 
percent, 
from 
89 
percent 
in 
199 
1. 
There 
has 
also been 
significant rationalization 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
supplementary 
duties, 
with 
the 
number 
of 
rates 
reduced 
from 
31 
to 
5. 
The 
FY03 
Budget 
Speech also 
announced Government’s 
intent 
to 
move 
to 
a three-tier 
tariff 
structure 
over 
a three-year 
period, 
with 
a 
maximum 
tariff 
rate 
of 
25 
percent. 
In 
accordance 
with 
this 
time-table, 
the 
maximum 
tariff 
rate 
will 
be reduced 
to 
30 
percent 
in 
FY04. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
keep 
in 
mind 
that 
import 
taxes 
remain 
an 
important 
source 
of 
revenue 
and 
account 
for 50 
percent 
of 
tax 
revenues. Therefore, 
while 
faster 
tariff 
reduction 
is 
desirable, 
it 
will 
have 
to 
be 
phased 
in 
and 
accompanied 
by 
a 
shift 
to 
domestic taxation. 
37. 
Good 
progress 
is 
also 
being 
made 
in 
implementing 
customs 
reform, 
which 
was 
initiated 
four 
years 
ago, 
supported 
by 
the 
IDA-financed 
Export 
Diversification 
Project. 
Customs procedures 
are 
being 
revised 
to 
make 
them 
compatible 
for 
operating 
in 
a 
computerized 
environment, 
and 
ASYCUDA++ 
(UNCTAD’s 
customs 
computerization 
package) 
is 
being 
implemented.  Less than 
10 
signatures 
are 
now 
required 
on 
Bills 
of 
Entry 
compared 
to 
25 
a 
few 
years 
ago, 
and 
only 
10 
percent 
of 
the 
consignments 
are 
subjected 
to 
physical 
inspection 
compared 
to 
the past 
practice 
of 
inspecting 
every 
consignment. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
improvement 
in 
procedures, clearance 
time 
has 
been reduced 
from 
72 
hours 
in 
1999 
to 
less 
than 
10 
hours 
in 
2001 and 
further 
to 
3 
hours now, 
for 
95 
percent 
of 
the 
consignments. 
38. 
Bangladesh 
unified 
its 
exchange 
rate 
and 
moved 
from 
a 
fixed 
to 
a 
moderately 
flexible 
exchange 
regime 
in 
199 
1. 
Since 
then, 
the 
real 
effective 
exchange 
rate 
(REER) 
has 
been 
remarkably 
stable, 
moving 
within 
a 
fairly 
small 
band 
of 
about 
5 
percent 
around 
its 
trend, 
which 
indicates 
slow 
devaluation 
from 
1991 
up 
to 
about 
2001, 
followed 
by 
modest 
appreciation 
since 
then. 
The 
strength 
of 
the 
Taka 
during 
this 
period 
has 
in 
part 
been 
due 
to 
the 
rapid 
growth 
of 
ready-made garment 
(RMG) 
exports, 
which 
increased 
from 
$US 
116 
million 
in 
1985 
to 
US 
4.8 
billion 
in 
2000, 
and 
growing 
remittances, 
which 
rose 
from 
$390 
million 
to 
$1.9 
billion 
during 
the 
same 
period. 
Bangladesh’s 
exports 
grew 
a 
strong 
14 
percent 
per 
annum 
during 
the 
199Os, 
driven 
by 
a 
remarkable 
17 
percent annual 
growth 
of 
RMG 
exports, 
which 
thrived 
under 
the 
MFA 
quota 
regime. 
The reduction 
in 
tariffs 
and 
removal 
of 
protective 
QRs 
eliminated 
much 
of 
the 
anti-export 
bias, 
while 
a 
policy 
of 
slow 
devaluation 
and 
prudent 
management 
of 
the 
REER 
helped 
to 
maintain 
competitiveness 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
exports. 
The 
IMF 
is 
discussing 
further  liberalization 
of 
exchange 
rate 
management 
with 
the 
Government 
and 
expects 
to 
support 
this 
action 
under 
the proposed 
PRGF 
operation. 
39. 
The 
phase 
out 
of 
the 
MFA 
in 
2005 
presents 
opportunities 
as 
well 
as 
serious  challenges 
to 
Bangladesh’s 
exports, 
75 
percent 
of 
which 
are 
made 
up 
of 
RMG. 
While 
price 
competitiveness  and a 
motivated labor 
force 
are 
its 
strengths, 
the 
RMG 
sector’s 
position 
as 
a 
“cut, 
make and 
trim” 
(CMT) 
producer, 
without 
direct 
contact 
with 
leading market 
players, 
long 
lead 
times 
due 
to 
delays at 
the 
port 
as 
well 
as 
limited 
backward 
linkage, 
poor 
technology 
base 
and 
lack 
of 
product 
design 
and 
development 
capabilities 
are 
seen 
as 
weaknesses 
in 
a 
more competitive 
post-MFA 
global 
RMG 
market. 
Addressing 
key 
infrastructure 
bottlenecks, 
improving 
the 
regulatory 
environment, 
and 
improving 
competitiveness 
by 
reducing 
the 
cost 
of 
doing 
business 
should 
enable 
Bangladesh 
to 
cope 
with 
these 
impending 
external 
developments 
and 
sustain 
past 
export 
performance.8

Reforming 
State-Owned 
Enterprises 
40. 
As 
discussed 
in 
Section 
IV 
above, 
an 
important 
element 
in 
Government’s strategy 
to 
improve 
the 
climate 
for  private 
sector 
led 
growth 
is 
to 
withdraw 
completely 
from 
participating 
directly 
in 
manufacturing 
activity 
and 
significantly 
reduce 
the 
adverse 
impact 
of 
state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs) 
on 
the  economy. 
With 
physical 
assets 
equivalent 
to 
an  estimated 
35 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
employment 
of 
250,000, 
and 
investment 
equal 
to 
9 
percent 
of 
gross 
domestic investment, 
SOEs 
have remained a 
huge 
drag 
on 
the 
Bangladeshi 
ec~nomy.~ 
Consolidated 
data 
on 
SOEs 
indicate 
that 
their 
financial 
performance 
has 
worsened 
in 
recent 
years, 
leading 
them 
to 
make increasing 
demands 
on 
budgetary 
resources, 
directly 
or 
indirectly. 
Gross 
SOE 
losses 
per 
year, 
counting 
only 
the 
loss-mahng 
entities, 
have 
averaged 
Tk.15 
billion 
annually 
(about 
US$340 
million), 
or 
about 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
every 
year. 
SOE 
deficits 
are 
financed 
largely 
through 
the 
Annual 
Development 
Program 
(accounting 
for 
one-third 
of 
the 
central 
government 
budget 
deficit 
during 
FYO 
1 
-02), 
borrowing 
from 
nationalized commercial 
banks 
with 
explicit 
or 
implicit 
government 
guarantees, 
and  default 
on 
debt  service 
and 
other 
liabilities. 
These 
deficits, 
constituting 
9-12 
percent 
of 
total 
domestic 
credit 
during 
FY 
1994-2000, have 
had 
a 
significant effect 
on 
credit 
creation  and 
consequent 
monetary 
expansion 
in 
the  economy. 
The 
cost 
to 
the 
economy 
of 
inefficient 
services 
in 
energy, 
telecommunications, 
railways, 
ports, and other 
public 
utilities 
and banking, 
in 
terms 
of 
increased 
cost 
of 
doing 
business, 
foregone economic 
opportunities 
and 
lost 
consumer 
welfare 
has 
been 
very 
high. 
The 
coverage 
of 
basic services 
like 
power 
and 
gas 
has 
largely 
been 
limited 
to 
the 
urban 
non-poor, 
and 
associated subsidies have 
not 
benefited 
the 
large 
majority 
of 
the 
poor. 
41. 
Government 
policies 
-- 
administered 
pricing 
of 
outputs 
and 
inputs, 
wage 
and 
employment 
rigidities,  off-budget 
transfers 
and 
subsidies 
-- 
have 
undermined 
not 
just 
state 
enterprises’ 
fiscal 
performance 
but 
also 
their 
ability to 
contribute 
to 
development. 
State 
monopolies 
rule 
out competitive 
pricing 
in 
several 
sectors, 
and 
for 
several 
SOEs 
(particularly 
in 
the 
power, 
gas, 
and water 
sectors) 
a 
major 
cause 
of 
the 
high 
operational 
losses 
is 
the 
significant 
proportion 
of 
revenue leakage 
on 
account 
of 
theft, 
pilferage, and 
inadequate 
billing 
and 
collection. 
Most 
public 
utilities 
deliver 
services that 
are 
inadequate 
and 
of 
poor 
quality. 
In 
part 
because 
of 
the 
fiscal 
excesses 
and 
non-viability 
of 
state enterprises, 
public 
financial institutions 
(specialized development 
banks and 
nationalized commercial 
banks) 
suffer 
from 
a 
huge 
burden 
of 
non-performing 
loans 
and, 
consequently, 
capital 
inadequacy. 
42. 
Recognizing 
that 
fundamental 
reforms 
are  necessary 
in 
the 
state 
enterprise  sector 
over  the 
medium-term, 
the 
government has developed 
a 
program 
of 
closures 
and privatization, 
which 
it 
views 
as 
a 
central 
element 
of 
its 
broader 
economic 
refom 
agenda. 
In 
a 
politically 
bold 
decision, 
in 
July 
2002 the 
Government  closed Adamjee 
Jute 
Mills, 
the  largest 
jute 
mill 
in 
the 
world 
employing 
about 
25,000 
workers 
and 
accounting 
for 
about 
10 
percent 
of 
annual 
SOE 
losses. 
Labor 
union 
militancy,  weak 
management 
and pervasive 
corruption 
had 
characterized 
Adamjee’s 
operations. 
Government successfully 
negotiated 
the 
terms 
of 
closure 
with 
the 
workers and 
their 
unions, 
including 
a 
retrenchment package 
that 
has 
been designed 
to 
minimize 
social 
hardships 
caused 
by 
the 
lay-offs. 
Laid 
off 
workers 
from 
Adamjee 
have already 
been 
paid 
about Tk.3.6 
billion 
(US$62 
million) 
in 
retrenchment 
benefits, 
amounting 
to 
two 
months 
salary 
for 
every 
year 
of 
service 
plus 
a redundancy payment 
ranging 
from 
13 
to 
27 
percent 
of 
the 
calculated 
amounts, 
depending 
upon 
length 
of 
service. 
Adamjee’s 
closure has 
been generally 
supported 
within 
the 
country, and there 
have been 
no 
demonstrations 
or 
hartals 
(strikes) 
protesting 
it. 
Buoyed 
by 
its 
success, 
the Government 
has 
closed 
several 
other 
SOEs 
and 
paid-off 
the workers (Table 
4), 
reducing 
total 
SOE 
employment 
by 
about 
16 
percent. 
These 
closures represent an 
especially 
significant 
effort 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Government 
to 
withdraw 
from 
manufacturing activity, 
with 
retrenched workers  accounting 
for 
about 
25 
percent 
of 
all 
SOE 
employees engaged 
in 
manufacturing activity. 
The 
enterprises 
closed 
accounted 
for 
about 
41 
percent 
of 
the 
aggregate losses 
of 
SOEs 
engaged 
in 
manufacturing 
and 
17 
percent 
of 
total 
SOE 
losses.

While 
past 
privatization 
efforts  focused 
on 
the 
sale 
of 
mostly 
loss-making 
units 
in 
the 
manufacturing 
sector 
(mainly 
textiles),  the 
intention 
now 
is 
to 
expand 
privatization 
efforts 
to 
the 
state 
enterprise  sector 
as 
a whole. 
Cabinet 
approved 
a 
revised 
Privatization 
Policy 
in 
March 
2002 
clarifying 
Govemment’s  objectives and 
approach 
to 
privatization, 
signaling 
its 
commitment 
to 
reform. 
In 
addition 
to 
immediately 
subjecting 
the 
SOEs 
to 
a 
hard 
budget  constraint 
and 
limiting 
government 
guarantees 
for 
credit 
(agreed 
with 
Govemment 
and 
monitored 
under 
the 
IMF 
program), 
the 
Govemment 
intends 
to 
quickly 
transfer 
to 
the 
private 
sector those 
small 
to 
medium 
sized 
manufacturing 
enterprises 
whose 
privatization 
plans 
have 
already 
been 
approved 
and 
processed 
by 
the 
Privatization 
Commission. 
Deshbandhu 
Sugar 
Mill 
has 
been 
privatized, 
and 
an 
additional 
10 
enterprises 
are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
being 
handed over 
to 
the 
private 
sector, 
for 
a  combined 
price 
of 
Tk.1.5 
billion 
(US$26 
million), 
inclusive 
of 
long-term 
liabilities 
to 
be 
absorbed 
by 
purchasers. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
withdrawing 
the 
state 
further 
from 
manufacturing 
activities,  an 
additional 
105 
enterprises 
have been 
identified 
for 
closure/privatization over the 
FY04-06 
period, 
with 
retrenchment 
of 
around 
75,000 
workers. 
Strengthening 
the 
Financial 
System 
44. 
The 
I-PRSP 
notes 
that 
“a 
sound 
and 
well- 
functioning financial 
system 
is 
required 
for 
ensuring 
growth 
and 
providing 
access 
to 
financial 
resources 
to 
the 
poor”. 
Poor 
governance, 
lack 
of 
discipline, 
and 
inadequate disclosure are 
fundamental 
problems 
confronting 
the 
financial 
system 
in 
Bangladesh. 
Classified 
(non-performing)  loans amounted 
to 
about 3 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
total loan portfolio 
in 
the 
banking 
system 
at the end 
of 
June 
2002, 
using 
Bangladesh Bank’s 
standards, 
which 
are 
lax 
compared 
to 
intemational 
norms. 
The 
classified 
loans 
of 
the 
nationalized 
commercial 
banks  (NCBs) 
and 
specialized  development  banks 
(SDBs) 
are 
unsustainably 
high 
- 
19 
percent 
of 
loans 
net 
of 
provisions 
or 34 
percent 
on 
a 
gross basis 
for 
NCBs; 
16 
percent 
(net) 
and 
56 
percent 
(gross) 
for 
SDBs 
-- 
and 
show 
little 
change 
over 
time. 
While 
the 
classified 
loans 
of 
the private 
domestic 
banks have 
shown a 
downward 
trend, 
amounting 
to 
around 
16 
percent at the end 
of 
December 2002, the 
level 
is 
still 
high 
given 
their 
limited 
capital 
base. 
Loan 
recovery 
rates 
are 
low 
and, 
as 
of 
the 
end 
of 
June 
2002, 
all 
4 
NCBs, 
2 of 
the 
5 
SDBs, 
and 4 
of 
the 30 
private 
domestic 
banks 
had 
negative 
capital 
after 
the 
full 
provisioning 
requirements 
were 
taken 
into 
account. 
Even 
under  current 
classification 
and 
provisioning 
standards, 
the 
capital 
shortfall 
amounted 
to 
about Tk.55 
billion 
($1 
billion) 
on 
June 
30, 
2002 
-- 
this 
amount 
would 
almost double 
if 
international 
accounting 
standards 
were applied.

Retrenchments

The 
poor 
perfonnance 
is 
due 
to 
various problems 
afflicting public 
and 
private 
banks. 
There 
have 
been 
high 
levels 
of 
insider 
lending 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
banks 
and directed 
lending 
to 
state 
owned 
enterprises. 
Interest 
spreads 
have 
remained 
around 
7 
percent 
for 
the  past 
decade, 
symptomatic 
of 
15 
Page  24
inefficiencies 
and 
portfolio 
problems. 
As 
de 
facto 
industry 
leaders, 
the 
NCBs 
need 
these 
spreads 
to 
survive. 
But 
while 
the 
high 
spreads 
allow 
the 
more 
efficient 
foreign 
and domestic banks 
to 
earn handsome 
profits, 
they 
are 
still 
inadequate 
to 
cover 
the 
provisioning 
expenses 
of 
the 
NCBs 
and 
SDBs. 
The 
weak 
and 
inefficient 
financial 
system 
limits 
access 
to 
credit,  raises 
interest 
rates (real 
borrowing 
rates 
have 
exceeded 
10 
percent 
in 
certain 
years), 
and 
acts 
as 
a 
serious 
drag 
on 
economic 
growth. 
A 
recent 
World 
Bank 
study 
estimated 
that 
if 
financial 
sector 
inefficiencies 
had 
been 
removed 
20 years 
ago, 
real 
GDP 
per 
capita 
would 
have 
been 
15-37 percent 
higher 
by 
1995.'' 
46. 
Soon 
after  talung  office, 
the 
Government 
began 
dealing 
with 
the 
problems 
confronting 
the 
financial 
sector 
by 
appointing 
a 
Banking 
Reform 
Committee, 
which 
has 
recently 
provided 
Government 
with 
its 
recommendations. 
A 
key 
priority 
identified 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
central bank's oversight 
over 
the 
bankmg 
system 
and 
give 
it 
autonomy 
over 
monetary 
and  exchange 
rate policies. 
Accordingly, 
the 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
Order 
of 
1972 
has 
been 
amended. 
The 
Bankmg 
Companies 
Act 
of 
1991 and 
the 
Bangladesh 
Banks 
(Nationalization) 
Order 
have also 
been 
amended 
by 
removing 
the 
provisions 
that 
kept 
the 
NCBs 
and 
SDBs 
outside 
the 
purview 
of 
the 
central bank. 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
has 
been 
receiving 
technical 
assistance 
from 
the 
IMF 
and 
the 
U.S. 
Treasury 
and 
is 
implementing 
a 
program 
to 
upgrade 
its 
management, 
operational 
processes 
and 
systems 
and 
staff 
resources 
with 
IDA 
assistance 
under 
the 
Central 
Bank 
Strengthening 
project. 
47. 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
has 
issued 
Circulars 
to 
(i) 
raise 
the 
risk 
weighted capital 
adequacy 
threshold 
for 
banks 
from 
8 
to 
9 
percent, 
to 
be 
complied 
with 
by 
June 
30, 
2003; 
and 
(ii) 
restrict 
dividend 
payment 
by 
banks 
in 
excess 
of 
20% 
by 
requiring 
an 
equivalent 
amount 
to be 
set 
aside 
for 
reserves. 
Minimum 
capital 
requirements 
are 
being 
increased 
from 
Tk.200 
million 
(US$3 
million) 
to 
Tk. 
1 
billion 
(US$17 
million). 
The 
Government has 
abolished 
four 
National 
Savings 
Certificate 
schemes 
that 
paid 
disproportionately 
high 
rates 
of 
interest, at 
a 
huge 
cost 
to 
the 
treasury, 
and 
impinged 
on 
the 
ability 
of 
financial institutions 
to 
issue 
long-term 
liabilities 
instruments attractive 
to 
the 
general 
public. 
Government 
has 
also 
restricted 
access 
to 
the 
remaining 
schemes 
to 
private 
individuals. 
The 
Money 
Laundering Prevention 
Act,

consistent 
with 
the 
recommendations

the 
recently 
concluded 
Financial 
Sector 
Assessment 
Program", 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
will 
engage 
reputable 
firms 
to 
audit 
the 
four 
NCBs, 
based 
on 
international 
auditing

standards. 
New 
lending 
by 
NCBs 
will 
be 
restricted through

limits 
on 
net 
lending 
and

limit. 
About 
a 
hundred 
branches 
of 
NCBs 
have 
already 
been 
closed, 
and 
additional 
branches 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
closed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2003. 
Government intends 
to 
initiate 
actions 
to 
privatize 
one 
of 
the 
four 
NCBs 
(Rupali 
Bank, 
which 
accounts 
for 
6 
percent 
of

system 
assets) 
and 
engage 
new 
professional 
management 
for 
a 
second 
NCB, 
Agrani 
Bank. 
49. 
Over 
the 
medium-term, 
the 
goal 
is 
for 
government 
to 
divest 
the 
NCBs, 
either 
through 
partial 
or 
full 
privatization. 
A 
comprehensive strategy 
to 
define

will 
be 
adopted 
by 
mid-2004.  The 
Government 
has

While 
there have been recent improvements, 
poor 
financial 
performance 
of 
state-owned energy 
 enterprise^'^, 
and 
inadequate 
services, 
contribute 
to 
the 
poor 
overall 
performance 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
SOEs. 
Key 
challenges 
in 
the 
short 
term 
are 
to 
stabilize 
the 
financial condition 
of 
the 
sector, 
improve 
governance 
and accountability, 
strengthen 
and 
expand the already successful 
rural 
electrification 
program, prepare the 
urban electricity distribution 
business 
for 
private 
sector 
participation,  continue 
to 
attract 
private 
capital 
and operating 
expertise 
for power 
generation 
and 
gas 
production, and 
deregulate the 
petroleum 
sector. 
52. 
In 
the 
power 
sector, 
over 
the 
last 
two 
years, 
there 
has 
been a noticeable 
improvement 
in 
the 
reliability 
of 
electricity 
supply 
(with 
the 
commissioning 
of 
two new 
independent 
power plants 
with 
a 
capacity 
of 
8 
10 
MW), 
a 
sustained 
reduction 
in 
system 
losses, 
an 
improvement 
in 
revenue 
collection,  and 
an 
expansion 
in 
rural 
access 
on 
a 
promising institutional 
and 
financial 
foundation. 
System 
losses 
(as 
a 
percent 
of 
total 
generation) have 
reduced 
from 
35 
percent 
to 
30 percent, 
collections 
(as 
a percent 
of 
generated 
electricity) 
have increased 
from 
60 
percent 
to 
70 
percent, 
and almost a 
million 
new 
customers 
are 
now 
being 
supplied 
by 
the 
rural 
electricity 
cooperatives 
(Palli 
Bidyut 
Samitis 
or 
PBS’).  Bangladesh’s 
power 
sector 
system loss 
is 
now 
lower 
than 
in 
most 
Indian 
states, 
although 
it 
is 
higher 
than Pakistan and 
Sri 
Lanka 
where 
losses 
are 
in 
the 
18-20 
percent 
range. 
These 
improvements 
are 
a 
result 
of 
the transfer 
of 
low 
consumption 
density 
distribution 
areas 
from 
BPDBDESA 
to 
PBSs 
(which 
have 
better incentives 
and 
a 
record 
of 
improving 
performance 
in 
such 
areas), 
improved 
performance 
of 
corporatized 
DESCO 
and 
PGCB, and 
Govemment-initiated 
dnves 
to 
disconnect 
illegal 
consumers 
and 
collect unpaid 
bills. 
There 
have also 
been 
two tariff 
adjustments since January 
1, 
2002, 
which 
have 
helped 
improve 
cost-recovery 
and 
reduce 
tariff 
distortions between 
customer categories. 
However, 
the 
power 
sector’s 
performance 
remains 
unsatisfactory: 
69 
percent 
of 
the 
population, 
mostly 
in 
rural 
areas, 
does 
not 
have 
access 
- 
the 
Household 
Income 
and 
Expenditure 
Survey 
2000 
indicated 
that 
only 
about 
3 
1 
percent 
of 
households have 
access 
to 
electricity 
(80 
percent 
in 
urban 
areas 
and 
19 percent 
in 
rural),  compared 
with 
21 
percent 
in 
1995- 
96. 
The 
sector 
is 
financially 
bankrupt 
and 
relies 
heavily 
on 
budget 
support. 
BPDB’s 
liabilities 
at the 
end 
of 
FYOl 
were 
about 
Tk.118 
billion 
($2.1 
billion), 
equivalent 
to 
4.6 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Half 
these 
liabilities 
were current. 
Furthermore, 
even 
with 
budget 
support under 
the 
ADP 
of 
Tk.5.64 
billion 
($100 
million) 
in 
FYOl, 
BPDB 
reported 
a 
net 
loss 
of 
Tk.3.75 
billion 
($67 
million). 
The 
bulk 
of 
these 
losses 
and accumulated 
liabilities 
are 
on 
account 
of 
subsidies 
enjoyed 
by 
the 
“connected” 
minority 
and 
the 
high 
level 
of 
electricity 
theft. 
Power 
shortages 
and 
outages 
have 
inflicted 
substantial 
costs 
on 
the 
economy. 
Power 
elasticity 
of 
GDP 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
estimated 
at between 
0.3 
to 
0.5

of

mentioned 
above, 
96 
percent 
of 
business 
enterprises 
surveyed 
report 
that 
access 
of 
power 
supply 
is 
a 
serious 
problem. 
Recent 
improvements  notwithstanding, 
inefficiencies 
are 
still 
high; 
tariffs 
are 
unbalanced 
favoring 
the 
middle 
and 
upper 
classes 
and 
there 
is 
neither a 
transparent 
policy 
nor 
regulatory 
mechanism 
on 
setting 
tariffs. 
For 
example, 
urban 
households 
continue 
to 
enjoy 
300 
kwWmonth 
of 
subsidized 
electricity. 
53. 
In 
the 
oil 
sector, 
domestic 
petroleum 
products prices 
have 
not 
been 
revised 
in 
line 
with 
changes 
in 
the 
international 
market, 
resulting 
in 
the 
state-owned  Bangladesh 
Petroleum 
Corporation 
(BPC) 
building 
up 
huge 
liabilities, 
which 
have 
been financed 
through borrowings 
from 
the 
commercial 
banks. 
The 
existing  petroleum 
products 
pricing 
system 
is 
not 
transparent  (imports, 
refining, 
transport, 
distribution), 
there 
is 
little 
competition, 
and 
a 
conducive 
environment 
does 
not 
exist 
for 
attracting credible 
private 
sector 
investments. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
competition 
and an 
adequate 
pricing 
system, 
all 
entities 
in 
the 
petroleum 
downstream 
market 
(refinery, 
marketing 
companies 
- 
which 
are 
all 
state-owned) 
are 
in 
poor 
financial 
health, have 
no 
incentives 
for 
efficiency 
improvement, 
and 
provide 
poor 
quality 
of 
service 
to 
consumers. 
Similarly, 
the 
natural 
gas 
sector 
faces 
financial  difficulties,  and 
the 
state-owned 
PetroBangla Corporation 
neither 
has 
the operational autonomy 
nor 
is 
allowed 
market-based 
wellhead 
prices 
to 
fund 
exploration 
and 
gas 
field 
development. 
The 
financial 
position 
of 
gas 
transmission 
and 
distribution 
entities 
is 
the 
same, 
and 
the 
gas 
sector 
and 
petroleum 
products markets continue 
to 
be 
regulated 
in 
an 
ad 
hoc 
manner. 
54. 
Convinced 
of 
the 
need 
for 
deep 
and 
broad 
structural 
reforms 
in 
the 
energy 
sector, 
the 
Government 
has 
committed 
to 
implementing 
a 
comprehensive 
reform 
program, 
consisting 
of 
the 
following 
four 
main 
stages: 
(a) 
formulation 
and 
announcement 
of 
a 
policy 
statement that 
provides 
the 
broad 
guidelines 
for 
the 
reform 
program; 
(b) 
development 
of 
a 
transparent 
regulatory framework 
for 
the 
electricity, 
gas, 
and 
petroleum 
markets; 
(c) 
unbundling 
of 
the 
vertically 
integrated 
electricity and 
gas 
sector 
utilities 
and 
establishing markets 
in 
which 
electricity 
and 
gas 
are 
traded at 
an 
arm's 
length; 
and 
(d) 
divestiture 
of 
the 
state 
ownership 
in 
most 
of 
the 
segments 
of 
the 
markets. 
55. 
The 
Government 
has 
adopted 
a 
two-phased approach that 
involves, 
first, 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
early 
actions 
and, 
second, 
deeper 
structural 
reforms 
to 
be 
undertaken 
over 
the 
next 
two 
to 
three 
years. 
The 
first 
set 
of 
actions 
has 
responded 
to 
the 
financial 
crisis 
in 
the 
energy 
sector. 
Tariffs 
have 
been 
adjusted 
upwards and 
programs 
instituted, 
particularly 
in 
the 
power 
sector, 
to 
reduce 
system 
losses 
and 
increase 
collections.  Since 
coming 
to 
power, 
the 
Government 
has 
increased 
BPDB 
power tariffs 
by 
8 
percent 
and 
DESA 
power 
tariffs 
by 
7 
percent 
The 
subsidy 
for 
domestic consumers 
has 
been reduced 
slightly 
by 
the 
split 
of 
the 
300 
kWmonth 
tariff 
block into 
two 
blocks. 
End-user 
power tariffs 
now 
range 
from 
US 
cents 
3.2kwh 
or 
about 
US 
cents 
1Okwh 
(Tk1.8-5.7 
per 
kwh), 
with 
industrial 
and 
commercial 
consumers 
cross-subsidizing 
household consumption. 
Notably, 
rural 
customers 
pay 
tariffs 
considerably 
higher 
than 
urban 
customers 
(rural 
households 
pay 
30 
percent 
more 
than 
Dhaka 
households)  and 
irrigation 
consumption 
is 
not 
subsidized 
(rural 
farmers 
pay 
an average 
of 
Tk.2.78kwh 
or 
US 
cents 
5kWh). 
In 
2002, 
the 
price 
of 
motor 
spirits 
was 
increased 
by 
22 
percent, 
diesel 
and 
kerosene 
by 
10 
percent, 
and 
natural 
gas 
prices 
by 
10 
percent. 
Petrol 
and 
diesel 
prices 
were  increased 
by 
a 
further 
17 
percent 
in 
January 
2003, 
while 
the 
price 
of 
kerosene was 
left 
unchanged.

Over 
the 
next 
few 
months 
it 
is 
expected that 
the 
Government 
will: 
Adopt 
an 
interim 
pricing 
framework 
for 
electricity, 
gas 
and 
petroleum 
products 
as 
a 
step 
toward 
commercializing 
sector 
operations 
and 
to 
help 
provide 
policy 
guidance 
to 
the 
new 
regulator. 
Since December 
2001, 
the Government 
and 
the 
Bank 
have 
had 
extensive discussions 
on 
energy 
pricing.16 
The 
pricing 
framework 
will 
allow 
formula-based 
frequent 
tariff 
adjustments 
in 
line 
with 
international market 
prices. 
Prices 
of 
petroleum 
products 
will 
be 
based 
on 
import 
parity 
prices;  the 
price 
of 
gas 
will 
be 
linked 
with 
the 
international 
price 
of 
high 
sulfur 
fuel 
oil 
and 
power tariffs 
would 
reflect 
movements 
in 
gadfuel 
oil 
prices 
and 
other 
variable 
costs. 
The 
prices 
for  power 
will 
be 
reviewed 
quarterly, 
while 
those 
for 
gas 
and 
petroleum 
will 
be 
reviewed 
monthly. 
While 
prices 
will 
normally 
be 
adjusted semi-annually, 
more 
frequent adjustments 
could 
be 
made 
if 
these 
are made 
necessary 
by 
international price 
movements 
and 
other  economic 
factors. 
Eliminate 
the 
second 
block 
of 
subsidized 
urban 
household 
electricity 
consumption 
(200 
kwmonth) 
(recognizing 
that 
the 
first 
subsidized 
block 
of 
100 
kWmonth 
is 
more 
than 
sufficient 
to 
protect 
the 
poor) 
and 
implement 
the 
first 
steps 
to 
adjust 
gas 
and 
petroleum 
prices 
in 
line 
with 
the 
pricing 
framework. 
Announce 
its 
road map 
on 
energy 
sector 
reform 
covering 
the 
next 
3 
years and 
outlining 
the 
Government’s 
vision 
on 
sector 
restructuring,  ownership, 
private 
sector 
participation,  regulation, 
and 
related 
matters; 
and 
Continue 
its 
performance improvement drives 
to 
reduce 
system 
losses 
and 
improve 
collections 
in 
the 
power 
sector. 
57. 
Following 
the 
policy 
announcement, 
the 
Government 
will 
commence 
implementing 
the 
energy 
sector 
reform 
program 
by 
introducing 
a 
sequence 
of 
structural 
changes 
over 
the 
next 
two 
to 
three 
years. 
Among 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
petroleum 
sector  are 
the 
passage 
of 
a 
Competition Law, 
deregulation 
of 
crude/product 
imports, 
improved 
safety 
of 
installations/outlets  and 
privatization 
of 
at  least 
two 
Oil 
Marketing 
Companies. 
Medium-term 
reforms 
proposed 
for 
the 
natural 
gas 
sector 
include 
unbundling 
of 
Petrobangla, 
Titas 
Gas 
and 
the 
Gas 
Transmission 
Company, 
further  refinement 
of 
the 
gas 
tariff 
framework, 
operationalization 
of 
a 
new 
regulatory 
framework, 
and 
privatization 
of 
at  least 
two 
distribution 
companies 
through competitive 
tendering.

Major 
structural 
changes 
in 
the 
power 
sector are envisaged, 
including 
unbundlingkorporatization 
of 
BPDB, 
resulting 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
several generation companies, one 
national 
grid 
company (already 
in 
place), 
and 
a 
few 
distribution 
companies 
to 
serve 
urban 
areas, 
complementing 
rural 
distribution 
by 
local 
cooperatives 
(PBSs). 
Issuing 
licenses 
to all 
power 
sectors 
entities 
by 
the 
new 
Energy 
Regulatory 
Commission, 
adoption 
and 
implementation 
of 
a 
Financial 
Action 
Plan  for 
BPDB 
and 
DESA, 
commercialization 
of 
power 
sector entities, 
and 
preparing 
the 
urban electricity 
distribution 
market 
for 
private 
sector 
participation 
are the other 
major 
changes 
planned 
for 
the 
power 
sector. 
Improving 
Telecommunication 
Services 
59. 
Bangladesh’s 
telecommunications 
sector 
remains 
a 
significant 
constraint 
to 
economic 
growth. 
Despite 
being 
the 
first 
country 
in 
the 
region 
to 
license 
private 
operators 
to 
provide 
services 
in 
1989, 
Bangladesh lags 
behind 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
South 
Asia 
region, 
both 
in 
the  coverage  and 
quality 
of 
telecommunications 
services. 
The 
overall 
level 
of 
teledensity 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
very 
low 
at 
approximately 
0.83 
lines 
per 
hundred 
persons compared 
to 
an international 
low 
income 
group 
average 
of 
4 
lines 
per 
hundred 
persons. 
Although 
approximately 
80 
percent 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
population 
reside 
in 
rural 
areas, 
The 
Bank 
recommendations 
are 
summarized 
in 
Bangladesh: 
Considerations 
on 
Energy 
Pricing, Energy 
and 
Infrastructure 
Unit, 
South 
Asia 
Region, 
January

access 
to 
services 
in 
these 
areas 
is 
limited. 
Non-Dhaka 
and 
rural 
teledensity 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
only 
about 
0.19 
lines 
per 
hundred 
persons. 
This 
low 
level 
of 
teledensity 
reflects 
the 
failure 
of 
initiatives 
to 
attract 
the 
private 
investment 
needed 
for 
the 
sector 
as 
well 
as 
the 
poor 
performance 
of 
the 
dominant 
operator 
Bangladesh Telegraph 
and Telephone 
Board 
(BTTB) 
to 
meet 
customers’ 
demands. 
60. 
The 
main 
sector 
issues 
can 
be 
classified 
under 
two 
broad 
categories: 
(a) 
sector 
performance, 
and 
(b) 
competition 
and 
private 
investment 
environment. 
Poor 
sector 
performance 
is 
evidenced 
by 
(i) 
limited 
access 
to 
telecommunication 
services, 
(ii) 
low 
rural 
teledensity, 
and 
(iii) 
low 
BTTB 
productivity 
and 
performance. 
Limited 
competition 
and 
private 
investment 
have 
taken  place 
in 
the 
sector, 
but 
the 
environment 
has 
not 
been 
conducive 
to 
large 
scale 
investments. 
Some 
of 
the factors that have 
hindered 
competition and private 
investment 
include 
lack 
of 
separation 
in 
the 
policy 
and 
operational 
roles 
of 
government, 
limited 
opening 
of 
the market,  inadequate 
interconnection 
capacity, 
distorted tariffs,  and 
inadequate 
regulatory 
framework. 
61. 
The 
Government 
has 
undertaken 
several 
reform 
initiatives 
over 
the 
past 
few 
years 
to 
increase 
competition 
in 
the 
sector 
and 
improve 
regulation. 
These 
include: 
adoption 
of 
the 
National 
Telecommunications 
Policy 
of 
1998, 
which 
recognizes 
competition 
and 
private participation 
as 
the 
principal 
means 
of 
promoting 
improved 
sector 
performance;  the  establishment 
of 
the  Bangladesh 
Telecommunications 
Regulatory  Commission 
(BTRC) 
in 
January 
2002, 
as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Telecommunications 
Act 
of 
2001; 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
National Information 
and Communications 
Technology 
(ICT) 
Policy 
in 
September 2002, 
which 
aspires 
to 
use 
ICT 
as 
a 
key 
engine 
of 
economic 
growth. 
The 
ICT 
policy 
calls 
for 
accelerated 
deregulation 
of 
and 
private  participation 
in 
the 
telecommunications 
sector. 
At 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
ICT 
Task 
Force, 
a 
high-level 
committee 
has 
been 
established 
to 
recommend 
to 
Government 
the 
most 
appropriate 
options and 
an 
implementation 
timetable 
for 
BTTB’s 
restructuring. 
Key 
objectives 
of 
the 
restructuring 
are 
to 
create 
a 
level playing 
field 
within 
the 
sector 
by 
separating the Government’s 
policy 
function 
from 
operations 
and 
to 
empower 
BTTB 
to 
operate 
as 
a 
commercial 
enterprise. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Government 
has 
decided 
to 
introduce 
competition 
in-local 
and 
long 
distance services 
by 
licensing 
private 
operators. 
The 
Government 
has 
recognized 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
BTRC’s 
regulatory 
capacity 
to 
ensure 
a 
level playing 
field 
in 
a 
multi-operator 
environment. 
The 
Government 
has 
sought 
IDA’S 
assistance 
to 
finance technical 
assistance 
to help 
implementation 
of 
these 
reforms. 
There 
has 
been 
dramatic 
growth 
in 
the 
mobile 
telephone 
market 
- 
although cellular 
phones were 
only 
introduced 
in 
the 
1990s, 
mobile 
phone penetration 
exceeded 
fixed 
line 
penetration 
by 
2001. 
According 
to 
the 
investment 
climate 
survey 
mentioned 
above, 
the 
median 
waiting 
time 
for 
a 
cellular 
phone 
now 
is 
only 
one day 
and 
most 
companies 
no 
longer rate telecommunications 
as 
a 
major 
problem.

the

mechanisms and an inadequate 
legal 
and 
judicial 
system 
are  some 
of 
reasons 
for 
the 
poor 
business 
environment. 
63, 
The 
current Government’s 
election 
manifesto recognized 
the 
imperative 
to 
strengthen governance 
and 
improve 
oversight and 
accountability and 
listed 
several governance 
reforms 
that the 
party 
intended 
to 
implement 
if 
voted 
into power 
(Box 
1). 
The 
I-PRSP 
observes 
that  “poor  govemance 
is 
a  strong 
impediment 
to 
current 
poverty 
reduction 
efforts”. 
Whereas 
improving 
governance 
will 
take time, 
the 
Government 
has 
made an encouraging 
start, 
and 
a 
multi-sectoral 
program 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
the 
country’s “pillars 
of 
integrity” 
is 
being 
implemented. 
Improving 
Financial Management 
64. 
The 
Country Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
and 
other 
diagnostic 
studies 
reveal 
that 
the 
lack 
of 
financial 
accountability 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
particularly 
acute, 
and 
the 
chain 
of 
accountability 
between 
the 
public, 
the legislature, 
and 
the 
executive 
needs 
considerable 
strengthening. 
There 
are 
several 
issues 
that 
deserve 
to 
be 
highlighted: 
. 
For 
several 
years 
the 
annual reports 
of 
the 
Comptroller 
and 
Auditor 
General 
(C&AG) 
have 
repeatedly 
documented 
waste, 
fraud, 
and 
the 
abuse 
of 
public 
funds, 
as 
has 
the 
Public 
Accounts 
Committee 
in 
parliament, 
with 
little 
corrective action. 
. 
Although 
the 
Constitution 
stipulates 
that 
the 
C&AG’s 
office 
is 
independent 
of 
government, 
its 
report 
is 
first 
submitted 
to 
the 
Prime 
Minister’s 
office, 
an 
auditee. 
While 
this 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
notion 
of 
an independent 
supreme 
audit 
and 
in 
contrast 
to 
practice 
in 
countries 
with 
effective 
public 
audits, 
Government believes that 
this 
is 
simply 
a procedural 
step 
similar 
to 
that 
followed 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
South Asia. 
The 
C&AG’s 
report 
is 
automatically 
passed 
on 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister to 
the 
President, 
with 
minimal 
delay. 
There 
is 
concem 
within 
the 
office 
of 
C&AG 
that 
it 
is 
treated 
as 
a 
Division 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
with 
the 
C&AG 
having 
inadequate 
control 
over 
his 
staff 
for 
appointments 
and 
promotions. 
His 
budget 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
whereas 
in 
many  countries 
this 
is 
determined 
by 
the 
Public 
Accounts 
Committee 
of 
Parliament. 
Government believes that 
the 
budget 
provided 
to 
the 
C&AG 
has 
never 
been 
a 
binding 
constraint and 
has 
to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
overall 
fiscal 
framework, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
with 
the 
budget 
provided 
to 
the Supreme Court, hence 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
The 
C&AGs 
that 
have been appointed 
in 
recent 
years 
have been 
senior 
civil 
servants 
close 
to 
the 
age 
of 
retirement and have 
not 
been 
in 
place 
long 
enough 
to 
follow 
up 
on 
the 
financial 
management 
reform 
agenda. 
. 
.

. 
The 
C&AG's 
audit 
staff 
are 
drawn 
from 
the 
same 
cadre 
as 
the accounts 
staff 
and 
trained 
auditors 
can 
be 
transferred 
back 
into 
accounting 
posts, 
creating 
potential conflicts 
of 
interest 
and  perceptions 
of 
lack 
of 
audit 
independen~e.'~ 
Although 
separation was 
legislated 
in 
1983 
(Ordinance 
XXVIII), 
it 
was 
never 
implemented, 
largely 
due 
to 
opposition 
from 
accounts personnel 
who 
fear 
loss 
of 
opportunities 
of 
transfer 
into 
coveted audit 
posts, 
which 
have 
more travel 
and 
promotion 
prospects. 
In 
addition, 
internal 
control 
climate 
is 
poor, 
as 
reported 
by 
the 
C&AG 
repeatedly 
in 
his 
reports. 
Internal 
audit 
is 
still 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
and 
exists 
only 
in 
large 
ministries 
and 
major 
autonomous organizations, and 
generally 
only 
pre-audit functions 
are 
carried 
out. 
Elections 
were 
held 
in 
October 2001, 
but 
parliamentary 
standing committees have 
not 
yet 
been 
formed. 
.

An 
IMF 
Safeguard 
Assessment, 
conducted 
in 
September 
2002, 
concluded 
that 
financial 
management 
in 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
was 
weak 
and comprehensive 
reforms 
were  necessary 
to 
improve 
accounting, 
financial 
reporting, 
auditing 
and 
control 
systems 
as 
well 
as 
the 
legal 
framework. 
The 
Assessment 
also 
noted 
that 
the 
accounting 
department 
did 
not 
have 
sufficiently qualified 
staff 
and 
the 
financial 
statements 
that 
were 
prepared 
contained 
limited 
information 
on 
cash 
flows, accounting policies, 
disclosure 
of 
government 
balances, 
contingent 
liabilities, 
and 
foreign liabilities. 
66. 
Since 
takmg 
office, 
the 
Government 
has 
made 
encouraging 
progress 
in 
implementing 
several 
CFAA 
recommendations 
through 
a 
Financial 
Management 
Reform 
Program 
(FMRP), 
supported 
by 
UK- 
DFID 
and 
the 
Netherlands. 
Implementation 
of 
CFAA 
recommendations 
to 
strengthen 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
office 
of 
C&AG 
is 
also 
being 
supported 
through 
an 
IDF 
grant. 
The 
auditing 
and 
accounting functions 
are 
being 
separated. 
The 
Controller 
General 
of 
Accounts 
(CGA) 
no 
longer reports 
to 
the 
C&AG. 
From 
July 
1, 
2002, 
positions 
of 
Chief 
Accounts 
Officers 
(CAOs) 
were 
created 
in 
each 
Ministry 
to 
report 
directly 
to 
their 
Secretary and 
the 
CGA, 
the 
CGA 
reports 
ultimately 
to 
the 
Finance 
Secretary. 
Internal 
audit 
teams are 
being 
piloted 
in 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
ministries. 
To 
assure 
quality 
of 
accounting 
data, 
a Central 
Reconciliation 
Unit 
has 
been 
established 
in 
the 
CGA's 
office. 
This 
unit 
carries 
out 
reconciliation 
of 
the 
checks 
issued 
electronically 
by 
the 
CAOs 
based 
in 
Dhaka 
and 
paid 
by 
Bangladesh 
Bank. 
To 
facilitate 
the 
flow 
of 
information 
on 
Government 
receipts,  expenditures 
and 
borrowing 
position, 
the 
CAOs 
report 
their 
individual 
transactions 
by 
the 
banks 
to 
the 
Finance 
Division 
on 
a 
weekly 
basis. 
Field 
accounting 
offices 
have 
been reorganized 
through 
the 
abolition 
of 
20 
Regional 
Accounts 
Offices 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
6 
upgraded 
Divisional 
Offices. 
Information 
generated at 
the 
Thana 
and 
district 
level 
is 
now 
monitored 
and consolidated 
by 
the 
six 
Divisional 
Controllers 
and electronically 
transferred 
to 
the 
Central 
Data 
Processing 
Unit 
of 
the 
CGA 
and 
from 
there 
to 
the 
Finance 
Division. 
On- 
line 
electronic 
data 
transmission 
now 
allows 
the 
central government 
accounts 
to be compiled 
and 
reported 
within 
five 
weeks 
of 
the end 
of 
each 
month. 
A 
program 
is 
under 
way to 
complete 
the 
computerization 
of 
accounts 
in 
all 
districts. 
This 
will 
enable 
public 
officers 
to 
check 
the 
integrity 
of 
their 
accounts against 
the statements 
of 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
on 
demand. 
67. 
To 
enhance 
the 
safeguards 
framework 
for 
Bangladesh Bank, 
the recommendations 
of 
the 
IMF 
onsite 
safeguards 
assessment  are 
being 
implemented. 
Reserve  management 
functions 
have 
been 
segregated 
between 
the 
dealing 
room 
and the 
back 
office 
and a 
separate 
middle office 
function 
is 
being 
developed. 
It 
is 
intended that 
internal audit 
will 
be 
strengthened, 
with 
technical 
assistance 
from 
the 
IMF, 
and  mechanisms 
for 
reserves  management 
enhanced. 
The 
Budget 
and 
Accounts  Department 
of 
Bangladesh 
Bank, 
with 
support 
from 
the 
IMF, 
has 
started strengthening 
financial 
management 
and 
the 
June  30, 
2002 
financial 
statements 
have 
been 
restated 
in 
accordance 
with 
International Accounting 
Standards 
(IAS). 
The 
IDA-financed 
Central 
Bank 
Strengthening 
project 
will 
provide 
financing 
for 
an 
audit 
of 
the 
June 
30, 
2003 
financial 
statements, 
which 
will 
be 
based 
on 
International 
Standards

has 
been

for 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
Bangladesh

Overhauling 
Procurement 
68. 
The 
integrity 
of 
public 
procurement 
is 
closely 
linked to 
financial 
accountability. 
The 
public 
sector 
in 
Bangladesh annually 
procures about 
US$3 
billion 
worth 
of 
goods, 
works 
and 
services. 
The 
Bangladesh 
Country 
Procurement 
Assessment 
Review 
(CPAR)20 observed that 
public 
sector 
procurement 
suffers 
from 
systemic deficiencies 
including 
opaque 
procurement 
practices, outdated 
procurement 
rules 
and 
procedures, 
inadequate  management  capacity, 
and 
lack 
of 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
mechanisms. 
Furthermore, 
public 
procurement 
has 
been 
infested 
by 
entrenched 
and pervasive 
rent- 
seeking 
and 
corruption. 
Survey 
work 
shows that economic 
losses 
due 
to 
procurement-related 
corruption 
and delays 
are 
significant. 
The situation 
leads 
to 
the waste 
of 
scarce 
public 
resources, 
be 
it 
domestic 
savings 
or 
external 
aid, 
and 
poor quality 
of 
goods, 
works 
and 
services. 
At 
a 
more 
fundamental 
level, 
it 
causes 
erosion 
of 
public 
confidence and 
deterioration 
of 
the 
investment climate. 
Thus, 
reform to 
address 
the 
underlying 
causes 
of 
poor 
procurement 
is 
high 
on 
the 
country’s 
governance 
agenda. 
69. 
Recognizing 
the 
critical 
need 
to 
improve 
public 
procurement, 
the Government 
is 
in 
the process 
of 
implementing, 
with 
the support 
of 
an 
IDA 
credit, 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
CPAR 
by 
creating 
basic 
policy 
and institutional 
frameworks 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
through 
(a) 
reforming 
the procurement 
rules 
and 
mandatory 
use 
of 
standard 
bid 
documents 
to 
reduce 
procurement 
delays; 
(b) 
introducing 
mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
in 
procurement  process 
and 
restore 
public 
confidence; 
and 
(c) 
establishing 
procurement training, 
monitoring 
and evaluation capacity 
to 
track 
procurement performance 
of 
public 
sector 
entities. 
70. 
A 
Central 
Procurement 
Technical 
Unit 
has 
been 
established  and 
is 
scheduled 
to 
submit 
to 
Government 
the 
final 
draft 
procurement 
rules 
and 
standard 
bidding 
documents 
by 
May 
31, 
2003. 
New 
streamlined procurement approval 
procedures, 
with 
significantly 
reduced 
number 
of 
layers, have been 
developed. 
Government 
has 
issued orders 
mandating 
publication 
of 
awards 
for 
contracts 
of 
US$200,000 
and 
above 
and 
has 
started 
actual 
publication. 
To 
improve 
procurement 
management  capacity, 
Government 
initiated 
an 
intensive 
Training 
of 
Trainers 
program 
in 
February 
2003, 
and 
1,600 
persons 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
trained over 
the 
next 
three 
years. 
Establishing 
an 
Independent 
Anti-Corruption 
Commission 
7 
1. 
The Bureau 
of 
Anti-Corruption (BAC) 
is 
the 
principal 
organization responsible 
for 
investigating 
allegations 
of 
corruption 
in 
Bangladesh 
and 
following 
inquiry 
with 
legal 
action.21 
Ever 
since  the 
introduction 
of 
the 
parliamentary 
system 
in 
Bangladesh, 
BAC 
has 
remained under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister’s 
office, 
prior 
to 
which 
it 
reported 
to 
the 
office 
of 
the President. 
Between 
1994 
and 
2000, 
BAC 
received 
a 
total 
number 
of 
70,201 
complaints, 
resulting 
in 
cases 
being 
filed 
for 
9 percent 
of 
the 
complaints 
and 
files 
being 
“closed” 
for 
an 
additional 
32 
percent, 
where 
the 
allegations 
could 
not 
be 
substantiated. 
Fifty 
nine 
percent 
of 
the 
complaints 
are 
pending.22 
72. 
Numerous 
observers have expressed reservations about 
BAC’s 
operations. 
Among 
the 
factors 
affecting 
its 
operations, 
an important 
constraint 
is 
the 
excessive 
political 
interference 
in 
the Bureau’s

functioning. 
Charges 
are 
never 
brought 
against 
persons 
affiliated 
with 
the 
ruling 
party, 
as 
prior 
permission 
for 
this 
is 
required 
from 
the 
Prime 
Minister. 
The authority 
of 
the 
Bureau’s 
Director 
General 
in 
conducting 
cases 
against 
senior 
government 
officials 
is 
severely 
limited, 
causing 
the 
Public 
Administration 
Reform 
Commission 
(PARC) 
to 
compare 
BAC’s 
operations 
to 
a person “who 
has 
been 
asked 
to 
swim 
with 
tied 
hands”.23 
Excessively 
bureaucratic procedures, 
lack 
of 
proper 
planning 
and 
investigation, 
weak 
framing 
of 
cases, 
poorly 
trained 
and 
negligent 
officials, 
and 
corruption 
are 
some 
of 
the 
causes 
that have 
been 
identified for 
the 
Bureau’s 
poor 
performance. 
To 
address these 
causes, 
the 
PARC 
report 
had 
recommended 
the establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
Anti-Corruption 
Commission 
vested 
with 
the authority 
to 
investigate allegations 
of 
corruption 
against 
all 
officers and 
citizens 
of 
the 
country, 
irrespective 
of 
rank 
and 
position. 
Consistent 
with 
its 
election 
manifesto, 
the 
Government 
has 
reaffirmed 
this 
intention, 
and 
Cabinet 
has 
approved a 
draft 
bill 
approving 
the 
establishment 
of 
this body. 
It 
is 
intended 
that the 
commission 
will 
report 
annually 
to 
parliament. 
Members 
of 
the 
commission 
would 
be 
appointed 
for 
a 
fixed four 
year 
nonrenewable 
term 
and 
could 
only 
be 
removed 
from 
office 
in 
instances 
of 
abuse 
of 
power 
or corruption, 
following 
the recommendations 
of 
a 
judicial 
committee. 
Initiating 
Public 
Administration Reform 
73. 
The 
problems 
afflicting 
Bangladesh’s 
public 
administration 
are 
well 
known 
and  have 
been 
discussed 
widely. 
As 
stated 
in 
the 
Public 
Administration Reforms 
Commission24 (PARC) 
report, 
the 
system 
of 
public 
administration 
is 
“rigid, 
unresponsive, 
inefficient 
and 
ineffective,  pre-occupied 
with 
process rather 
than 
results”. 
Although 
the 
total 
size 
of 
the 
civil 
service 
as 
a 
proportion 
of 
population 
(about 
1 
percent) 
is 
less 
than 
the 
average 
for 
South 
Asia 
and 
most 
developing 
and 
developed countries, 
there 
is 
excess 
manpower 
at 
lower 
levels 
(Class 
111 
& 
Class 
IV 
employees) 
and a 
shortage 
of 
skilled 
civil 
servants 
at 
higher 
levels. 
Hiring 
decisions, 
particularly 
at 
lower 
levels, 
are 
influenced 
by 
political 
pressures, 
and 
recruitment 
has 
historically 
been 
based 
on 
a 
geographic  quota  system 
with 
special 
preferences 
given 
to 
specific 
groups 
of 
candidates. 
Promotions 
are 
perceived 
as 
being 
based 
on 
time 
served 
and good 
contacts, 
and 
there 
has 
been erosion 
in 
terms 
of 
the package 
of 
financial 
benefits 
offered 
to 
public 
servants.25 
74. 
While 
public 
administration 
reform 
has 
not 
yet 
started 
in 
earnest, 
the 
Government 
has 
taken a 
few 
initial 
steps 
aimed 
at 
improving 
the 
system. 
All 
routine recruitment 
against vacant posts at 
lower 
levels 
in 
administration 
has 
been 
stopped, 
although recruitment 
is 
continuing 
for 
critical 
posts such 
as 
doctors, 
nurses 
and 
teachers. 
To 
deal 
with 
the 
acute 
skills 
shortage, 
Government 
has 
started 
recruiting 
senior 
managers 
on 
contract 
from 
the 
private 
sector 
and 
from 
abroad. 
These 
include 
the 
Governor 
of 
Bangladesh Bank, the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Tariff 
Commission, 
Member 
Planning Commission 
and Chairman 
of 
the 
Board 
of-Investment. 
Efforts 
are also 
underway 
to 
tighten criteria 
for 
recruitment 
and 
promotion. 
In 
addition 
to 
seniority, 
Government 
has 
issued 
new 
guidelines 
that 
require 
taking

Separating 
the 
Judiciary 
from 
the Executive 
75. 
Separation 
of 
judiciary 
from 
executive 
control 
is 
an 
important 
element 
in 
establishing 
the 
proper 
rule 
of 
law 
and 
improving 
governance, 
and Bangladesh’s 
political 
parties have 
all long 
supported 
this 
objective. 
The 
present  Govemment 
has  also 
expressed 
its 
commitment 
to 
complete 
the  separation 
process. 
The Appellate 
Division 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court, 
through 
a 
judgment 
passed 
on 
December 
2, 
1999, 
identified 
five 
conditions 
of 
judicial 
independence: 
(i) 
security 
of 
tenure; 
(ii) 
security 
of 
salary; 
(iii) 
institutional 
independence 
of 
the 
Subordinate 
Judiciary 
(from 
the 
District 
Court 
to 
the 
Assistant 
Judge’s 
Court) 
from 
the 
Parliament 
and 
the 
Executive; 
(iv) 
recruitment 
to 
Judicial 
service 
by 
a 
separate 
Judicial 
Service 
Commission; 
and 
(v) 
financial 
independence 
of 
the 
Supreme Court, 
i.e. 
freedom 
to 
spend 
funds 
allocated 
to 
it 
in 
the 
budget 
without 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
or 
any other 
ministry. 
76. 
The 
Govemment 
has 
already delegated 
full 
financial 
autonomy 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
to 
incur 
any 
expenditure 
from 
the 
funds 
allocated 
to 
it 
in 
the 
budget. 
Judge’s 
security 
of 
tenure 
and 
salary have 
been 
ensured, 
once 
they 
are appointed. 
At 
present, 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Law 
have 
dual 
control over 
disciplinary 
and 
promotion 
processes 
for 
the 
Subordinate 
Court 
judges. 
The 
Government 
has 
agreed 
to 
implement 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
directives 
but 
needs 
more 
time 
to 
resolve 
issues 
relating 
to 
the 
services 
of 
magistrates, 
who 
are 
part 
of 
the 
Civil 
Service  and 
under 
the 
control 
of 
Ministry 
of 
Establishment. 
Since 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s judgment, 
the 
Establishment 
Division 
has 
referred 
transfer 
and 
discipline 
matters 
of 
full-time 
(judicial) 
Magistrates 
in 
the 
Metropolitan 
Magistrates’  Courts 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court. 
However, 
civil 
administrative 
officers 
who 
perform 
judicial 
functions 
as 
part-time 
Magistrates 
are 
still 
under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
Establishment 
Division. 
The 
Government 
is 
considering 
ways 
to 
address 
this 
issue. 
Cleaning 
the 
Natural 
Environment 
77. 
The 
Government 
is 
currently 
engaged 
in 
a 
number 
of 
programs 
aimed 
at strengthening capacity 
for 
environmental 
management, 
including 
the 
UNDP-supported 
Sustainable 
Environment 
Management 
Program, 
the 
CIDA-supported 
Bangladesh 
Environmental 
Management 
Program, 
and 
the 
IDA-supported 
Air 
Quality 
Management  Project. 
These 
initiatives 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Management 
Action 
Plan 
and 
assist 
the 
Department 
of 
Environment 
in 
the 
administration 
of 
its 
regulatory 
program 
of 
environmental 
assessments, 
pollution 
control, 
and 
monitoring 
of 
environmental 
quality. 
78. 
Particular 
emphasis 
has 
been 
given 
to 
the 
control 
of 
urban air pollution, 
and 
some success 
has 
been achieved 
in 
this 
regard. 
High 
levels 
of 
vehicular 
air 
pollution 
have 
repeatedly 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
major 
health 
hazard 
in 
Dhaka. 
Govemment 
has 
banned 
the 
movement 
of 
buses 
more 
than 
20 
years 
old 
and 
trucks 
more than 
25 years 
old on 
the 
streets 
of 
Dhaka, 
starting 
in 
January 2002. 
Most 
of 
these 
buses 
and trucks, 
many 
of 
which 
were 
owned 
by 
senior 
police 
officials, 
were 
heavily 
polluting 
and were 
rarely 
legally 
registered. 
This 
ban 
resulted 
in 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
about 
1,000 
buses 
from 
the 
streets 
of 
Dhaka 
and 
has 
had 
a 
positive impact. 
The Govemment 
has also 
banned 
the 
movement 
of 
all 
two 
stroke 
three 
wheelers (baby-taxis) 
registered 
prior 
to 
1993 
on 
accounts 
of 
their 
pollution, 
removing 
about 
14,000 
baby 
taxis 
and 
2,000 
tempos. 
Private 
transport  operators 
have 
imported 
about 
2,000 
improved 
(four 
stroke 
engine) 
baby 
taxis 
to 
replace 
the 
old 
models. 
Under 
the 
World 
Bank 
supported 
Dhaka 
Urban 
Transport 
Project, extensive 
dialogue 
has 
taken 
place 
between 
rickshaw 
owners, 
drivers 
association 
and 
the 
Dhaka 
Metropolitan 
Police 
(DMP), 
aimed 
at 
malung 
several 
major 
bus 
routes 
free 
of 
non-motorized 
transport, 
which would 
further 
limit 
congestion, 
and 
thereby reduce 
pollution.

The 
Human 
Development Agenda 
79. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
human development, safety 
net 
provision 
and disaster 
management, 
Bangladesh 
is 
building 
on 
the 
progress  already  achieved. 
The 
expansion 
of 
coverage  and 
access 
to 
education, 
encouraging 
record 
of 
improvements 
in 
health 
outcomes and 
family 
planning 
as 
well 
as 
improved 
disaster 
preparedness 
and 
flood 
relief 
(discussed 
in 
Section 
I1 
above) 
were 
made 
possible 
by 
the 
shift 
in 
public 
policy 
toward 
the development 
of 
human 
resources and 
the 
rural 
economy. 
These 
successes 
must 
be 
balanced 
against 
the 
remaining 
serious 
human 
development challenges the 
country 
faces. 
While 
primary 
school 
gross 
enrollment 
rates 
are 
close 
to 
100 
percent, 
attendance 
rate 
is 
only 
60-65 
percent 
and 
primary 
cycle completion rate 
is 
67 
percent. 
Adult 
literacy 
rate remains 
lower 
than 
the 
South 
Asia 
regional 
average. 
Maternal 
mortality 
is 
very 
high 
(392 
per 
100,000 
live 
births), 
child 
malnutrition 
is 
among the 
highest 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
there 
are 
lingering 
problems 
of 
low 
birth 
weight 
and 
persistence 
of 
infectious 
diseases. 
80. 
Public 
spending 
in 
the 
social 
sectors 
- 
which 
takes 
more 
than a 
quarter 
of 
the budget 
--meets the 
minimum 
standards 
of 
efficiency 
and 
equity, 
and 
tends 
to 
be 
directed 
to 
poorer 
regions.26 
Education 
is 
the 
largest 
recipient 
of 
public 
spending 
in 
Bangladesh 
(2.3 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
and 
basic education 
receives 
an 
overwhelming 
share 
of 
the 
total 
education 
spending. 
Health 
and 
the 
social 
safety 
nets 
each take 
up 
about 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Spending 
on 
the 
Essential 
Services 
Package 
(ESP) 
accounts 
for 
60 percent 
of 
the 
total 
health 
budget 
with 
26 percent 
for 
reproductive 
health 
and 
21 
percent 
for 
child 
health. 
The 
two 
main 
relief 
programs-Gratuitous 
Relief 
and 
Vulnerable 
Group 
Feeding-played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
assisting 
flood-affected 
households 
during 
the 
massive 
flood 
in 
1998. 
The 
country’s 
two 
main 
development 
programs-Vulnerable 
Group Development 
and 
Food 
For 
Work-target 
the 
poor relatively 
well. 
On 
the 
account 
of 
low 
revenue 
mobilization, 
however, even 
though 
the 
share 
of 
social 
sector 
public 
spending 
is 
high, 
Bangladesh’s 
public 
spending 
per 
capita 
($12) 
falls 
short 
of 
such 
neighboring 
countries 
as 
India 
($21) 
and 
Sri 
Lanka 
($37). 
Due 
to 
weak institutions 
of 
service 
delivery, even 
though 
the 
intra- 
and 
inter- 
sectoral 
allocation 
of 
expenditures 
have 
many pro-poor 
attributes, the 
effectiveness 
of 
these 
expenditures 
is 
below 
the 
full 
potential 
and 
resources 
reaching 
the beneficiaries 
fall 
short 
of 
the 
level 
intended. 
8 
1. 
There 
is 
consensus 
that 
institutional 
and 
governance 
reforms 
are 
the 
key 
for 
improving 
access, 
quality 
and 
efficiency 
of 
education 
and 
health 
services, 
as 
well 
as 
targeting and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
safety 
net. 
In 
terms 
of 
public 
expenditure 
priorities, 
the 
education 
sector 
is 
to 
receive 
increased 
allocation, 
while 
continuing 
emphasis 
on 
basic 
education 
and 
improvements 
in 
its 
quality 
and 
equity through 
rebalancing 
expenditure 
on 
labor 
and 
non-labor 
inputs 
and expanding 
involvement 
of 
NGOs 
and 
private 
sector 
in 
provision 
of 
education 
services. 
Also 
in 
the 
health 
sector, 
the 
priority 
is 
to 
allocate 
more 
funds 
on 
ESP 
and capitalize 
on 
the 
existing potential 
for 
greater 
involvement 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
NGOs, 
and 
grass- 
roots community 
organizations 
by 
de-linhng 
the 
Government’s 
provider 
and 
financier 
functions. 
The 
Government 
is 
now 
focusing 
on 
a 
second generation 
set 
of 
reforms 
to 
address 
existing 
shortcomings. 
(Annex 
F 
presents 
a 
review 
of 
policies, 
outcomes 
and 
key 
issues 
in 
education, 
health 
and  social 
protection.) 
82. 
In 
the 
education 
sector, 
the Government 
is 
currently 
in 
the 
process 
of 
developing 
a 
medium-term 
framework, 
which 
will 
establish 
policy 
directions 
and 
outcome 
targets, 
with 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
quality 
improvement. 
With 
respect 
to 
primary 
education, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Primary 
and 
Mass Education 
(MoPME) 
is 
in 
the process 
of 
preparing 
a 
second 
Primary 
Education Development Program 
for 
the 
next 
five 
years,with 
assistance 
of 
a 
donor group 
led 
by 
the 
ADB. 
The 
specific objectives 
of 
the 
program 
are 
to: 
(i) 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching 
and 
learning, and 
enhance 
student 
achievement; 
(ii) 
enhance 
access 
to 
schooling 
through  improvement 
of 
physical  facilities 
and 
financial 
support 
to 
the 
poor 
and

disadvantaged; 
and 
(iii) 
strengthen 
planning 
and 
management 
of 
primary 
education, 
and 
establish 
a 
nation-wide 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system. 
83. 
broad 
reforms aimed 
at: 
With 
respect 
to 
secondary education, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
is 
developing 
action 
plans 
for 
Increasing 
accountability 
of 
schools, 
both 
to 
the government and 
to 
the 
community.  Reforms 
in 
these 
areas 
will 
include  rigorously 
enforcing  criteria  governing 
the  establishment 
of 
schools  and 
establishing 
institutional 
mechanisms 
for 
linking 
school subventions 
to 
objective 
measures 
of 
school 
performance. 
Simultaneously, 
rules 
governing 
the 
functioning 
of 
school 
management 
committees 
will 
be 
revised 
to 
give them 
greater 
oversight responsibility. 
Improving 
standards 
for 
teacher 
recruitment  and training. 
An 
autonomous Teacher 
Recruitment 
Commission 
will 
be 
established 
to 
develop and 
implement 
uniform 
standards 
for 
teacher 
recruitment. 
Schools 
will 
retain 
the 
flexibility 
to 
choose teachers 
from 
the 
list 
of 
qualified 
candidates approved 
by 
the 
Commission. 
Simultaneously, 
uniform 
standards 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
incumbent 
teachers, 
who 
will 
be 
given 
the 
opportunity 
to 
upgrade 
their 
skills 
and become 
certified. 
Reducing 
opportunity 
for 
corruption 
and 
misuse 
of 
public 
resourses 
in 
textbook production 
. 
A 
time- 
bound plan  for 
the 
privatization 
of 
textbook  production 
is 
being 
developed, 
starting 
with 
the 
privatization 
of 
textbooks 
for 
grades 
9-10. 
These 
reforms 
are 
proposed 
to 
be 
supported 
by 
an 
IDA-financed 
Education 
Sector 
Adjustment 
Credit, 
presently 
under 
preparation. 
84. 
The 
Government 
will 
continue supporting 
the 
secondary 
education 
of 
girls 
and 
has 
extended 
the 
female 
stipend 
program 
to 
grades 
11 
and 
12, 
effective 
as 
of 
January 2002. 
Under 
the 
extension, 
girls 
that 
secure 
45 
percent 
or 
more 
in 
the 
Secondary 
School 
Certificate 
(SSC) 
examination 
will 
receive a 
monthly 
stipend 
of 
Tk.65, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
exemption 
of 
tuition 
fees. 
The 
annual  cost 
of 
this 
extension 
is 
estimated at 
US$9 
million 
equivalent. 
Over 
the 
medium 
term, 
Government 
intends 
to 
introduce  a 
nationwide 
targeted 
stipend 
and 
tuition 
program 
for 
secondary female 
students. 
85. 
In 
the 
health 
sector, 
the 
consortium 
of 
donors 
has 
been 
supporting Government’s 
Health 
and 
Population 
Sector 
Program 
(HPSP) 
since 
its 
start 
in 
1998 
(approximately 
$800 
million 
over 5 
years). 
The 
HPSP 
was 
prepared  based 
on 
a 
sector-wide 
program 
approach 
including 
integrating  financial 
management and 
streamlining  procurement 
systems. 
This 
has 
led 
to 
prioritization 
of 
expenditures 
and 
secured 
allocation 
for 
cost 
effective 
programs, 
especially 
those 
which primarily 
benefit 
children, 
women 
and 
the 
poor, 
and 
has 
considerably reduced 
the 
transaction 
costs 
of 
both 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Family 
Welfare and 
the 
development 
partners. 
Included 
in 
the 
HPSP 
was 
a 
substantial 
reform 
agenda 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
service 
provision. 
The 
reforms  included 
de- 
concentration 
of 
line 
authority 
to 
the 
district 
and 
health 
facility 
level, 
unification 
of 
the 
separate 
family 
planning 
and 
health 
wings 
of 
the service 
delivery 
system 
at 
the 
thana 
level 
and below, 
development 
and 
integration 
of 
gender 
equity 
concerns 
and 
institutionalization 
of 
stakeholder 
participation 
and 
community 
oversight 
of 
the 
program. 
While 
there 
is 
progress 
on 
most 
of 
the 
indicators 
of 
health 
outcomes, 
several 
aspects 
of 
the 
reform 
agenda 
still 
remain 
to 
be 
implemented. 
86. 
The 
Government and the 
consortium 
of 
donors 
are 
presently discussing 
the 
next 
phase 
of 
HPSP. 
The 
Government 
is 
concerned about the 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
is 
having 
second thoughts about 
the 
unification 
of 
health 
and 
family 
planning 
services. 
Donors 
are concerned about 
the 
implementation 
shortfall 
of 
the 
reform 
agenda 
(agreed 
under 
the 
current 
phase 
of 
HPSP), 
the 
delays 
in 
scaling 
up 
nutrition 
programs, and the 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention 
and 
arsenic 
mitigation 
activities.  Despite 
that, 
in 
its 
Conceptual 
Framework 
for 
the 
next 
phase 
of 
the 
program, the Government 
has 
clearly 
stated 
its 
intention 
to 
continue 
the 
sector-wide 
program 
approach 
in 
the 
sector. 
27

87. 
To 
strengthen 
the 
governance 
of 
safety 
net programs, 
the 
Government 
has, 
with 
effect 
from 
July 
1, 
2002, 
discontinued 
the 
Food 
for 
Education 
(FFE) 
program 
- 
in-kmd 
stipend 
characterized 
by 
high 
administrative 
leakage 
- 
and 
replaced 
it 
by 
an expanded 
Primary 
Education 
Stipend 
Program 
(PESP). 
Under 
this 
new 
program, 
the 
bottom 
40 
percent 
poor 
families 
in 
rural 
areas 
will 
get 
a 
cash 
stipend 
of 
Tk.lOO 
per 
month for 
sending 
one 
child 
to 
primary 
schools and Tk.125 
per 
month 
if 
they 
are 
sending 
more than 
one 
child. 
The 
total 
number 
of 
likely 
beneficiaries 
is 
estimated 
at 
7 
million 
children, 
and the 
net additional 
burden 
on 
the 
budget 
as 
a 
result 
of 
this 
program 
is 
estimated at about $35-40 
million 
annually. 
Experience 
from 
the 
Government’s 
female 
stipend 
program 
in 
secondary education, 
which 
is 
operated 
on 
a 
cash 
basis, 
suggests 
that 
the 
problems 
of 
leakage 
in 
managing 
cash 
stipends 
are 
lower 
than 
in-kind 
food 
programs, 
although 
this 
will 
need 
to 
be 
monitored 
carefully. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
monetizing 
the 
Food 
for 
Work 
(FFW) 
program, 
with 
about 
181,000 
tons 
being 
monetized 
in 
FY03 
so 
far. 
88. 
Another terrible 
aspect 
of 
vulnerability 
- 
acid-attacks 
on 
women 
- 
experienced 
a 
surge 
in 
recent 
years, 
and there 
were 
no 
laws 
and regulations 
for 
handling 
acid-related violence. 
Two 
Acts 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
issue 
have 
been 
approved 
by 
Parliament. 
The 
Acid 
Control 
Act 
controls 
the 
import, marketing 
and 
production 
of 
acid, 
while 
the 
Acid 
Related 
Offense 
Bill 
empowers 
the 
judiciary to 
prosecute, 
under 
strict 
time 
limits, 
offenses 
relating 
to 
acid 
throwing.  The 
Bill 
also makes 
provision for 
the 
rehabilitation and 
treatment 
of 
acid 
burn 
victims. 
VI. 
THE 
BANK’S 
STRATEGY 
IN 
BANGLADESH 
Overall 
CAS 
Context 
89. 
The Bank’s country 
assistance 
strategy 
(CAS) 
for 
Bangladesh 
for 
FYO1-03 
identifies 
four 
main 
thrusts 
for 
the 
Bank 
Group’s 
assistance 
to 
Bangladesh. 
These 
include 
(i) 
helping 
to 
build 
stronger 
institutions 
and 
governance 
across sectors; 
(ii) 
consolidating 
gains 
in 
human 
development 
and supporting 
initiatives 
to 
address 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
development  challenges 
in 
education, 
health 
and 
nutrition; 
(iii) 
implementing 
an 
integrated 
approach 
to 
rural 
development, 
including 
supporting 
growth 
in 
agriculture 
and 
non-farm 
activities, 
making 
opportunities and 
assets 
available 
to 
the 
poor 
and 
improving 
rural 
infrastructure; 
and 
(iv) 
accelerating and 
broadening 
private 
sector-led 
growth 
by 
helping 
to 
remove 
structural  impediments 
and 
establish 
an 
environment  conducive 
to 
private 
investment, 
strengthen 
the 
financial 
sector, 
and 
support 
private 
investments 
in 
energy, 
infrastructure, 
manufacturing and 
services. 
90. 
In 
particular, 
the 
CAS 
notes 
that 
“unless 
the 
underlying institutional 
and 
governance 
issues 
are 
addressed, 
neither 
foreign 
nor 
domestically 
fimded 
programs 
will 
achieve 
their potential 
for 
accelerating 
economic 
growth 
and 
reducing 
poverty.” 
In 
this 
regard, 
it 
stresses 
the 
need 
for 
Government 
to 
improve 
the 
law 
and order situation; 
tackle 
corruption 
in 
banlung, 
power 
and 
revenue 
administration; 
reform 
the 
civil 
service, 
public 
audit and 
accounting 
bodies, 
public 
procurement and 
the 
civil 
justice 
system; 
and 
ensure 
that 
policies 
provide 
incentives 
for 
increasing 
efficiency, accountability 
and 
transparency. 
91. 
The 
Bangladesh 
CAS 
2000 
was designed 
to 
take account 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
election 
cycle. 
The 
CAS 
was 
prepared about 
a year 
before 
the 
national 
elections 
held 
in 
October 200 
1. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
CAS’S 
preparation, 
Bangladesh 
was 
in 
a 
low-case 
lending 
scenario due 
to 
weak 
implementation 
capacity, 
poor 
govemance 
and stalled reforms. 
The 
CAS 
strategy was 
to 
use 
existing 
and 
new 
analytical 
work 
to 
engage 
the 
new 
Government 
in 
dialogue, 
identify 
areas 
of 
mutual 
agreement and 
reform 
champions, 
and 
develop an expanded 
program 
of 
support 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
indications 
from 
the 
Government 
about 
the 
areas 
28 
Page  37
in 
which 
it 
could 
move forward 
with 
reforms.27 
The 
strategy 
was 
thus 
to be 
opportunistic 
in 
seehng 
areas 
with 
good 
prospects 
for 
reform 
and 
responsive 
to 
Government initiatives. 
92. 
Overall 
progress made 
since 
FY02 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
CAS 
triggers 
justifies 
increasing 
IDA 
lending 
to 
the 
base 
case 
level 
starting 
in 
FY03.” 
The 
macroeconomic situation 
has 
improved, 
effective 
initial 
actions have 
reduced 
domestic 
financing 
of 
debt, 
and 
official 
foreign 
exchange 
reserves have 
stabilized 
at 
about 
US$1.6 
billion 
(although 
still 
below 
a 
safe 
level for 
Bangladesh). 
Portfolio 
performance 
has 
improved, and 
it 
is 
projected 
that the 
proportion 
of 
projects-at-risk 
will 
be 
below 
the 
15 
percentage 
points 
required 
under 
the 
base 
case. 
The 
I-PRSP 
has 
been 
completed. 
The 
proposed 
Development 
Support 
Credit 
is 
the 
first 
adjustment 
operation 
in 
Bangladesh 
since the 
mid-l990s, 
representing 
a gradual 
move 
by 
the 
Bank 
into 
a 
more 
programmatic 
approach 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
the 
medium-term 
reform 
program 
articulated 
in 
the I-PRSP. 
Analytical and 
Advisory 
Activities 
93. 
Extensive 
analytical 
work 
by 
the 
Bank, 
including 
the 
completion 
of 
all 
core 
diagnostics, 
and 
several  governance-related 
reports 
(a 
corruption 
study, 
an 
institutional 
and 
governance 
review,  and 
procurement  and 
financial 
accountability 
assessments) 
provided 
the 
context 
for 
discussions 
with 
the 
Government that 
came 
to 
power 
in 
October 
2001. 
Eighteen 
policy 
briefs 
prepared 
by 
Bank 
staff 
were 
used 
to 
initiate 
relations 
with 
the 
new 
Ministers 
and 
Secretaries.  These 
briefs 
covered 
macro 
issues 
such 
as 
govemance, state-owned 
enterprises, 
the 
financial 
sector, 
globalization 
and 
trade, 
as 
well 
as 
sectoral 
priorities 
in 
health,  education,  environment, 
agriculture 
and infrastructure. 
Three 
major 
studies 
-- 
a 
Poverty 
Assessment, 
a 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
and 
a 
Review 
of 
Public 
Enterprises 
-- 
were 
also 
prepared  and 
discussed 
during 
2002 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
Government’s 
formulation 
of 
its 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
and 
I-PRSP. 
The 
PA 
and 
PER 
were conducted 
jointly 
with 
the 
ADB, 
and 
all 
three 
reports 
were  disseminated 
widely 
and 
discussed 
in 
national 
workshops. 
During 
2002 the 
Bank 
also 
published 
two 
reports 
of 
user 
surveys 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
public 
service 
delivery. 
94. 
As 
the 
relationship 
with 
the 
new 
Government 
developed, 
the 
Bank 
provided 
a substantial 
amount 
of 
analytical 
assistance 
in 
response 
to 
specific 
requests. 
Short 
notes 
were 
frequently 
prepared 
on 
macroeconomic 
policy 
issues. 
In 
response 
to 
requests, 
missions were organized 
during 
the Government’s 
first 
months 
in 
office 
to 
provide 
technical  advice 
to 
the 
Privatization  Commission 
and 
on 
the 
Government‘s 
new 
Privatization 
Policy. 
Another 
Bank 
team 
provided 
detailed technical 
analysis 
on 
energy 
pricing, 
and 
there 
was 
an 
on-going dialogue 
about the 
proposed 
regulatory regime 
for 
the energy 
sector. 
The 
Bank 
resumed 
its 
financial 
sector dialogue, 
especially after 
a 
new 
Governor 
was 
named 
in 
December 
2001, 
and 
in 
late 2002 
the 
Bank 
co-managed, 
with 
the 
IMF, 
the preparation 
of 
a 
report 
under 
the 
Financial 
Sector 
Assessment 
Program 
(FSAP). 
In 
addition 
to 
contributing 
to 
the  Government’s 
development 
agenda, 
this 
rich 
menu 
of 
ESW 
has 
greatly 
influenced 
the 
design 
of 
the 
DSC. 
Lending 
Activities 
95. 
The 
Bank’s 
lending 
support 
is 
designed 
to 
complement 
our 
AAA 
initiatives 
and 
support 
the 
Government’s 
poverty reduction 
strategy. 
A 
proposed education 
sector 
adjustment 
operation and 
the 
Second 
Primary Education Development Program 
are 
under preparation 
to 
support the 
Government’s 
efforts to improve 
education 
quality 
and 
make 
it 
more 
equitable and 
efficient.  The 
Bank 
is 
the 
lead 
donor 
27 
With 
Bangladesh 
being 
in 
a 
low-case 
lending 
scenario, 
Bank’s 
annual 
lending 
to 
the 
country 
has 
averaged about 
US$300 
million 
in 
FY01-02. 
According 
to 
the 
CAS, 
base case 
lending would 
imply 
increasing 
annual 
financial 
support 
to 
about 
US$400-500 
million 
annually, 
which 
would 
be 
triggered 
by 
an 
improvement 
in 
the  macroeconomic  environment; 
improvements 
in 
govemance, 
especially procurement 
and 
financial 
management; 
and progress 
in 
sectoral 
reforms, especially 
in 
the energy and 
financial 
sectors.

of 
Bangladesh 
Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
Progress 
Report.

Page  38
in 
the 
Health 
and 
Population 
Sector 
Program and 
is 
assisting Bangladesh deal 
with 
emerging 
health 
challenges 
such 
as 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
arsenicosis. 
An 
important 
element 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
strategy 
has 
been 
to 
help 
increase 
rural 
employment 
and incomes 
through 
an 
integrated 
approach 
to 
rural 
development. 
In 
conjunction 
with 
development partners, the 
Bank 
has 
been 
worlung 
with 
Government 
in 
key 
areas 
such 
as 
agribusiness development, fisheries 
and 
agncultural 
technology. 
Investments 
supported 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
roads  and markets, 
rural 
electrification 
and 
micro-credit 
programs 
have 
provided 
income 
generating 
opportunities 
for 
the 
poor. 
The 
Bank’s 
strategy 
in 
the 
water 
sector  focuses 
on 
institutional 
reform, 
enhanced 
community participation 
and close 
attention 
to 
environmental 
and 
social 
dimensions 
of 
flood 
control 
and drainage 
schemes. 
Simultaneously, 
the 
Bank 
has 
promoted innovative community-driven 
development 
(CDD) 
approaches 
to 
deliver 
critical 
social 
assistance 
and 
infrastructure 
services 
to 
the 
poor. 
Through 
the 
Social 
Investment 
Program, 
for 
instance, 
the 
Bank 
is 
supporting 
the 
piloting 
of 
community- 
driven 
initiatives 
to 
replace 
top-down interventions 
traditionally employed 
in 
the 
country. 
Donor Coordination 
96. 
The 
Bank 
has 
continued 
to 
work 
in 
close partnership 
with 
Bangladesh’s 
active donor 
community. 
Donors, 
of 
whom 
IDA, 
ADB 
and 
Japan are 
the largest, 
finance approximately  50 
percent 
of 
the annual 
development budget. 
The 
Bank 
has 
collaborated closely 
with 
UK-DFID 
and 
CIDA 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
micro-finance; 
with 
UK-DFID 
and 
FA0 
in 
agribusiness development; 
with 
the 
Netherlands 
in 
the 
water 
sector; 
and 
with 
a consortium 
of 
donors 
in 
the 
health and education 
sectors. 
Several 
of 
the governance- 
related 
reports, 
mentioned 
above, 
have 
been prepared 
in 
partnership 
with 
donors 
such 
as 
AUSAID, 
Canada, 
Netherlands, 
UNDP 
and 
USAID. 
The 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
and 
the 
Poverty 
Assessment 
were 
jointly 
prepared 
with 
the 
Asian 
Development 
Bank. 
97. 
The 
Bank 
and 
the 
IMF 
teams 
have 
worked 
in 
close 
collaboration, 
especially 
in 
areas 
relating to 
the 
macroeconomic 
framework,  the 
financial 
sector 
and 
reforms 
of 
state 
owned 
enterprises. 
The 
IMF, 
which 
has 
taken 
the 
lead 
in 
discussions 
on 
Government’s 
medium-term 
macroeconomic framework, 
is 
processing 
a 
PRGF 
in 
parallel. 
A 
Joint 
Staff 
Assessment 
(JSA) 
of 
the I-PRSP 
is 
planned 
for 
the 
end 
of. 
May 
2003 
and 
it 
is 
envisaged 
that, 
following 
the 
JSA, 
both 
institutions 
will 
complete the preparatory 
work 
needed 
to 
process 
the 
DSC 
and PRGF 
by 
June 
2003. 
VII. 
THE 
PROPOSED 
DEVELOPMENT 
SUPPORT 
CREDIT 
98. 
Credit 
Design. 
Following 
a 
request 
from 
the 
Government,  the 
proposed Development 
Support 
Credit 
will 
support 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
implementation 
of 
the Government’s 
medium-tenn 
reform 
program, 
as 
discussed 
in 
its 
I-PRSP. 
The 
proposed credit amount 
would 
be 
US$300 
million 
equivalent,  and 
the 
borrower 
would 
be 
the People’s 
Republic 
of 
Bangladesh, represented 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
The 
Credit 
will 
be 
on 
IDA 
terms, 
with 
a 
maturity 
of 
40 
years 
including 
a 
grace 
period 
of 
10 
years. 
Strength 
of 
reform 
effort, incremental 
fiscal 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
SOE 
retrenchment 
program, 
and 
the 
country’s 
balance 
of 
payments 
position 
were 
important 
considerations 
in 
determining 
the 
credit 
amount. 
Since 
experience 
with 
multi-tranche 
adjustment  operations 
in 
Bangladesh 
in 
the 
early-to-mid 
1990s 
was 
not 
good, 
with 
cancellations 
of 
second 
and 
third 
tranches, 
it 
is 
intended 
that 
the 
credit 
will 
be 
disbursed 
in 
a 
single 
tranche, 
upon 
completion 
of 
the 
prior 
actions 
summarized 
in 
Box 
2. 
Box 
3 
summarizes 
indicative 
triggers 
for 
a 
second, 
follow-up 
adjustment  operation. 
The 
prior 
actions 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
Government’s 
medium 
term 
policy 
framework 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
B, 
and 
are 
a 
sub-set 
of 
the 
policy 
framework articulated 
in 
the 
I-PRSP. 
Columns 
2 and 3 
of 
the 
matrix 
in 
Annex 
B 
provide 
indications 
of 
the 
actions that 
Government 
is 
contemplating 
for 
FY04 
and 
FY05. 
The 
detailed 
coverage 
of 
the 
medium- 
term 
outcomes 
and 
monitorable 
indicators 
associated 
with 
this 
policy 
framework 
are 
presented 
in 
Column 
5 
of 
Annex 
B. 
This 
credit 
is 
envisaged 
as 
the 
first 
in 
a 
sequence 
of 
adjustment operations 
over 
the 
next 
30 
Page  39
several 
years. 
Govemment’s 
completion 
of 
a 
full 
PRSP 
in 
2004 
would 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
PRSCs 
as 
the 
main 
instrument 
of 
adjustment 
operations. 
This 
approach 
underpins 
a 
long-term 
engagement 
that 
is 
dependent 
on 
the 
Government’s 
commitment 
to 
continue 
implementing 
its 
reform 
program. 
99. 
Credit 
Amount 
and 
Disbursements. 
Disbursements under the proposed 
Credit 
will 
be 
made 
to 
a 
special deposit account 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
established at 
Bangladesh 
Bank for 
this 
purpose. 
The 
counterpart 
funds 
generated 
by 
the 
DSC 
will 
be 
used 
to 
finance 
part 
of 
the  Govemment’s 
budgetary 
expenditures 
related 
to 
implementing 
its 
reforms 
program, 
especially 
SOE 
reform. 
The 
credit 
will 
be 
disbursed 
according 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
simplified 
disbursement procedures 
for 
adjustment 
operations. 
Thus 
disbursements 
will 
not 
be linked 
to 
specific 
purchases 
and 
there 
will 
be 
no 
procurement 
requirements. 
If 
the 
credit 
proceeds 
are 
used 
for 
ineligible 
purposes, 
the 
International Development Association 
(IDA) 
will 
require 
the 
Borrower 
to 
either 
(a) 
return 
that amount 
to 
the 
account 
for 
use 
for 
eligible 
purposes; 
or 
(b) 
31 
Page  40
refund 
the 
amount 
directly 
to 
IDA, 
in 
which 
case 
IDA 
will 
cancel 
an 
equivalent undisbursed amount 
of 
the credit. 
IDA 
reserves 
the 
right 
to 
an 
audit 
of 
the special deposit account 
by 
the statutory auditor 
of 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
with 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
IDA. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance  and  the 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
have 
in 
place the 
basic 
financial 
management 
systems 
in 
terms 
of 
accounting, 
reporting, 
auditing 
and 
internal 
controls. 
The 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
agreed 
to 
adopt 
IAS 
in 
preparing 
its 
financial 
statements 
and 
will 
be 
audited 
by 
internationally 
recognized 
auditing 
firms.

Fiduciary 
Risks 
and 
Mitigation. 
Efficient 
and 
accountable management 
of 
public 
finances 
is 
central 
to 
good 
governance. 
Bangladesh 
is 
particularly 
weak 
in 
this 
area, 
as 
discussed 
in 
the 
annual 
reports 
of 
the 
Comptroller 
and 
Auditor 
General 
and 
the 
recently 
concluded 
Country  Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
and 
the 
IMF 
Fiscal 
ROSC 
and  Safeguard 
Assessment 
reports. 
Inadequate 
internal 
controls 
in 
the 
public 
sector 
annually 
result 
in 
a large number 
of 
irregularities 
and 
incidents 
of 
malfeasance. 
As 
discussed 
in 
paragraph 
65, 
a recent 
IMF 
Safeguards 
Assessment 
found 
major 
weaknesses 
in 
the accounting, 
reporting 
and 
control 
environment 
of 
Bangladesh 
Bank. 
101. 
The 
proposed operation 
supports 
a number 
of 
initiatives 
recommended 
by 
the 
CFAA 
such 
as 
separating 
the 
audit 
and accounting 
functions, 
a 
greater 
independence 
for 
the 
Auditor 
General, 
adoption 
of 
public 
sector 
international auditing 
standards (cash basis, 
as 
a 
first 
step), 
preparation 
of 
a 
strategic 
plan 
and an independent 
review 
of 
the 
C&AGs 
office, 
overhauling 
procurement 
procedures and guidelines, 
and establishing 
an 
independent 
Anti-Corruption 
Commission. 
During 
the 
next 
few 
years, 
government 
intends 
to significantly 
strengthen 
financial 
management 
through 
the 
installation 
of 
financial 
management 
units 
in 
every 
ministry, 
survey 
of 
internal 
controls 
and 
reform 
activity, 
publication 
of 
annual 
performance 
reports 
by 
ministries, 
training 
of 
public 
sector accountants, 
updating financial 
manuals and 
guidelines, 
closing 
non-essential 
bank 
accounts, 
and 
establishing 
internal audit 
committees 
in 
all 
ministries. 
These 
initiatives 
are 
being 
supported 
by 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Reform 
Program, 
financed 
by 
UK-DFID 
and 
the  Government 
of 
Netherlands. 
As 
indicated 
in 
paragraph 
67, 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
IMF 
safeguards 
assessment 
are 
being 
implemented 
to 
enhance 
the 
safeguards 
framework 
for 
Bangladesh 
Bank. 
102. 
Environmental 
Aspects. 
As 
the 
proposed 
operation 
is 
a structural 
adjustment credit, 
it 
is 
guided 
by 
OD8.60, 
rather than 
by 
OP4.01 
and therefore 
does 
not 
require an 
environmental 
assessment, 
although 
a 
review 
of 
environmental 
policies 
is 
good 
practice. 
In 
preparation 
for 
the 
sequence 
of 
IDA-supported 
adjustment 
credits 
expected 
to 
take 
place 
over the 
next 
several 
years, 
discussions 
are 
underway 
with 
the 
Government 
to 
collaborate 
with 
the 
Bank 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
Country 
Environment 
Analysis, 
which 
would 
review 
the 
state 
of 
the 
environment,  analyze 
existing 
policies,  and 
assess 
current 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
environmental 
management.  Based 
on 
this 
assessment, 
further 
environmental 
reforms and 
institutional 
strengthening 
consistent 
with 
the 
PRSP 
may 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the actions supported 
by 
future 
adjustment  credits. 
In 
addition, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Government's 
privatization 
program, 
an 
environmental 
due 
diligence 
process 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
implemented 
to 
help 
identify, 
assign 
and 
mitigate 
the 
environmental 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
facilities 
to 
be 
privatized 
and closed. 
103. 
Social 
Impact 
and Poverty 
Monitoring. 
The 
I-PRSP 
acknowledges 
that 
the 
success 
of 
the 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
will 
require 
a 
systematic approach 
to monitoring 
and 
evaluation, and 
outlines a 
comprehensive 
set 
of 
input, 
intermediate,  and outcome 
indicators that 
will 
be 
used 
to 
track 
progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
(Annex 
C). 
One 
of 
the 
key 
outputs 
of 
the 
poverty 
monitoring 
system 
envisaged 
under 
the I-PRSP 
is 
an 
Annual 
Report 
on 
Poverty Reduction 
and 
Social 
Development, 
providing 
an overview 
of 
progress 
in 
achieving 
economic growth, 
human 
development, 
poverty 
reduction, 
gender 
equality 
targets and analysis 
of 
factors 
behind 
the observed 
trends 
and 
their 
policy 
implications. 
A 
Poverty 
Focal Point 
is 
envisaged 
in 
the 
Planning Commission 
for 
effective 
poverty 
and 
MDG 
monitoring 
and 
trackmg 
progress 
in 
implementing 
anti-poverty 
policies 
and 
programs. 
In 
addition, 
a 
National 
Poverty Reduction 
Council 
(NPRC) 
chaired 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
formed, 
with 
strong 
inter-ministerial 
linkages and representation 
from 
the 
private 
sector, 
academia, 
research 
institutes, 
NGOs, 
and 
the 
civil 
society. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy 
will 
be 
the central task 
of 
this 
Council, along 
with 
addressing strategy 
and policy-related 
issues 
arising out 
of 
the 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
work 
of 
the 
Poverty 
Focal 
Point, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
act 
as 
the Secretariat 
for 
NPRC. 
104. 
A 
relatively 
comprehensive 
information 
base 
already exists 
in 
Bangladesh, 
providing 
extensive 
geographically 
disaggregated  data  needed 
to  monitor 
most 
of 
the 
important  poverty 
and

development 
indicators. 
The 
country 
has 
in 
place 
extensive 
data 
collection 
systems 
on 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
indicators 
related 
to 
poverty, 
demography, 
health, education, 
nutrition, 
and 
access 
to 
services. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
decennial 
population 
censuses, 
at 
regular 
intervals 
Bangladesh 
Bureau 
of 
Statistics 
(BBS) 
carries 
out 
large-scale 
nationally 
and 
regionally 
representative 
surveys, 
such 
as 
Household 
Income  and 
Expenditure  Survey 
(HIES), 
Labor 
Force  Survey 
(LFS), 
and 
Child Nutrition 
Survey 
(CNS). 
Other 
government 
agencies 
(e.g. 
BANBEIS 
- 
the 
Bangladesh 
Bureau 
of 
Educational 
Information 
and Statistics) 
also 
maintain 
an 
extensive 
database 
of 
a number 
of 
sector-specific 
indicators. 
Other 
independent (or 
semi-autonomous) 
data 
collection initiatives include 
the 
Bangladesh 
Health 
and 
Demographic 
Surveys 
(DHS), 
the 
Helen 
Keller 
International’s 
Nutritional 
Surveillance 
Project,  and the 
CAMPE 
Education 
Watch 
project 
105. 
Donors, 
notably 
the 
ADB, 
DFID, 
and 
the 
World 
Bank, 
are 
coordinating 
efforts 
to 
provide 
technical 
and 
financial 
assistance 
needed 
to 
strengthen 
capacity 
in 
the 
Poverty 
Focal 
Point 
to 
fulfill 
its 
designated 
function. 
Further, 
building 
on 
a long-standing 
collaboration 
between 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
BBS, 
which 
has 
included 
extensive 
technical 
assistance 
for 
two 
earlier 
HIES 
rounds, 
efforts 
are 
underway 
to 
prepare an 
IDF 
grant 
to 
support 
the 
next HIES, 
and 
to 
reinforce 
and 
expand 
on 
earlier 
initiatives 
to 
improve 
in-country 
capacity 
for 
poverty 
and 
social 
impact 
monitoring 
and 
analysis. 
106. 
Government 
is 
keenly 
aware 
of 
the 
potential 
social 
costs 
associated 
with 
some 
of 
the 
adjustment 
measures 
and 
would 
like 
to 
ensure 
that 
social 
hardships 
resulting 
from 
the 
reforms 
are 
minimized. 
In 
particular, 
there 
are 
concerns about 
workers that 
have 
been 
laid 
off 
as 
a 
result 
of 
SOE 
closures 
and the 
increase 
in 
the  cost 
of 
living 
resulting 
fi-om 
recent 
increases 
in 
utility 
prices2’. 
Learning 
from 
past 
experience, 
to 
mitigate 
adverse 
social 
impacts, 
Government 
has 
engaged 
labor 
representatives 
in 
extensive discussions 
prior 
to 
embarkmg 
upon 
its 
SOE 
closures 
and 
privatization 
program. 
While 
the 
legal 
minimum 
gratuity required 
under 
the 
labor 
code 
is 
one 
month’s 
salary 
per 
year’s 
service, 
the 
negotiated 
severance 
package 
is 
generous 
(two 
months 
salary 
for 
every 
year 
of 
service, 
plus 
a redundancy 
payment 
ranging 
fi-om 
13 
to 
27 
percent, depending 
upon 
length 
of 
service) 
and 
will 
mitigate 
against 
some 
of 
the 
hardship that 
retrenched 
workers 
might 
face. 
The 
average severance 
pay 
received 
by 
blue collar 
workers 
is 
about 
Tk. 
100,000-125,000 
(US$1,750-2,200). 
These 
“savings” 
are 
equivalent 
to 
about  3 
years’ 
eamings 
for 
an 
unskdled worker 
in 
the 
informal 
sector, 
and 
much 
more 
than 
they 
could 
expect 
to 
save. 
Extra 
care 
is 
being 
taken 
to 
ensure 
that 
laid-off 
workers 
do 
not 
have 
to 
pay 
bribes 
to 
receive 
their 
retrenchment 
benefits 
by 
issuing 
“accounts 
payee 
only” 
checks 
or 
directly 
depositing 
payments 
into 
workers’ 
bank 
accounts. 
A 
survey 
of 
workers 
who 
were retrenched 
following 
the 
closure 
of 
Adamjee 
Jute 
Mill 
is 
presently 
being 
implemented 
to 
better 
understand 
what 
has 
happened 
to 
the 
workers 
and 
their 
families 
six 
months after 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
enterprise. 
The 
survey 
questionnaire 
has 
been 
designed 
to pay 
particular 
attention 
to 
the 
social 
impact 
of 
the 
reform 
measures 
on 
women and 
children. 
Over 
the 
longer 
term, 
there 
is 
an 
expectation that 
the 
improved 
investment 
climate 
resulting 
from 
the 
structural 
reforms 
will 
facilitate displaced workers 
finding 
alternative employment opportunities. 
107. 
Recent 
increases 
in 
energy 
prices 
are 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
inflation 
in 
the 
short 
run. 
However, after 
incorporating 
these 
price 
hikes, 
the 
overall 
annual increase 
in 
the 
Consumer 
Price 
Index 
is 
projected 
to 
remain 
under 
5 
percent, 
as 
has 
been the 
case 
in 
recent 
years 
(Annex 
B). 
Moreover, 
the 
first 
100 
kWh 
of 
electricity 
usage 
are 
heavily 
subsidized 
and Government believes that 
this 
block 
is 
more 
than 
sufficient 
to 
protect 
the 
poor, 
many 
of 
whom 
do 
not 
have 
legal 
access 
to 
electricity 
supply. 
Surveys 
conducted 
in 
four major 
metropolitan 
areas 
in 
Bangladesh show that 
there 
is 
a 
high 
willingness 
29 
While 
retrenchment 
of 
SOE 
workers 
is 
no 
doubt 
an 
important 
issue 
from 
a 
political 
economy 
perspective, 
it 
is 
worth 
bearing 
in 
mind 
that fewer 
than 
5 
percent 
of 
all 
workers 
in 
Bangladesh 
are 
employed 
in 
the 
formal public 
sector. 
Furthermore, 
public 
sector 
jobs 
pay 
an 
extremely 
high 
premium: 
even 
after 
controlling for  individual 
characteristics  such 
as 
education 
and 
experience, 
the 
wage 
premium 
in 
public 
sector 
jobs 
for 
men is 
estimated 
to 
be 
3 
1 
percent 
and 
for 
women 
66 
percent:

priority. 
108. 
Given 
that 
the 
assessment 
of 
the  social 
impact 
of 
programs 
and policies through 
quantitative 
methods alone has 
some 
important limitations, 
BBS 
is 
planning 
to 
integrate 
qualitative 
and quantitative 
data 
collection 
in 
the 
next 
HIES 
round. 
The 
qualitative 
field 
work 
administered 
in 
a 
subset 
of 
sites 
to 
be 
covered 
under 
the 
survey 
will 
focus 
on 
issues 
related 
to 
empowerment, 
participation, 
vulnerability, 
and 
social 
mobility, 
and 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
collaboration 
with 
local 
NGOs. 
Access 
to 
data 
within 
the 
country 
will 
be improved through adoption 
of 
a 
national 
data 
access 
policy 
by 
the 
government. 
Finally, 
the 
planned 
IDF 
grant 
will 
also 
promote collaboration 
between 
BBS 
and 
Dhaka 
University 
to 
facilitate 
use 
of 
BBS 
data 
by 
students 
and 
applied 
researchers 
in 
the 
country. 
It 
is 
expected that 
these 
various 
initiatives 
will 
help 
promote  better 
use 
of 
data 
within 
the 
country  and 
strengthened 
capacity 
for 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, and 
will 
help 
inculcate a 
stronger 
‘results-orientation’ 
within 
Government. 
I 
109. 
Improving 
governance 
has 
repeatedly 
been 
identified 
as 
the 
biggest 
development challenge 
facing 
Bangladesh 
and 
the 
greatest 
impediment 
to 
achieving 
its 
growth 
potential 
and 
thus 
achieving 
the 
poverty reduction 
MDG. 
The 
measures 
already 
implemented 
and 
the actions 
proposed 
will 
increase transparency 
and accountability 
in 
government, 
help 
restore 
public 
and 
private 
sector confidence,  and 
improve 
the investment climate. 
In 
particular, 
until 
the 
Govemment 
is 
able 
to 
produce timely, 
accurate 
and transparent 
financial 
reports, the 
fiduciary 
risks 
in 
Bangladesh 
will 
remain 
high. 
Improving 
Governance 
will 
contribute 
to 
accelerating 
the 
rate 
of 
economic growth,  employment 
creation and 
poverty 
reduction. 
Governance 
improvements 
in 
the 
social 
sectors, 
in 
particular, 
will 
help 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
delivery 
in 
these 
essential 
sectors 
and make 
the services 
more affordable 
and 
accessible 
to 
the 
poor. 
Benefits 
and 
Risks. 
110. 
The 
program, however, 
entails 
significant 
risks. 
First, 
gwen 
the 
powerful 
vested 
interests 
who 
stand 
to 
loose 
substantially 
from 
improvements 
in 
governance, 
existing 
political 
support 
for 
the 
medium- 
term 
reform 
program could 
erode 
once 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
situation improves 
or 
as 
elections 
draw 
closer, 
or 
if 
the 
distribution 
of 
gains 
from 
growth 
are 
not 
sufficiently 
equitable. 
Second, 
implementation 
may 
be 
slower 
than 
planned 
because 
of 
limited 
experience, inadequate 
institutional 
and 
human 
capacity, 
or 
uneven 
support 
for 
reform 
within 
the Government,  especially 
given 
the 
deep-rooted nature 
of 
the 
problems and wide-ranging 
reforms 
that 
are 
called for. 
Third, 
the 
reform 
costs 
to 
the budget 
could be 
higher 
than 
estimated 
if 
banking 
and 
SOE 
reforms 
proceed 
at 
a slower 
pace 
or 
if 
adjustment-related 
counterpart 
funds 
are 
invested 
in 
unviable 
projects. 
Finally, 
there 
is 
a 
danger  that  the 
extemal 
environment 
could 
remain 
depressed 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
of 
time, 
preventing 
an 
acceleration 
in 
the rate 
of 
export 
and economic 
growth. 
Increased 
levels 
of 
extemal financial 
support  are 
being 
solicited to 
provide 
the 
Government 
with 
a cushion 
against 
this 
extemal 
risk.

Mitigation 
Strategy. 
Several 
specific 
measures 
are 
being 
implemented 
to 
minimize 
these 
risks. 
First, 
the 
new 
Govemment, 
which 
was 
elected 
on 
a 
reform 
platform, 
has 
significantly 
accelerated the 
PRSP 
preparation 
process, 
during 
which 
numerous 
consultations 
with 
civil 
society 
groups 
on 
the 
need 
to 
implement reforms 
have 
taken 
place 
throughout 
the 
country. 
These 
consultations 
have 
benefited 
from 
a 
rich 
body 
of 
analytical reports prepared 
by 
the 
Bank 
and other development 
partners 
that 
has 
been 
widely 
disseminated. 
The 
resulting 
draft 
I-PRSP 
has 
been 
discussed 
widely 
throughout 
the  country. 
The 
Govemment 
has also engaged 
in 
substantive 
dialogue 
with 
labor 
leaders 
and 
workers 
to 
ensure 
that 
their 
concerns 
are 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
retrenchment 
program. 
As 
Government 
deepens 
its 
reform 
efforts, 
it 
will 
be 
important 
to 
ensure that, 
as 
discussed 
above, 
an effective 
monitoring 
system 
is 
put 
in 
place 
to 
assess 
the 
social 
impact 
of 
adjustment. 
Second, 
the 
reform 
effort 
is 
being 
led 
by 
the

build 
constituencies 
for 
change 
within 
the 
political 
leadership. 
The 
Minister 
and 
his 
team 
are 
convinced 
that  support 
from 
the 
FIs 
at 
this 
stage 
in 
the 
reform 
process 
will 
considerably 
strengthen 
their 
hand 
and 
set 
the 
stage 
for 
future 
reforms. 
Third, 
the 
Government 
has 
already 
implemented 
significant  up-front 
actions, 
laying 
the 
foundation 
for 
subsequent 
reforms.  Fourth, 
the 
Govemment, 
in 
concert 
with 
the 
Bank, 
DFID 
and other donors 
has 
a 
well-articulated 
plan for 
financial 
management 
reforms. 
The most important 
actions 
in 
order 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
are 
the 
reestablishment 
of 
the 
Public 
Accounts Committee and 
the 
complete independence 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General, 
areas 
in 
which 
the 
Government 
is 
workmg 
on. 
Fifth, 
the 
single 
tranche 
operation 
will 
ensure 
implementation 
of 
a 
critical 
minimum 
set 
of 
irreversible 
actions. 
Finally, 
Bangladesh enjoys considerable 
goodwill 
among 
the 
donor 
community 
which 
has 
indicated 
that 
their 
support 
to 
the 
country 
would 
increase 
if 
the 
reform 
effort 
is 
sustained. 
Substantial 
technical 
assistance 
support 
is 
also 
being 
lined 
up 
to 
help 
design 
and support 
the 
implementation 
of 
future reforms. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
World 
Bank, 
such 
technical 
assistance 
support 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
UK-DFID, 
ADB, 
UNDP 
and 
the 
IMF. 
112. 
While 
the above 
risk 
mitigation 
measures 
should 
provide 
adequate 
comfort 
that 
these 
risks 
are 
manageable, 
as 
an 
added 
risk-mitigation 
measure 
and 
to 
strengthen 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
reformers, the 
Bank 
will 
provide 
a 
credit 
acceleration 
clause 
that 
would allow 
the 
Bank 
to 
demand 
immediate repayment 
of 
the 
proposed 
credit 
by 
the 
Borrower 
in 
case 
if 
reforms 
are 
reversed 
or materially 
changed.

Dear 
Mr. 
Wolfensohn, 
Letter 
of 
Development Policy 
1.0 
Introduction 
1.1 
Since the assumption 
of 
office 
in 
October 
2001, 
the 
present 
Government 
took 
immediate 
steps 
to 
stem 
the 
slide 
in 
macroeconomic 
management, 
and, 
through 
swift 
corrective 
measures, 
has 
been 
able 
to 
restore macroeconomic 
stability, 
and 
set 
the 
economy 
on 
a 
course 
of 
sustained 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
In 
sharp 
contrast 
with 
the 
lack 
of 
reforms 
during 
the 
five 
years 
of 
the 
previous 
Government, 
the 
new 
Government 
is 
keen 
to 
undertake 
wide-ranging 
reforms 
of 
institutions 
and 
policies relating 
to 
broad-based 
governance, 
banking 
and 
financial 
sector, 
state- 
owned 
enterprises, energy, 
infrastructure, 
and 
the environment. 
1.2 
This 
letter 
of 
Development 
Policy 
lays 
out 
what 
the 
Government 
has 
already done 
in 
the 
field 
of 
structural 
reforms,  the 
reform 
actions 
planned 
under 
its 
three  year 
National 
Strategy 
for 
Economic 
Growth,  Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Social 
Development, 
and 
seeks 
adjustment support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Our 
strategy 
is 
to 
undertake 
reforms 
on 
the basis 
of 
the 
Action 
Plan 
embodied 
in 
the 
NSEGPWI-PRSP. 
In 
light 
of 
this 
strategy,  a 
three-year 
“Rolling 
Investment 
Program” 
is 
being 
formulated, 
which 
will 
be 
the  basis 
of 
the  Government’s 
medium-term 
development 
strategy. 
The 
major 
thrust 
of 
that  strategy 
is 
on 
rapid 
poverty reduction 
and 
accelerated economic 
growth 
with 
macroeconomic 
stability.

2.0 
Background 
2.1 
On 
October 
10, 
2001, 
when 
the 
present 
Government 
took 
charge, 
the 
macroeconomic 
situation 
was 
fragile 
with 
a 
fiscal 
deficit 
that 
appeared 
quite 
unsustainable. 
By 
June 
2001, 
the 
consolidated  government 
deficit 
had 
risen 
to 
nearly 
7.5% 
of 
GDP, 
from 
4.4 
percent 
in 
FY98. 
Consequently,  domestic 
bank 
borrowings 
of 
the 
govemment 
rose 
dramatically 
such that 
the 
outstanding domestic 
public 
debt 
rose 
threefold 
between 
FY96 
and 
FYOI, 
from 
Tk. 
60 
billion 
to 
Tk. 
180 
billion. 
Monetary 
policy, 
which 
simply 
accommodated the 
fiscal 
excesses, 
was 
highly 
expansionary, 
and 
led 
to 
pressures 
on 
the balance 
of 
payments 
and 
depletion 
of 
foreign 
exchange 
reserves. 
In 
October 
2001 
, 
these 
reserves 
stood 
at 
$1.1 
billion, 
barely sufficient 
to 
finance 
six 
weeks’ 
import 
bill. 
Global 
economic 
recession, 
which 
was 
further 
deepened 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
September 
11 
events, 
made matters worse 
by 
causing a 
fall 
in 
Bangladesh’s 
export 
earnings, 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
many 
years. 
3.0 
Immediate 
Steps 
to 
Restore Macroeconomic 
Stability 
3.1 
The new 
Government 
being 
fully 
aware 
of 
the 
danger 
posed 
by 
macroeconomic 
imbalances 
had 
to 
undertake 
urgent recovery 
measures 
to 
address 
the 
issue. 
The 
Government 
formed 
five 
Secretaries 
Committees 
on 
17 
October, 
2001 
to 
prepare 
reports 
on 
adrmnistrative 
reforms, 
improvement 
of 
law 
and 
order situation, 
poverty 
alleviation, 
human 
resource development 
and 
economic 
management. 
The  commitment 
of 
the 
Government 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
reforms 
and 
improved 
governance 
is 
best 
reflected 
in 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
100-day 
program 
to 
address 
25 
most 
urgent 
issues 
facing 
the country. 
Budgetary Management 
3.2 
A 
number 
of 
measures 
have been introduced over 
the 
past 
year 
to improve 
the 
government’s 
budgetary 
management.  These 
include: 
0 
In 
FY02 
there 
was 
skepticism that government 
would 
be 
able 
to 
keep 
the 
fiscal 
deficit to 
within 
five 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Yet, 
with 
strong  determination 
and 
steadfast 
efforts,  the 
government made 
prudent 
though 
painful 
changes 
in 
fiscal 
and 
financial 
management 
which 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
restore 
fiscal 
balance 
and 
contain the 
fiscal 
deficit 
to 
4.7%. 
This 
was 
accomplished 
through 
a 
combination 
of 
expenditure 
rationalisation 
and 
improvements 
in 
tax 
administration. 
On 
the basis 
of 
data 
fed 
by 
computerised 
accounting 
and 
budgeting 
system, 
the Finance 
Division, 
after 
exhaustive 
interaction 
with 
the 
line 
ministries over 
a 
period 
of 
2 
months, 
pruned 
non-essential 
expenditure 
to 
the 
tune 
of 
about 
Taka 
10 
billion. 
In 
order 
to 
compress 
capital 
expenditure, 
the 
Planning Commission 
also 
undertook 
a 
similar 
exercise 
to

prune 
the 
Annual 
Development 
Programme 
by 
axing 
unproductive and low-priority projects 
to 
the tune 
of 
Taka 
30 
billion. 
e 
Monthly Fiscal 
Performance 
Report 
was 
developed 
and 
is 
now 
being 
generated 
on 
the basis 
of 
information 
gathered 
from 
budgeting 
and 
accounting 
database. 
This 
helps 
in 
monitoring 
resource 
mobilization 
and 
utilisation 
of 
resources 
by 
ministry 
and 
by 
economic  category. 
Generation 
of 
this 
report 
has 
been 
institutionalised. 
0 
Separation 
of 
accounts 
from  audit 
was 
implemented 
from 
1 
July 
2002. 
This 
entailed certain 
institutional 
restructuring 
including 
creation 
of 
offices 
of 
CAOs 
(Chief 
Accounts 
Officer) 
in 
each 
ministry 
directly 
reporting 
to 
respective 
Secretaries 
and 
CGA 
(Controller 
General 
of 
Accounts) 
reporting 
to 
Finance 
Secretary. 
Field 
accounting 
offices 
were reorganised 
through 
abolition 
of 
20  Regional 
Accounts 
Offices 
and 
creating 
6 
upgraded 
Divisional 
Offices. 
Information 
generated 
at 
Thana 
and 
district 
levels 
are 
monitored 
and 
consolidated 
by 
6 
Divisional 
Controllers 
of 
Accounts 
and 
electronically 
transferred 
to 
Central 
Data 
Processing 
Unit 
at 
CGA, 
and 
from 
there 
to 
Finance 
Division. 
Because 
of 
on-line 
electronic  data 
transmission 
central 
government 
accounts 
can 
now 
be 
compiled 
and 
reported 
within 
S(five) 
weeks 
of 
month-end. 
e 
Expansionary 
fiscal 
policy 
and 
unimpeded 
release 
of 
funds 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
fiscal 
year 
by 
the past government 
caused 
large 
carryover 
of 
expenditure 
into 
the 
following 
fiscal 
year 
creating imbalance between 
below 
the 
line 
and above the 
line 
budget deficit, 
and 
misuse 
of 
fimd. 
For 
example, 
cheques 
of 
about 
Taka 
17 
billion 
floated 
into 
FY02 from 
FYO1. 
Through 
streamlining 
of 
budgetary 
process 
(no 
fimd 
was 
released after 
May) 
and 
cash 
management (no 
cheque 
issued 
in 
FY02 
was 
honoured 
after 
15 
of 
July, 2002) 
cheque 
float 
from FY02 
to 
FY03 
has 
been 
scaled 
down 
to 
only 
Taka 
5 
billion, 
which 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
a 
reasonable 
float. 
Thus 
unabated 
chequefloat 
was 
curbed. 
In 
order 
to 
restore 
fiscal 
and 
budgetary discipline, 
soon 
after 
taking 
charge, 
the 
Government 
imposed 
an 
embargo 
on 
irregular 
transfer 
of 
funds 
to 
the Public 
Account 
of 
the 
Republic. 
Up 
until 
then, 
this 
had 
been a regular practice 
of 
certain 
departments 
and 
during 
FYOl 
a 
substantial amount was transferred 
to 
several 
deposit accounts 
to 
avoid 
lapse 
of 
budget 
grants. 
Aside 
from 
this, 
the 
CGA 
is 
seriously 
pursuing 
regular 
reconciliation 
of 
both 
receipts 
and 
expenditure 
with 
the 
relevant 
departments. 
e 
To 
establish 
integrity 
of 
balances 
of 
various 
accounts 
under 
the 
Public 
Account 
of 
the 
Republic, 
CGA 
has 
introduced 
an 
elaborate 
programme 
to 
verify 
the balances 
kept 
by 
the 
Page  48
Annex 
A 
Page

of

entire  accounting 
network 
of 
the 
Government.  Several 
task 
teams 
have 
been 
fielded 
to 
monitor 
and 
review 
the 
progress 
of 
implementation.  Full-scale  implementation 
of 
this 
programme 
would 
mean 
reflection 
of 
correct 
balances 
of 
these 
accounts 
in 
the 
national 
accounts. 
Prior 
to 
introduction 
of 
this 
programme, 
there 
was 
no 
serious 
attempt 
to 
provide 
credibility 
to 
the 
balances 
of 
these 
accounts. 
To 
assure 
quality 
of 
accounting 
data, 
a 
Central 
Reconciliation 
Unit 
has been established 
within 
CGA. 
The 
unit 
is 
now 
carrying out reconciliation 
of 
cheques 
electronically 
issued 
by 
the 
CAOs 
based 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Dhaka 
and 
paid 
by 
Bangladesh 
Bank. 
In 
order 
to 
have 
real time 
information 
on 
Government's receipts, expenditure 
and 
borrowing position 
of 
CAO 
of 
each 
ministry 
now 
have 
one 
window 
each, 
in 
respect 
of 
receipts 
and 
expenditure 
with 
the 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
and 
Sonali 
Bank, 
and 
their 
individual 
transactions 
are 
reported 
to 
the 
Finance 
Division 
by 
the 
banks 
on 
a 
weekly 
basis. 
In 
the 
current 
FY, 
ADP's 
fund 
release 
is 
being 
monitored 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
to 
see 
development 
resource 
utilization 
pattern.  Government's 
Bank 
borrowing 
is 
being 
monitored 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
and 
weekly/monthly report 
on 
domestic 
debt 
management 
is 
being 
prepared 
on 
the

has 
been 
formed 
comprising

Macroeconomic 
Management 
3.3 
Several 
measures 
have 
been 
put 
in 
place 
and more 
are 
being 
taken 
to 
improve 
macroeconomic management. 
These 
are 
listed 
below: 
All 
projects 
financed 
by 
suppliers' credits 
have 
been 
put 
on 
hold. The 
FY03 
budget, 
with 
a 
central 
government 
deficit 
target 
of 
3.9 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
was 
approved 
by 
parliament 
in 
June 
2002. 
Numerous 
revenue-enhancing 
measures 
- 
both 
in 
tax 
and 
non-tax were 
announced 
in 
the 
budget 
for 
FY03. 
These 
include: 
lowering 
of 
the personal 
income 
tax exemption 
limit, 
increase 
in 
the 
minimum 
income tax 
payable 
by 
individuals, 
containment 
of 
tax 
holidays, 
additional 
tax 
on 
undistributed 
profits 
of 
listed 
companies, 
reduction 
in 
corporate 
tax 
rate, 
inclusion 
of 
NGO 
incomes (except 
micro-credit) 
into 
the 
tax 
net, 
abolition 
of 
zero 
duty 
rates 
on 
many 
imports, 
withdrawal 
of 
several 
VAT 
exemptions 
and 
extension 
of 
VAT 
to 
additional 
areas 
of 
activity, 
increase 
in 
travel 
and 
motor 
vehicle 
taxes, 
and 
appropriate 
rationalization 
of 
the 
rates 
of 
non-tax 
revenue items. 
To 
make 
our 
development 
effort 
self-reliant 
and 
self-sustaining, 
we 
are 
conscious 
of 
the 
need 
to 
enhance 
our 
revenue 
effort. 
In 
the 
backdrop 
of 
declining foreign 
aid, 
this 
becomes even 
more 
crucial. 
This 
is 
why 
a 
gamut 
of 
policy 
changes 
have 
been 
initiated 
both 
in 
tax revenue 
and 
non-tax 
revenue items. 
The 
revenue target 
has 
been 
raised 
from 
10.2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY02 
to 
10.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY03. 
Some 
non-tax 
revenue 
rates 
have 
been 
enhanced 
by 
even 
500 
times. 
During 
the 
first 
six months 
of 
the 
current year 
NBR 
revenue 
has 
increased 
by 
about 23% 
much 
higher 
than 
the 
target. 
Though collection 
of 
non-tax 
revenue 
is 
still 
lagging 
behind 
its 
target, 
it 
is 
expected 
to 
increase 
significantly 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
year. 
Our 
expenditure-GDP 
ratio 
(at 
15% 
of 
GDP) 
is 
also one 
of 
the 
lowest 
in 
the 
world. 
We 
plan 
a 
judicious 
increase 
in public 
expenditures 
directed 
primarily 
towards 
social 
and

3.4 
Privatization 
and 
Rationalization 
of 
SOEs 
The 
Government 
has 
passed 
a 
revised 
Privatisation  Policy 
signalling 
its 
commitment 
to 
reform. 
All 
SOEs 
have been 
put 
on 
hard 
budget 
constraints 
and 
a 
well-designed performance 
contract 
will 
soon 
be 
in 
operation 
with 
appropriate 
system 
of 
rewards. 
The 
Government 
is 
downsizing 
the 
Trading 
Corporation 
of 
Bangladesh  (TCB), 
Bangladesh 
Apculture 
Development  Corporation  (BADC), 
Bangladesh 
Sugar 
and 
Food 
Industries  Corporation 
(BSFIC), 
Bangladesh 
Shpping 
Corporation 
(BSC), 
Bangladesh 
Chemical 
Industries 
Corporation 
(BCIC) 
and 
Bangladesh  Steel 
and 
Engineering  Corporation 
(BSEC). 
One 
hundred 
SOEs 
are 
presently 
being 
processed 
for 
privatization 
by 
the 
Privatization 
Commission, 
out 
of 
which 
fifty-three 
have 
been 
taken 
up 
for 
privatization 
by 
the present 
government. 
SOEs 
identified for 
privatisation, 
if 
no 
buyers 
are 
found, 
would 
be 
closed 
down. 
Already 
Adamjee 
Jute 
Mill 
and 
19 
(nineteen) 
other 
mills 
have 
been 
closed. 
This 
would 
reduce 
manpower 
in 
the 
SOEs sector 
by 
15 
percent 
and 
its 
loss 
by 
17%. 
4.0 
Structural 
Reforms 
to 
Improve 
Productivity 
and 
Efficiency 
4.1 
Reforms 
in 
the 
Energy 
and 
Power 
Sector 
The 
Government 
has 
undertaken a 
series 
of 
reform 
measures 
in 
the energy 
and 
power 
sector 
in 
order 
to 
create 
an 
appropriate 
enabling  environment 
for 
improved 
public 
sector 
performance,  attract 
multi-lateral 
and 
private 
investment, 
rationalize 
tariff 
rates 
and 
improve 
tariff 
collections, 
and 
give 
'value 
for 
money' 
to 
the 
consumers. 
Long 
overdue 
increases 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
petroleum,  gas 
and power 
have 
been 
implemented. 
Energy 
prices 
were 
raised 
in 
January 
and 
September 
2002 
on 
motor 
spirits 
(22%), 
diesel 
and 
kerosene 
(lo%), 
power 
and 
electricity 
(74%) 
and 
natural 
gas 
(10%). 
In 
January 
2003, 
petrol 
and 
diesel prices were 
increased 
by 
a 
further 
17%. 
In 
order  to promote 
efficient 
energy 
use, 
the 
government 
has 
adopted  a 
new 
electricity, 
gas 
and 
petroleum 
pricing 
framework  to 
ensure 
efficiency 
and 
financial 
viability 
of 
this 
sector. 
This 
framework 
will 
provide 
for 
a formula-based, 
flexible 
pricing 
mechanism 
that 
rationalizes 
the 
prices 
of 
energy 
products 
and 
enables 
cost 
recovery 
for 
all 
operating, maintenance, 
and 
capital 
costs.

soon. 
Government 
has 
decided 
to 
combine 
the 
drafts 
“Bangladesh 
Electricity 
Reform 
Act, 
2002” 
and 
“Gas 
Act” 
together. 
The 
combined 
Draft 
Act 
renamed 
as 
“The 
Energy 
Regulatory 
Commission 
Act, 
2003” 
has 
been enacted 
in 
April 
2003. 
This 
act 
would 
facilitate 
creation 
of 
an 
Energy Regulatory 
Commission 
for 
regulation 
of 
all 
activities related 
to 
electricity, 
gas, 
and 
petroleum 
products.

The 
transmission 
lines, 
according 
to 
the 
action 
plan, 
have 
been 
handed 
over 
to 
PGCB 
(Power 
Grid 
Company 
of 
Bangladesh) 
by 
BPDB 
(Bangladesh Power 
Development 
Board). 
BPDB 
and 
DESA 
have 
prepared 
a 
list 
of 
the 
largest 1000 
numbers 
of 
defaulting 
consumers 
and 
the 
disconnection 
process 
is 
going 
on. The 
field 
offices 
of 
DESA 
and 
BPDB 
are 
taking 
actions 
against  the 
delinquent 
consumers 
as 
a  continuous  process 
in 
collecting 
revenues. 
For 
increasing revenue 
earnings, 
many 
consumers have been 
allowed 
payment 
of 
arrears 
by 
instalments. 
Both 
the 
agencies 
are 
trying 
to 
resolve 
the 
problem 
of 
high 
accounts 
receivables 
through 
a 
policy 
of 
persuasion and legal measures. 
Arrears 
payable 
by 
the 
Government 
on 
account 
of 
utilities 
will 
be 
settled 
by 
June 
this 
year.

In 
view 
of 
the 
positive  impact 
of 
telecommunication 
and 
the 
new 
information 
and 
communication  technology 
on 
poverty 
alleviation 
and 
growth, 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
undertaking 
reforms 
in 
the 
telecommunication 
sector. 
The 
Bangladesh 
Telecommunication 
Act, 2001 
has 
been 
enacted 
to 
meet 
the 
demand 
of 
a 
growing 
and 
modem 
economy. 
The 
Act 
provides 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory 
Commission 
(BTRC) 
to facilitate 
the growth  and 
development 
of 
telecommunication 
activities 
in 
a 
multi-operator  competitive  environment 
where 
the 
private 
sector 
will 
play 
the 
key 
role. 
Moreover, 
Govt. 
has 
decided 
to 
corporatize 
BTTB 
and 
a 
committee 
has 
been 
set 
up 
to 
recommend 
how 
this 
is 
to 
be 
done. 
A 
high-powered  committee 
has 
been 
formed 
in 
this 
regard 
and 
the 
Committee 
is 
expected 
to 
put 
forward 
necessary 
recommendations 
very 
soon. 
Already four 
cellurar 
telephone companies 
and 
two 
fixed 
land 
telephone companies 
in 
rural 
Page  52

areas 
are 
operating 
in 
the 
private 
sector. 
Setting 
up 
of 
more 
celluar 
and 
fixed 
land 
telephone 
companies 
in 
the 
private 
sector 
are 
under 
active consideration 
of 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
BTRC. 
Tariffs 
in 
the 
Telecommunication 
Sector 
have 
been 
recently rationalized 
to 
generate 
fair 
competition 
in 
the 
sector. 
Reforms 
in 
this 
sector 
will 
continue 
in 
future. 
The 
Government 
has 
a 
plan 
to 
set 
up 
IT 
village 
(ITV) 
in 
the country.

have 
been closed 
and 
many 
more 
will 
be 
closed 
in 
phases. 
The 
interest rates 
for 
the 
four 
National 
Savings 
Certificate 
scheme 
were 
reduced 
and 
four 
other 
National 
Savings 
Instruments 
have 
been 
abolished. 
New 
incentive 
scheme 
has 
been 
introduced 
for improving 
performance 
including 
collection 
of 
NPLs. 
Loan 
recovery 
departments 
have been strengthened. Necessary amendments 
to 
the 
Money

and  banking 
supervision 
have 
been  strengthened,  Powers 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
Banks 
and 
management 
have been 
clearly 
spelt 
out. 
Fit 
and proper 
tests 
for 
Chief 
Executives 
of 
private 
commercial 
banks 
have 
been 
introduced. 
Similar 
tests 
will 
be 
introduced 
for 
directors 
as 
well. 
ESfective 
internal 
control 
system 
is 
being 
set 
up. 
Capital 
adequacy 
requirements  have 
been 
increased 
fiom 
8% 
to 
9% 
on 
risk-weighted 
basis. 
Dividend 
declaration 
by 
banks 
in 
excess 
of 
20% 
is 
allowed 
only 
if 
an 
equivalent amount 
is 
set 
aside 
for 
reserve. 
The 
single 
borrower 
limit 
has 
been 
reduced 
by 
half. 
Regulations 
have 
been 
issued 
by 
the Bangladesh 
Bank 
to 
control loan 
default. 
A 
Committee 
on 
Default 
Loans 
was 
set 
up 
to 
suggest measures 
for 
reducing 
the 
burden 
of 
debt 
default 
and 
for improved 
loan 
management 
perfomance 
of 
the 
banking 
sector. 
A 
loan 
write-off policy 
has 
been introduced 
by 
BB 
for 
the 
first time 
in 
Bangladesh. 
BB 
has 
also 
tightened 
loan 
rescheduling 
guidelines. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Committee, 
some 
bad 
loans 
have 
been 
rescheduled 
and 
written-off. 
The 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Bank-Fund 
FSAP 
mission 
are 
being 
reviewed 
to 
carry 
out 
further 
reforms 
in 
the 
financial 
sector.

4.4 
Improvement 
in 
Trademxternal 
Sector 
The 
trade 
regime 
has 
been 
further 
liberalized 
by 
reducing 
the 
maximum 
tariff 
rate 
by 
5 
percentage 
points 
(to 
32.5 
percent). 
Supplementary 
duty 
scheme has 
been 
rationalized 
by 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
rates 
from 
31 
to 
5. 
Import 
license 
fee 
on 
all 
imports 
has 
been 
withdrawn. 
In 
consequence, 
the 
average 
nominal 
protection 
accorded 
by 
the 
tariff 
structure 
has 
declined 
further. 
This 
trend 
will 
be 
maintained 
in 
the 
forthcoming 
budget 
and 
efforts 
will 
be 
made 
to 
further 
streamline 
the 
tariff 
structure. 
A 
wide 
range 
of 
measures 
and 
improved 
logistics 
for 
monitoring 
were  introduced to 
increase 
the 
volume 
of 
remittance. 
In 
a 
number 
of 
countries, 
banks 
and 
exchange houses 
have been 
set 
up. 
The 
Money 
Laundering 
Prevention Act,  2002 
has 
been 
introduced to 
curb 
illegal 
transactions. 
It 
is 
because 
of 
these 
immediate 
steps 
taken 
by 
the 
govemment 
the 
volume 
of 
remittance 
inflows 
grew 
at 
a rate 
of 
about 
33% 
from 
US$1882 
in 
FY2000- 
01 
to 
US$2501 
million 
in 
FY 
2001-02. 
The 
same 
growth 
trend 
has 
been 
continuing 
until 
now. Foreign 
exchange reserves 
have 
been 
rising 
gradually, 
reaching 
US$2 
billion 
as 
of 
March, 
2003, 
sufficient 
to 
cover 
two 
and 
a 
half 
months’ 
imports. 
4.5 
Socially Responsible 
Fiscal 
Strategy 
The 
FY03 
budget 
continues 
Bangladesh’s 
long-standing 
tradition 
of 
emphasizing 
investment 
in 
the social 
sectors 
and 
rural 
infrastructure. 
The education 
sector 
is 
given 
top 
priority 
and 
accounts 
for 
15.4 
percent 
of 
total 
expenditures; transport 
and 
communication 
account 
for 
another 
13.4 
percent; 
health 
7 
percent 
and 
agriculture 
7 
percent. 
Defence 
expenditures 
remain 
low 
by 
developing 
country 
and 
South 
Asian 
standards, 
accounting 
for 
less 
than 
1.5 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Adequate 
allocation 
will 
be 
made 
in 
the 
revised 
budget 
for 
FY 
2002-03 
to 
defray 
the 
severance 
benefits 
payable 
to 
the retrenched labourers 
and 
employees 
of 
the 
SOEs 
selected 
for 
privatisation. 
More 
allocation 
will 
be 
provided 
in 
the 
Revenue 
budget 
for 
O&M 
expenditure 
and 
to 
clear 
up 
arrears. 
Recognizing 
the 
need to 
strengthen the governance 
of 
targeted food  transferprogrammes, 
the 
Food 
for 
Education 
Programme 
and 
the 
Primary 
Education 
Stipends Programme have 
been 
discontinued 
and 
replaced 
by 
a 
cash 
stipend 
programme 
for 
primary 
school 
students. 
It 
may 
be 
noted 
here that 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
the 
government 
has 
already monetized 
some 
of 
its 
Food-for-Work 
(FFW) 
programs. 
The 
Government 
is 
determined 
to 
continue 
supporting 
the 
secondary 
education 
of 
girls 
and 
has 
decided 
to 
extend 
the 
Female Stipends 
Programme 
to 
Class 12.

The  Govemment 
has 
meanwhile 
banned  the 
use 
and 
marketing 
of 
the 
polythene 
bags. 
The Government 
has phased 
out 
two 
stroke 
three 
wheelers 
from 
Dhaka 
city 
to eliminate 
one 
of 
the 
major 
sources 
of 
air 
pollution. 
4.6 
Governance 
Reforms 
Recognizing 
the 
critical 
need 
to 
improve 
public procurement, 
the 
Government 
is 
creating 
basic 
policy 
and 
institutional fiameworks 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
through 
(a) 
reforming 
the 
procurement 
rules 
and 
mandatory 
use 
of 
standard 
bid 
documents 
so 
as 
to 
cut 
procurement 
delays; 
(b) 
introducing 
mechanisms 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
in 
procurement 
process 
and 
restore 
public 
confidence; 
and 
(c) 
establishing 
procurement  training, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
capacity 
to track procurement 
performance 
of 
public 
sector 
entities. 
Recommendations 
of 
the 
Public Administration 
Reforms 
Commission 
are 
being 
reviewed 
by 
a  Secretary 
level 
committee 
and 
some 
of 
the  recommendations  have 
already 
been 
implemented. 
Merit-based 
promotion 
system 
has 
been introduced 
for 
posts 
in 
the 
Secretariat. 
In 
order 
to 
reduce the 
size 
of 
the 
Government recruitment to most 
of 
the 
vacant posts 
in 
the 
Government 
has 
been 
stopped. 
Moreover, 
transfer 
of 
posts 
from 
Development 
to 
Revenue 
budget 
has 
been subject 
to 
strict 
scrutiny 
by 
a Secretary 
level 
committee 
headed 
by 
the 
Cabinet 
Secretary. 
Auditing 
and 
accounting 
functions have 
been 
separated 
and 
a 
TA 
Project 
has 
been 
initiated 
to 
further 
strengthen the 
audit function. 
The 
Govemment 
is 
fully 
determined 
to 
ensure 
law 
and 
order 
and, 
with 
this 
end 
in 
view 
launched 'operation 
clean 
heart' 
in 
which both 
defense 
and 
civilian 
administration 
worked 
together 
to 
recover 
illegal 
arms 
and 
curb terrorism. The 
move 
was 
welcomed 
by 
the  business 
community 
and 
received 
broad-based support 
of 
the people. Several actions 
have 
been 
taken 
to 
strengthen the 
police 
force 
and 
to 
raise 
their 
efficiency.  The 
Speedy 
Trail 
Act 
has 
been 
passed 
and 
Speedy 
Trail 
Courts 
set 
up. 
The 
Govemment 
is 
determined 
to 
improve 
the 
skills 
and 
efficiency 
of 
administration 
and 
several actions have been 
initiated 
to 
provide 
need-based 
training to 
government 
officials. 
The 
process 
of 
separation 
of 
Judiciary 
from 
the 
Executive 
is 
continuing.

of 
the actions towards 
this 
end. 
5.0 
Preparation 
of 
I-PRSP: 
A 
Process 
of 
Policy Ownership: 
Key 
Elements 
of 
PRSP 
5.1 
Shortly 
after 
taking 
office, 
the 
present 
government accelerated 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
three-year 
National 
Strategy 
for 
Economic 
Growth, 
Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Social 
Development 
and 
organized 
a 
series 
of 
national 
consultations 
to 
solicit 
inputs 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
its 
poverty reduction 
strategy. 
The 
strategy has 
been 
worked 
out 
based 
on 
the 
rich 
experience 
of 
existing poverty 
research 
and 
participatory poverty 
assessments, 
impact 
and 
outcomes 
of 
past 
strategies 
and 
policies, 
and 
assessment 
of 
development 
and 
reform 
issues. 
An 
initial 
draft 
of 
the 
I-PRSP  was  prepared 
in 
April 
2002 
and 
posted 
on 
the 
Government’s 
web-site, 
followed 
by 
a 
four 
month period 
during 
which 
the 
draft 
was 
discussed 
with 
various  government 
and 
non-governmental 
organizations, members 
of 
civil 
society 
and 
Bangladesh’s development 
partners. 
The 
process 
of 
policy 
ownership, 
as 
adopted 
in 
Bangladesh, aims 
at 
providing 
a 
well-prioritized national 
strategy 
for 
economic  growth, 
poverty 
reduction, and 
social 
development. 
5.2 
Social 
development 
captures 
inter-related 
issues 
of 
human 
development, 
gender 
equality, 
social  deprivations 
and 
environmental 
sustainability. 
For 
this, 
the 
process 
has 
combined 
policymaking 
and 
broad-based consultations 
with 
different 
stakeholders. 
Additional 
inputs 
for 
preparing 
the strategy paper were gathered 
through 
commissioning 
twelve 
studies 
in 
key 
poverty 
related 
areas 
such 
as 
economic,  social, 
and 
infrastructure 
development; 
public 
expenditure  analysis; 
poverty 
diagnostics; 
and 
governance 
issues. 
In 
each 
division 
of 
the 
country, consultations were organized 
at 
the 
upazila 
level 
with 
the 
poor 
including women 
and 
men, 
members 
of 
non-government 
organizations 
(NGOs), 
and 
various occupational 
groups. 
Similar 
consultations were also organized 
with 
field-level 
hctionaries 
of 
the 
Government 
Ministries 
and 
Agencies, 
NGOs, 
women’s 
groups, 
local 
and 
religious 
leaders, 
local 
government representatives, 
and 
cross-section 
of 
the 
civil 
society. 
Finally, 
three 
separate 
consultations 
were 
held 
at 
the 
national 
level 
involving 
the 
Government 
officials, 
representatives 
of 
professional 
groups 
and 
the 
civil 
society, 
and 
the 
development 
partners. 
The 
dialogue  process 
reviewed 
both 
diagnostic 
and 
prescriptive 
aspects 
of 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
efforts 
proposed 
in 
the 
draft 
document. 
The 
consistency 
among 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy, 
the 
medium-term 
policy 
framework, 
and 
the 
social 
targets was 
closely 
examined 
during 
the 
dialogue 
process.

5.3 
The 
National 
Strategy 
of 
Economic Growth, Poverty 
Reduction 
and 
Social Development 
has 
been 
finalized 
by 
Govemment. 
The 
strategy 
has 
been 
jointly 
assessed 
by 
the 
IMF 
and 
World 
Bank. 
The 
key 
emphasis 
of 
this 
strategy 
are 
as 
follows: 
The 
first 
set 
of 
policies 
aims 
at 
accelerating the pace 
and 
expanding 
the 
scope 
for 
pro-poor 
economic 
growth 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
the 
employment opportunities 
and 
income 
of 
the 
poor. 
The 
second 
set 
aims 
to 
foster 
the 
human 
development 
of 
the 
poor 
through 
education, 
health, 
nutrition 
and 
other 
social 
interventions. 
The 
third 
set 
of 
policies 
supports 
women’s development 
and 
aims 
at 
closing 
the 
gender 
gap 
in 
development. 
The 
fourth 
set 
provides social 
safety 
nets 
to 
the 
poor 
against 
anticipated 
and 
unanticipated 
income 
and 
consumption 
shocks 
through 
targeted 
and 
other 
efforts. 
Finally, 
the 
fifth 
set 
of 
policies 
focuses 
on 
participatory 
governance 
with 
actions 
aimed 
at 
enhancing the 
voice 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
promoting 
security, 
power 
and 
social inclusion. 
5.4 
The 
Government’s  strategy 
is 
to 
launch 
an 
initial 
set 
of 
reforms 
in 
areas where broad 
consensus 
exists, 
with 
the 
expectation that 
these 
will 
begin 
to 
pay-off 
shortly, 
creating 
momentum 
and 
public 
support 
for 
subsequent 
measures. 
The 
central objective 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
Government’s 
reform 
program 
is 
to 
improve 
the 
investment 
climate 
and 
stimulate 
faster 
economic 
growth 
in 
order 
to 
accelerate 
the 
pace 
of 
poverty 
reduction. 
In 
this 
context, Government 
intends 
to 
focus 
its 
efforts 
on 
improving 
three 
broad 
and 
interrelated 
areas, 
i.e. 
the macroeconomic 
environment, 
the 
country’s govemance 
and 
regulatory 
framework, 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
physical 
and 
financial 
infrastructure. 
In 
improving 
the 
macroeconomic environment, 
Government 
envisages 
prudent 
fiscal 
management, 
which 
in 
tum 
will 
necessitate 
higher 
revenue 
mobilization, 
more 
efficient 
public 
administration 
and 
reform 
of 
state-owned 
enterprises. 
Both 
monetary 
and 
exchange 
rate 
policy 
will 
complement 
this 
fiscal 
stance. 
Efforts 
to 
improve governance 
will 
focus 
on 
implementing 
much 
needed 
institutional 
reforms, 
including 
putting 
in 
place 
a 
proactive 
regulatory  environment 
and 
effective 
incentives 
linked 
to 
real 
accountability. 
In 
improving 
physical and 
financial 
infrastructure 
particular 
attention 
will 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
power,  transport 
and telecommunications 
sectors 
and 
reforming 
the banking 
system. 
5.5 
Accelerating pro-poor 
economic 
growth 
will 
be 
the 
key 
element 
in 
achieving 
success 
of 
the 
Strategy. 
In 
order 
to 
halve 
the 
poverty 
rate 
by 
2015, 
a 
goal 
set 
in 
our 
I-PRSP, 
growth 
over 
the 
medium 
to 
long-term 
must 
be 
raised 
to 
at 
least 
7 
percent 
in 
conjunction 
with 
pro-poor policies. 
The 
sources 
of 
increased 
growth 
would 
involve 
several 
areas: 
(i) 
higher 
private 
investment 
and 
increased 
inflow 
of 
foreign direct 
investments 
(FDIs) 
by 
ensuring 
good 
govemance, 
promoting 
an 
Page  57
Annex 
A 
Page

of 
22 
investment-friendly 
environment  and 
taking 
measures 
to 
reduce transaction 
costs; 
(ii) 
increased 
efficiency 
and 
technological 
progress 
across 
the 
economy 
including promotion 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technologies  (ICTs) 
and 
biotechnology; 
(iii) 
expanded 
growth 
of 
industry 
(particularly  small 
and 
medium 
enterprises) 
and 
service 
sectors; 
(iv) 
diversification 
in 
crop 
production 
and 
non-farm 
(e.g. 
livestock) 
sector 
growth; 
and 
(v) 
expansion 
and 
diversification 
of 
the 
export 
sector. 
5.6 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
PRSP 
period, 
we 
aim 
to 
raise 
GDP growth to 
6.5 percent, 
up 
from 
5 
percent 
on 
average 
during 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
199Os, 
and 
to contain 
inflation 
under 
4 
percent. 
For 
ensuring 
such growth, 
prioritization, 
sequencing 
and 
interrelationships 
of 
macro 
and 
sector 
policies 
are 
being 
emphasized. 
Within 
the medium term framework, 
priorities 
would 
be 
given 
to 
ensure the following: 
(i) 
stable 
macroeconomic 
balances; 
(ii) 
strong 
institutions 
and 
improved 
govemance; 
(iii) 
private 
sector-led 
and 
outward 
oriented 
growth; 
(iv) 
Government-private 
sector 
(including 
NGOs) 
partnership; 
and 
(v) 
gender 
sensitive 
macro 
and 
policy 
framework 
embedded 
in 
the 
national 
budget. 
The 
priorities 
of 
sectoral 
and 
sub-sectoral 
activities 
will 
be 
worked 
out 
such 
that the 
growth 
elasticity 
of 
poverty reduction 
can 
be 
increased. 
5.7 
A 
detailed 
budgetary 
expenditure framework 
indicating 
the 
public 
resource envelope 
and 
expenditure 
pattem 
required 
to 
achieve 
the 
desired 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
targets 
has also 
been 
worked 
out. 
It 
has 
been 
supported 
by 
an 
indicative 
costing 
of 
poverty 
reduction 
programs. 
The 
target rate 
of 
growth 
has 
been 
set 
to 
ensure 
a 
real 
breakthrough 
in 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
Program 
implementation 
will 
be 
tracked 
by 
an 
inter-agency 
working 
group. 
Efforts 
will 
continue 
to 
strengthen the 
monthly 
reporting 
system, 
to 
ensure 
quality 
and 
consistency 
of 
data 
used 
in 
assessing 
compliance 
with 
the 
program’s 
quantitative 
targets. 
6.0 
The 
Program 
of 
Structural 
Reforms, 
2003-2006 
6.1 
The 
government 
is 
hlly 
cognizant 
of 
the 
need 
for 
maintaining 
macroeconomic stability with 
sustainable 
fiscal 
deficits. 
Towards 
this 
end, 
the Government’s 
priority would 
be 
to 
address 
external 
and 
domestic  imbalances 
expeditiously 
to 
pave 
the 
way  for 
implementing 
the 
comprehensive 
medium 
term 
stabilization 
and 
reform 
measures 
under 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
The broad 
outlines 
of 
the 
medium-term 
reform 
programs 
would 
be 
as 
follows: 
Page  58
Annex 
A 
Page 
I4 
of 
22 
Fiscal 
Policy 
6.2 
Within 
the program, 
fiscal 
measures 
would 
be 
taken 
to 
contain 
fiscal 
deficit; 
limit 
deficit 
financing 
and 
domestic 
borrowing; 
mobilize 
domestic resources 
(tax 
and 
non-tax) 
through 
better 
compliance, 
collect 
arrears, 
reduce 
exemptions, extend the 
VAT 
net, 
and 
improve 
tax 
and 
customs 
administration; 
rationalize 
pubic 
expenditure 
by 
improving 
quality 
and 
equity, 
reduce 
subsidies 
to 
SOEs, 
implement 
non-productive 
expenditure 
control 
measures, 
and 
improve 
financial 
accountability. 
The 
budgeting 
process 
would 
be 
made 
more 
transparent 
through 
increased pre-budget 
consultations 
and 
better 
institutional 
mechanisms 
for 
participation 
of 
various 
groups 
and 
the 
civil 
society. 
The 
Parliamentary 
oversight 
of 
the 
budget 
will 
be 
strengthened 
through 
ensuring 
more 
effective 
roles 
of 
the 
Public 
Accounts 
Committee, 
Public 
Estimates 
Committee, 
Public 
Undertakings 
Committee 
and 
the 
Parliamentary Standing Committees 
on 
individual 
Ministries. 
In 
order 
to 
sustain 
the 
results 
of 
reforms carried out 
so 
far, 
Government 
is 
going 
to 
introduce a 
new 
reform 
programme 
covering 
a 
range 
of 
core 
areas 
of 
public financial 
management 
- 
such 
as 
budgeting,  accounting, 
internal 
controls, 
auditing 
and 
human 
resource development. 
This 
would 
further 
streamline the 
macro 
economic 
and 
financial 
management 
of 
the 
govemment. 
A 
Macroeconomic Policv Analvsis 
Unit 
would 
be 
established 
very 
soon 
comprising officers 
from 
all 
key 
WingsBections 
of 
the  Finance 
Division to 
help 
the 
top 
management 
in 
macroeconomic 
policy 
planning 
and 
to 
provide 
on-the-job 
training to 
other 
officers 
so 
that 
changes 
are 
sustained. 
Several 
reforms 
would 
be 
considered 
for  improving 
budget 
preparation 
and implementation, 
reconciliation 
of 
accounts 
and 
increasing 
effectiveness 
of 
budget 
and 
its 
pro-poor 
orientation. 
The 
budget 
will 
be 
made gender sensitive 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that  the  benefits 
are 
distributed 
in 
an 
equal 
and 
equitable 
manner. 
In 
order 
to 
operationalise 
a 
Poverty  Focal 
Point 
will 
be 
established 
in 
the 
Planning 
Commission 
with 
commensurate 
status, 
technical 
capability 
and 
inter-ministerial 
linkages. 
The 
key 
task 
of 
the 
Focal 
Point 
would be 
to 
coordinate 
preparation 
of 
the 
full 
PRSP 
and 
the 
3-year 
rolling 
plan. 
the 
I-PRSP 
In 
addition 
to 
adopting  a 
medium-term 
framework, 
the 
quality 
of 
budgeting 
would 
be 
improved 
through 
using 
strict 
criteria 
for 
project 
selection, 
instituting  strategic 
planning 
through 
budget committees 
in 
ministrieshgencies, streamlining 
Jinancial 
management and 
procurement procedures, and strengthening 
internal 
control 
and 
audit 
systems. 
Financial 
management 
capability 
of 
the 
line 
ministries 
will 
be 
strengthened. 
A 
public 
debt 
management 
Page  59
Annex 
A 
Page 
I5 
of

ofJice 
will 
be 
set 
up 
in 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. Several expenditure 
tracking 
studies 
will 
be 
done 
for 
effective 
budget 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
public 
expenditure. 
Performance 
budgeting 
and 
comprehensive 
auditing 
with 
focus 
on 
performance audit 
will 
be 
institutionalized. 
Support 
to 
Public 
Accounts 
Committee 
will 
be 
enhanced 
through 
quality 
auditing 
and 
elimination 
of 
backlog 
in 
audit, 
and 
effective 
follow-up 
of 
PAC 
recommendations. 
The 
existing 
Resource 
Monitoring 
Committee's functions 
will 
be 
strengthened 
through 
fiscal 
and macroeconomic analysis 
and 
reporting. 
Existing 
Computable 
General 
Equilibrium 
(CGE) 
model 
would 
be 
updated 
and 
refined 
to 
trace macroeconomic 
impact 
of 
policy 
changes 
and 
facilitate 
informed 
decision-making. 
Financial 
and 
External 
Policies 
6.3 
Monetary 
and  exchange rate policies 
would 
complement  the 
goal 
of 
macroeconomic 
stability 
with 
recourse 
to 
market 
based 
instruments 
to 
achieve 
inflation 
and 
reserve objectives. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
move  towards 
more 
flexible 
exchange  rate  management. 
Several 
structural 
measures 
e.g. 
improved 
performance 
of 
nationalized commercial 
banks 
(NCBs) 
and development 
financial institutions 
(DFIs), 
better enforcement 
and 
elimination 
of 
loopholes 
in 
the 
Bankruptcy 
Act, 
privatisation 
or 
liquidation 
and 
reforms 
of 
the 
SOEs 
to 
contain 
their 
demand 
on 
budgetary 
and 
bank 
resources 
would 
be 
implemented 
to 
support 
the 
stabilization policies 
in 
the 
short term. 
Several 
measures 
along 
these 
lines 
have already 
been proposed 
in 
the 
budget 
of 
FY03. 
Recognizing 
that  economic 
performance 
has 
been 
impeded 
by 
poor  financial 
sector 
governance 
and 
the 
resulting 
high 
level 
of 
NPLs, 
we 
have 
moved 
to 
improve 
the 
institutional 
framework 
for 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
financial 
system. 
Governance 
and 
BB 
supervision 
of 
private 
commercial 
banks 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
strengthened 
under 
the 
recently 
enhanced 
prudential 
framework. 
Looking 
ahead, 
the  strategy 
for 
banking 
reform 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
NCBs 
in 
view 
of 
their  large 
NPL 
ratios 
( 
estimated 
at 
almost 
28 
percent 
of 
loans 
). 
The 
approach 
initially 
will 
be 
aimed at 
curbing 
the 
flow 
of 
new 
bad 
loans, 
and 
strengthening 
governance 
of 
NCBs, 
while 
developing detailed 
resolution 
strategies 
for 
each 
bank 
A 
comprehensive  strategy 
to 
define 
the 
resolution option 
bank-by-bank 
and 
address 
the 
existing 
stock 
of 
NPLs 
will 
be 
adopted 
drawing 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
joint 
BanWund 
Financial 
Sector 
Assessment 
Program 
(FSAP), 
with 
follow-up 
technical 
assistance, 
and 
also 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
Bank 
credit 
for 
banking 
reform.

In 
preparation 
for 
this 
comprehensive program, and 
to 
signal 
our 
commitment 
to 
NCB 
reform, 
the 
following 
steps 
will 
be 
taken 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
I-PRSP: 
Reputable 
local 
fms 
will 
be 
engaged 
to 
conduct special audits 
of 
the 
four 
NCBs, 
based 
on 
international 
auditing 
and 
accounting 
standards. 
The 
process 
of 
appointing 
the 
audit 
firms 
has 
already 
been 
initiated. 
New 
professional 
management 
will 
be 
secured 
for 
one 
of 
the 
NCBs 
by 
October 
2003. 
New 
management 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
performance-based  criteria, 
and 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
sufficient 
authority 
to 
implement 
staffmg 
changes 
at 
senior 
levels 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
bank 
performance 
and 
credit 
risk 
management. 
In 
addition, management support 
will 
be 
contracted 
to 
two 
other 
NCBs. 
New 
lending 
by 
NCBs 
will 
be 
restricted 
through: 
(a) 
tightening 
prudential 
limits 
on 
individual 
loan 
exposure;

The

SOE 
Reform 
6.4 
Given 
the 
large 
fiscal 
drain 
by 
the 
SOEs 
and 
their 
overall inefficiency, 
a 
key 
ingredient 
of 
the 
Government’s 
deficit 
reduction 
strategy 
would 
be 
to 
bring 
a 
balance 
in 
their  financial 
accounts. 
The 
Government 
would 
implement 
a comprehensive 
program 
aimed 
at 
privatisation 
and 
downsizing 
of 
the 
state-owned  sector. 
For 
the 
purpose, 
a 
sequenced 
approach 
would 
be 
followed 
beginning 
with 
privatising or liquidating 
selected 
manufacturing 
enterprises.

The 
Government 
is 
and 
would 
continue 
downsizing 
the 
Trading Corporation 
of 
Bangladesh 
(TCB),  Bangladesh 
Agriculture 
Development Corporation 
(BADC), 
Bangladesh 
Sugar 
and 
Food 
Industries Corporation 
(BSFIC),  Bangladesh 
Shipping Corporation 
(BSC), 
Bangladesh 
Chemical 
Industries 
Corporation 
(BCIC) 
and Bangladesh Steel 
and 
Engineering Corporation 
(BSEC). 
A 
little 
over  Taka 
6.25 
billion 
has 
been  already 
paid 
by 
the  government 
as 
retrenchment 
cost. 
Due  to 
the 
speed 
at 
which 
privatisation 
is 
being 
pursued 
by 
the 
government 
an 
additional Taka 
4 
billion 
will 
be 
needed 
within 
this 
year 
to 
meet 
the 
severance 
cost. 
Apart 
from 
this 
to 
meet the 
short-term 
and 
long-term 
liabilities 
of 
these 
privatised 
enterprises another 
Taka 
28 
billion 
would 
be 
needed 
in 
this 
year. 
8 
A 
time bound action 
plan 
has 
been 
taken 
up 
to 
stop 
losses 
of 
the 
remaining 
SOEs 
and 
make 
them 
profitable. 
The 
process 
of 
privatisation 
will 
continue 
in 
a 
phased 
manner. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
utilities 
and 
services 
(e.g. 
gas, 
power, water, 
railways, 
shipping 
and 
telecommunications), 
appropriate modes 
would 
be 
adopted 
like 
outsourcing, divestiture, 
public-private 
partnerships 
and 
others. 
While 
liquidation 
of 
non-viable 
enterprises  and 
privatisation 
of 
selected 
manufacturing 
SOEs 
would 
be 
the 
priority 
agenda 
to 
ease 
the 
administrative  and 
financial 
burden 
in 
the 
short 
run, 
remaining 
SOEs 
would 
be 
given 
operational autonomy 
and 
allowed 
to 
operate 
along 
commercial 
lines 
under 
hard 
budget 
constraints. 
8 
In 
case 
any 
SOE 
is 
required 
to 
pursue 
non-commercial 
objectives,  the 
costs 
of 
such 
constraints 
would 
be 
calculated 
and 
compensated 
through 
the 
budget 
in 
a 
transparent 
manner. 
For 
ensuring 
a 
successful 
privatisation program,  the 
priority 
would 
be 
to create 
the 
basic 
environment 
for 
attracting 
private 
investment 
so 
that the 
enterprises 
can 
be 
sold 
at fair 
prices. 
For 
this, 
the 
regulatory 
and 
policy 
environment 
will 
be 
rationalized 
so 
that 
public 
monopolies 
do 
not 
turn 
into 
private 
monopolies, 
and 
attention 
will 
be 
given 
to 
creating 
the 
non-distorting 
environment 
for 
the 
private 
sector 
to 
hction 
in 
a 
level-playing 
field. 
In 
such 
cases, 
the 
interim 
strategy 
would 
be 
to allow 
private 
entry 
and 
competition 
in 
industries 
where 
such 
SOEs 
exist 
and 
take 
time-bound 
and 
concrete 
steps 
for 
privatisation. 
The 
cross-sectoral 
linkages 
of 
SOE 
reform would 
also 
be 
considered. 
8 
For 
those 
SOEs, 
which would 
be 
retained 
in 
the 
public 
domain, 
clear guidelines would 
be 
specijied. 
These 
would 
be 
corporatized 
and 
required 
to 
operate 
under 
hard 
budget 
constraints. 
Such enterprises 
would 
access 
financing 
from 
the 
banks 
on 
their 
own 
financial 
strength 
along 
with 
mobilizing 
funds 
fiom 
the 
capital 
market.

Private 
Sector 
Development: 
Energy 
Sector 
Reforms 
6.5 
A 
major 
challenge 
for 
our 
Government 
is 
to 
restore 
business 
and 
investor confidence 
that 
was eroded 
due 
to 
past 
lack 
of 
reforms 
in 
key 
areas, 
such 
as 
ports, 
energy, 
telecommunications, 
and 
financial 
sector. 
Our 
goal 
is 
to 
provide 
a 
stable 
policy 
environment, 
which 
reduces 
the 
incentives 
for 
lobbying 
and 
rent 
seeking, 
discourages corruption, 
and 
minimizes 
the 
extra-legal 
costs 
of 
doing 
business. 
For 
proper 
functioning 
of 
the 
private 
sector, 
physical 
improvements 
and 
management 
reforms 
in 
the 
basic 
infrastructure 
including 
power, water 
supply, 
port 
and 
telecommunications 
will 
be 
given 
priority 
along 
with 
private 
sector 
participation. 
The 
Government 
has 
stressed 
the 
urgency 
for 
ensuring 
the 
following 
reforms 
in 
the energy sector 
over 
the 
program 
period 
(3 
Year 
Road 
Map): 
Setting 
up 
the 
Energy Regulatory Commission 
Strengthening 
and 
improvement 
of 
commercial performance 
Designing 
and 
implementing 
competitive 
and equitable 
pricing policy 
Ensure 
good 
governance 
through 
providing 
autonomy 
of 
gas 
marketing 
companies 
Enactment 
of 
laws 
to 
strengthen 
the 
legal framework 
and 
Strengthening 
the 
capability 
of 
existing institutions 
Reforming 
the 
energy 
sector 
through 
appropriate 
pricing 
and 
transparent 
regulatory 
framework 
will 
be 
given 
due 
importance. 
Decisive 
reform 
of 
the energy 
sector 
is 
critical to 
containing 
SOE 
losses, 
since such 
losses 
are 
heavily 
concentrated 
in 
this 
sector. 
Recent 
energy 
price 
increases 
have already 
helped 
to 
reduce 
losses 
and 
raise collections. 
In 
addition, 
setting 
up 
of 
an 
independent 
Energy 
Regulatory 
Commission, 
it 
is 
expected, 
would 
enhance 
efficiency 
and 
substantially 
curtail 
losses.

Human 
Development 
and Poverty Reduction 
6.6 
We 
recognize 
that 
development 
of 
human 
capital 
has 
strong 
poverty  reducing 
effects 
in 
Bangladesh. 
Three main 
elements 
of 
human 
development 
will 
be 
targeted: 
education, 
health and 
nutrition. 
Within 
the 
health 
sector, 
although 
some 
success 
has 
been 
achieved 
in 
preventive health 
care, 
a 
small 
proportion 
of 
poor 
people have 
access 
to 
public 
health 
care services. 
In 
the 
health 
sector, 
Health 
and 
Population 
Sector 
Programme 
(HPSP) 
achieved 
remarkable 
success 
in 
certain 
areas, 
while 
it 
also  faced  operational 
problems 
in 
some 
others. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
this 
programme 
effective, 
the 
Government 
has 
commissioned 
a 
full 
review 
of 
the 
operational 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
this 
new 
approach. 
The 
government remains 
committed 
to 
the 
sector-wide approach 
and 
recognizes 
the 
obvious 
advantages 
of 
this 
approach. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
has 
taken 
the 
lead to 
improve 
governance 
in 
the 
education 
sector. 
The 
government 
will 
further 
improve 
governance 
in 
the education 
sector 
through 
widening 
the 
coverage 
and improving quality 
of 
education emphasizing education 
for 
all 
concept. 
Moreover, 
finding 
more 
effective 
ways 
to 
provide 
vocational 
and 
technical education 
will 
be 
given 
priority 
in 
the 
education 
strategy. 
The 
strategy 
will 
focus 
mainly 
on 
teachers 
training, 
performance-based government  subventions, 
curricula 
up-gradation,  academic supervision, 
decentralized  management 
and 
expenditure 
tracking 
studies. 
The 
newly 
introduced 
cash 
stipend 
program 
is 
planned 
to 
be 
a 
targeted program. 
The 
Government 
is 
determined 
to 
continue supporting 
the 
secondary 
education 
of 
girls. 
The 
program 
will 
be 
targeted 
to 
those 
girls 
that 
secure 
45 
percent 
or 
more 
marks 
in 
the 
Secondary 
School 
Certificate 
(SSC) 
examination. 
Over 
the 
medium 
term, 
Government 
intends 
to 
assess 
the 
results 
of 
the 
targeting 
pilots 
that 
are‘ 
being 
implemented 
and 
introduce 
a 
nationwide-targeted 
stipend 
and 
tuition 
program 
for 
secondary female 
students 
in 
the 
light 
of 
strategies 
outlined 
above. 
The 
burden 
of 
poverty 
continues 
to 
fall 
disproportionately 
on 
women. 
A 
related institutional 
issue 
is 
to 
increase 
the 
political 
voice 
of 
women, 
especially 
poor 
women, 
which 
will 
further 
enhance 
their 
agency 
role 
and 
hence, 
contribute 
to 
faster 
progress 
in 
the 
well 
being 
of 
children 
and 
women. 
The  Government 
would 
actively  promote policies 
for 
increasing 
women’s 
participation 
in 
all 
spheres 
of 
development 
under 
the 
poverty 
reduction 
strategy. 
By 
addressing the 
critical 
needs, 
well-executed 
and 
well-targeted 
direct 
interventions 
would be 
used 
to 
significantly 
improve 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
poor. 
A 
set 
of 
policies 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
social 
safety 
net 
for 
the 
poor 
through 
works 
and 
income 
transfer 
programs. 
The 
second 
set 
of 
policies 
will 
put 
emphasis 
on 
the 
development 
of 
social 
solidarity. 
The 
third 
set 
would 
be 
directed 
towards 
ensuring 
good 
public 
health 
services 
to 
reduce 
health 
hazard 
related 
income 
and 
consumption 
shocks.

Along 
with 
economic 
growth, 
policies 
would 
be 
emphasized 
to 
promote  improved 
distribution 
of 
assets 
and income 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
poor, 
including 
women. Measures 
will 
be 
undertaken 
for 
ensuring 
tenurial 
security, especially 
for 
the 
poor 
farmers. 
Providing 
access 
to 
human 
assets 
such 
as 
basic education 
and 
higher 
level 
of 
skills 
will 
help 
the 
poor 
to 
access 
better employment 
and 
income. 
Similarly, 
ensuring 
expanded 
access 
to 
financial 
assets 
via 
micro-credit 
would 
help 
the 
poor 
to 
undertake 
income-generating  activities. 
Finally, 
the 
access 
to political 
assets-greater 
empowerment-would 
help 
the 
poor 
to 
ensure a 
fair 
share 
in 
public 
resources 
and 
benefits 
of 
development. 
6.7 
Pollution 
of 
the 
environment 
will 
get 
the 
priority 
it 
deserves 
for 
sustainable development. 
The 
government 
would 
implement 
the 
environment 
strategy 
drawing upon 
Environment 
Policy 
1992, 
Dhaka Declaration 
2000 
and 
the 
NEMAP 
and 
would 
integrate 
environmental 
conservation 
into 
the 
national 
development strategy.

In 
order 
to 
ensure 
that allegations 
of 
corruption 
are 
impartially 
investigated 
and 
those

the 
Cabinet 
has 
approved  a

for 
the 
establishment 
of 
an

All 
commitments 
made

to. 
Bangladesh 
has 
made substantial progress 
in 
taking

the 
7.2 
The 
specific 
path 
of 
the 
Balance 
of 
Payment 
position 
over 
the 
medium 
term 
will 
depend 
on 
a host 
of 
factors 
including 
the 
net 
inflow 
of 
foreign 
assistance, 
performance 
of 
exports 
and 
remittances, 
and 
foreign 
direct 
investment. 
The 
current 
account 
deficit 
(including 
the 
official 
grants) 
is 
projected to 
increase 
from 
its 
abnormal 
scenario 
of 
FY02. 
In 
addition, 
large 
debt service 
payments, 
including 
PSC  obligations, 
which 
amount 
to 
about 
US 
$634 
million 
a 
year, 
are 
expected 
to 
rise. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
large 
financing 
need 
for 
increased 
poverty reducing 
and 
growth 
enhancing 
programs, 
only 
a 
modest increase 
in 
gross

is 
envisaged. 
The 
total 
financing 
requirement 
from 
the 
official

source 
over 
FY04-FY06 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
covered 
by 
multi-sectoral

(including 
World

and 
bilateral 
creditors 
(including

programs 
of 
the 
Govemment 
under

as 
well 
as 
costs

would be 
around 
1 
percent

over the

requiring 
about 
additional 
US 
$ 
700 
million 
per

forfznancing 
the 
gap 
of 
about 
US 
$ 
2.0 
billion 
over 
the

and 
this 
is 
expected 
to 
be

largely 
by 
quick-disbursing

from 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
Asian 
Development 
Bank, 
the 
Fund, 
and 
other 
bilateral 
donors. 
The 
Government 
of 
Bangladesh 
intends 
to 
contain 
extemal 
commercial 
borrowing to 
ensure 
that 
the 
extemal 
debt 
burden 
remains 
manageable. 
The 
Government 
will 
also 
contain 
domestic 
financing 
of 
the

to 
a 
sustainable 
level.

Financial 
support

long-term 
loans 
of 
privatised 
SOEs 
(including 
Adamjee 
Jute 
Mills 
Ltd.) 
during 
this 
year 
would be 
about 
Taka 
28 
billion. 
Out 
of 
the 
total 
requirement, 
a 
little 
over 
Taka 
6.2 
billion 
has been 
already 
paid 
by

We 
are

as

and 
the 
rest 
for 
short

could 
be 
financed 
by 
development

during 
this

More 
would be 
needed 
in 
the 
coming

by 
the

Extemal  public

approximately 
to

$17.4

at 
the 
end 
of 
FY03.

maintain 
external 
debt 
sustainability 
in 
the 
long 
term. 
We 
look 
forward 
to 
a program 
support 
from 
the 
Bank 
amounting 
to about 
US 
$300 
million during 
thisJiscal 
year and, 
further 
program 
support 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
PRGF 
from 
the 
Fund 
over 
the 
next 
three 
years 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
I-PRSP. 
We 
are 
convinced 
this 
scheme 
will 
receive 
your 
favorable  consideration. 
To 
facilitate 
wider distribution 
of 
the 
LPD 
and 
I-PRSP 
including 
the 
JSA 
of 
I-PRSP,  the 
Government 
of 
Bangladesh authorizes 
their 
publication 
by 
the 
Bank.

Bangladesh: 
Medium-Term 
Macroeconomic 
Framework 
The 
Context 
1. 
When 
the 
present 
government 
took office 
in 
October 
2001, 
Bangladesh’s 
fiscal situation 
was 
weak. 
Declining 
exports, 
reduced 
FDI 
inflows 
and increased 
monetary 
accommodation 
of 
fiscal deficits 
threatened Bangladesh’s 
ability 
to 
even 
maintain, 
let 
alone 
accelerate, 
its 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
efforts. 
Global 
recession, 
across-the-board 
decline 
in 
export 
prices, 
rising 
oil 
prices, 
extremely 
slow 
progress 
in 
structural 
policy 
reforms 
and 
continued 
fragility 
in 
political 
and  economic  governance 
underpinned 
the 
vulnerable 
state 
of 
the 
economy. 
2. 
Several macroeconomic  fundamentals  weakened 
in 
the  late 
1990s. 
The 
central  govemment 
budget 
deficit 
increased 
to 
more 
than 5 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
domestic 
financing 
increased sharply 
to 
above 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
As 
a 
result, 
central government 
domestic debt increased 
from 
13 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FYOO 
to 
15 
percent 
in 
FYOl 
and 
the 
share 
of 
interest 
on 
domestic 
debt 
increased 
fkom 
13 
percent 
of 
current 
spending 
to 
16 
percent 
during 
the 
same 
period. 
The 
continued operation 
of 
the 
loss-malung 
state 
owned 
enterprises 
became 
a 
massive 
drain 
on 
public 
resources 
in 
the 
late 
1990s. 
Total 
SOE 
losses 
increased 
from 
Tk 
14 
billion 
in 
FY97 
to 
more 
than 
Tk 
33 
billion 
(1.3 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
in 
FYOl 
and 
total 
borrowing 
of 
these 
enterprises 
from 
the 
banking 
system 
reached 
nearly 
Tk 
74 
billion 
at the close 
of 
FYO 
1, 
equivalent 
to 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Foreign 
exchange reserves 
declined 
to 
around 
$1 
billion, 
equivalent 
to 
less 
than 
one 
month 
of 
imports 
of 
goods 
and 
services. 
3. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
resilience 
of 
Bangladesh’s economy, 
low 
initial 
levels 
of 
public 
debt 
and interest 
payments, 
and 
early 
action 
by 
the 
new 
government 
to 
restore 
fiscal 
and 
monetary 
policy 
on 
a 
sustainable 
path, Bangladesh managed 
to 
maintain 
macroeconomic 
stability 
and 
achieved 
a 
reasonable 
GDP 
growth 
of 
4.4 
percent 
in 
FY02. 
CPI 
inflation 
remained 
manageable 
at 
4.6 
percent 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2002 
despite 
the 
impact 
of 
September 
2002 energy 
price 
adjustments. 
Foreign 
exchange 
reserves 
have 
been 
rebuilt 
to 
around 
$1.7 
billion, 
reflecting 
both 
the 
impact 
of 
a 
tighter 
fiscal 
policy 
as 
well 
as 
recourse 
to 
administrative 
measures 
to 
contain 
imports. 
Central 
Government 
deficit 
was 
reduced 
from 
5.1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FYOl 
to 
4.7 
percent 
in 
FY02 
through 
both 
additional 
revenue 
effort 
and expenditure 
discipline. 
The 
FY03 
budget 
aims 
to 
reduce the 
deficit 
further 
to 
4.2 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
and 
its 
domestic 
financing 
to 
about 
2 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
4. 
Monetary 
policy 
has 
also 
been 
kept 
tight 
and, 
along 
with 
fiscal 
restraint, 
this 
facilitated 
the 
rebuilding 
of 
net 
international 
reserves and 
contributed 
to 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
exchange 
rate 
following 
the 
1.5 
percent 
devaluation 
in 
January 2002. 
The 
inter-bank 
and curb 
market 
rates 
exhibited 
some 
volatility 
in 
November 
2002, 
reflecting 
depreciation 
expectations 
and 
a temporary 
increase 
in 
the Government’s 
domestic 
financing 
requirements. 
The 
pressures 
on 
the 
exchange 
rate 
have 
eased 
and 
the 
rate 
has 
been 
kept 
at  appropriate, 
broadly 
stable 
levels 
over 
the 
last 
six 
months, 
with 
the 
curb 
market 
premium 
remaining 
well 
below 
2 
percent. 
An 
improved legal 
and regulatory framework 
in 
the 
banlung 
sector 
accompanied sound management 
of 
the exchange rate. 
5. 
Budgetary 
financing 
of 
the 
SOE 
deficits-in 
the 
form 
of 
investment 
financing 
under 
the 
ADP, 
wages, 
direct 
subsidies, 
working 
capital 
loans 
for 
the purchase 
of 
raw 
materials 
and 
manpower 
separation 
payments, 
and capital restructuring, 
has 
been 
costly 
in 
the past. 
These 
contributed considerably 
to 
the 
rise 
in 
public 
sector 
deficit 
during 
FYOO-01. 
The 
main 
loss-making 
SOEs 
have 
increasingly 
relied 
on 
accumulating 
arrears 
as 
a 
form 
of 
financing 
their 
deficits.31 
The 
SOE 
closures 
should 
thus 
lead 
to 
significant 
reduction 
in 
the 
consolidated 
public 
sector 
deficit, 
in 
both 
the  short- 
and 
medium-term, 
31 
The 
outstanding 
stocks 
of 
SOE 
arrears 
on 
debt service 
payments 
to 
the 
govemment 
and 
the 
NCBs 
amounted 
to 
23 
percent 
of 
GDP 
at 
end-200

improve 
the 
environment 
for 
private 
sector development 
and contribute 
to 
strengthening 
of 
the 
financial 
system 
by 
reducing 
the 
need 
for 
directed 
lending 
to 
SOEs. 
Equally 
important, 
it 
provides 
credibility 
to 
Govemment 
plans 
to 
withdraw 
further 
from 
manufacturing activities 
over 
the 
next 
twelve 
months. 
Public 
sector 
banks have 
imposed a 
cost 
on 
the 
exchequer 
in 
terms 
of 
recapitalization 
payments, 
and 
their 
large 
capital 
shortfall 
represents 
a 
major 
source 
of 
contingent 
liability 
for 
the 
Government. 
NCB 
reforms 
would 
thus 
mitigate 
a 
major 
source 
of 
fiscal 
risk. 
The recent 
amendments 
in 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
the 
financial 
sector 
are 
necessary 
preparatory 
steps 
for 
deeper 
reforms. 
The 
closure 
of 
NCB 
branches 
will 
contribute 
to 
reduction 
of 
consolidated 
public 
sector 
deficit 
and  the 
abolition 
of 
National 
Savings 
Certificate 
schemes 
will 
help 
direct 
private 
savings 
to 
private 
investments 
while 
contributing 
to 
containment 
of 
central Government 
deficit. 
6. 
The 
improvement 
in 
the 
investment 
climate 
resulting 
from 
the 
structural 
reform 
measures 
already 
implemented 
should significantly 
grease 
the 
economic 
recovery 
that 
appears 
to 
be 
underway. 
Over 
the 
last 
twelve 
months 
ending 
November 
2002, 
industrial 
production 
and 
export 
growth 
have recovered 
to 
6.6 
percent and 
-0.2 
percent respectively,  compared 
with 
1.6 
percent 
industrial production 
growth 
and 
-2.9 
percent 
export 
growth 
over 
the 
12 
months 
ending November 
2001. 
kven 
by 
agncultural production 
and 
export growth, 
real 
GDP 
growth 
in 
FY03 
is 
thus 
expected 
to 
rise 
to 
an estimated 
5.2 
percent. 
However, 
inflation 
in 
FY03 
could 
rise 
to 
a 
still 
modest 
5 
plus 
percent, 
reflecting 
the 
lagged effects 
of 
energy 
price 
adjustments. 
To 
the 
extent 
this 
is 
the 
case, 
the 
rise 
in 
inflation 
need 
not be 
a 
major 
concern 
since 
it 
is 
a 
manifestation 
of 
relative 
price 
corrections, 
which 
became essential 
due 
to 
changes 
in 
intemational 
prices. 
The 
real 
choice 
was 
between 
keeping 
inflation 
repressed 
by 
not 
adjusting 
energy 
prices, 
and 
thus 
worsening 
price 
distortions, 
or 
bringing 
inflation 
out 
in 
the open 
to 
correct 
price 
distortions and 
send 
the 
consumers 
the 
right 
market 
signals. 
To 
the 
extent 
the 
rise 
in 
inflation 
was 
driven 
by 
utility 
price 
increases, 
it 
can 
be 
expected 
to 
last 
only 
as 
long 
as 
it 
takes 
for 
utility 
price 
increases 
to 
feed 
into 
prices 
of 
commodities and 
services 
where 
the 
intensity 
of 
utility 
use 
is 
high. 
The 
Medium-Term 
Macroeconomic 
Framework 
7. 
The  Govemment 
has 
put 
in 
place 
a 
prudent 
and 
sustainable 
medium-term 
macro-economic 
framework 
for 
increasing 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
(Table 
Cl). 
The 
framework 
is 
highly 
dependent 
on 
the 
assumption that 
the 
impact 
of 
a possible 
war 
in 
Iraq 
would 
be 
transitory and 
that Bangladesh 
would 
take 
enough actions 
to 
avert 
losing 
export market 
share 
following 
the 
MFA 
phase-out 
in 
2005. 
While not 
too 
ambitious, the 
growth 
rates envisaged 
for 
the 
next 
five 
years 
represent 
a 
significant 
increase 
from 
recent 
performance. 
The 
framework 
envisages 
a 
realistic 
recovery 
of 
GDP growth 
rates 
from 
the 
expected 
5.2 
percent 
in 
FY03 
to 
5.5 
percent 
in 
FY04, 
increasing 
further 
to 
6 
percent 
in 
FY05 
and 
plateauing at 
6.5 
percent 
in 
FY06 
and 
onwards. 
The 
Govemment’s I-PRSP 
envisages 
raising growth 
to 
7 
percent over 
the 
medium 
to 
long 
term, 
which 
in 
conjunction 
with 
pro-poor 
policies 
would 
help 
achieve 
the 
I-PRSP 
goal 
of 
halving 
the 
number 
of 
people 
living 
below 
the 
poverty 
line 
by 
2015. 
Inflation 
is 
projected 
to 
decline 
to 
4 
percent 
from 
FY04 
and 
onwards.

GDP 
growth would 
be 
anchored 
in 
larger investment 
by 
a 
more 
vibrant 
private 
sector 
(including 
FDI), 
a 
strong increase 
in 
the 
efficiency 
of 
investment and a 
further 
building 
up 
of 
human capital and 
physical 
infrastructure. 
Growth 
in 
Bangladesh 
has been 
well 
below 
its 
potential 
during 
the 
last 
decade 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
poor 
investment 
climate, 
political 
and 
economic 
instability, 
inefficient public 
spending, 
and 
poor 
governance. 
The 
achievement 
of 
the 
growth 
targets 
hinge 
critically 
on 
the 
timely 
implementation 
of 
reforms, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
macroeconomic 
management, 
tax 
reform 
and 
composition 
of 
public 
expenditures, trade 
and 
exchange 
rate 
regimes, 
reforms 
of 
the 
SOEs 
and 
NCBs, 
energy 
pricing 
and 
regulation,  and 
general 
economic 
governance. 
Priority 
is 
being 
given 
to 
these 
areas 
under 
the 
Bank’s 
dialogue 
with 
the 
Government 
on 
the 
Development 
Support 
Credit. 
These 
reforms 
will 
create 
a 
positive 
environment 
for 
private 
investment 
leading 
to 
more 
efficient 
resource 
allocation 
and 
utilization. 
Higher 
economic 
growth 
needs 
to  be 
complemented 
by 
pro-poor 
measures 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
the 
I-PRSP 
poverty 
reduction 
target, 
This 
would 
require 
shifting 
public 
resources 
toward 
improving 
the 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
essential 
public 
services such 
as 
basic education, health, 
infrastructure 
services 
and 
addressing 
governance 
issues 
in 
these 
sectors 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
poor 
indeed 
benefit 
from 
the 
additional 
public 
resources. 
Also, improvements 
in 
these 
areas 
are 
among the 
prerequisites 
for 
buoyant 
private 
investment. 
9. 
Fiscal 
Policy. 
The 
path 
of 
fiscal 
policy 
in 
the 
medium-term framework 
is 
consistent 
with 
Bangladesh’s 
reform 
needs 
and 
public 
debt 
sustainability. 
Revenue 
mobilization 
is 
the 
central 
element 
of 
the 
budget 
strategy 
for 
the 
next 
three  years. 
This 
would 
help 
balance 
the 
need 
to 
support 
poverty 
reduction 
with 
the 
need 
to 
contain 
domestic 
financing. 
Also, 
over 
the 
next 
several 
years, 
the 
central 
Government 
budget 
will 
have 
to 
shoulder 
the 
burden 
of 
paying 
the  adjustment  cost 
of 
reforms 
and 
increases 
in 
development  expenditures 
on 
productive 
investment 
in 
education, 
health 
and 
poverty 
reduction. 
These 
are 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
size 
of 
the 
fiscal 
deficit 
from 
its 
projected 
4.2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY03 
to 
4.8 
percent 
in 
FY04 
and 
4.7 
percent 
in 
FY05. 
The 
wider 
fiscal deficits 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
increased 
external 
financing 
on 
concessional terms based 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
poverty reduction 
plan. 
A 
more 
detailed description 
of 
the 
expected 
FY03 
budget 
outcomes and the 
indicative 
FY04 
budget 
is 
presented 
in 
Table 
C2. 
Page  78
Annex 
C 
Page 
4 
of 
7 
10. 
Total 
revenue 
in 
FY04 
is 
targeted 
to 
rise 
by 
14 
percent over 
its 
expected 
level 
in 
FY03 
while 
expenditure 
is 
planned 
to 
increase 
by 
17 
percent. 
Increased 
public 
investment 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
complement the 
growth 
of 
private 
investment 
in 
response 
to 
reforms. 
To 
contain 
the cost 
of 
public 
debt 
servicing, 
the Government 
will 
limit 
domestic 
financing 
to 
1.9 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY04, 
and 
will 
rely 
more 
on 
highly 
concessional 
external financing. 
If 
the latter 
turns 
out 
to 
be higher than 
the 
level 
currently 
projected, 
the 
overall 
budget 
deficit 
could be 
raised 
to 
5 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
to 
accommodate 
additional 
targeted 
poverty 
reduction 
programs 
and structural 
reform 
costs. 
In 
order 
to 
adjust 
to 
a 
possible 
shortfall 
in 
concessional external 
financing 
relative 
to 
the 
FY04 
target, 
the budget 
will 
be 
executed 
prudently 
by 
back-loading 
expenditures, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
capital 
spending. 
The 
actions 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
the 
event 
of 
financing 
shortfalls 
would 
include rationalizing  and 
trimming 
expenditures 
and  additional 
revenue 
measures. 
1 
1. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
efforts 
to 
boost 
revenues 
on 
a sustainable 
basis 
will 
be 
a 
core element 
of 
the 
Government’s 
medium-term fiscal 
strategy. 
Emphasis 
will 
be 
given 
to 
measures 
to 
broaden the 
tax 
net 
and 
improving 
tax 
administration. 
Revenue 
measures 
underpinning 
the 
FY04 
budget 
will 
include 
extending the 
income 
tax net 
and 
VAT 
nets; 
strengthening customs administration, 
including 
through 
revamping  the  bonded 
warehouse 
system; 
expanding 
the  audit 
program;  and 
setting 
up 
a 
central 
intelligence 
unit 
for 
the 
main 
taxes. 
The 
Government 
will 
take 
into 
account 
the recommendations 
of 
the 
Revenue 
Reforms 
Commission 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
significantly 
enhance 
the 
revenue 
base. 
Furthermore, 
utility 
prices 
and 
administrative 
fees 
and 
charges 
will 
be 
adjusted 
on 
a 
timely 
basis 
to 
protect 
non-tax 
revenues.

The 
quality 
of 
development expenditures 
will 
be 
enhanced 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
their 
pro-poor 
focus. 
It 
is 
intended 
that, 
within 
the 
fiscal 
year, 
no 
new 
unapproved 
ADP 
projects 
will 
be 
added 
to 
the 
program 
as 
this 
undermines 
fiscal 
sustainability 
and 
the 
overall 
quality 
of 
ADP 
projects. 
It 
will 
also 
restructure 
ADP 
spending, 
drawing 
on 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
Commission 
and 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
2002 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review. 
Adequate 
funding 
will 
be 
ensured 
to 
cover 
the 
costs 
of 
reforming 
the 
SOEs 
and 
NCBs. 
Very 
tentative 
estimates made 
by 
the 
Government indicate that 
the 
costs 
of 
reform 
could 
be 
in 
the range 
of 
0.5-0.7 
percent 
of 
GDP 
annually 
in 
the 
next 
three 
years. 
13. 
The 
Govemment 
has 
committed 
to 
attach 
particular 
importance 
to 
improving 
fiscal 
transparency 
and control, especially 
fiscal reporting 
and watchdog institutions. 
Recent gains 
in 
fiscal reporting 
will 
be 
consolidated 
through implementing 
the 
action 
plan 
recommended 
by 
the 
Fiscal 
Transparency 
Module 
of 
the 
Report 
on 
Observance 
of 
Standards 
and 
Codes 
(ROSC), 
as 
well 
as 
meeting 
key 
benchmarks 
under 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Reform 
Program. 
In 
particular, 
steps 
will 
be 
taken 
to 
strengthen 
internal control 
by 
allowing 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General 
to 
carry 
out audit 
functions independently. 
14. 
The 
External 
Sector 
and 
Balance 
of 
Payment 
Outlook. 
In 
order 
to 
put 
the 
economy 
on 
a 
path 
of 
accelerated and sustainable 
growth, Bangladeshi 
manufacturers and service 
providers 
need 
to 
find 
new 
products 
and export 
markets 
for 
the 
absorption 
of 
their 
supplies and 
services. 
It 
is 
reasonable 
to 
assume 
that, 
with 
a 
revival 
in 
the 
global 
economic environment, 
a 
flexible 
exchange 
rate 
regime and reduction 
in 
the domestic cost 
of 
doing 
business, 
Bangladesh 
would 
be 
able 
to 
raise 
merchandize 
export 
growth 
to 
about 
8-9 
percent 
per 
annum 
by 
FY05 
(Table 
Cl). 
Manufacturing 
and 
service 
oriented 
growth 
also 
means 
increased 
dependence 
on 
import 
growth, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
in 
any 
economy 
with 
growing 
openness. 
Import 
growth 
is 
therefore 
projected 
to 
rise 
back 
to 
an 
average 
annual 
rate 
of 
7 percent 
by 
FY05. 
Remittance 
from 
Bangladeshi workers  abroad 
can also 
be 
expected 
to 
grow 
at 
a 
healthy 
4-5 
percent 
annually, 
as 
demand 
for 
labor 
and 
wages 
in 
international labor 
markets 
return 
to normal 
levels. 
The 
required 
export, 
remittance and 
import growth 
rate 
for 
sustaining 
productivity 
growth 
imply 
that 
the 
current 
account 
deficit 
would 
rise 
to 
over 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY04, 
primarily 
on 
account 
of 
capital 
imports. 
This 
is 
not 
unsustainable, 
given 
improved 
access 
to 
concessional 
financing 
due 
to 
structural 
reforms 
and 
macroeconomic 
stability. 
The 
balance 
of 
payments 
outlook 
is 
strengthened 
as 
exports 
are 
diversified, 
more 
workers’ 
remittances  are  channeled 
through 
the 
formal 
financial 
sector 
while 
a 
favorable 
business 
climate 
leads 
to 
higher 
FDI. 
15. 
The 
projections 
above 
are 
subject 
to 
significant 
downside 
risks, 
particularly 
higher 
oil 
prices, 
potential 
losses 
in 
workers’ 
remittances, 
and 
disruptions 
in 
exports 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
prolonged 
Iraqi 
conflict. 
Also, 
Bangladesh has 
lost 
valuable 
time 
in 
preparing 
to 
face 
the 
anticipated 
changes 
in 
its 
export 
markets 
following 
the 
MFA 
phase-out 
in 
2005.  Persistence 
with 
substantial 
structural 
reforms 
will 
help 
weather the 
shocks. 
Concessional 
foreign financing 
- 
both 
capital 
transfers 
and 
medium 
and 
long-term 
loans 
- 
will 
be 
critical for 
Bangladesh’s 
medium-term 
growth 
sustainability and 
reducing 
vulnerability 
to 
shocks. 
The 
present 
foreign 
exchange reserve 
level 
of 
just 
two 
months 
import 
equivalent 
is 
low 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
raised to 
a 
sustained 
3 months’ 
of 
imports 
by 
the 
end 
of 
FY04. 
A 
more 
accommodative 
fiscal 
stance 
and  emergency 
external 
support 
may 
also 
be 
needed 
to 
help 
avoid 
an 
excessive  economic 
slowdown 
due 
to 
exogenous shocks. 
16. 
Monetary 
and 
Exchange 
Rate 
Policies. 
Maintaining 
low 
inflation, 
increasing 
GDP 
growth 
and 
rebuilding 
international 
reserves 
require 
prudent 
monetary and 
exchange 
rate policies. 
Consistency 
is 
needed 
between 
the 
growth 
of 
broad money and 
the 
BB 
net 
domestic 
assets. 
Broad 
money 
growth 
in 
turn 
has 
to 
be 
in 
line 
with 
the 
growth 
of 
nominal GDP 
and 
the 
economy’s 
monetization 
needs. 
Given 
a 
prudent 
fiscal 
stance, 
tighter 
monetary 
policy 
relative 
to 
the 
experience 
in 
the 
recent past should 
have 
no 
adverse 
implications 
for 
the 
growth 
of 
credit 
to 
the 
private 
sector.

17. 
In 
the 
indicative program 
agreed 
with 
the 
IMF 
(Table 
C3), 
the Government 
has 
committed 
to 
reserve 
money 
growth 
targets 
of 
4.5 
percent and 
9.6 
percent 
for 
FY03 
and 
FY04 
respectively, 
while 
broad 
money 
growth 
is 
expected 
to 
slow to 
12.1 percent 
in 
FY04. 
This 
would 
allow 
Bangladesh 
Bank to 
rebuild 
net 
international 
reserves, 
while 
accommodating 
required 
private 
sector 
credit  growth. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
linking 
the 
yields 
on 
new 
issues 
of 
national 
savings 
certificates 
to 
the rates 
for 
treasury 
bills 
of 
comparable 
maturity 
and 
enhance 
coordination 
between 
foreign 
exchange 
and 
liquidity 
management operations. 
These 
will 
help 
reduce 
rigidities 
in 
the 
structure 
of 
interest 
rates 
and  augment 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
monetary 
policy. 
Further, 
reforms 
in 
financial 
markets  and  the 
development 
of 
a 
secondary 
market 
for 
treasury 
bills 
would 
allow 
the 
use 
of 
indirect 
instruments 
for 
monetary 
policy 
to 
enhance 
monetary 
management. 
The 
reforms 
in 
the 
monetary 
sector are 
expected 
to 
increase 
control 
of 
BB 
over 
NCBs 
and 
DFIs 
and 
lead 
to 
an 
efficient 
allocation 
of 
credit, 
largely 
to 
the 
private 
sector. 
This 
is 
made 
possible 
by 
reduced 
central  Government  reliance 
on 
banks 
for  deficit 
financing 
and 
with 
market determined 
lending 
rates. 
18. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
exchange 
rate 
policy, 
it 
is 
essential 
that 
the 
exchange 
rate 
is 
not 
over-valued and 
that 
exchange 
restrictions 
introduced 
in 
late 
2000 
and 
2001 
are 
completely 
dismantled.  Government 
is 
discussing 
with 
the 
IMF 
the 
possibility 
of 
early 
adoption 
of 
a 
market-based exchange 
rate 
system 
to 
boost 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
monetary 
policy, 
strengthen 
the 
Government’s 
capacity 
to 
address 
shocks 
on 
a 
timely 
basis 
and 
enhance 
export 
competitiveness 
in 
a challenging 
global 
environment. 
It 
will 
also 
help 
prevent 
exchange 
rate misalignments. 
A 
timetable 
has 
been 
adopted 
to 
phase 
out 
exchange 
restrictions 
under 
the 
Fund’s 
Article 
VIII. 
19. 
Public 
Debt 
Sustainability. 
Despite 
increases 
in 
total 
public 
debt 
from 
44.4 percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY98 
to 
about 
50 
percent 
in 
FYO1, 
Bangladesh 
remains 
among 
the 
“less 
indebted low-income’’ 
countries 
with 
the 
ratio 
of 
net 
present 
value 
of 
external 
debt 
to 
exports 
at about 105 percent 
in 
2001. 
Nearly 
two- 
third 
of 
the 
total public 
debt 
comprise 
of 
highly 
concessional 
external 
debt. 
Current 
public 
debt 
would 
be 
sustainable 
under 
the 
fiscal 
and  external 
policy 
path 
envisaged 
in 
the  macroeconomic  framework. 
Downside deviation 
from 
this 
path 
could 
subject 
Bangladesh 
to 
unsustainable 
debt 
dynamics. 
A 
recent 
IMF 
exercise examined 
what 
would 
happen 
to 
the 
public 
sector 
debt-GDP 
ratio 
if 
all 
key 
variables 
remained 
at 
their 
average 
value 
for 
the 
past 
seven 
years. 
This 
analysis 
suggests 
that 
the 
baseline, 
which 
assumes 
a 
slight 
increase 
in 
public 
debt 
from 
about 
51 
percent 
of 
GDP 
to 
53  percent, 
compares 
unfavorably 
against 
the 
historical 
scenario. 
This 
is 
because 
the 
baseline 
assumes 
a 
lower 
3.8 
percent 
GDP 
growth 
rate 
during 
FY03-08 
than 
the 
recent 
historical 
average 
of 
5 
percent, 
a 
higher 
average 
nominal 
interest 
rate 
on 
public 
debt 
(5 
percent 
compared 
with 
2.8 
percent), 
and 
a 
slow 
but 
steady 
decline 
in 
the 
primary deficit 
from 
2.1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
FY03 to 
1.4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
over 
the 
projection 
period, 
compared 
with 
a 
historical 
average 
of 
1.8 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
20. 
Applying 
individual 
and combined 
adverse shocks 
to 
key 
economic 
variables 
in 
FY03-04, 
IMF 
stress tests 
on 
the 
baseline 
projections 
suggest 
that, 
even 
under 
significant 
adverse 
shocks, 
the 
public 
debt 
is 
likely 
to 
remain 
manageable at 
under 
70 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
The 
greatest 
risk 
to 
the 
baseline scenario 
apparently 
comes 
from 
a 
significant 
real 
depreciation 
of 
the 
exchange 
rate and 
a 
sudden 
increase 
in 
other 
debt-creating 
flows, 
the 
latter arising 
for 
example 
from 
a 
recapitalization 
of 
NCBs or 
an assumption 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
SOE 
debt whose 
costs 
are 
not 
incorporated 
into 
the baseline 
scenario.  Shocks 
to 
the 
real 
interest 
rate, 
GDP 
growth, 
or 
to 
the 
primary 
balance have 
relatively 
modest impacts 
on 
the 
debt 
dynamics. 
While 
this 
analysis 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account the 
contingent 
liabilities 
of 
the 
Government, 
which 
could 
be 
considerably 
large, 
it 
does 
reinforce 
the 
importance 
of 
adhering 
to 
the 
macroeconomic 
policy 
path 
envisaged 
in 
the Government’s 
medium-term 
framework.

1. 
A 
more 
comprehensive 
examination 
of 
the 
implications for 
sustainability 
of 
the  deteriorating 
fiscal 
stance 
in 
the 
late 
90s, 
at the 
level 
of 
both 
the 
central 
Government and 
the 
consolidated 
public 
sector, 
derived 
a 
level 
of 
the 
primary deficit 
to 
GDP 
consistent 
with 
constant 
money-GDP and 
public 
debt 
to 
GDP 
ratios.32 
The 
results 
showed that 
the 
sustainable 
level 
of 
the Government’s 
primary 
deficit 
was 
2.7 
percent 
of 
GDP; 
well 
below 
the 
actual 
4.4 
percent 
in 
FYOO 
and 
the 
4.7 
percent 
in 
FYO1, 
but 
close 
to 
the 
2.9 
percent 
primary deficit 
achieved 
in 
FY02 
and 
above 
the 
2.2 
percent 
projected 
for 
FY03. 
Thus, 
while 
the 
increases 
in 
primary 
deficit, 
financed 
by 
costly 
domestic 
debt, 
in 
the late 
90s 
was 
not 
sustainable, 
current 
fiscal 
policy 
and 
the 
medium-term  fiscal 
framework 
is 
consistent 
with 
sustainability. 
The 
calculations 
of 
sustainable 
primary deficit 
levels 
for 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
consolidated 
public 
sector, 
using 
FYOl 
actual 
level 
as 
the benchmark, showed 
that a 
fiscal correction 
equivalent 
to 
1.8-2 
percentage 
points 
of 
GDP 
was 
required 
for 
the 
primary 
deficit 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
stationary 
liability 
ratios 
to 
GDP. 
Nearly two-third 
of 
the 
required reduction 
will 
be 
achieved 
by 
FY03. 
As 
Table 
C1 
shows, 
the 
medium- 
term 
fiscal 
deficit path 
adopted 
by 
the 
Government 
implies 
a 
stable 
total public 
debt-GDP 
ratio 
at around 
50-5 
1 
percent.

EDUCATION 
Outcomes 
2. 
Coverage 
and 
access 
to 
education  over  the  past 
two 
decades 
have 
exceeded 
expectations, 
especially 
when 
seen 
against the 
backdrop 
of 
the 
performance 
of 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
(Table 
F.l). 
The 
main 
successes 
include 
(i) 
rapid 
expansion 
of 
primary 
education 
- 
gross 
primary 
enrollment 
rate 
increased 
72 
percent 
in 
1990 
to 
91 
percent 
in 
2000; 
(ii) 
a 
narrowing 
of 
disparity 
between 
rural 
and 
urban 
primary 
enrollments; 
and 
(iii) 
closing 
of 
the  gender 
gap, 
including 
among 
the 
very 
poor. 
In 
addition, 
enrollment 
in 
junior 
secondary education 
and 
secondary 
education 
expanded at 
an 
annual 
rate 
of 
10 
percent 
during 
1993-99. 
Gender 
and 
urban-rural 
parity 
in 
Bangladesh 
are 
comparable 
to 
Sri 
Lanka. 
Close 
to 
nine 
out 
of 
every 
ten children 
eventually 
enroll 
in 
primary 
school 
and 
Bangladesh 
has 
achieved 
similar 
levels 
of 
primary 
and secondary 
gross 
enrollment 
as 
countries 
with 
higher 
per 
capita 
income 
such 
as 
Vietnam, Thailand, and 
Indonesia.

3. 
The 
government accords such 
hgh 
priority 
to 
spending 
on 
education that 
it 
is 
the largest 
single 
item 
in 
the 
revenue 
and 
development 
budget, 
and offers 
substantial  demand-side 
incentives 
to 
boost 
enrollment  (food-for-education  program, 
secondary 
school 
stipend, 
etc.). 
In 
addition, 
the 
country’s 
extensive non-government 
institutions 
have also 
contributed 
to 
delivering 
education 
services.

government 
spending 
on 
primary 
education 
more 
than doubled 
in 
real 
terms 
between 
1991 and 
2000, 
since 
total public 
spending 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
low, 
education outlays 
- 
at 
around 
2.2 percent 
of 
GDP 
-- 
remain 
low 
relative to 
other countries 
in 
the 
region 
(e.g. 
India 
3.7 
percent, 
Sri 
Lanka 
3.4 
percent). 
4. 
Recently, 
however, 
while 
official 
estimates 
continued 
showing 
improvements,  survey-based 
estimates 
indicate 
less 
encouragmg outcomes. 
The 
HES 
series 
report 
a 
moderate 
rise 
- 
from 
44 
percent 
to 
56 
percent 
- 
between 
199 
1-92 and 
2000 
in 
the 
share 
of 
population 
aged 
11-19 years 
that 
has 
completed 
grade 
5 
and, 
wonyingly, 
a 
fall 
in 
enrollment 
rates 
of 
6 
-10 
years 
old 
over 
the past 
five 
years. 
In 
addition, 
quality 
of 
education 
has 
not 
kept 
pace 
with 
education 
expansion. 
Students’ 
attendance rates 
are 
low 
(62 
percent), 
teacher absenteeism 
is 
high 
(5-20 
percent, 
depending 
on 
the 
type 
of 
school), 
the 
curriculum 
is 
of 
limited 
relevance, 
particularly 
at the secondary 
level, 
and teacher-pupil 
contact 
time 
is 
very 
low 
(CAMPE 
1999, 
2000).34 
Parents have 
to 
pay 
to 
obtain 
textbooks 
that 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
provided 
free 
of 
charge. 
Three-quarters 
of 
the 
total 
resources 
allocated 
to 
the 
Food-for-Education 
(FFE) 
program 
do 
not 
appear 
to 
reach 
any 
benefi~iary.~~ 
Although 
not 
enough 
hard 
evidence 
exists, 
it 
is 
widely 
believed 
that 
the 
education 
students 
receive 
in 
schools 
in 
poor 
areas 
is 
of 
disproportionately 
poor quality 
and 
may 
be 
one 
of 
the 
main 
reasons 
why 
children 
from 
poor 
families 
are 
much 
more 
likely 
to 
drop-out. 
5. 
Poor 
children 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
be enrolled 
in 
school at 
all 
levels. 
While 
at 
a 
primary level 
for 
every 7 non-poor 
children 
6 
of 
their 
poor 
counterparts 
are 
enrolled 
, 
the 
gap 
in 
enrollment 
rates 
of 
poor 
and non-poor 
widens 
considerably 
at 
the 
junior 
secondary 
level 
(where 
for 
every 2 
non-poor 
children 
enrolled 
only 
1 
poor 
is 
enrolled) 
and 
further 
at 
the 
secondary 
and 
higher 
secondary 
level 
(the 
ratios 
are 
1 
to 
3 
and 
1 
to 
6, 
respectively). 
Possibly, 
this 
is 
attributable 
to 
higher 
primary drop out 
rates 
among 
the 
poor 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
secondary 
education 
is 
much 
more 
costly. 
Benefit 
incidence 
analysis 
(BIA) 
carried 
out 
using 
data 
from 
the 2000 
HIES 
in 
conjunction 
with 
government 
expenditure data 
indicated 
that 
public 
spending 
on 
education 
has 
re-distributional impact 
(the 
poor 
receive a larger 
share 
of 
education 
subsidy 
than 
their 
share 
in 
total 
consumption). 
Primary 
education 
expenditures 
are 
found 
to 
be 
strongly 
pro-poor 
(the 
poor 
receive 
a 
share 
larger than 
their 
share 
in 
the 
total 
population). 
The 
key 
factor 
dnving 
the 
pro- 
poor 
distribution 
of 
primary 
education 
is 
the 
age 
composition, 
which 
more than 
offsets 
the 
lower 
enrollment 
rates  among  the 
poor. 
Secondary 
and tertiary 
spending 
are 
not 
pro-poor,  however, 
the 
distribution 
of 
government 
spending 
in 
these 
two 
sub-sectors 
is 
quite 
comparable 
with 
that 
in 
other 
countries 
with 
similar 
levels 
of 
per capita 
income 
(Table 
F.2). 
6. 
Lower 
enrollments 
among the 
poor 
cannot 
be 
explained away 
by 
child 
labor, 
as 
a large 
fraction 
of 
poor 
children 
who 
are 
not 
workmg 
never 
enroll 
in 
school. 2000 
HIES 
data 
on 
the 
activity 
status 
of 
children 
shows 
that 
the 
share 
of 
10-14-year-old 
children 
who 
are 
neither 
working 
nor 
in 
school 
is 
extremely 
high 
- 
about 
30 
percent 
- 
in 
the 
poorest 
expenditure 
de~ile.~~ 
The 
two 
most 
common 
responses 
among 
the 
idle 
10-14 
year-olds 
as 
to 
why 
they 
were 
not 
available 
for 
work 
were that 
they 
were 
“too 
young” 
(24 percent) 
or 
that 
there 
was 
“no 
work 
available” 
(44 percent). 
Understanding 
why 
children 
from 
poor 
families 
are 
not 
attending 
schools, 
even 
when 
they 
are 
not 
in 
the 
labor 
force, 
should be 
an 
urgent 
priority.

Recent evidence 
suggests 
that 
the 
incidence 
of 
child 
labor 
has 
declined 
during 
the 
past 
decade. 
According 
to 
data 
eom 
the 
Labor Force 
Surveys (based 
on 
the 
‘usual 
definition’ 
of 
economically 
active), the number 
of 
children 
between 10-14 
years 
of 
age 
who 
are 
economically active 
has 
declined 
from 
5.6 
million 
in 
1995-96 to 
4.3 
million 
in 
1999-00. 
The 
estimates 
of 
the 
total 
magnitude 
of 
child 
labor 
vary 
considerably 
across 
different 
data 
sources 
(e.g., 
comparing 
figures 
from 
the 
HES, LFS, 
and 
National 
Survey 
of 
Child 
Labor). 
However, most 
data 
sources 
point 
to 
a 
decline 
in 
labor 
force 
participation 
by 
children 
during 
the past 
decade.

Three 
key 
public 
policies 
underpinned 
Bangladesh’s 
education 
successes. 
These 
include: 
(i) 
sustained 
injections 
of 
public 
 resource^;^' 
(ii) 
effective  partnerships 
with 
private 
sector 
for 
service 
delivery; 
and 
(iii) 
provision 
of 
subsidies 
to 
influence 
the 
demand 
for 
education 
in 
favor 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
women. 
8. 
Bangladesh’s 
public 
policy 
and 
expenditures have 
consistently 
emphasized education, 
and 
the 
sharp increases 
in 
education 
spending 
that occurred 
during 
the 
mid-1990s 
have 
been 
sustained. 
Education 
is 
by 
far 
the 
largest 
recipient 
of 
budgetary 
funds 
in 
combined 
ADP 
and recurrent 
budgets. 
Total 
GOB 
expenditure 
on 
education 
is 
currently 
about 
2.2 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
15-16 
percent 
of 
total 
government 
spending 
(Table 
F.3). 
Most 
government expenditure 
on 
education 
is 
directed 
to 
basic  education, 
Le., 
primary 
and 
mass 
education 
and 
secondary education, however, 
during 
the 
past 
decade, 
there 
has 
been 
a 
significant 
shift 
within 
basic 
education 
from 
the 
primary 
to 
the 
secondary 
level. 
While 
the 
pressure 
to 
accommodate the 
increasing 
demand 
for 
continuing 
education 
from 
the 
cohort 
that 
finished 
primary 
school 
contributed 
to 
this 
trend, 
it 
also 
reflected 
a 
policy 
shift 
to 
widen 
the 
provision 
of 
secondary 
education, 
particularly 
to 
girls. 
9. 
Expansion 
of 
primary 
education 
took 
place 
both 
within 
and 
outside 
public-sector 
provision. 
There 
has 
been 
a 
large 
expansion 
in 
primary 
schools 
in 
Bangladesh 
in 
the 
early 
1990s 
and 
by 
1996 
there 
were 
37,7 
10 
government 
primary 
schools 
(GPS) 
and 
19,683 
registered non-govemment 
primary 
schools 
(RNGPS) 
operating 
in 
the 
country. 
In 
fact, even 
after 
the 
growth 
in 
GPS 
and 
RNGPS 
leveled 
off 
in 
1996, 
local 
communities  continued 
to 
organize  schools 
with 
government  support. 
Compared 
to 
GPS, 
the 
RNGPS 
and 
community 
schools 
tend 
to 
have 
lower 
teacher 
salaries, 
a 
higher 
number 
of 
students 
per 
classroom, and 
higher 
students-teacher 
ratios, 
thus 
resulting 
in 
lower per-pupil 
costs. 
10. 
The 
rapid 
expansion 
of 
secondary 
education 
was 
mainly 
through 
partnership 
with 
private 
providers. 
The  large 
expansion 
in 
primary 
enrollment 
eventually 
resulted 
in 
increased demand 
for 
continuing 
into 
the 
secondary 
level. 
To 
achieve 
rapid 
expansion 
of 
secondary 
enrollment, 
GOB 
opted 
for 
even 
wider 
partnership 
with 
the 
private 
sector, 
which 
allowed 
to 
ensure 
lower 
per-pupil 
cost. 
As 
a result, 
today 
more 
than 
95 
percent 
of 
secondary schools are 
non-government 
whose 
unit 
cost 
per 
pupil 
is 
$16, 
37 
The 
expansion 
of 
education 
was 
mostly 
financed 
from 
domestic 
resources. 
The 
ratio 
of 
sectoral 
project 
aid 
to 
sectoral 
ADP 
has 
declined 
fiom 
47 
percent 
in 
early 
1990s 
to 
27 
percent 
in 
2000 
Page  92
Annex 
F 
Page 
4 
of 
17 
compared 
with 
$68 
in 
govemment 
secondary  schools. 
This 
difference 
in 
unit 
cost 
is 
due 
to 
lower 
teacher-student 
ratio 
as 
well 
as 
teacher 
salaries 
(in 
non-govemment 
secondary 
schools 
govemment pays 
90 
percent 
of 
the 
base 
teacher salary). 
11. 
Despite 
high 
administrative 
leakage, 
government 
strategy 
to 
promote 
education 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
women 
through 
demand 
side 
interventions  delivers 
results. 
Currently, 
two 
demand 
side 
conditional 
education 
transfer 
programs 
provide 
subsidies 
to 
selected 
schools 
and 
direct 
benefits 
to 
selected 
groups 
of 
students 
and their 
families. 
The 
Food 
for 
Education 
(FFE) 
program 
provides grain 
rations 
(recently 
monetized) 
to 
disadvantaged 
families 
if 
they 
send 
their 
children 
to 
primary 
school. 
The 
Female 
Secondary 
Stipends 
(FSS) 
program 
provides 
stipends 
and 
tuition 
waivers 
to 
females 
residing 
in 
non- 
municipal 
areas 
if 
they 
attend 
grades 
VI-X. 
About 
20 
percent 
of 
all 
education 
ADP 
spending 
is 
devoted 
to 
FSS, 
and 
another 
16 
percent 
to 
FFE 
and 
primary 
stipends3* 
combined 
(Table 
F.4). 
38 
In 
2000 
the 
govemment 
introduced 
a 
Primary 
Education 
Stipends 
Program 
covering 
rural 
poor families 
in 
non-FFE 
areas. 
This 
program 
pays 
a cash 
stipend 
of 
Tk 
25 
per 
student 
per 
month using 
the 
same 
targeting 
criteria 
as 
in 
FFE.

Evidence 
from 
surveys 
suggests 
that 
FFE 
is 
reasonably 
well-targeted 
toward 
the 
poor. 
For 
instance, 
the 
poorest 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
income 
distribution 
are 
nearly 
5 
times 
more 
likely 
to 
participate 
in 
FFE 
program 
than 
are 
the 
richest 
20 
percent 
of 
the population. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
strong 
evidence 
from 
the 
mid 
1990s 
(Ravallion 
and 
Wodon 
2000)39 that the 
FFE 
program 
succeeds 
in 
attracting 
poor 
children 
to 
school. 
Specifically, 
estimates 
show that 
participation 
in 
FFE 
increases 
the 
probability 
of 
attending 
school 
by 
20 
percent 
on 
average. 
Evidence 
from 
HIES 
2000 
shows 
that 
these 
gains have 
been 
sustained. 
While 
the 
FSS 
is 
not 
pro-poor 
and 
no 
formal 
evaluation 
of 
its 
effectiveness 
has 
been 
done, 
it 
is 
deemed 
to 
have raised 
girls’ 
secondary 
enrollments, 
as 
high 
as 
or 
higher 
than 
those 
for 
boys 
for 
all

More 
recent 
information 
indicates 
that 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
programs 
in 
place 
is 
significantly 
negated 
by 
implementation 
problems. 
Most 
disturbing 
are estimates 
of 
aggregate 
household 
transfers 
for 
the 
FFE 
and 
FSS 
programs obtained 
from 
the 
HIES 
2000. 
The 
administrative 
leakages 
in 
FFE 
is 
such 
that 
a large 
portion 
of 
the 
aggregate 
program 
allocation 
is 
not 
accounted 
for 
in 
the 
survey estimates. 
What 
is 
particularly 
worrisome 
in 
the 
Bangladeshi  context 
is 
that 
similar 
calculations 
for 
the 
FFE 
program 
using 
the 
1995-96 
Household Expenditure 
Survey 
(1995-96 
HES) 
indicate 
substantially 
lower 
discrepancy, 
indicating 
that 
problems 
of 
leakage 
have deteriorated 
over 
time 
(see

Key 
Sector 
Issues 
14. 
GOB 
has 
implemented 
several 
policies 
in 
the 
education 
sector, 
which 
have 
yelded 
laudable 
results. 
The 
outcomes 
certainly 
would 
have 
been 
much 
better 
if 
the 
handicaps, 
mostly 
of 
the 
institutional 
nature, 
did 
not hold 
back 
the 
system. 
A 
consensus 
defines 
the 
measures 
needed 
in 
the 
field: 
(a) 
raise 
the 
amount 
of 
public 
resources 
devoted 
to 
basic education; 
(b) 
continue 
to 
improve 
access 
and 
equity; 
(c) 
establish  better 
partnerships 
with 
relevant 
stakeholders 
(parents, 
communities, 
non-government 
institutions, 
etc.) 
to 
improve 
quality 
of 
education 
services; 
(d) 
provide 
adequate 
teacher 
training 
and 
other 
needed 
pedagogical 
inputs, 
as 
well 
as 
(e) 
undertake 
better 
assessments 
of 
learning and 
outcomes.  There 
is 
also 
a 
need 
to 
improve 
management 
and accountability, 
reduce 
corruption 
and 
waste, 
and 
de-politicize 
the education 
system. 
15. 
Governance 
is 
a 
key 
constraint 
on 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
education. 
A 
recent 
survey 
on 
governance 
problems 
in 
Bangladesh 
found 
growing 
dissatisfaction 
among 
the 
parents 
of 
school 
children 
with 
the 
quality 
of 
education 
in 
general 
and, 
most 
acutely 
with 
schools 
at 
the 
primary 
level. 
Where 
22 
percent 
had 
registered 
their 
unhappiness 
with 
education 
standards 
in 
a 
similar 
survey 
five 
years 
ago, 
30 
percent 
took 
that 
negative 
view 
in 
the 
current 
survey.  Governance  can 
be improved 
in 
part 
through 
decentralization 
of 
management 
at 
primary 
and 
secondary 
levels. 
While 
community 
involvement 
in 
education 
has 
already increased somewhat, 
no 
significant 
power 
has 
yet 
been 
devolved 
to 
communities 
or 
local 
governments  at  the 
primary 
and 
secondary 
level.

16. 
Accountability 
and 
incentive 
mechanisms 
and, 
checks 
and 
balances 
for 
teachers 
and 
administrators 
are 
extremely 
weak. 
The 
ministries 
do 
not 
have 
sufficient 
capacity 
to 
monitor 
the 
financial 
aspects 
of 
the 
subvention 
system, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
instruction. 
They 
have 
little 
control 
over 
the 
collection 
of 
information 
from 
schools, 
thus 
resulting 
in 
substantial  delays 
in 
the 
production 
of 
basic statistics. 
Information 
about 
student 
and 
school performance 
and 
about finance 
is 
not 
always 
reliable, 
nor 
is 
it 
available 
to 
the 
public. 
Teacher wages 
are 
not 
related 
to 
performance. 
While 
teacher salaries are 
it 
is 
not 
clear that 
this 
is 
the 
reason 
for 
poor 
teacher 
performance, 
as 
manifested 
by 
their 
high 
rate 
of 
absenteeism. 
It 
appears 
that 
poor 
governance 
in 
teacher 
recruitment, 
training, 
assignment 
to 
schools, 
salary 
payments 
and 
supervision 
are 
some 
major 
factors 
behind 
the 
very 
low 
motivation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
teachers 
to 
teach. 
Only 
these 
can 
explain 
why, 
despite 
being 
paid 
less 
than 
their 
counterparts 
in 
the government 
and 
government 
aided 
schools, teachers 
in 
NGO 
schools 
seem 
to 
do 
better 
in 
classrooms 
(CAMPE, 
2000).42 
17. 
Low 
efficiency 
is 
due 
in 
part 
to 
unbalanced expenditures 
on 
labor and non-labor 
teaching 
inputs. 
A 
high 
share 
of 
government 
education 
expenditure at 
all 
levels 
is 
directed at 
teachers’ 
salaries 
and 
salary- 
related 
subsidies 
to 
non-govemment  institutions. 
In 
1999/00, 
salaries 
and 
salary-related 
subsidies 
accounted 
for 
97 percent and 
80 
percent 
of 
recurrent 
expenditure  at 
the 
primary 
and 
secondary 
levels 
respectively. Construction 
is 
another 
large 
item 
in 
education 
budgets. 
For 
instance, 
although 
the 
number 
of 
government 
and govemment-supported 
primary 
schools has 
been 
largely 
stable 
for 
several 
years, 
construction 
of 
govemment-aided 
schools absorbed 
28 
percent 
of 
the 
capital 
budget 
in 
1999-00. 
18. 
At 
the 
secondary 
level, 
the 
govemment 
provides 
its 
subsidies 
directly 
to 
a 
“qualified” 
set 
of 
private 
schools. 
Once  the  schools  have  attained 
their 
eligibility 
to 
receive 
government 
subsidies, 
however, 
the 
subsidies 
continue 
to flow 
regardless 
of 
performance  or 
community 
satisfaction. 
The 
government 
has 
little 
leverage 
beyond 
periodic 
non-renewal 
of 
accreditation 
and 
discontinuation 
of 
subventions, 
measures 
it 
rarely 
employs. 
There 
are 
few 
ministry 
staff 
at 
the 
field 
level 
to 
monitor 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
services 
they 
are 
essentially purchasing. 
The 
consequence 
is 
a 
sub-system 
of 
uneven, 
but 
generally 
poor 
quality, 
in 
which 
considerable 
rent-seeking 
behavior 
is 
alleged 
to 
occur. 
19. 
Tertiary 
sector, 
relatively 
small 
but 
in 
high 
demand, 
tends 
to 
subsidize 
private 
goods 
(the 
degree 
training 
of 
undergraduates 
and 
masters 
candidates) 
and 
does 
not 
focus enough 
on 
science 
and 
technology. 
It 
also 
fails 
to 
fully 
mobilize private 
resources. 
Even 
though 
they 
still 
have pockets 
of 
excellence, 
Bangladeshi 
universities 
are 
deteriorating 
rapidly 
due 
to 
shortages 
of 
funding 
and 
the 
rapid 
politicization 
of 
campuses. 
Little 
resources 
are 
available 
for 
research, 
even 
in 
the 
best universities. 
Within 
universities, 
resources 
are 
allocated 
among departments based 
on 
staffing and 
historical 
patterns, 
instead 
of 
being 
responsive 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
students (or 
the 
economy). 
Much 
instructional 
time 
is 
lost 
to 
demonstrations 
and 
strikes. 
The 
other 
part 
of 
hgher 
education, 
the 
degree 
colleges, account 
for 
about 
85 
percent 
of 
40 
While 
greater 
decentralization 
of 
primary 
and 
secondary 
education 
in 
Bangladesh 
also 
offers potentially 
high 
payoffs 
in 
terms 
of 
improving 
quality 
and 
access, 
special 
attention 
is 
warranted 
on 
at least 
two 
fronts. First, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
considerable 
regional 
inequalities 
in 
resource 
mobilization 
potential, 
while 
school-level 
management 
can 
effectively 
be 
decentralized, 
local 
financing 
cannot 
be 
the exclusive 
source 
of 
educational 
support. 
Govemment 
action 
may 
still 
be 
needed 
at 
the 
national 
or 
regional 
level 
in 
providing 
resources, 
setting 
standards, 
developing 
curricula 
and 
assessing 
learning. 
Second, 
relying 
on 
decentralization 
to 
improve 
the 
management 
of 
education 
presupposes 
that 
families 
and communities 
will 
be 
sufficiently 
empowered 
to 
participate 
effectively, 
to 
influence 
policy 
formulation through 
democratic 
processes, 
and 
to 
prevent 
elite 
capture 
and 
corruption. 
41NGO-run 
schools 
have 
lower 
teacher salaries, 
but 
tend 
to 
employ individuals 
with 
lower level 
of 
formal 
education 
and 
tenure.

Although 
they 
are 
subsidized 
by 
the government 
(albeit 
at a 
much 
lower 
level 
per 
student 
as 
compared 
to 
the universities), 
they finance 
about 
two-thirds 
of 
their 
costs 
through 
student 
fees. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
justify 
the 
payment 
of 
subsidies 
to 
degree 
colleges, since 
the 
services 
they 
provide 
are 
mainly 
“private.” 
It 
would 
be 
better 
to 
gradually 
terminate 
the 
subsidies 
that 
private 
degree 
colleges 
receive and 
privatize 
most 
of 
the 
remaining 
government 
degree 
colleges. 
Progress 
with 
reform 
measures 
20. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
a 
significant 
decline 
in 
fertility, 
Bangladesh 
is 
projected 
to 
experience 
declining 
demographic 
pressure 
on 
primary 
and 
secondary education. 
In 
particular, 
population 
in 
primary 
age 
is 
expected 
to 
shnk 
from 
16.7 
million 
in 
1999 
to 
14.2 
million 
in 
2005 
and 
13.6 
million 
in 
2008. 
The 
number 
of 
lower 
secondary 
and 
secondary 
age 
children 
is 
also 
projected 
to 
decline. 
Analysis 
of 
public 
resources 
requirements 
under 
alternative 
scenarios 
indicate that 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
the 
present 
coverage 
or 
even increase 
it 
from 
the 
existing 
91 
percent 
gross 
enrolment rate 
to 
100 percent 
while 
maintaining 
inflation 
adjusted 
unit 
costs 
and 
thus 
the 
“low 
quality”, 
the 
share 
of 
education 
in 
the 
budget 
can 
actually 
decline 
if 
annual 
GDP 
growth 
is 
maintained 
at 
around 
5 percent, 
the 
average 
of 
the 
90s. 
In 
order 
to 
provide primary 
education 
to 
all 
and 
improve 
quality 
of 
this 
education (incl.  better 
classroom 
facilities, 
more 
and better teaching-learning 
materials, 
better 
academic supervision, 
hiring 
additional 
teachers, 
etc. 
) 
as 
well 
as 
and 
provide 
universal 
coverage 
of 
lower 
secondary 
by 
2008; 
the 
resource 
requirement 
will 
rise 
to 
nearly 
3 
percent 
of 
GDP. 
Building 
an increase 
in 
coverage 
at the 
secondary 
level to 
50 
percent 
of 
the 
age 
group 
by 
2008  and 
allowing 
enrollment 
growth 
at  the 
higher 
secondary, 
tertiary 
and 
technical 
education 
at 
their historic 
rate, 
the 
resources 
required to 
expand 
coverage 
and 
improve 
quality 
increase 
to 
4 
percent 
of 
GDP 
by 
2008.43 
21. 
In 
recent 
months, the government 
has 
exhibited 
its 
commitment 
to 
improve 
governance 
in 
the 
education 
sector 
by 
modifying 
or reforming 
poorly- 
governed programs  (replacing 
FFE 
with 
a 
cash 
stipend 
program). 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
is 
also 
developing action 
plans 
for 
reforms 
in 
these 
areas 
and implementation 
is 
expected 
to 
commence 
by 
July 
2003. 
Some 
key 
aspects 
of 
the strategy 
involve: 
22. 
With 
respect 
to 
primary 
education, the 
Ministry 
of 
Primary 
and 
Mass 
Education 
(MoPME) 
has 
recently 
developed 
the 
Primary 
Education Development 
Program, 
which 
represents 
MoPME’s 
plan 
over 
the 
next 
five 
years, 
and 
is 
designed 
to 
provide an 
overarching 
policy 
framework 
and 
implementation 
plan 
for 
the development 
of 
primary 
education. 
It 
focuses 
on 
strategies 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
primary 
education, 
as 
well 
as 
enhancing 
access 
for 
the disadvantaged. 
Development 
partners 
(e.g., 
ADB) 
pledged 
their 
support 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
this 
program through 
investment 
loans. 
The 
specific objectives 
of 
the 
program 
are 
to: 
(i) 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
teaching and learning, and 
enhance 
student 
achievement; 
(ii) 
enhance 
access 
to 
schooling, 
through improvement 
of 
physical 
facilities 
for 
the 
disadvantaged 
and 
provide 
incentives 
to 
teachers 
to perform 
better; 
and 
(ii) 
strengthen 
planning 
and 
management 
of 
primary 
education, and 
establish 
a 
nation-wide 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
system. 
23. 
With 
respect 
to 
secondary education, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
is 
developing 
action plans 
for 
reforms, 
and 
implementation 
is 
expected 
to 
commence 
by 
July 
2003. 
There 
are 
three 
key 
aspects 
of 
the 
strategy: 
Increasing 
accountability 
of 
schools, 
both 
to 
the 
govemment and 
to 
the 
community.  Reforms 
in 
these 
areas 
will 
include 
rigorously 
enforcing criteria governing 
the 
establishment 
of 
institutions 
and establishing 
institutional 
mechanisms 
for 
linking 
school 
subventions 
to 
objective 
measures 
of 
school  performance. 
Simultaneously,

the 
functioning 
of 
school  management

committees 
will 
be 
revised 
to 
give 
them 
greater 
responsibility regarding 
the 
supervision 
of 
schools. 
An 
autonomous 
Teacher 
Recruitment 
Commission 
will 
be 
established, 
in 
order 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
uniform 
standards 
for 
teacher 
recruitment. 
Schools 
will 
retain 
the 
flexibility to 
choose 
teachers, 
but 
they 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
list 
of 
qualified 
candidates 
approved 
by 
the commission. 
Simultaneously, 
uniform 
standards 
will 
be 
developed 
for 
existing 
teachers, 
who 
will 
be 
given 
the 
opportunity 
to 
upgrade 
their 
skills 
and 
become 
certified. 
Reducing opportunity 
for 
corruption 
and 
misuse 
of 
public 
recourses 
in 
textbook production 
. 
A 
time-bound 
plan 
for 
the 
privatization 
of 
textbook production 
is 
being 
developed, 
starting 
with 
the 
privatization 
of 
textbooks 
for 
grades 
9-10. 
These 
reforms 
are 
proposed 
to 
be 
supported 
by

and

HEALTH 
Outcomes 
24. 
Bangladesh 
has 
an 
impressive 
record 
of 
health 
outcomes over 
the 
years. 
Infant 
and 
under 
five 
mortality 
has 
been 
reduced 
by 
50 
percent, 
total 
fertility 
rate 
halved through voluntary 
acceptance 
of 
contraceptive, 
life 
expectancy  increased 
by 
14 
years, 
and 
substantial 
advances 
have 
been 
made 
in 
prevention 
of 
cholera 
and malaria, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
near-elimination 
of 
polio 
and 
leprosy. 
The 
latter 
is 
an 
MDG 
of 
the 
Government 
that already has 
been 
achieved. 
These advances are 
due 
to 
the government's 
close  partnership 
with 
NGOs 
especially 
in 
the 
area 
of 
family 
planning  and immunization, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
an 
affordable 
(basic) 
national 
health 
program. 
Sound 
interventions 
in 
other 
sectors, 
such 
as 
wider 
availability 
of 
food, expansion 
of 
education and 
access 
to 
safe 
water, 
leading 
to 
an increase 
in 
peoples' demand 
for 
better 
health 
services have also 
been 
important 
contributing 
factors. 
Taking into 
account 
the 
government's 
low 
level 
of 
resources, 
the 
national health 
policy 
rightly 
focused 
on 
the 
most 
pressing 
needs 
of 
the 
population 
- 
primary 
health 
care 
in 
rural 
areas, 
population 
control, 
and 
immunization. 
25. 
Nevertheless, 
there 
are 
still 
major 
gaps 
in 
health 
outcomes and 
policies: 
matemal mortality 
is 
very 
high, 
and 
one 
of 
Bangladesh's 
successes, 
the 
provision 
of 
safe 
water 
supply 
to 
97 
percent 
of 
the 
population, 
is 
jeopardized 
by 
the 
extensive presence 
of 
ground 
water 
contaminants 
such 
as 
arsenic. There 
are  other 
lingering 
problems: 
low 
birth 
weight,  a 
slowdown 
in 
the 
reduction 
in 
fertility 
rates, 
and 
persistence 
of 
infectious 
diseases. 
26. 
Besides, 
child 
malnutrition 
short-term, acute 
food 
deficits 
(as 
reflected 
in 
low 
weight-for-age) 
as 
well 
as 
from 
longer-term, 
chronic under-nutrition 
(as 
manifested 
in 
high 
rates 
of 
stunting) 
is 
among 
the 
highest 
in 
the 
world 
and 
600 
to 
700 
children die 
of 
malnutrition-related 
causes 
in 
Bangladesh every 
day. 
The 
social and 
economic 
consequences 
of 
malnutrition 
are 
profound, 
resulting 
in 
human 
misery, 
lost 
productivity 
and 
reduced 
intellectual 
and 
learning 
capacity. 
The 
country 
has made 
impressive 
gains 
in 
reducing 
malnutrition 
rates 
during 
the last 
15 
years. 
The 
decline 
in 
rates 
of 
underweight 
and 
stunted 
children 
has 
been 
especially 
steep 
since the 
early 
1990s. 
For 
instance, 
between 
1992 
and 
2000, 
stunting 
rates 
dropped 
from 
64 
percent 
to 
49 
percent, 
implying 
an 
annual decline 
of 
3.3 
percent. 
The 
wasting 
rate 
fell 
even 
faster 
- 
from 
17 
percent 
in 
1992 
to 
12 
percent 
in 
2000, 
equivalent 
to 
an 
annual decline 
of 
4.3 
percent.

A 
recent 
World 
Bank nutrition 
sector paper, 
Bangladesh: 
Breaking 
the 
Malnutrition 
Barrier, 
estimated the current 
cost 
of 
malnutrition 
at 
$1 
billion 
annually.

Recent 
survey 
(2000 
HIES) 
show 
an encouraging 
finding 
is 
that 
the 
targeting 
of 
the 
poor 
with 
prenatal 
care 
and 
immunization 
services 
has 
been 
so 
successful that the 
poor 
are 
just 
as 
likely 
as 
the 
non- 
poor to 
use 
both 
services. 
However, 
the 
impact 
of 
government-provided 
health 
services 
is 
limited 
because 
of 
low 
utilization 
rates 
for 
most 
services. 
On 
average, 
only 
2 
percent 
of 
urban 
and 
1.7 
percent 
of 
rural 
residents 
visited 
government 
providers 
for 
curative 
care 
in 
the 
30 
days 
preceding 
the 
survey, 
possibly 
because 
the 
efficiency 
of 
government 
services 
is 
also 
limited 
due 
to 
private 
practices 
of 
govemment 
doctors. 
The 
utilization 
rates 
of 
government  doctors 
in 
private 
practice, 
particularly 
by 
the 
non-poor, 
exceed 
the 
rate at 
which public 
health facilities 
are 
used. 
28. 
Public health 
expenditures 
play 
important 
redistributive 
role. Outlays 
for child 
care 
and 
prenatal 
care 
benefit 
the 
poor 
the 
most, 
in 
large 
part 
because 
poor 
households 
tend 
to 
have 
more 
children. 
The 
benefit 
incidence 
analysis 
of 
public 
expenditures 
on 
health 
conducted 
in 
parallel 
with 
that 
of 
education 
expenditures shows that 
the 
share 
of 
all 
public 
health 
expenditures 
accruing 
to 
the 
poor 
is 
an estimated 
45 
percent, 
while 
their 
share 
in 
the 
population 
is 
50 
percent, 
and their 
share 
in 
the 
overall 
income 
is 
an 
estimated 
26 
percent 
(Table 
F.5). 
Such 
a 
distribution 
of 
health 
expenditures reduces 
inequality 
and 
adds 
proportionally 
more 
to 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
poor. 
In 
fact, 
health 
subsidy 
represents 
1.45 
percent 
of 
the 
average 
per 
capita 
expenditure 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
0.8 
percent 
of 
the 
non-poor.. 
Allocations 
to 
Limited 
Curative 
Care 
show 
the 
most 
unequal distribution, 
with 
the 
poorest 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
having 
considerably 
lower 
access 
to 
the 
subsidy 
compared 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
population.

Comparing distributions 
of 
health 
spending 
in 
Bangladesh 
with 
those 
in 
other 
counties 
provides 
a 
benchmark 
for 
judging 
program 
success. 
Bangladesh has 
a 
more pro-poor 
distribution 
than 
Ghana, 
which 
shows 
a 
highly 
inequitable 
distribution, 
and Vietnam, 
which 
shows subsidies 
to 
both 
inpatient 
and 
outpatient 
care 
favoring wealthier 
groups. 
However, 
Bangladesh lags 
behind 
Malaysia, 
where 
inpatient 
public 
services were  accessible 
to 
the 
poor 
as 
early 
as 
1984. 
The 
country 
does 
better than 
India 
in 
reaching 
the 
low-income 
population 
with 
health 
subsidies 
for 
curative 
care. 
An 
important 
caveat, 
though, 
is 
that Bangladesh, 
like 
its 
neighbor, 
has 
limited 
success 
in 
reaching 
the 
poorest 
of 
the 
poor 
with 
curative 
care 
subsidies-only 
11 
percent 
of 
which 
in 
all 
accrue 
to 
the poorest 
fifth 
of 
the 
population. 
30. 
One reason that 
poor 
households’ 
share 
of 
public 
health 
subsidies 
is 
not 
greater 
may be 
related 
to 
the 
fees 
required 
for 
service. Fees charged 
in 
government 
facilities 
do 
not 
represent 
a large 
burden 
for 
poor 
households, 
but 
informal 
fees 
required 
in 
the 
same 
facilities 
are 
comparable 
to 
or 
even 
higher 
than 
the 
official 
ones. 
A 
second 
reason 
may be 
related 
to 
government 
doctors’ 
conducting 
a 
private 
practice 
in 
which 
they 
charge 
fees 
substantially 
above  those 
for 
services 
in 
other 
types 
of 
facilities, 
including 
private. 
If 
these 
private 
consultations 
take 
place 
during 
official work 
hours, 
or 
if 
public 
equipment and 
Page  98
Annex 
F 
PagelOof17 
supplies 
are 
diverted 
for 
private 
practice, 
access 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
public 
health 
care 
expenditures 
is 
naturally 
reduced. 
Public 
Policies 
31. 
There 
is 
broad 
agreement among  the 
GOB, 
donors, 
NGOs, 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
on 
the 
priorities 
of 
health 
policy. 
This 
policy 
supported 
by 
sustained 
increases 
in 
resources 
emphasizes 
rural 
primary 
care 
and 
family 
planning.45 Bangladesh’s 
national health program 
has over 
the 
years focused 
on 
provision 
of 
affordable 
rural 
primary 
health 
care 
(through 
Upazila 
Health 
Complexes 
and 
Union 
Health 
and 
Family 
Welfare 
Centers) 
and 
on 
developing 
partnerships 
with 
NGOs. 
The  latter 
has 
been 
an 
extremely 
important 
source 
of 
Bangladesh’s 
successes, 
especially 
in 
the 
area 
of 
family 
planning 
and 
immunization 
services. 
Historically, 
most 
promotional 
services have been 
supplied 
by 
NGOs. 
They 
are 
credited 
for popularizing 
ORT 
for 
diarrhea, use 
of 
contraceptives, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
providing 
services 
in 
nutrition, and 
tuberculosis 
(TB) 
and 
leprosy 
management, 
mainly 
under contract 
from 
the 
government. 
Immunization program 
implemented 
in 
a collaborative 
framework 
expanded 
from 
covering 
less 
than 
1 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
in 
1981 
to 
over 
90 
percent 
in 
the early 
1990s. 
More 
recently 
NGOs 
became 
increasingly  active 
in 
promoting 
behavioral 
changes 
to 
reduce 
the 
spread 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
and 
they 
are 
increasingly 
being 
commissioned 
by 
the 
government 
to 
provide primary 
and 
community-based 
health- 
care 
and 
nutrition 
services. 
Given 
the 
limited 
amount 
of 
government 
resources devoted 
to 
health 
(around 
US$ 
3.6 
per 
year, 
per 
capita), 
the 
private 
sector 
plays 
a large 
role 
in 
provision 
and 
financing 
of 
health 
services. 
The 
largest 
group 
of 
providers 
are 
qualified 
and 
unqualified 
drug 
retailers, 
who 
serve 
the 
dual 
purpose 
of 
prescribing 
and 
selling 
drugs, 
and 
accounted 
for 
almost 
half 
of 
the 
value 
of 
all 
health 
services 
provided 
in 
1997 
32. 
In 
1998 
GOB 
adopted 
a 
new 
donor-supported 
approach 
to 
health 
service 
delivery 
called 
the 
Health 
and 
Population 
Sector 
Program 
(HPSP) 
which 
brought 
about 
major 
structural 
reforms 
in 
the 
sector.. 
The 
program 
implementation 
plan 
prepared 
for 
the 
HPSP 
estimated 
its 
cost at 
US$3.2 
billion 
between 
1998-2003 
of 
which 
US$900 
million 
was 
to be 
provided 
by 
the development partners. 
HPSP 
represents 
a 
shift 
from 
a 
project 
to 
a 
program 
approach 
and involves 
extensive 
policy 
and 
structural 
reform. 
It 
focuses 
on 
delivering 
an Essential Services Package 
(ESP) 
and 
envisages 
the 
following reform 
actions: 
. 
unification 
of 
the 
bifurcated

Family 
Planning 
service 
delivery 
structure;46 
shift 
to 
provision

Expanded 
Program

Immunization 
(EPI)

clinics 
and 
establishing

reorganizing 
the 
Directorates and 
the 
Ministry 
through 
a 
redefinition 
of 
roles, 
responsibilities 
and accountabilities 
(especially 
developing 
an 
integrated 
support services 
focusing 
on 
human 
resource 
management, 
development 
and

management 
information 
systems;

and 
procurement); 
. 
450ver 
the 
period 
1975-1998, 
health 
and 
population 
system 
development 
has 
been 
undertaken 
by 
GOB 
and 
its 
development 
partners 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
large number 
of 
projects (called: 
Pop-1;  Pop-2;  Pop-3; 
and, 
FPHP). 
The 
Fourth 
Population 
and 
Health 
Project 
(FPHP), 
provided 
support 
to 
virtually 
all 
aspects 
of 
health 
and 
family 
welfare: 
in 
this 
sense, 
it 
was 
a 
sector 
project, 
unlike 
its 
predecessors 
that had 
emphasized 
population 
issues. 
There 
were 
eleven co-financiers, 
and 
additional 
parallel 
support 
was 
provided 
by 
other 
donors, 
including 
UN 
technical 
agencies. 
The 
World 
Bank 
led 
a consortium 
of 
these 
donors. 
46 
The 
MoHFW 
is 
organized 
into 
separate 
Health 
and 
Family 
Planning 
(FP) 
cadres. 
One, 
i.e. 
the 
health 
services 
infrastructure 
and personnel, 
is 
predominantly 
supported 
by 
the 
revenue 
budget, 
while 
the 
other, 
FP, 
is 
mostly 
supported 
from 
the 
development 
budget.

It 
was 
designed 
to 
constitute 
60-70 
percent 
of 
the 
combined health 
budget. 
The 
delivery 
of 
ESP was envisaged 
through facilities 
at Thana

below 
including 
the 
construction 
of 
13,500 
“one

period. 
A 
mechanism 
for 
expanded 
community participation 
in 
management and 
funding 
of 
these 
community 
clinics 
was 
envisaged 
under 
the 
HPSP. 
Some 
services 
were planned 
to 
be 
delivered 
through 
specialized 
NGOs. 
With 
respect 
to 
hospital

an 
especially 
important 
element 
was 
to 
make 
the

referral

The 
shift 
in 
budget 
management 
from 
a 
project  to 
a  programmatic 
approach 
35. 
Health 
expenditures 
declined 
in 
real 
terms 
between 
1997 and 
2001, 
largely 
due 
to 
deficiencies 
in 
the 
procurement 
system, 
and 
increased 
in 
200 
1-02 
to 
1997-98 
level, 
according 
to 
Health 
Economics 
Unit 
(HEU) 
of 
MoHFW 
analysis. 
Over 
1993-200 
1 
while 
the 
budget 
allocations 
to 
health 
continued 
to 
increase, 
since 
1997/98 actual 
expenditures 
declined 
both 
in 
real 
per-capita 
terms 
(see 
Figure 
F.l) 
and 
as 
a 
share 
of 
GDP. 
Total 
spending 
in 
1999/2000 was 
only 
84 
percent 
of 
the 
orignal

This 
expenditure 
under-run, 
which 
is 
mostly 
in

is 
largely 
the 
result

In

1, 
there was 
a 
significant improvement 
in 
financial 
performance, 
due 
largely 
to 
MoHFW’s 
better procurement performance. 
Nevertheless, 
this 
improvement 
has 
only 
brought

Progress 
with 
Reform 
Measures 
36. 
After 
four 
and 
a 
half 
years there 
is 
good 
progress 
on 
most 
important indicators 
of 
improved 
health 
outcomes. HPSP approach 
allowed 
for 
prioritization 
of 
expenditure 
within 
the 
resource 
framework 
for 
the 
MOHFW 
and 
secured 
allocation 
for 
cost 
effective 
programs especially 
those 
which primarily 
benefit 
children, 
women and 
the 
poor. 
This 
program 
approach 
reduced considerably the transaction 
costs 
of 
both 
the 
MoHFW 
and the 
Development 
Partners. Several 
important 
policy 
objectives 
of 
HPSP, 
such 
as 
focusing 
resources 
on 
ESP, 
directing 
resources 
to 
facilities 
located 
close 
to 
users, 
and 
limiting 
the wage 
bill, 
have 
been 
achieved. 
There 
were 
other 
notable 
areas 
of

was 
a 
substantial 
reform 
agenda 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
public 
service 
provision. The 
reform 
agenda 
included 
de-concentration 
of 
line 
authority 
to 
district 
and 
health 
facility 
level, 
merger 
of 
the 
two 
separate 
wings 
of 
the 
service 
delivery 
system, 
reform 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
system, 
adoption 
of 
a 
pro-poor 
agenda, 
development 
and 
integration 
of 
gender 
equity 
concems 
and 
institutionalization 
of 
stakeholder 
participation 
and 
community 
oversight 
of 
the 
program. 
Good 
preparatory 
work 
has 
been 
done 
but 
most reforms 
are 
yet 
to 
be 
completed. 
The 
current 
phase 
of 
HPSP 
ends 
in 
2003 
and 
the 
Govemment 
and 
the 
consortium 
of 
donors 
are 
presently 
discussing 
an  action 
plan 
for 
the 
next 
phase 
of 
HPSP. 
The 
Government 
is 
concemed 
about 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
and 
is 
having 
second thoughts  about  the 
unification 
of 
health 
and 
family 
planning 
services. 
Donors 
are 
concemed 
about 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
reform 
agenda (agreed 
under 
the  current 
phase 
of 
HPSP), 
and 
about  delays 
in 
scaling 
up 
nutrition 
programs, 
restructuring 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
prevention 
project, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
lack 
of 
accommodation 
of 
arsenic 
related activities 
within 
the HPSP. 
Despite 
that, 
in 
its 
Conceptual 
Framework 
for 
the 
next 
phase 
of 
the 
program, 
the 
Govemment 
has 
clearly 
stated 
its 
intention 
to 
continue 
the 
sector-wide 
programmatic 
approach 
in 
the 
sector, 
to 
include 
both 
nutrition 
and urban health 
services under 
the 
framework, 
commission 
a 
full 
review 
of 
operational 
strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
of 
PHSP, 
and 
implement 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
review. 
Key 
sector 
issues 
38. 
Despite 
this 
relatively 
strong 
record, 
there 
are 
still 
numerous 
gaps 
in 
health 
outcomes. 
Bangladesh 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
achieve 
some 
MDGs: 
(i) 
at 
392 
per 
100,000 
maternal 
mortality 
rate 
is 
among 
the 
highest 
outside 
of 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa 
- 
this 
is 
due 
mainly 
to 
low 
level 
of 
clinic 
delivery 
(95 
percent 
of 
deliveries 
take 
place 
at 
home), 
and 
insufficient 
number 
of 
trained 
mid-wives; 
and 
(ii) 
despite 
increasing 
use 
of 
contraceptives, 
the 
total 
fertility 
rate 
(TFR) 
has 
been 
stagnating 
around 
3.2 
percent 
for 
the 
last 
5-6 
years-this 
is 
due, 
in 
part, 
to 
insufficient diversification 
of 
available 
modem 
contraceptives 
and 
their 
irregular 
use. 
Another 
MDG-child 
malnutrition-remains 
a 
challenge. 
A 
first 
generation 
of 
strategic goals 
in 
reducing 
malnutrition 
has 
been 
achieved 
in 
Bangladesh. 
This 
includes 
the 
generation 
of 
high 
level 
of 
policy 
support, 
development 
of 
a programmatic 
approach 
and 
evolution 
of 
conducive 
structures 
in 
the 
health 
and 
food policy 
arena. 
While 
future economic 
growth 
will 
provide 
strong impetus 
for 
continued reductions 
in 
malnutrition, 
it 
is 
most 
likely 
that 
achievement 
of 
this 
MDG 
goal 
will 
require 
additional 
interventions, 
which, 
inter 
alia 
should 
include 
improvements 
in 
access 
to 
clean 
water, 
currently 
threatened 
by 
such contaminants 
as 
arsenic 
and 
pathogens. 
Future 
interventions  should 
also 
build 
on 
the 
success 
of 
BINP 
to 
expand coverage 
of 
nutrition 
programs. 
There 
are 
other 
lingering 
problems 
such 
as: 
low 
birth 
weight, 
and persistence 
of 
infectious 
diseases. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
emerging 
additional 
burden 
of 
arsenic 
poisoning, 
there 
are serious 
challenges associated 
with 
the 
changing 
disease 
pattems. 
Besides 
the 
shortfalls 
in 
health 
outcomes, 
substantial 
inequalities between 
poor 
and 
nonpoor 
persist 
in 
many health 
indicators, especially 
regarding 
child 
health. 
39. 
There 
are 
three 
institutional 
problems 
in 
the 
health 
care 
system, 
which 
if 
not 
addressed, 
will 
seriously 
inhibit 
GOB’S ability 
to 
address 
the 
increasing 
health 
needs 
of 
the 
pop~lation.~~ 
These 
problems 
47 
There 
is 
also 
growing 
perception 
of 
increasing 
corruption 
in 
health 
service 
delivery.  Doctors 
as 
well 
as 
the 
public 
are 
very 
vocal 
about 
systemic 
corruption 
regarding 
procurement, 
registration 
of 
clinics, 
appointment, posting, 
and 
promotion 
of 
medical 
professionals, 
the 
provision 
of 
medicine 
and supplies. 
Even after 
admission, 
extra 
payments 
are 
routine 
aspects 
of 
treatment 
whether 
in 
Govemment 
or 
private 
facilities 
Another 
set 
of 
problems 
pertains to 
the 
rigidities 
in 
budget management and 
duality 
of  health 
budget 
leading 
to 
sub-optimal 
geographic 
allocation 
rules 
and 
imbalances between 
recurrent 
and 
development 
expenditures.

of

pertain 
to 
(i) 
slow 
progress 
of 
HPSP implementation; 
(ii) 
the 
lack 
of 
efficiency 
in 
the 
public 
sector; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
ill-defined 
role 
of 
the 
non-public 
sector. 
40. 
Implementation 
of 
HPSP 
has 
been 
slow 
and 
public 
expenditure 
on 
health 
fell 
in 
real 
per 
capita 
terms 
and 
as 
a 
share 
of 
total 
government expenditure 
during 
the 
first 
three 
years, 
only 
rising 
in 
the 
fourth 
year 
to 
pre-HPSP 
levels. 
The consumption 
of 
ESP 
services 
falls 
well 
behind 
the 
HPSP 
target 
of 
80 
per 
cent 
coverage. 
With 
the 
exception 
of 
maternal 
care, 
there 
is 
no 
evidence that 
HPSP 
has 
generated 
increases 
in 
health 
service 
volume 
or 
improvements 
in 
quality 
or 
efficiency 
at the 
provider level.  The 
following 
aspects 
of 
HPSP need 
strengthening: 
. 
. 
Poverty 
and 
gender 
related 
actions 
have 
yet 
to 
appear 
in 
Annual 
Operational 
Plans 
although 
important analytical 
work 
is 
being 
done 
by 
HEU 
and 
this 
issue 
is 
emphasized 
in 
the 
H"SP. 
Although 
important 
preparatory 
work 
has 
been 
done, 
none 
of 
the 
reforms planned 
under 
HPSP 
have 
been 
implemented 
to 
the 
full 
extent. 
This 
places the 
durability 
of 
preparatory 
work 
in 
jeopardy and vigorous 
implementation 
of 
HPSP 
reforms 
is 
needed. 
The 
development 
of 
procurement 
functions 
in 
MoHFW 
should 
proceed 
with 
utmost urgency. 
Strategies  and  mechanisms 
for 
engaging 
non-government 
providers 
especially 
in 
such 
important 
areas 
as 
BCC 
and 
HIV-AIDS 
should 
be 
further 
developed 
and 
implemented. 
Flow 
of 
financial 
information 
has 
been 
significantly 
improved, 
but 
management 
information 
system 
in 
the 
sector 
need 
further 
strengthening. 
. 
. 
41. 
Productivity 
of 
Thana 
and 
union 
facilities 
is 
very 
low 
by 
international 
standards. 
Poor 
facility 
management, 
sub-optimal 
location 
and 
staffing 
of 
facilities, 
as 
well 
as 
doctor 
absenteeism 
and 
inadequate 
provision 
of 
medical 
supplies, 
lead 
to 
low 
quality 
and 
hence 
low 
attendance 
rates 
and 
low 
productivity 
and 
high 
unit 
costs 
of 
these 
facilities 
in 
comparison 
to 
other large 
low-income 
countries. 
This 
situation 
is 
particularly 
worrisome 
since 
these 
facilities 
attract 
the 
bulk 
of 
resources, 
and 
represent 
the 
backbone 
of 
health 
service 
delivery. 
One 
of 
the 
reasons 
for 
low 
productivity 
is 
that government 
clinicians 
have weak 
incentives 
to 
increase 
their 
productivity 
in 
government work, 
since 
they 
can 
sell 
their 
services 
to 
private 
clients. 
42. 
Little 
progress 
in 
improving 
efficient mobilization 
of 
private 
providers 
has 
been 
achieved. 
Given 
the 
deep 
penetration 
of 
private health providers 
in 
the 
health 
market 
and 
large 
volume 
of 
private 
health 
spending, 
the issue 
of 
regulation, 
and 
enforcement 
of 
quality and 
standards 
becomes essential 
to 
ensure 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
private 
spending. 
PUBLIC 
SOCIAL 
SAFETY 
NET 
PROGRAMS 
Progress 
in 
reducing vulnerability 
43. 
Bangladesh 
has 
moved 
from 
being 
chronically 
in 
food 
deficit 
to 
self-sufficiency 
in 
rice 
production. 
Early 
investments 
in 
agricultural 
research, 
reforms 
in 
inputs 
markets 
(particularly 
for 
fertilizer, 
irrigation 
equipment, 
and 
seeds), 
and 
improvement 
in 
infrastructure 
have 
helped 
spur 
apcultural 
production. The 
government 
has 
privatized 
foodgrain 
distribution, 
lifted 
restrictions 
on 
rice 
and 
wheat 
imports 
by 
private 
traders, 
and 
reduced 
its 
presence 
in 
foodgrain 
markets, 
all 
actions 
that have 
contributed to 
improving 
availability 
and 
diminishing 
deficits 
in 
domestic 
production 
(Ahmed 
et. 
al., 
2000). 
Since 
liberalization 
of 
trade 
in 
the 
early 
nineties, 
private 
sector 
imports 
of 
rice 
have 
on 
several 
occasions 
contributed 
to 
filling 
the 
food availability 
gap 
after 
poor 
rice 
harvests 
(in 
1994-95 
and 
1995- 
96) 
and 
natural 
disasters 
(most 
notably, 
following 
the 
1998 
floods).  Seasonality 
in 
rice 
prices 
is 
also 
much 
reduced, 
a 
consequence 
of 
rapid growth 
in 
dry-season 
boro  rice 
production  and 
improved 
integration 
of 
markets 
in 
different 
regions. 
More 
importantly, 
a recent 
survey (2000 
HIES) 
data 
show that 
Page  102
Annex 
F 
Page14of17 
households 
in 
Bangladesh 
are 
by 
and 
large 
able 
to 
shield 
consumption 
of 
this 
staple  cereal 
from 
fluctuations 
in 
price. 
For 
most 
households, 
no 
significant 
intra-year 
variation 
in 
rice 
consumption 
is 
evident. 
44. 
Over 
the 
years, 
Bangladesh 
has 
also made 
notable 
progress 
in 
its 
capacity 
to 
deal 
with 
natural 
disasters. 
Large 
quantities 
of 
public 
resources 
are 
now 
directed 
to 
water  management, 
holding food 
stocks, 
emergency 
public 
works, 
and 
flood 
protection 
and 
cyclone 
shelters. 
Weather 
monitoring 
and 
early 
waming 
systems 
have 
been 
strengthened, 
and 
improved 
wireless 
operations have 
been 
set 
up 
in 
cyclone 
prone 
areas. 
The 
decline 
in 
numbers 
of 
deaths 
during 
crises 
reflects 
an 
improved 
ability to 
evacuate 
people 
from 
disaster 
zones 
and 
to 
provide 
shelter. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
spread 
of 
defensive 
infrastructure 
such 
as 
coastal 
and 
river 
embankments has 
helped 
to 
mitigate 
the 
impact 
of 
natural 
disasters. 
This 
enhanced 
capability, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
resilience 
of 
its 
people, was 
in 
ample evidence 
during 
the 
country’s 
resolute and 
effective 
response 
in 
1998 
to 
one 
of 
the 
century’s worst floods. 
45. 
Notwithstanding 
these 
successes, 
high 
levels 
of 
poverty 
magnify 
the 
adverse 
effects 
of 
natural 
disasters: 
poor 
people 
and 
poor 
communities 
are 
frequently 
the 
primary 
victims, 
in 
part 
because 
they 
are 
priced 
out 
of 
the 
more  disaster-proof 
areas 
and 
live 
in 
makeshift 
houses 
in 
areas 
with 
low 
quality 
infrastructure. 
In 
addition,  various 
types 
of 
economic 
and non-economic  shocks 
unrelated 
to 
natural 
disasters 
affect 
the 
poor 
disproportionately. 
These 
conditions 
justify 
the 
commitment 
of 
successive 
govemments 
and 
the 
donor 
community 
to 
ensure 
some 
social 
protection 
for 
the 
poor. 
In 
2001-02, 
total 
govemment 
spending 
on 
social 
safety 
net 
programs 
was 
approximately 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP 
and 
5.6 
percent 
of 
total 
govemment 
expenditures. 
Public 
safety 
net 
and 
its 
targeting 
outcomes 
46. 
Bangladesh 
has 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
systems 
of 
targeted transfer 
programs 
in 
the 
world. 
The 
long 
history 
of 
extensive 
social 
safety 
net 
provision, 
testament 
to 
the 
commitment 
of 
successive 
Governments 
to 
a 
minimum 
level 
of 
protection 
in 
the face 
of 
frequent 
natural 
calamities. 
Budgetary 
expenditures 
on 
safety 
net 
programs 
are 
equivalent 
to 
almost 
1 
percent 
of 
GDP, 
95 
percent 
of 
which 
are 
directed towards 
targeted 
food 
transfer programs 
(Table 
F.6). 
Four 
food 
assistance-based 
programs 
(FFW, 
FFE, 
TR, 
VGD) 
aim 
at 
promoting 
human 
capital 
development and creating 
productive 
physical 
assets, 
while 
two 
other 
programs 
(VGF, 
GR) 
aim 
at responding 
to 
the 
calamities-related 
emergency 
needs. 
The 
remaining 
5 
percent 
of 
GOB 
expenditures 
on 
safety 
net 
is 
directed 
towards 
smaller 
programs 
supporting 
the 
elderly, 
orphans, 
and 
widows. 
47. 
A 
number 
of 
evaluation 
studies 
have 
provided 
evidence that 
the 
four 
large 
safety 
net 
program 
(FFE, 
VGD, 
VGF, 
GR) 
are 
reasonably 
well-targeted 
towards 
the 
poor 
and 
those 
affected 
by 
disasters. 
They 
also succeed 
in 
achieving 
their 
developmental objectives. 
Estimates based 
on 
the 2000 
HIES 
data 
show 
that households 
from 
the 
lowest 20 
percent 
of 
the 
income 
distribution 
are 
nearly 
5 
times 
as 
likely 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
FFE 
program relative 
to 
the 
richest 
20 
percent 
of 
the 
population 
(Table 
F.7). 
These 
targeting 
outcomes 
are 
comparable 
to 
performance 
of 
targeted 
programs 
in 
the 
other 
countries. 
In 
addition,  there 
is 
strong evidence 
from 
the 
mid-1990s 
that 
the 
FFE 
program 
achieves 
its 
developmental 
objective 
by 
attracting 
poor 
children 
to 
school 
(Ravallion 
and 
Wodon 
2000). 
Estimates show 
that, 
on 
average, 
participation 
in 
the 
FFE 
program 
increases 
the 
probability 
of 
attending school 
by 
20 
percent. 
Preliminary 
evidence 
from 
the 
2000 
HIES 
shows 
that 
these 
gains 
have been 
sustained.

Two 
main relief 
programs-GR 
and VGF-played 
an important 
role 
in 
assisting 
flood-affected 
households 
during 
the 
massive 
flood 
in 
1998. 
Studies 
by 
International 
Food 
Policy 
Research 
Institute 
(FMRSP-IFPRI) 
suggest 
that 
while 
direct 
distribution 
through 
these 
programs 
was 
quite 
small 
in 
comparison 
to 
private 
imports, they 
played 
an 
invaluable 
role 
in 
targeting 
relief 
to 
those 
in 
need. 
The 
GR 
program, 
for 
example, 
distributed 
more 
than 
74,000 
metric 
tons 
of 
wheat 
and 
rice 
in 
1998-99 and 
only 
1 
1.4 
percent 
of 
GR 
recipients 
were 
not 
directly 
exposed 
to 
floods. 
The 
VGF 
program 
targeted resources 
to 
all 
areas 
(both 
flooded 
and 
non-flood 
affected 
areas) 
of 
the country. 
As 
a 
result, 
whde 
it 
was 
less 
effectively 
targeted 
to flood 
exposure, 
it 
was successful 
at 
reaching 
the 
poor. 
Approximately 
25 
percent 
of 
VGF 
recipients 
were 
not 
directly 
exposed 
to 
the 
flood 
but 
households 
in

The 
development 
impact 
of 
safety 
net 
programs 
is 
severely 
limited 
by 
unacceptably 
high 
administrative 
leakage. 
Recent 
evidence 
indicates that 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
various 
social 
safety 
nets 
is 
significantly 
reduced 
because 
of 
implementation 
problems. 
The 
most 
disturbing 
are 
estimates 
of 
aggregate 
household 
transfers 
to 
the 
VGD, 
VGF 
and 
FFE 
programs 
obtained 
from 
the 
2000 
HIES 
survey. 
The 
Table 
F.8: 
Survey estimate 
of 
accounted 
grain 
as 
percent 
of 
aggregate 
program 
allocation 
3urvey 
(HIES) 
administrative 
leakages 
in 
these 
three 
programs 
appear 
large, 
with 
20-70  percent 
of 
the 
aggregate 
program 
allocation 
not 
being 
accounted 
for 
in 
the  survey 
estimates:  35 
percent 
of 
the 
food 
grains 
allocated 
to 
the 
VGF, 
41 
percent 
of 
the 
VGD, 
and 
an overwhelming 
75 
percent 
of 
allocations 
to 
the 
FFE 
appear 
not 
to reach 
any 
household, 
intended 
or 
unintended 
beneficiaries, 
(see 
Table 
F.8). 
What 
is 
particularly 
worrisome 
is 
that 
similar 
calculations 
for 
the 
FFE 
program 
using 
the  1995-96 
HES 
reveal 
substantially 
lower 
discrepancy, 
indicating 
that problems 
of 
leakage 
have 
deteriorated 
over 
the 
last 
five 
years. 
In 
this 
context, any conclusions about the effectiveness 
and targeting 
efficiency 
of 
these 
programs 
based 
on 
the 
incidence 
analysis presented 
earlier 
must 
be 
balanced 
against 
these 
findings. 
Progress 
with 
reform 
measures 
50. 
Recognizing 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
governance 
of 
safety 
net 
programs, 
the 
Government 
has, 
with 
effect 
from 
July 
1, 
2002, 
discontinued 
FFEP 
and 
replaced 
it 
by 
an expanded 
PESP, 
which 
is 
a 
cash 
stipend 
program 
for 
primary 
school 
students. 
Under 
this 
new 
program, 
the 
bottom 
40 
percent 
poor 
families 
in 
rural 
areas 
will 
get 
a 
cash 
stipend 
of 
Tk.lOO 
per 
month 
if 
they 
are 
sending 
one 
child 
to 
primary 
schools 
and 
Tk.125 
per 
month 
if 
they 
are 
sending 
more 
than 
one 
child. 
Total 
number 
of 
likely 
beneficiaries 
is 
estimated 
at 
7 
million 
children 
and the 
program 
is 
likely 
to 
cost about 
$150 
million 
annually. 
The 
net 
additional burden 
on 
the 
budget 
as 
a 
result 
of 
this 
program 
is 
estimated at about 
$35-40 
million 
annually. 
Experience 
from 
the Government’s 
female 
stipends 
program 
in 
secondary education, 
which 
is 
operated 
on 
a 
cash 
basis, 
suggests 
that 
the 
problems 
of 
leakage 
in 
managing 
cash stipends 
are 
lower, 
although 
this 
will 
need 
to 
be 
monitored 
carefully. 
5 
1. 
The 
Government 
is 
determined 
to 
continue 
supporting 
the 
secondary education 
of 
girls 
and 
has 
recently 
extended 
the 
female 
stipends 
program 
to 
Class 
12, 
with 
effect 
from 
January 2002. 
The 
program 
will 
be 
targeted 
to 
those 
girls 
that 
secure 
45 
percent 
or 
more 
in 
the Secondary 
School 
Certificate 
(SSC) 
examination. 
They 
will 
receive a 
monthly 
stipend 
of 
Tk.65, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
exemption 
of 
tuition 
fees. 
The 
cost 
of 
this 
extension 
is 
estimated at 
US$9 
million. 
Over 
the 
medium 
term, 
Government intends 
to 
assess 
the 
results 
of 
the 
targeting 
pilots 
that 
are 
being 
implemented 
and 
introduce 
a 
nationwide 
targeted 
stipend 
and 
tuition 
program 
for 
secondary female 
students. 
The 
Government 
is 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
monetizing 
the 
Food-for-Work 
(FFW) 
program, 
with 
about 
18 
1,000 
tons 
being 
monetized 
in 
FY03 
so 
far. 
Key 
sector issues 
52. 
Improved 
administration 
of 
the safety 
net 
programs rather than 
their 
expansion 
is 
the 
main policy 
imperative 
and 
would 
yield 
considerable gains 
in 
enhancing 
effectiveness 
of 
government-provided social 
protection. 
Actions to 
reduce 
leakage 
are 
(i) 
strengthening 
the 
administrative 
systems 
for 
the 
monitoring 
of 
expenditures 
(e.g., 
internal 
and  independent 
external 
audits,  strengthening 
participation 
of 
local 
bodies), 
and 
(ii) 
increasing 
public 
access 
to 
information 
(e.g., 
Client 
Satisfaction 
Surveys, 
Participatory 
Monitoring 
and Evaluation, 
Public 
Expenditure 
Trackmg 
Surveys). 
Page  105
Annex 
F 
Page17ofl7 
53. 
There 
are 
other 
innovative 
program 
design features that 
may 
be 
considered 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
accountability 
while 
minimizing 
transaction 
costs. 
For 
instance, 
Smart Cards 
have been 
used 
in 
many 
countries 
to 
reduce 
administrative 
costs 
and 
the 
possibility 
of 
error 
and 
fraud 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
various 
 service^.^' 
Leakage 
in 
the 
Rural 
Maintenance Program 
(RMP) 
- 
a 
cash-for-work program 
employing 
rural 
women 
for 
road 
maintenance 
- 
is 
also 
believed 
to 
be 
very 
low 
because 
of 
the 
unique 
wage 
payment 
system. 
Salaries 
for 
each 
road 
maintenance association 
are 
paid 
by 
a 
bank 
transfer 
every 
two 
weeks 
directly 
into 
a 
maintenance 
crew bank 
account  that 
is 
operated 
by 
the  elected representative 
of 
the 
workers. 
Potential 
for 
leakage 
is 
minimized 
since 
certification 
by 
officials 
is 
not 
required 
to 
withdraw 
payments, 
in 
addition to 
which 
involvement 
of 
local 
govemment 
officials 
and 
NGOs 
like CARE 
helps 
introduce 
checks and balances 
into 
the 
system and 
thus 
improve 
accountability. 
48 
Experience 
with 
smart cards 
has 
been 
growing. 
Some notable 
examples 
are 
the 
Swazi 
Business 
Growth 
Trust 
in 
Swaziland 
and 
the 
Swayam 
Krishi 
Sangam 
- 
a 
Grameen 
Replication 
program 
in 
Andhra 
Pradesh 
that 
provide 
loans 
to 
small 
farmers 
and 
women, 
respectively. 
Other 
examples 
abound 
in 
India: 
Kerala 
is 
piloting 
the 
use 
of 
the technology 
as 
ration 
cards; 
members 
of 
a 
women’s 
milk 
co-operative society 
in 
rural 
Rajasthan 
have been 
using this 
technology 
to 
maintain their 
milk 
delivery 
and 
payment 
records; 
and 
Amul 
uses 
the 
cards 
to 
store 
details 
of 
milk 
transactions 
from 
farmers 
to 
the co-operative.

AGRICULTURE 
AND 
RURAL DEVELOPMENT4’ 
Overview 
1. 
Despite 
rapid 
urbanization 
in 
the 
last 
decade, 
the 
rural 
sector 
still 
harbors 
80 
percent 
of 
the 
population. 
Agriculture 
remains 
the 
mainstay 
of 
Bangladesh economy 
contributing 
about 
25 
percent 
of 
the 
country’s 
GDP 
and 
employing 
about 
63 
percent 
of 
its 
labor 
force. 
Agricultural 
production 
is 
dominated 
by 
crops 
with 
rice 
covering 
about 75 percent 
of 
cultivated 
land 
and 
contributing 
14 percent 
to 
total 
GDP. 
Fisheries 
currently 
contributes 
6 
percent 
of 
GDP 
with 
marine 
capture 
accounting 
for 
more 
than 
half 
of 
fish 
production 
in 
the 
country, 
but 
inland 
culture 
fisheries 
(shrimp 
and 
pond 
fisheries) 
providing 
an 
important 
source 
of 
export 
earning. 
After 
several 
decades 
of 
slow 
growth 
(1.6-2.8 
percent 
per 
year), 
agricultural 
value 
added 
grew 
at 
4.7 
percent 
per 
year 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
the 
1990s 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
acceleration 
in 
food 
grain 
production 
(6.6 
percent 
per 
year 
in 
1995-00) 
and consistently 
high 
growth 
in 
the 
fisheries 
sub-sector (8-9 percent 
in 
the 
1990-00). 
The 
rural 
non-farm 
(RNF) 
sector, 
which 
produced 
about 28 
percent 
of 
GDP 
in 
1995-96, has 
grown 
at 
a 
compound 
rate 
of 
7 
percent 
a 
year 
during 
1991-96 
allowing 
for 
employment 
growth 
of 
2.6 
percent 
a 
year (compared 
to 
1 
percent 
employment 
growth 
in 
agriculture). 
This 
reflected 
sustained expansion 
in 
services 
and 
small 
scale 
manufacturing. 
2. 
Productivity-led 
acceleration 
of 
agricultural 
production, 
diversification 
within 
and 
outside 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
development 
of 
rural 
infrastructure  and 
import 
liberalization policies 
have 
greatly 
transformed 
the 
rural 
economy. Three 
major 
outcomes 
of 
this 
transformation 
include: 
(i) 
elimination 
of 
famines 
and 
attaining 
food 
grain 
self-sufficiency 
(ii) 
decline 
in 
income 
poverty 
and 
(iii) 
containment 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
natural 
disasters. 
Public 
Spending 
and 
Policies 
3. 
GOB 
policies 
have 
traditionally 
emphasized the 
development 
of 
the 
rural 
economy 
as 
a 
means 
to 
alleviate 
poverty 
and 
contain 
the 
impact 
of 
natural 
calamities. 
In 
the 
early 
1970s 
and 
1980s, 
broad 
agriculture 
sector 
claimed 
over 
30 
percent 
of 
all 
public 
 investment^.^' 
Since the 
late 
1980s, 
there have 
been noticeable improvements 
in 
the 
policy 
framework 
for rural 
and 
agricultural 
development, 
namely 
the 
previous 
emphasis 
on 
direct market 
interventions 
and 
large 
capital 
spending 
on 
flood 
control, 
irrigation 
and 
drainage 
projects 
has 
been 
replaced 
by 
a 
strategy based 
on 
human 
resource development and 
market- 
oriented 
agricultural 
growth 
to 
develop  the 
rural 
economy. 
Consequently 
while 
most 
of 
public 
expenditures focused 
on 
broad 
agricultural 
development 
in 
the 
1980s 
(with 
relatively 
low 
emphasis 
on 
rural 
infrastructure), 
the 
Government today 
allocates 
a 
larger 
share 
of 
expenditures 
on 
education 
and 
rural 
infrastructure-roads 
and electricity-to 
achieve 
the 
above 
objective 
(Table 
Gl). 
49 
This 
Annex 
draws 
heavily 
on 
Bangladesh 
Public 
Expenditure Review, 
joint 
report 
by 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
Asian 
Development 
Bank 
2002. 
Public 
expenditures 
in 
agriculture 
are 
classified 
in 
narrow 
(traditional) 
and 
broad 
definitions. 
Narrow 
definition 
of 
agriculture 
includes 
crop, 
forestry, 
food 
marketing, 
fisheries 
and 
livestock. 
Broad definition 
in 
addition 
includes 
rural 
infrastructure, 
institutions, 
flood 
control 
and 
water 
resources.

Because 
of 
the 
highly 
disaster-prone 
environment 
in 
Bangladesh, 
the 
government 
continuously 
maintained 
high 
level 
of 
disaster-mitigation 
expenditures 
as 
a 
means 
to 
protect 
the 
population. 
Due 
to 
Bangladesh’s 
topology 
- 
the 
flow 
of 
the 
Ganges, 
the 
Brahmaputra and 
the Meghna, 
in 
a 
flat 
delta 
plain-- 
the 
biggest 
problem 
in 
disaster management 
is 
flood 
management 
and 
drainage 
in 
the 
wet 
season. 
Consequently, large 
amounts 
of 
public 
resources 
(0.6 
percent 
of 
GDP) 
are 
directed 
to 
(i) 
water management 
control, especially 
drainage; 
(ii) 
holding 
food 
stocks; 
(iii) 
emergency 
relief; 
and 
(iv) 
flood 
protection 
and 
cyclone 
shelters. 
Expenditures 
on 
disaster, 
and 
flood 
management 
in 
particular, 
are 
implemented 
through 
various 
line 
ministries. 
The 
largest 
allocation 
is 
made 
to 
water 
management 
and 
flood 
control, 
drainage 
and 
erosion control, 
whch 
constitutes 
25 
percent 
of 
broad 
agnculture expenditure (Table 
G. 
1). 
Also 
a 
significant 
part 
of 
the 
government’s one 
million 
tons 
food 
stock 
is 
intended 
for 
emergency 
relief. 
The 
long-term impact 
of 
sustained 
levels 
of 
expenditures 
in 
ths 
area, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
improved 
environment 
of 
cooperation 
with 
NGOs, 
is 
that today 
the 
sensitivity 
of 
both 
agricultural 
and 
non-agricultural 
sector 
components 
of 
GDP 
to 
natural 
disasters 
has 
declined dramatically. 
5. 
Weather 
monitoring 
and early 
warning 
systems 
have been 
strengthened. 
The 
ability 
to 
evacuate 
people 
from 
disaster 
zones 
and 
to 
provide 
shelter 
has 
improved. The 
1998 
flood 
was unprecedented 
in 
its 
scale 
and 
duration, 
especially 
in 
the 
central 
part 
of 
Bangladesh. 
Despite 
the 
scale 
of 
damage, 
no 
major 
shortages 
of 
food 
items 
were reported 
at 
any 
time 
throughout 
the 
flood 
period, and 
households were 
by 
and large 
able 
to 
maintain 
consumption levels. Also, 
the  1998 
flood 
inflicted 
a 
far 
lower 
death 
toll 
(1,100 
fatalities) 
compared 
to 
an 
estimated 
staggering 
138,000 
deaths 
during 
the  1991 cyclone, 
an 
estimated 
2,055 
deaths 
during 
the 
1987 
flood, 
and 
an estimated 
2,000-6,500 
fatalities 
during 
the 
1988 
floods (Pantelic et 
al, 
2000).” 
Disaster-coping 
mechanisms 
at  the 
micro  level 
are 
also 
much 
stronger  today. 
6. 
A 
number 
of 
other strategic 
policies 
accompanied 
and 
facilitated 
public 
and private 
investments 
in 
rural 
development 
and 
allowed for 
shifts 
in 
public 
expenditures. 
Input 
market 
reform, 
import 
and 
tax 
policies 
and 
strategic 
partnership 
with 
NGOs, 
played 
a  substantial 
supporting 
role

Bangladesh’s 
agricultural 
transition. 
Liberalization 
of 
input markets 
7. 
Bangladesh 
is 
among 
the 
few 
developing 
countries  that  have  considerably 
liberalized 
seed 
policy. 
In 
1984-85, the 
private 
sector 
was 
allowed 
to 
import 
seed. 
Liberalization 
of 
seed 
policy 
proceeded 
further 
in 
1992 
with 
liberalization 
in 
procurement 
of 
imports (including 
seeds 
of 
notified 
crops) 
and

(including

institutes). 
The 
“Seed 
Act” 
was 
revised 
in 
1997 
to 
allow for 
import 
of 
vegetable 
seeds 
without 
testing 
and 
for 
reducing 
testing 
period for imported 
seeds 
of 
notified 
crops 
to 
two 
years. 
8. 
The fertilizer market 
was also 
liberalized 
starting 
from 
early 
1980s 
and gradually, 
by 
the 
early 
1990s, 
all 
aspects 
of 
fertilizer 
marketing including 
imports 
were 
placed 
in 
the 
private 
sector. 
Production 
of 
urea and 
pricing 
of 
urea 
at the 
factory 
gate 
continued 
to 
remain 
in 
public 
domain. 
Unfortunately, 
however, 
during 
a 
drastic 
shortage 
in 
1995, 
extensive 
controls 
were 
introduced 
in 
the 
urea 
marketing 
and 
distribution 
process, 
and 
subsidies 
on 
urea 
sales 
from 
the 
factories 
and 
sales 
of 
public 
sector urea 
imports 
were 
largely 
revived. 
Economic 
subsidy 
on 
urea 
distribution 
calculated 
based 
on 
comparing 
ex-factory 
with 
import 
parity 
prices amount 
to 
about 
Tk7 
billion 
annually 
in 
recent 
years. 
The 
brunt 
of 
the 
urea 
fertilizer 
subsidy 
is 
bome 
by 
the 
gas 
industry 
through 
low 
gas 
prices 
charged 
to 
urea 
factories 
and 
only 
small 
budgetary 
outlays are accorded 
to 
fertilizer distribution 
outlets. 
Import 
and 
tax 
policies 
9. 
The withdrawal 
of 
restrictions 
on 
import 
of 
irrigation 
equipment 
and 
pumping 
installation 
in 
the 
late 
1980s 
induced 
fast expansion 
of 
irrigated 
area. 
It 
also 
allowed 
a 
shift 
in 
public 
investments 
away 
from 
large 
irrigation 
investments 
into 
development 
of 
rural 
infrastructure. 
As 
a result, 
today 
less 
than 
10 
percent 
of 
irrigated 
land 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
serviced 
from 
public 
irrigation 
facilities, 
although 
distribution 
of 
irrigation 
development 
across 
the 
districts 
of 
Bangladesh 
is 
very 
uneven.  Because coastal 
and 
north- 
east 
low-lying 
areas 
do 
not 
have 
easy 
access 
to 
tubewell 
irrigation, 
Bangladesh Water 
Development 
Board’s 
(BWDB) 
flood 
control 
and 
drainage 
projects 
concentrated 
in 
these 
areas. 
10. 
The 
exemption 
of 
duty 
on 
power 
tillers 
and 
engines 
in 
1989 
was 
instrumental 
in 
increasing 
their 
use, 
while 
the 
duty 
reduction 
on 
equipment 
and 
raw 
materials 
for 
food 
processing 
helped 
develop 
the 
non-apcultural 
rural 
sector. 
Partnership 
with 
NGOs 
in 
providing 
social 
services 
and 
micro-credit 
1 
1. 
Recognizing 
the 
enomous 
task 
ahead 
GOB 
encouraged 
NGGled 
development 
of 
micro-credit 
institutions. 
Following 
the 
success 
of 
the Grameen 
Bank 
in 
1976, 
micro-credit 
initiatives 
flourished 
in 
rural 
areas 
over 
the 
last 
two 
decades. 
A 
ground-breaking 
feature 
of 
these 
initiatives 
was 
that 
they 
targeted 
not 
only 
those 
lacking 
the 
collateral, 
but 
also 
women 
in 
particular. 
In 
2000, 
micro-credit 
programs 
delivered 
by 
the 
Government and 
NGOs 
covered 
over 10 
million 
individuals 
(Grameen 
Bank 
2.4 
million, 
BRAC 
3.3 
million, 
Proshika 
1.7 
million, 
Association 
for 
Social Advancement 
1.2 
million). 
A 
number 
of 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
NGO 
activities 
are 
well 
targeted 
to 
the 
poor 
and 
women and 
have 
positive impact 
on food 
consumption,  savings behavior, 
and 
health 
and education 
outcomes 
(Zeller 
et 
al. 
2001, 
and 
citations 
therein.) 
Over 
time, 
large 
volume 
of 
public 
and donor 
resources 
have become available 
through 
these 
credit 
programs. 
In 
particular, 
the 
Palli 
Karma 
Sahayak 
Foundation 
(PKSF)  was established 
as 
an 
apex 
organization 
to 
provide 
credit through 
various partner organizations 
that 
on-lend 
these 
funds 
to 
their 
clients. 
These 
initiatives contributed 
to 
raising 
incomes 
and 
human 
development 
outcomes 
in 
the 
rural 
areas 
of 
Bangladesh. 
Sustained 
emphasis 
on 
crop research 
12. 
About 
30 
percent 
of 
ADP 
expenditures 
in 
the 
two 
successful 
agriculture 
sub-sectors-rice 
and 
fisheries-are 
allocated 
to 
research 
activities. 
Even 
though 
public 
investments 
in 
research 
were 
relatively 
low 
in 
absolute 
terms 
(3-4 
percent 
of 
broad 
agriculture 
expenditure, 
or 
0.4 percent 
of 
agncultural 
GDP 
during 
1980-2000), 
it 
paid 
off 
very 
well. 
The 
Bangladesh 
Rice 
Research 
Institute 
(BFUU) 
has 
released 
about 
45 
high 
yielding 
rice 
varieties 
(HYVs) 
that 
are 
used 
in 
60 
to 
65 
percent 
of 
rice 
area. 
Empirical 
Page  109
Annex 
G 
Page 
4 
of

evidence shows 
that 
rice 
research 
in 
Bangladesh 
raised 
TFP 
in 
rice 
production 
by 
around 
1 
percent 
per 
annum 
during 
1975-1997. 
The 
rapid 
development 
of 
the 
fisheries 
sector 
can 
also 
be 
attributed 
in 
part 
to 
success 
in 
adopting 
new 
fish 
varieties and technologies. 
Key 
Issues 
and 
Policy 
Priorities 
13. 
An 
important 
achievement 
of 
past 
rural 
development 
policies 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
the 
more 
broadly 
shared 
pattem 
of 
growth 
in 
rural 
areas 
as 
compared 
to 
urban 
areas. 
Even 
though 
growth 
in 
average 
per- 
capita 
expenditure 
over 
the past 
decade 
was 
lower 
in 
rural 
as 
compared 
to 
urban 
areas 
(1.7 
vs. 
2.8 
percent 
per 
annum), 
rural 
growth 
was 
much 
more 
evenly 
distributed 
across 
income 
levels. 
Consequently, 
the 
poverty rate 
has 
declined 
at the 
same 
rate 
across 
urban 
and 
rural 
areas, 
and 
severe 
poverty 
has 
declined 
faster 
in 
rural 
areas 
as 
compared 
to 
urban 
areas. 
Growth 
of 
per-capita consumption 
in 
rural 
areas 
in 
the 
past 
decade 
seems 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
greater 
diversification. 
Available 
data 
show that 
there 
have 
been 
large 
shifts 
in 
sectors 
of activity 
such 
as 
services, 
factory 
workers 
and 
artisans, 
relative 
to 
agncultural 
laborers. 
Small 
cottage 
industries 
developed 
in 
rural 
areas, 
albeit 
mostly 
in 
villages 
with 
connection 
to 
electricity. The 
land 
rental 
market 
developed 
with 
tenancy 
rising 
from 
16 
percent 
of 
operated 
area 
in 
1983-84 
to 
22 
percent 
in 
1996. 
Fixed 
rent 
tenancy also 
rose 
in 
importance 
relative 
to 
sharecropping 
from 
26 percent 
of 
total 
area 
under 
tenancy 
to 
38 
percent 
in 
1996. 
14. 
Bangladesh 
has 
potential to 
accelerate 
growth 
in 
rural 
farm 
and 
non-farm 
sectors 
by 
realigning 
govemment 
policies 
to 
strongly 
encourage 
the 
rural 
non-farm 
sector, 
grooming 
institutions 
for 
provision 
of 
public, 
rather than 
private 
goods 
(including 
technology 
push), 
developing 
supporting infrastructure, 
and 
removing 
barriers 
for 
efficient functioning 
of 
markets 
(including 
protection 
to 
the 
sugar 
industry). 
In 
the 
environment 
of 
accelerated growth, 
equipping 
the 
poor 
with 
the 
private 
and 
public 
assets, 
as 
well 
as 
continued 
measures 
to 
reduce 
their 
vulnerability 
through 
targeted 
interventions, 
is 
the 
best 
way 
to 
raise 
their 
incomes and 
enable 
them 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
growth 
process. 
Improving 
the environment for 
rural 
non-farm 
growth 
15. 
The 
rural 
non-farm 
sector 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
become a 
leading 
sector 
of 
Bangladesh’s economy. 
However, 
its 
growth 
and 
employment-creating  opportunities  need 
to 
be 
nurtured 
carefully through 
a 
strong 
rural 
focus 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
public 
goods  (infrastructure, 
market  information) 
and 
credit 
delivery. 
Any 
“urban bias” 
caused 
by 
more 
favorable 
treatment accorded 
to 
urban 
industry 
needs 
to 
be 
removed. 
For 
example, 
tax 
holidays, 
enhanced depreciation, 
lower 
rates 
of 
capital 
gains 
tax, 
etc. 
are 
offered 
to 
manufacturing 
export-oriented 
industries 
located 
in 
the 
cities 
(e.g., 
garments 
and 
leather), 
but 
are 
not 
available 
to 
ago-processing 
industries. 
To 
boost 
the  agro-processing 
industry, 
tariffs 
on raw 
materials 
and 
inputs 
used 
by 
rural 
industry 
must 
be 
reduced 
further 
and 
supplementary 
duties 
withdrawn. 
Supporting the 
diversification 
in 
the 
farm 
sector 
16. 
The 
capacity 
of 
the 
rural 
non-farm 
sector 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
depends 
heavily 
on 
consumption 
and 
production 
linkages 
with 
agnculture, 
and 
hence 
upon 
strong 
agncultural 
growth.  The 
govemment 
needs 
to 
focus 
its 
policies 
on 
sustaining 
the  recent 
agricultural 
growth 
momentum 
through 
promotion 
of 
agncultural diversification. 
Reforming outdated 
institutions 
for 
rural 
development 
and 
building 
new 
ones 
17. 
Moving 
to 
commercialized 
and 
diversified 
agnculture 
requires 
a 
major 
shift 
in 
the 
role 
and 
functions 
of 
govemment 
while 
strengthening 
the 
base 
for 
deeper 
involvement 
of 
private 
entrepreneurs 
in 
rural 
areas. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
govemment 
should 
abandon 
subsidizing 
fertilizer 
and 
sugar 
and 
intervening 
with 
agricultural 
prices, 
and 
undertake 
more 
functions 
as 
dissemination 
of 
information;

overseeing 
the 
process 
of 
quality 
control 
(e.g., 
standardization and 
grades); 
and 
monitoring 
of 
farm 
input 
quality, 
(e.g., 
inspection, sampling, 
and 
testing 
of 
fertilizer 
and 
seeds). 
The 
govemment should 
also foster 
development 
of 
institutions 
to 
take 
up 
such 
roles 
as 
livestock 
disease 
surveillance  and 
control 
and 
development 
of 
veterinary 
services. 
18. 
Changing 
patterns 
of 
demand 
for 
food, 
degrading 
resources, 
the 
emergence 
of 
new 
areas 
of 
integrative 
research  (biotechnology, 
agro-forestry), 
and 
stagnant 
yields 
for  many 
crops  pose 
new 
challenges 
for 
the 
agricultural 
research 
and 
extension 
system. 
Recent 
growth 
in 
rice 
yield 
is 
largely 
due 
to 
reallocation 
of 
land 
from 
local to 
high 
yielding 
varieties 
rather 
than improvement 
in 
variety-specific 
yields. 
Sustaining 
recent 
agricultural 
growth would 
require 
addressing 
these 
new 
challenges, 
but 
the 
budgetary 
impact 
for 
the 
govemment 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
strategy adopted. 
Given 
the 
fledgling 
state 
of 
private 
sector research today, 
in 
the 
short and 
medium 
term 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
needed research 
work 
will 
have 
to 
come 
from 
the 
public 
sector, 
and 
this 
will 
need 
stable, 
significant 
public 
financial 
support. 
Over 
the 
longer 
term, 
the 
budgetary 
impact 
could 
be 
reduced 
if 
the government 
encourages 
private 
sector 
entry 
and 
builds 
a  strong  partnership 
with 
it. 
Establishing  and 
enforcing  intellectual  property 
rights 
is 
important 
in 
this 
context 
to 
ensure 
inflow 
of 
private 
investments 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
seeds 
research, 
livestock 
and horticulture. 
19. 
It 
is 
also 
necessary 
that 
the 
Govemment-run 
Bangladesh 
Agricultural 
Development Corporation 
(BADC) 
gradually 
withdraw 
from 
supplying 
seeds 
at 
a 
highly 
subsidized 
price, a 
practice 
that constrains 
the  emergence 
of 
private 
sector 
initiatives. 
Phasing 
out 
of 
BADC 
and termination 
of 
a 
number 
of 
development projects 
will 
entail additional 
budgetary 
savings. 
As 
discussed 
above, 
upwards 
of 
2,800 
BADC 
employees have already been retrenched. 
20. 
Government allocations 
on 
research 
should 
increase, 
while 
the 
National Agricultural 
Research 
System 
should 
redirect 
its 
emphasis 
and 
intensify 
research 
efforts 
in 
non-rice 
crops 
and 
non-crop 
agrlcultural 
products. 
Inland 
culture 
fisheries development 
offers 
opportunities 
for 
income, 
employment, 
and 
foreign 
exchange 
generation. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
Govemment-led 
system 
of 
extension 
services 
would 
benefit 
from 
closer 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
and 
should 
be 
redirected 
toward 
provision, 
upon 
demand, 
of 
"know-how" 
on 
these 
higher 
value 
varieties, 
improved 
soil 
and 
farm 
water 
management 
practices, 
port-harvest 
handling 
and 
processing, 
fertilizer 
use 
and 
product 
standardization 
for 
export 
markets. 
2 
1. 
Importantly, 
rural 
institutions 
are 
critical 
in 
ensuring 
the inclusiveness 
of 
growth 
which 
requires 
not 
only 
that 
the 
poor 
build 
up 
their 
assets 
(especially 
health 
and 
education), 
but 
also 
that the 
return 
to 
these 
assets 
are enhanced. 
A 
critical 
factor 
in 
raising 
returns 
is 
better 
defined property 
rights 
and clearer 
regulations 
on 
common 
resource management. 
If 
poverty 
is 
to 
decline, 
it 
is 
also 
imperative 
that 
stronger 
enforcement  mechanisms are 
in 
place 
to 
guarantee 
those 
rights, 
which 
in 
turn 
calls 
for 
governance 
improvements. 
Developing and upgrading 
physical, 
financial 
and 
social infrastructure 
22. 
Sustained  development 
in 
rural 
areas 
is 
not 
possible 
without 
adequate 
infrastructure. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
improvements 
in 
access 
to 
electricity 
in 
recent 
years, 
rural 
electrification 
is 
abysmally 
low, 
with 
only 
one 
out 
of 
five 
rural 
households 
having 
access 
to 
electricity. 
Studies 
have 
shown 
that 
lack 
of 
access 
to 
electricity 
is 
a 
major 
obstacle 
to 
rural 
development, 
especially 
for 
agrlcultural 
diversification 
and 
RNF 
growth. 
Upgrading 
rural 
roads 
offer 
another avenue 
for rural 
development 
in 
Bangladesh. 
Rural 
roads 
are 
plentiful, 
but 
their 
integration 
into 
a 
coherent 
network 
as 
well 
as 
their 
maintenance 
require 
immediate 
attention. 
Improvements 
in 
the 
rural 
financial 
infrastructure 
will 
not 
be 
possible 
without 
removal 
of 
the 
handicaps 
in 
the 
entire 
banking 
system. 
Access 
to 
credit 
remains 
limited, 
while 
the 
two 
agricultural 
banks 
are 
saddled 
with 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
problems 
as 
other 
financial

of

institutions, 
namely 
under-capitalization 
and 
non-performing 
loans. 
Large 
landowners 
are 
the 
principal 
beneficiaries 
of 
agncultural 
credit, 
which 
precludes 
access 
by 
small 
and 
medium 
size farmers, traders and 
organized 
processors. 
Continued 
support 
and 
encouragement 
of 
grass-root 
organizations and 
NGOs 
as 
providers 
of 
rural 
services, 
as 
well 
as 
introduction 
of 
new 
modes 
of 
social 
engagement 
(e.g. 
contract 
farming, 
access 
to 
local 
and 
international 
markets) 
will 
yield 
high 
dividends 
in 
terms 
of 
spreading 
the 
benefits 
of 
innovation 
and 
growth to 
wider 
segments 
of 
the 
rural 
population. 
Removing barriers 
to 
efjcient 
functioning 
of 
agricultural 
markets 
23. 
Given 
Bangladesh’s 
success 
following 
the 
liberalization 
of 
fertilizer  and 
irrigation 
equipment 
markets, 
removing 
the 
remaining 
market 
barriers 
could 
bring 
high 
benefits. 
The 
priorities 
in 
pursuit 
of 
this 
objective include:

Complete

market, 
which 
is 
a 
more effective 
way 
of 
guaranteeing 
price 
stability. 
GOB’S 
policies, 
currently guided 
by 
fears 
of 
supply 
instability, 
are 
misplaced 
as 
the 
urea 
subsidy 
does 
not 
guarantee 
a 
stable 
supply 
if 
the 
world 
urea 
prices 
fluctuate; 
in 
addition 
the 
subsidy 
benefits 
disproportionately 
the 
non-poor 
(mostly 
the 
public 
sector 
industrial 
producers), 
and 
deteriorates 
soil 
fertility 
balance. 
Maintaining 
the 
gas 
subsidy 
to public 
sector 
urea factories 
prevents 
private 
sector 
entry 
in 
urea 
production. 
This 
entry, 
as 
well 
as 
private 
sector 
imports, 
is 
further 
blocked 
on 
account 
of 
the 
government’s 
maintaining an 
administered 
price 
lower 
than 
the 
factory 
production 
cost 
or 
import 
price. 
Phasing 
out remaining 
public 
interventions 
such 
as 
open-market 
sales 
and 
domestic 
procurement 
in 
the 
food 
grain 
market, 
notwithstanding 
the 
already 
low 
level 
of 
support 
for 
domestic 
food 
grain. 
Private imports 
are 
highly 
responsive 
to 
wholesale 
prices 
and 
thus 
to 
shortfalls 
in 
production, 
while 
price 
fluctuations 
are 
now 
dramatically 
reduced 
through 
use 
of 
new 
technologies  that 
allow 
production 
of 
food 
grains throughout 
the 
year. Government’s 
role 
in 
holding food 
grain 
stocks 
should 
be 
limited 
to 
the management 
of 
an 
emergency 
stock 
to 
insure 
against 
natural 
disasters 
(as 
opposed 
to 
procurement 
for 
price-stabilization 
purposes). 
Phasing 
out 
of 
current 
protection 
to 
the 
sugar 
industry 
by 
freeing 
up 
administrative 
procurement 
prices 
of 
sugar 
and  divestiture 
of 
sugar 
mills. 
Current  policies 
including 
the 
restrictive 
input 
procurement 
system 
result 
in 
high 
level 
of 
taxation 
of 
sugarcane 
farmers 
and 
indirect 
taxation 
raises 
consumer prices 
of 
sugar 
significantly.

BANGLADESH: 
REFORMING 
FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT 
1. 
The 
findings 
of 
various 
diagnostic 
studiess2 
on 
Bangladesh 
reveal 
that 
fiduciary 
risk 
in 
public 
spending 
is 
high 
and 
significant 
improvement 
in 
public 
financial 
management 
is 
required. 
The 
Country Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
Report 
(CFAA), 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
Bangladesh 
(GOB), 
indicates 
that an inadequate 
control 
environment, 
lack 
of 
strategic 
planning, 
rigid 
and process 
oriented financial 
management 
systems, 
and 
lack 
of 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
in 
the management 
of 
the 
public 
purse 
are 
major 
impediments 
to 
sound 
public 
financial 
management. 
2. 
The 
following 
are some 
of 
the 
weaknesses 
identified 
by 
the 
analytical 
work 
that 
has 
been 
done: 
The 
internal 
control 
climate 
is 
poor, 
as 
pointed 
out 
repeatedly 
by 
the 
C&AG 
in 
his 
reports. 
Internal 
audit 
in 
Bangladesh 
is 
still 
at 
an 
early 
stage. 
The 
Secretary, 
as 
Pnncipal 
Accounting 
Officer, 
needs 
to 
ensure, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Chef 
Accounting 
Officer 
(CAO) 
and 
Internal 
Audit 
Officer, 
that 
procedures 
are 
clearly 
laid 
down, 
officers 
are 
adequately trained, records 
are 
properly 
managed 
and 
that 
officers 
are 
supervised 
and 
mentored 
as 
necessary. 
The 
CAO 
pre- 
audits 
all 
payments 
before they 
are 
made, 
except 
for 
some 
“departmentalized” 
agencies, 
such 
as 
Public 
Works, 
Roads 
and Highways, Telegraph 
and 
Telephone 
Board, 
which 
have 
check-issuing 
powers. 
There 
is 
no 
central 
direction 
or 
oversight 
of 
internal audit 
standards 
and management 
gets 
little 
technical 
advice 
on 
risk 
management 
and 
control. 
The upgrading 
of 
internal audit 
needs 
to 
be planned 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
strengthening 
of 
internal 
control. 
The 
government 
has 
indicated that 
it 
is 
committed 
to 
develop 
internal audit functions 
in 
the 
ministries 
and 
line 
agencies. 
Internal 
audit 
is 
being 
piloted 
in 
some 
ministries 
and 
will 
be 
expanded 
to 
10 
ministries 
by 
2005. 
Parliamentary 
Oversight 
is 
yet 
to 
be 
effective 
due 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
Public 
Accounts 
Committee 
and 
other finance 
and 
standing 
committees. 
Though 
parliamentary 
elections 
were 
held 
in 
October 
200 
1 
, 
parliamentary 
standing committees 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
established, 
largely 
on 
account 
of 
differences 
with 
the 
opposition 
party 
on 
chairmanship 
of 
the committees. 
The 
Public 
Accounts Committee (PAC) 
is 
the 
most important parliamentary 
committee, 
as 
it 
oversees 
public 
expenditures  based 
on 
reports  submitted 
by 
the 
C&AG. 
However, 
although 
some 
improvements  were 
made 
in 
its 
operations 
during 
the 
late 
1990s, 
PAC 
has 
not 
been 
fully 
effective. 
It 
has 
no 
secretariat 
and 
its 
budget 
is 
inadequate 
to 
perform 
its 
mandate. 
While 
PAC 
can make 
recommendations, 
it 
does 
not 
have 
any 
mechanism 
for 
follow-up. 
If 
the 
concerned 
ministry 
chooses 
not 
to 
take 
corrective 
action, there 
is 
little 
that 
PAC 
can do 
about 
this. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Refom 
Program, 
Supported 
by 
UK-DFID 
and 
the 
Netherlands, 
the 
government 
has agreed 
to 
set-up 
Audit 
Committees 
in 
every 
ministry. 
Once 
established, 
the 
Audit 
Committees should 
review 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
PAC 
and 
report 
back 
to 
PAC. 
The 
independence 
of 
the 
Comptroller 
and 
Auditor  General 
is 
limited. 
Although 
the 
constitution 
guarantees 
the independence 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Comptroller 
and 
Auditor 
General 
(C&AG), 
past 
C&AG’s 
have 
indicated 
that 
they 
face 
impediments 
in 
performing 
their 
constitutional 
mandate. 
The C&AG’s  report 
is 
first 
submitted 
to 
the 
Prime 
Minister’s 
Office, an 
auditee. 
This 
is 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
notion 
of 
an 
independent 
supreme 
audit 
and 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
practice 
in 
countries 
with 
effective 
public 
audits, 
which 
submit 
their 
reports 
directly 
to 
parliament. 
The 
C&AG’s 
office 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
Rules 
of 
Business 
of 
the 
Government, 
which 
52 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA), 
Public 
Expenditure Review 
(PER), 
Country 
Procurement

Report (CPAR), 
Institutional 
and 
Govemance 
Review (IGR) 
and

and 
Safeguard 
Assessment.

means 
that 
it 
gets 
treated 
like 
a Department 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Establishment  decide the 
budget 
and 
personnel 
policies 
of 
the 
C&AG’s 
office. 
Ideally 
it 
should 
be 
the 
Public 
Accounts 
Committee, 
which 
is 
the 
principal 
user 
of 
the 
C&AG’s 
services, 
that should 
determine 
the 
budget 
of 
the 
C&AG, 
although 
the 
budget 
allocation 
would 
be 
made 
by 
the 
Finance 
Division. 
To 
ensure 
accountability, 
the 
accounts 
of 
the 
C&AG 
office 
should 
be 
audited 
by 
an 
auditor  appointed 
by 
PAC. 
In 
addition, 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
and 
quality 
of 
audit 
reports, there 
is 
need 
for 
peer 
review 
of 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
C&AG’s 
Office. 
. 
Cash 
management 
is 
not 
very 
effective 
and 
results 
is 
excessive 
short-term 
borrowing 
from 
Bangladesh 
Bank 
and 
commercial banks. 
One 
reason 
for 
this 
is 
that 
budget 
revenue 
projections 
in 
the 
past 
have 
been 
high. 
To 
address 
this, 
a suitably staffed 
Resource 
Management 
Unit 
is 
being 
set 
up 
in 
the 
Finance 
Division 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
The 
financial 
statements 
of 
GOB 
are 
not 
fully 
accurate 
and transparent. 
The 
accounts 
of 
GOB 
are 
maintained 
on 
a 
cash basis and 
are 
not 
always 
complete. 
Assets 
and 
liabilities 
are 
not 
appropriately recorded 
in 
the 
books 
of 
accounts.  There 
is 
no 
system 
of 
commitment 
accounting. 
Payments 
required 
on 
an emergency basis 
are 
often 
recorded 
in 
suspense 
accounts. 
It 
is 
not 
uncommon 
to 
find 
lack 
of 
reconciliation 
and 
misclassification 
of 
expenditures 
that 
lead 
to 
inaccurate 
financial 
data. 
The 
accounting 
records, 
in 
many 
cases, 
do 
not 
include  direct 
disbursements 
for 
goods 
and 
services 
for 
the 
development projects. 
There 
are 
major 
unexplained 
differences 
between 
the 
bank 
balance 
shown 
in 
the 
Government’s  balance 
sheet 
and 
the 
balance 
shown 
in 
the 
scrolls 
(bank  statements) 
of 
the 
Bangladesh 
Bank. 
Only 
regular 
monthly 
reconciliations 
can remove 
this 
risk. 
The 
government 
is 
aware 
of 
these 
problems  and 
this 
is 
another  component 
that 
is 
being 
tackled 
under 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Reform 
Program. 
Government 
has 
also 
agreed 
to 
implement 
the 
International 
Public 
Sector 
Accounting 
Standards, 
initially 
on 
a 
cash basis. 
. 
The 
financial 
accountability 
of 
local 
government 
institutions 
is 
very 
weak. 
Most 
local 
government budgets 
are 
not 
in 
the 
public 
domain. 
The 
accounts 
of 
local 
governments 
are 
not 
prepared 
on 
a 
timely 
basis 
and 
their 
audited 
financial 
statements are 
not 
made 
public. 
None 
of 
the 
local 
governments  prepare 
any  performance  reports 
on 
the 
use 
of 
public 
funds. 
As 
Government 
embarks 
upon 
a 
program 
of 
decentralization, 
it 
is 
very 
important 
to 
improve 
the 
financial 
accountability 
environment 
of 
local 
govemment. 
Such a 
phased 
program 
could 
begin 
with 
improving financial 
accountability 
in 
four 
city 
corporations 
(Dhaha, 
Chittagong, 
Khulna 
and 
Rajshahi) 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis. 
GOVERNMENT’S 
FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT 
REFORM 
STRATEGY 
3. 
In 
recent 
years, 
and 
particularly 
since  the 
election 
of 
the  present 
Government 
in 
October 
2001, 
Bangladesh 
has 
made considerable progress 
in 
fiscal and 
economic 
reforms. 
A 
major 
pillar 
of 
these 
reforms 
has 
been 
improvements 
in 
the 
management 
of 
the 
public 
purse. 
Achievements 
to date 
0 
The 
Financial 
Management 
Reform 
Program 
(FMRF’) 
adopted 
by 
Government 
is 
designed 
to 
deliver 
five 
components: 
(i) 
improved 
audit  and 
other 
financial 
management 
reports 
for 
parliamentary scrutiny; 
(ii) 
a 
sustainable 
regulatory 
environment 
to 
enhance 
fiscal 
management; 
(iii) 
enhanced 
resource 
allocation, 
utilization 
and  performance 
management; 
(iv) 
enhanced 
Page  114
Annex 
H 
Page

of 
4 
financial 
management 
systems; 
and 
(v) 
greater 
capacity 
for 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Academy 
to 
support 
financial 
management 
training. 
A 
new 
budgetary classification 
system 
was 
introduced 
in 
1999 
under a 
Reform 
Project 
on 
Budget 
and 
Expenditure 
(RIBEC) 
that 
helped 
in 
making 
budgets 
and accounts 
more 
useful, 
particularly 
for 
economic 
analysis. 
In 
order 
to 
restore 
fiscal 
and 
budgetary  discipline, 
the 
Government 
imposed 
an 
embargo 
on 
irregular 
transfers 
of 
funds 
to 
the 
Public Account 
of 
the 
Republic 
in 
FY02. 
Public 
accounts and 
audit reports 
are 
now 
presented 
to 
Parliament 
annually 
and 
delays have 
been 
substantially 
reduced. 
From 
July 
1, 
2002, offices 
of 
CAOs 
(Chief 
Accounts Officers) 
in 
each 
ministry 
were 
created 
to 
report 
directly 
to 
their 
respective 
Secretaries 
and 
the 
Controller 
General 
of 
Accounts (CGA) 
who 
ultimately 
reports 
to 
the 
Finance 
Secretary. 
In 
addition, 
internal audit 
teams 
have 
been 
piloted 
in 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
ministries. 
To 
assure 
quality 
of 
accounting 
data, 
a Central 
Reconciliation 
Unit 
(CRU) has been 
established 
in 
the 
CGA’s office.  The 
unit 
is 
now 
carrying out reconciliation 
of 
cheques 
electronically 
issued 
by 
the 
CAOs 
based 
in 
Dhaka 
and 
paid 
by 
the 
Bangladesh 
Bank. 
Field 
accounting 
offices 
have 
been 
reorganized 
through 
the 
abolition 
of 
20 
Regional 
Accounts 
Offices  and 
the 
creation 
of 
6 
upgraded 
Divisional 
Offices. 
Information 
generated 
at 
Thana 
and 
District 
levels 
is 
now 
monitored 
and  consolidated 
by 
these 
6 
Divisional 
Controllers 
and 
electronically 
transferred 
to 
the Central 
Data 
Processing 
Unit 
of 
the 
CGA, 
and 
from 
there 
to 
the 
Finance 
Division. 
On-line 
electronic 
data 
transmission 
now 
allows 
the 
central 
government 
accounts 
to 
be 
compiled 
and 
reported 
within 
five 
weeks 
of 
each 
month-end. 
The auditing 
and 
accounting 
function 
are 
in 
the process 
of 
being 
separated. 
The 
CGA 
no 
longer 
reports 
to 
the 
Auditor 
General (C&AG).

of 
the 
Public

plan 
will 
be 
developed 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the

Audit 
Committees 
will 
be 
established 
in 
all

Full 
legal 
separation 
of

with 
the
