"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. Zambia Enterprise Development Project's\n            (EDP's) Multipurpose Credit Facility (MCF)\n            component's excellent performance indicates several\n            very important lessons regarding preparation and design of\n            lines of credit. Firstly, it shows that lines of credit\n            operations must be prepared after carrying out substantial\n            economic sector work both in real and financial sectors.\n            Secondly, it emphasizes that lines of credit operations\n            should be in tune with overall macro economic policies and\n            ongoing reform programs. Thirdly, it demonstrates that\n            credit lines are most effective when they are fully\n            intermediated by commercial banks. MCF also offers solutions\n            to deal with risks associated with foreign exchange\n            denominated lending by essentially dividing these risks in\n            two parts. First, the foreign exchange rate risk was left\n            entirely with the borrowers. Second, the foreign exchange\n            availability risks (i.e. possible re-introduction of\n            currency controls. etc.) was assumed by the apex by making\n            it possible to pay in local currency at the prevailing\n            exchange rate of the repayment date. EDP's Matching\n            Grant Scheme (MGS) component clearly shows that such\n            schemes, when designed for mainstream businesses, are very\n            much dependent on the size of the existing corporate sector.\n            EDP's technical assistance component demonstrates that\n            necessary technical assistance must be included to support\n            project's objectives and implementation. EDP\n            demonstrates that modular project design with clear\n            identification of operational responsibilities eases\n            implementation. Modularity essentially localizes problems\n            during implementation and prevents a contagion of problems\n            across the entire project."}, "docdt": "2003-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
