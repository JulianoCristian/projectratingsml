Some lessons\n            learned included: PPRWRP developed and demonstrated an\n            innovative and well-designed methodology for development of\n            improved Water User Association's (WUAs), and it\n            established and operated under both Ministry of Water\n            Resources (MWR) and State Office for Comprehensive\n            Agricultural Development (SOCAD) a pilot system to\n            demonstrate comprehensive and effective institutional\n            support for improved WUA development. It also showed that\n            properly designed and implemented WUAs provide exceptionally\n            high economic, social and environmental benefits and that\n            with strong government support they can be rapidly scaled-up\n            over wide areas under diverse conditions. However, to\n            achieve these high benefits and be sustainable, WUAs must be\n            \"standardized\" based on improved principles and\n            standards. And for effective implementation, WUA development\n            support needs to include policy, training, capacity\n            building, demonstration WUAs, and monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E). The project further showed that improved WUAs\n            based on democratic water management are pro-poor and\n            provide an effective and low-costs means to benefit the poor\n            and women. Where irrigation is involved, incorporating\n            improved, pro-poor WUA development into poverty alleviation\n            and gender support programs can provide substantial direct\n            benefits to the poor and women and help empower them. PPRWRP\n            has demonstrated that women in particular can participate\n            effectively in WUAs and make major contributions to WUA\n            operations. Compared to control groups, WUAs under the\n            project saved substantial amounts of water at a relatively\n            low cost due mainly to volumetric water charges, reduced\n            water conflict, and generally better local water management\n            which is reliable, flexible and timely. Improved WUAs\n            provided the right amount of water at the right time based\n            on farmer needs, increasing crop and water productivity.\n            Water saving reduces water costs for farmers and also\n            benefits the environment and the country."}, "docdt": "2010-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
