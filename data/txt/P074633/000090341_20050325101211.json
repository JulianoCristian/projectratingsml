The\n            Core Document sets out a five-year plan with three primary\n            objectives: (i) ensuring access and equity in primary\n            education, (ii) enhancing quality and relevance of primary\n            education, (iii) improving efficiency and institutional\n            capacity. A significant proportion of the total population\n            of Nepal are Dalits and indigenous people (recent estimates\n            from the 2001 census suggest 16 percent Dalits and 36.4\n            percent indigenous population). Because they inhabit all\n            regions and districts of Nepal covered by this broad\n            national education project, a Vulnerable Communities\n            Development Plan is an essential prerequisite for achieving\n            the stated objective of social inclusion in primary\n            education as set out in the NEFA Core Document. The central\n            goal for this VCDP is to assess the capacity of the NEFA\n            programme to offer inclusive education to meet the learning\n            needs for all disadvantaged communities in Nepali society,\n            including ethnic minorities, women, Dalits and indigenous\n            people and linguistic minorities through equal access to\n            educational resources. The overall Project Development\n            Objective of the EFA Core Document for Nepal is to\n            strengthen Nepal's institutional capacity at national,\n            district and school levels so as to deliver more efficient\n            and better education services."}, "docdt": "2013-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
