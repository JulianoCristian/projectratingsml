for Nepal were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: to improve the quality of education, in\n            particular learning outcomes, it is important to emphasize\n            the quality of learning inputs such as teachers and\n            instructional and learning materials. Low capacity limits\n            the potential of various instruments under communities\u2019\n            control to improve the efficiency and quality of schools. It\n            is important that central, district, and local level roles\n            and responsibilities are clearly defined when education\n            provision has been decentralized. Verification of the\n            current system suggests irregularities in reporting data:\n            scholarship distribution has not followed guidelines and the\n            incentive to over-report enrollment data has increased with\n            the introduction of per capita financing."}, "docdt": "2015-12-22T23:17:02Z"}
