By the early\n            1950s the country had only twenty two high schools, of which\n            twenty were community built, financed and managed. In 1972,\n            however, the government took over more than 8,000 schools.\n            But 30 years of neglect had taken a heavy toll. Literacy\n            rates were 52 percent, compared to 58 percent in South Asia\n            and 61 percent among low-income countries around the world.\n            The International Development Association financed Community\n            School Support Project was launched in 2003 to help reform\n            the defunct public school system. Net primary enrollment\n            rose from 84 percent in 2003 to 92 percent in 2008. Gender\n            parity improved from 83 percent to 98 percent during the\n            same period. More than 8,600 schools transferred back to\n            community management for the transition in education sector."}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T04:50:05Z"}
