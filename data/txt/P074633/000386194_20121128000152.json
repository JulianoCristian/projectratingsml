for Nepal were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: International Development Association\n            (IDA) has supported education in Nepal for over three\n            decades, and has constantly evolved its approach to\n            developing the sector based on the lessons learnt from its\n            projects. In designing the last program of the current\n            series, School Sector Reform Plan (SSRP), it has continued\n            to integrate and build on the lessons learned from the\n            implementation of past programs. From the perspective of\n            wider application, the EFA program provides some important\n            overall lessons. Specifically, four key lessons emerge from\n            the successful implementation of the EFA program: (i) a\n            Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) that supports the\n            Government's own program and relies on Government\n            structures for implementation can be an effective tool to\n            harmonize partner support, strengthen sectoral management\n            capacity and reduce transaction costs; (ii) high level\n            political commitment is critical to achieve difficult\n            reforms as is bureaucratic buy-in; (iii) effective\n            communication, specifically on progress of reforms can play\n            a critical role in ensuring sustainability of reforms; (iv)\n            participatory processes to engage communities and mobilize\n            beneficiaries can be a powerful means to achieve results.\n            Adequate capacity building is crucial to enable effective\n            decentralization, particularly at the village and community\n            levels. The reforms introduced under the EFA program\n            successfully decentralized administrative and financial\n            authority to local community bodies, i.e. the School\n            Management Committees (SMCs). To be truly meaningful, this\n            reform needs to be accompanied with strong capacity support\n            to ensure that the SMCs play their roles effectively.\n            Capacity support needs to be continuous and focused.\n            Balancing incentives to students with incentives to schools:\n            To date, strategies to enhance educational outcomes of the\n            disadvantaged have focused on increasing access through\n            provision of incentives such as scholarships."}, "docdt": "2010-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
