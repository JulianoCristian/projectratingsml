140 Education for all (Development Budget 
–
Central Level) and 65-5-140 Education 
for All (Development Budget – District Level) as per HMG/N current chart of 
accounts. All activities under these budget heads will be funded jointly by HMG/N 
and pooling donors. In the context of this JFA these budget heads will comprise the 
EFA Programme for financial reporting purposes. In the event that these budget heads 
are changed due to revision of HMG/N chart of accounts, HMG/N will notify the 
Pooling Donors of the new budget heads, which will comprise the EFA Programme 
for financial reporting purposes. 
 
7. 
The objectives of the EFA Programme are: (a) ensuring access and equity in primary 
education; (b) enhancing quality and relevance of primary education; (c) improving 
efficiency and institutional capacity as well as promoting Early Childhood 
Development and Non-formal Education as specified in the Core Document. 
 
8. 
This JFA sets forth the joint provisions and procedures for financial support to the 
EFA Programme and serves as a co-ordination framework for consultation between 
the Signatories for EFA Programme monitoring and decision-making, joint reviews of 
performance, common procedures on disbursement, procurement, and financial 
management including reporting and audits. 
 
9. 
The financial commitments of the Pooling Donors will be confirmed within the 
bilateral agreements/arrangements concluded between HMG/N and each of the 
Pooling Donors.  
 
10. 
The Pooling Donors will establish bilateral agreements/arrangements that are 
compatible with the spirit and provisions of this JFA and will refrain, as far as 
possible, from setting conditions in the bilateral agreements/arrangements that 
contradict or diverge from the spirit of this JFA. In case of any inconsistency or 
contradiction between the provisions and conditions of this JFA and any of the 
bilateral agreements/arrangements, the provisions of the bilateral 
agreements/arrangements will prevail. Insofar specific agreements on specific items 
made in bilateral agreements/arrangements should deviate from the JFA, the Pooling 
Donor concerned will inform the other Pooling Donors thereof by supplying a copy of 
the bilateral agreement/arrangements to the other Pooling Donors and specify the 
deviations and how to resolve them in case of inconsistency with this JFA.  
 
11. 
The Pooling Donors will base their actual support on the progress attained in the 
implementation of the EFA Programme. Progress will be measured through the 
common procedures for monitoring and reporting as described in paragraphs IX and X 
(refer to Annex 1. Nepal EFA Programme - Schedule of Monitoring and Reporting). 
 
II.

12. 
In matters pertaining to the implementation of this JFA, HMG/N will be represented 
by the Ministry of Finance ("MOF"). The responsibility for the implementation of the 
EFA Programme not affecting the overall responsibilities of HMG/N or the MOF will 
lie with the Ministry of Education and Sports ("MOES").

Programme.  
 
VII.   
Pooling Mechanism
29. 
The Pooling Donors will provide indicative funding levels for the following fiscal year 
in the semi-annual meeting in December. 
 
30. 
The Pooling Donors will provide a funding commitment in the semi-annual meeting in 
April. It will take into account the sub-sector budget and cash forecast statement (ref. 
49 (c)) of the EFA Programme. 
 
31. 
The Signatories will in the light of these commitments determine their share of 
funding for the coming fiscal year for the total EFA Programme as defined in section 6 
of paragraph I above.  
 
32. 
Changes within the year of commitments or schedule of disbursements by the Pooling 
Donors or additional commitments from new donors becoming signatories to this JFA, 
will be discussed and agreed upon between the Signatories before such adjustments 
are being made.  
 
33. 
The disbursements by the Pooling Donors to the foreign exchange account will be as 
follows: 
 
a. 
For the first disbursement of the first fiscal year under the EFA Programme, 
the Pooling Donors will advance their share of first two fiscal trimesters 
expenditure estimates for the first year.  
 
b.  For every trimester disbursement thereafter, the Pooling Donors will replenish 
the Foreign Exchange Account (FE Account) based on Financial Monitoring 
Reports (FMRs) as defined in para 49 of this arrangement showing funds 
utilized during the trimester, the cash balance position of the FE Account, and 
the cash forecast for the remaining fiscal year. 
 
Page  6
6
c.  In the event of the cash balance position in foreign exchange being more than 
the funds requirement for the next two trimesters, no transfers of funds would 
need to take place from the Pooling Donors to the foreign exchange account.     
 
d.  Any outstanding advance may be liable for repayment or deduction against the 
advance for the following fiscal year. 
 
e.  There may be a final adjusted disbursement for the fiscal year on the basis of 
the certified annual financial statement (section 50a). This adjustment will be 
made in the second trimester of the following fiscal year. 
 
34. 
The MOF/FCGO/MOES/DOE are responsible for certifying and forwarding the 
relevant financial reports indicated in paragraph IX below, and submitting the request 
for disbursement in writing in accordance with the provisions of this JFA to the 
PDWG contact Point. The MOF/FCGO will certify all consolidated annual reports. 
With respect to trimester reports the MOF/FCGO will certify only reports generated 
from the FCGO database. The rest lies with the MOES/DOE.  
 
35. 
The Contact Point in consultation with PDWG will have 10 days upon receipt of this 
request to review the attached reports (ref. paragraph IX) and clarify any outstanding 
issues including validity of cash forecasts for the following two trimesters with the 
MOF/FCGO and MOES/DOE. 
 
36. 
In the event of there being ‘no objection’ the Pooling Donors' Contact Point will 
advise Pooling Donors to deposit their share of the overall disbursement in the 
designated foreign exchange account, which should take place no later than 30 days 
after the receipt of HMG/N's request. 
 
37. 
In the event of there being issues which are not possible to clarify within the 10 day 
period indicated in section 35 above, the above process will be suspended until 
outstanding issues are resolved. HMG/N and the Pooling Donors will make their best 
endeavours to resolve any such issues as quickly as possible. 
 
38. 
Following confirmation from NRB, MOF/FCGO will immediately acknowledge 
receipt of the foreign exchange funds, in writing, to the Pooling Donors' Contact Point. 
 
39. 
The FE Account will be a non-interest bearing account. No fees and commission will 
be charged by the NRB for the operation of the account without prior agreement of the 
Signatories.  
 
40. 
The exchange rate at which funds from the foreign exchange account will be 
converted into Nepalese rupees will be the official buying rate of the NRB on the date 
of conversion. 
 
41. 
The FE Account will be used only for the purpose of transferring the amount to 
HMG/N's consolidated fund following the certification of actual expenditures. There 
will be no direct expenditure on the procurement of imported goods and services from 
the foreign exchange account. The procurement of such items will take place in 
accordance with paragraph VIII below. Upon MOES/DOE’s requests, foreign 
exchange currency payments will be promptly facilitated by HMG/N as per HMG/N
