      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to ad apt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses a primary education
project in Nepal, the Education for All Project 2004-2009 (EFA). The project was
implemented through a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), Nepal’s first SWAp in the
education sector. The World Bank Group was one of five original pooling donors.

Total project cost was estimated at US$664 million. The Government of Nepal was to
finance US$479 million. By project closing, the Government’s commitments had risen to
US$703 million.

The World Bank approved its contribution on July 8, 2004 with an IDA credit of US$50
million. Due to substantial cost increases Additional Financing was granted in 2007.
With the addition of an IDA grant of US$60 million, the Bank’s final contribution to the
project was US$110 million.

The report was prepared by Ann Elizabeth Flanagan, Economist, IEG. The findings are
based on a three week field mission to Nepal from May 15, 2014 to June 8, 2014 which
was conducted concurrently with an evaluation mission which contributed to IEG’s
evaluation of World Bank support to Early Childhood Development (ECD). The mission
visited the districts of Dhanusa, Kaski, Kathmandu, Kavre, and Mahotari and met with a
range of stakeholders: government, donors, civil society, School Management
Committees, Parent Teacher Associations, Head Teachers, Teachers, ECD Facilitators,
parents, and community members. Ms. Sangeeta Rana helped facilitate meetings in the
field.

IEG is grateful for the cooperation and assistance provided by all the concerned
stakeholders and the support provided by the World Bank country office staff in
Kathmandu.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and feedback, and comments received
from the Government have been included in Annex C.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report evaluates the contributions to educational
achievements made in Nepal as part of the World Bank’s Education for All Project 2004-
2009. The Education For All Project represents the World Bank’s financial support to
the Government’s Education For All Program. This is the first time the Independent
Evaluation Group has conducted a PPAR on an EFA funded project financed through a
Sector-wide Approach (SWAp).

Context

Nepal is a demographically and geographically diverse country. The Central Bureau of
Statistics counted 125 castes and 123 mother tongue languages spoken among its 26.5
million people (Government of Nepal, 2011). Among the country’s four ecological zones
and five development regions, the geography ranges from rugged mountainous terrain to
forests to fertile plains. Nepal’s topography, traditions, ethnic, and linguistic diversity
have contributed to isolating certain population segments from access to basic services.
Girls, Dalits, and disadvantaged Janajatis are among the most disadvantaged groups in
terms of access to education services.

Trends in education improvement prior to the EFA project had been mixed. Significant
gains had been achieved in net primary enrollment rates, which increased from 69 percent
in 1999 to 84 percent in 2003. Drop-out and survival rates had improved, yet repetition
rates remained high. Little progress had been made on eliminating the gender gap in
access to primary education.

Results of student learning as measured by tests of student achievement indicated low
performance at the primary school level. In terms of subgroups, boys and girls performed
equally well. Results were not disaggregated by caste, ethnicity, or income group making
differential performance among these groups and more advantaged students impossible.
Data from performance on the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) examination taken after
completing 10th grade suggested private school students – those whose families have the
means to pay for an education – were learning more.

The EFA project was designed to address gaps in educational achievement in access,
equity, quality, and efficiency.

Project Design and Objectives

The Project’s Development Objectives were to (i) ensure access and equity in primary
education; (ii) improve the efficiency and institutional capacity of primary education; and
(iii) enhance the quality and relevance of basic primary education for children and
illiterate adults. The Education for All project continued and expanded the processes and
systems put in place under previous Bank and donor support through the Basic and
Primary School Project II and the Community School Support Project. Donors had been
coordinating in Nepal’s education sector for more than two decades. The EFA SWAp
helped to further coordinate their efforts.

Project activities were designed to be complementary and synergistic and many activities
supported more than one intended outcome. Taking into consideration the relatively high
overall level of enrollment, the project rightly emphasized increasing the demand for
education among historically excluded and hardest to reach populations while continuing
to expand and rehabilitate classrooms to accommodate increasing enrollments.

Activities to improve school-level efficiency emphasized decentralized provision of
education and empowerment of School Management Committees (SMC) and local
communities, in particular decision-making authority and control over flexible resources.
At the time of project approval, there was, however, little evidence of the effectiveness of
school-based management. As well, there were ambiguities in the project’s definition of
autonomy and the precise levels, ways, and means to achieve participation in decision-
making. In particular, roles and responsibilities of SMCs were inconsistent between the
Acts and Regulations and relevant Operational Directives and Guidelines (CERID, 2007).
Accountability mechanisms were weak and support for capacity building limited.
Capacity building activities for district and school level stakeholders incorporated into
project design lacked a clearly defined and strategically prioritized capacity development
plan. Low capacity at all levels and weak internal controls limited the SWAp’s
appropriateness as a funding vehicle.

Activities to address the quality of education included teacher training, privatization of
textbook delivery (to improve the timely delivery of learning materials), early childhood
development (to improve readiness to learn), and support to literacy programs (to achieve
basic literacy for all). Improvements in the quality of education were also assumed to
follow from activities supporting decentralization and improved accountability. A
theoretical link between decentralization, accountability, and improved student learning
had been established (World Bank, 2004a), but little empirical evidence of the
effectiveness of school-based management existed at project approval. Overall,
insufficient emphasis was placed on improving the quality of education under EFA.

The project’s objectives were relevant at approval and remained relevant at project
closing. The project’s objectives and activities supported the Government of Nepal’s
strategy to achieve broad based economic growth, improvement of social services
delivery, social inclusion of historically excluded social groups, and good governance.
They were relevant in terms of Government priorities and commitments to global
initiatives such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Education for All,
Nepal’s educational context, and conflict mitigation. Democratic rule and demand for
equitable access to public services were major concerns arising out of the “Peoples
Movements.” While the EFA project was approved during the conflict, discussions in the
literature are mixed on the net impact the conflict had on the provision of education and
EFA’s implementation.

The project was aligned with the World Bank’s strategies. At project approval, the Bank
was supporting broad based economic growth and social sector development in Nepal;
universal access to an inclusive, quality primary education system was emphasized.
When the conflict ended and rebuilding began, in particular the writing of a new
Constitution, the Bank strategies focused on foundation laying activities, such as
education, upon which to build sustainable inclusive development. At project closure,
                                             xv


education remained a priority as it served the dual purpose of fostering both economic
development and peace-building.

Project Results

At project closing, the project had achieved its access and equity targets, obtaining
gender parity and representative shares of historically disadvantaged students enrolling in
primary education. A combination of new and improved learning environments,
scholarships, increased parental awareness, and community involvement likely
contributed to achieving improved access to education. On April 25, 2015, a 7.8
magnitude earthquake struck Nepal. The earthquake destroyed 30 percent of the basic
primary subsector schools in the country. The Region reports that classes were resumed
in temporary learning centers within a month after the earthquake.

Student attendance remains an issue, especially for poorer students. There is little
evidence of improved learning outcomes, which points to the need for more focused
attention on the determinants of learning and improving the quality of education.

Gains were made in repetition rates and drop-out rates in primary education. A number of
factors have contributed to the improvement of the efficiency of the primary education
system. Increased awareness, community participation, remittances, and a liberal
promotion policy were all contributing factors. Other systemic inefficiencies such as the
misallocation of teachers persisted.

Evidence to show that institutional capacity has improved is scant. Capacity building
activities were undertaken, but overall the project paid insufficient attention to
systematically strengthening capacity, particularly at local levels. Capacity constraints
continue to be a substantial concern.

Efficiency is rated modest. The benefits derive primarily from the number of students
completing fifth grade. Estimates may be overstated to the extent that calculations rely on
Government reported enrollment and completion figures.

Based on high relevance of objectives, modest relevance of design, modest achievement
on project objectives, and modest efficiency, the project’s outcome is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome is rated moderate. Political instability and fiscal
constraints continue, however, the Government was quickly able to mobilize US$300
million in additional funding from donors for post-disaster reconstruction efforts.

Bank supervision was strong and the Bank made a useful contribution to the project’s
access and equity objectives (later affected by the earthquake), but the Bank
underestimated local capacity and the consequent capacity building effort required to
implement a complex project which rested on decentralized decision-making. Bank
Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
                                            xvi


The Government of Nepal remains committed to education reform yet, recurrent
implementation issues and a weak internal control system persisted throughout project
implementation. Borrower Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Lessons

Based on the experience of this project, lessons for future education projects in Nepal and
elsewhere can be drawn:

      To improve the quality of education, in particular learning outcomes, it is
       important to emphasize the quality of learning inputs such as teachers and
       instructional and learning materials. There is little evidence to suggest inputs to
       the teaching learning process improved due to the project: the quality of ECD
       suffered from limited Government support; teachers received limited in-service
       training; and children still received textbooks after the start of the school year.
      In a low capacity environment, a strategy to build local level capacity is critical in
       a decentralized service provision model. Low capacity limits the potential of
       various instruments under communities’ control to improve the efficiency and
       quality of schools. Under EFA, distribution of grants was often delayed due to
       overly complex rules and procedures which were not well understood at the
       school-level. Low capacity limited the impact of School Improvement Plans
       which were meant to focus on teaching and learning activities.
      It is important that central, district, and local level roles and responsibilities are
       clearly defined when education provision has been decentralized. In Nepal,
       ambiguities existed as to where ultimate responsibilities for education decision-
       making lie. These ambiguities contributed to the failure of decentralization to
       bring about increases expected in the quality of public education.
      Quality assurance in M&E data is essential when funding is linked to school-level
       data. Verification of the current system suggests irregularities in reporting data:
       scholarship distribution has not followed guidelines and the incentive to over-
       report enrollment data has increased with the introduction of per capita financing.

1. Background and Context
Background
1.1     This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the implementation
experience and outcomes of World Bank support to the Government of Nepal’s
Education For All (EFA) program (2004 – 2009).1 The World Bank has supported
Nepal’s basic education sector for over two decades. Support for EFA is a continuation of
the assistance provided through the Basic and Primary Education projects I and II and the
Community School Support Project. This project was selected for a PPAR as part of a
series of assessments of the Bank’s long-term engagement in Nepal’s education sector
including the Basic and Primary Education Project II and Community School Support
Project prepared by IEG in 2009 and 2010, respectively. This is the first time the
Independent Evaluation Group has conducted a PPAR on an EFA funded project
financed through a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp).

Socio-Economic Context
COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS

1.2     Nepal is a demographically and geographically diverse country. The Central
Bureau of Statistics counted 125 castes and 123 mother tongue languages spoken among
its 26.5 million people (Government of Nepal, 2011). The country is divided into five
development regions (Eastern, Central, Western, Mid-Western, and Far Western) and
four ecological zones (Mountains, Hills, Valley, and Terai). Among these divisions the
geography ranges from rugged mountainous terrain to forests to fertile plains. The
country is divided into 75 districts, comprised of 3,915 villages, 58 municipalities, and
one metropolitan area. Nepal’s topography, traditions, ethnic, and linguistic diversity
have had a hand in isolating certain population segments from access to basic services.
Girls, Dalits and disadvantaged Janajatis are among the most disadvantaged groups in
terms of access to education services.

1.3     Caste and ethnicity are not only highly correlated with access to services but also
with resultant development outcomes, including poverty. Social inclusion, which requires
equitable delivery of basic social services, formed the cornerstone of the “People’s
Movement” in Nepal and a conflict that lasted for ten years (1996-2006).2

  The Government of Nepal’s strategy in the primary education subsector was outlined in its
Education for All Action Plan. The EFA Program is the financing provided by the SWAp donors
to coordinate their activities in support of the Government’s strategy. The share of financing and
activities undertaken by the World Bank in support of the EFA Plan will be referred to as either
the EFA project (or simply the project).

  The EFA project was approved during the conflict. Discussions in the literature are mixed on
the net impact of the conflict on the provision of education.

ECONOMICS

1.4     Education and quality investments in human capital augment the growth process
(Hanushek and Woessmann, 2012). Currently, Nepal is one of the world’s poorest
countries (Table 1.1). Over the past decade, economic growth was fairly stable but low,
averaging four percent per year. The economy depends primarily on agriculture and
services (e.g., agro-processing and tourism). Low educational attainment, in addition to
lack of electricity, and political instability constrain higher economic growth.

1.5     The majority of the population works in the agriculture sector (approximately 64
percent). An estimated 500,000 youth enter the labor force each year facing limited job
openings at home. As a result of low opportunities at home, migration for work is on the
rise and remittances have increased substantially over time. Approximately 1.92 million
young Nepalis were not living in Nepal at the time of the last Census. The majority of
Nepal’s migrant workers abroad are employed in low skilled jobs.

POVERTY

1.6     Nepal has made significant progress in reducing poverty (Table 1.2). Progress on
social inclusion in schooling was made over time and in every income quintile. The
poorest benefitted the most but are still most likely to remain out of school. (Figure 1.1).

Education in Nepal
1.7     Nepal’s vision for education is to instill social values and equip its citizens with
the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the global economy (Government of
Nepal, 2005a).

1.8     At project appraisal in 2004, the primary and secondary education sector in Nepal
was organized as follows: early childhood development and preprimary classes
(ECD/PPE), primary school (grade 1-5), lower secondary school (grade 6-8), secondary
school (grade 9-10) and higher secondary school (grades 11-12). ECD/PPE received little
financial or technical support from the Government of Nepal. Basic education was
considered grades 1-8. The Government provided universal free primary education. As
of 2011 the mean years of schooling for the population 15 and above was 8.2 years
(Government of Nepal, 2011).

1.9     At the time of EFA implementation, there were four broad categories of schools
in Nepal: (i) institutional schools, which are privately funded (ii) community schools
funded by the Government of Nepal; (iii) community managed schools, which are funded
by the Government of Nepal but have chosen to formally transfer management of the
school to the community; and (iv) unaided community schools, which may receive partial
funding from the Government of Nepal. In this document we refer to these schools as
private schools, community schools, community managed schools and unaided
community schools. The last three types of schools received support under the EFA
project.

EVOLUTION OF EDUCATION IN NEPAL

1.10 From 1846 to 1960, the education system in Nepal was limited to the ruling elites
(Table 1.3). The Government and donors maintain that the decentralization reforms
implemented under EFA were an extension of Nepal’s long history and tradition of
community schooling. The tradition of community schooling began in 1951 when schools
were opened by communities, however, these schools were restricted to the upper castes.
Nepal’s experience with an “open” and officially decentralized public education system
(e.g., open to all castes and communities) is relatively short. Given the remoteness of
some schools, even under a centralized system, the day-to-day operation of schools
remained with communities.

1.11 In 1971, with donor support, the Government centralized control over the
education system and began funding public education; communities could establish
schools and would receive Government support.

Table 1.3. Evolution of Education Provision and Structure in Nepal

1846-1950
                party and high caste elites.
                Popular democracy emerges out of the Rana period. The provision of education is
1951-1960       decentralized and School Management Committees are established. Community
                schools are established and managed at the local level with centralized control.
1960            Return to the Panchyat system. The community school system remains in place.
                Panchyat System introduces a centralized system of education, promulgates the
                Education Act of 1971 and introduces the National Education System Plan (with
1971-2001       the help of donors). The Act defines “community schools” and “institutional
                schools". All schools require government approval for establishment and
                operation. Only community schools receive regular funding from the Government.
                The 7th Amendment to the Education Act of 1971 decentralizes education and
                formally establishes School Management Committees (SMCs) in every community
2001            school “…for its operation, supervision and management…” Primary level
                education in community schools is legally free, including the provision of free
                textbooks.

TRENDS IN EDUCATION 1999 TO 2003

1.12 The Government, the World Bank, and other Development Partners have
supported reforms to achieve access, equity, and efficiency in Nepal’s basic and primary
public education system for two decades. The Bank has supported these objectives since
1999 through four projects: Basic and Primary Education Project (BPEP I); BPEP II;
Community School Sector Project (CSSP), and EFA. Support continues with the School
Sector Reform Project, the follow-on project to EFA.

1.13 Trends in education indicators between 1999 and 2003 were mixed. Few children
were enrolled in preprimary school in 2003 indicating a late start to implementing early
                                                      5


childhood education in Nepal. Significant gains were made in net primary enrollment,
which increased from 69 percent in 1999 to 84 percent in 2003. By 2003, Nepal
performed well against other South Asian countries in terms of enrollments. Drop-out
and survival rates had improved, yet repetition rates remained high. Little progress was
made on eliminating the gender gap in access to primary education (Table 1.4).

Note: Gender parity index calculated on gross enrollment.

1.14 On 2003 national tests of student achievement, fifth grade students answered half
of all questions (52 percent) correctly, on average. At that time, boys and girls performed
equally. Results were not disaggregated by caste, ethnicity, or income group making
differential performance measurement among these groups and more advantaged students
impossible. In 2004, performance on the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) examination
taken after completing 10th grade indicated extremely low knowledge gained. The pass
rate for public school 10th graders on the SLC was 38 percent compared to an 85 percent
pass rate for their private school peers (Bhatta, 2005). This result would suggest students
whose families have the means to pay for an education were learning more.

1.15 Achievements in primary education coincided with liberalization of private school
policies and a surge in demand for private education – fueled by perceived higher quality
as compared to public primary education (Carney and Bista, 2009). Currently,
remittances are also driving private school enrollment. Fees to attend private schools
exclude those who cannot afford to pay for schooling; students attending private schools
tend to be from higher income families.

REGULATION AND PROVISION OF PRIMARY EDUCATION

1.16 The central Government continues to make policies, fund, regulate, and supervise
the education system in Nepal. At the local level, districts, schools, and local
communities act as the implementing agencies of national policies and are expected to
ensure local priorities for education are addressed.

1.17 Decentralization has been the driving force in education reform in Nepal. In 1999,
Nepal passed the Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) which effectively reinstituted
community management of government services. LGSA devolved decision-making
authority for education service delivery from the central government to District
Development Committees (DDC) and Municipalities.
                                                        6


1.18 The 2001 7th Amendment to the Education Act of 1971 formalized the
relationship between the central government and local bodies by renaming all schools
“community schools” and re-establishing SMCs. Certain ambiguities exist between the
LSGA and the Amendment to the Education Act. In the former, ultimate responsibility
for education decision-making lies with the DDC while in the latter, more power is
vested with the Village Education Committee (VEC) and decision-making authority was
handed to SMCs.

1.19 Under both Acts, education planning was envisioned as a bottom up process. The
7th Amendment outlined a process of school-level education planning through school
improvement plans (SIP) upon which higher level plans (i.e., village, district, national)
were built. Since the dissolution of local bodies in 2002 (elections have yet to be held),
Village Development Committees (VDC) and VECs have not been as instrumental in
school planning as envisioned. Locally elected officials at the district level were replaced
by government appointed civil servants. District education planning goes from the
schools to the District Education Officer (DEO) who is essentially a central level
employee. In effect, the system remains highly centralized.

1.20 Per EFA project documentation, SMCs have been given the authority to mobilize
resources for schools, participate in the SIP process; approve the school’s annual budget;
provide day-to-day operating, monitoring, and managing support to schools; arrange for
the auditing of the annual school budget; present yearly financial statements to
community stakeholders; and report on educational progress and planning. The
community, SMCs, parents, and teachers are responsible for ensuring that block grants
disbursed to schools are properly allocated and efficiently used (World Bank, 2004b;
Independent Evaluation Group, 2010a; CERID, 2004; CERID, 2005). Both community
schools and community managed schools continue to receive earmarked grant funding
for teachers’ salaries as before but now also receive block grant funding which includes
both the earmarked component and a non-earmarked component. The latter consists of a
general block grant awarded to community managed schools (incentive grant for
transferring), a SIP grant awarded to all community schools, and performance-based
incentive grants for which all schools are eligible (Table 1.5).

REMAINING CHALLENGES IN PRIMARY EDUCATION IN 2003

1.21 Since 1992, the Bank, in coordination with other donors, has supported the
government in reforms focusing on three primary objectives: building institutional
capacity in education at all levels of decision-making (e.g., central, district, and school);
improving the efficiency and quality of education services; and improving equity in
access to education, especially for girls and students from disadvantaged communities.

1.22 Despite continuous donor support and the improvements achieved toward
universal access to primary education, at the time of project approval challenges
remained in all four areas – education access, equity, efficiency, and quality. Nepal’s
promise of free primary education had not come to pass; public schools continued to
charge fees to students, reducing the demand for education especially among the poor.
More than one-quarter of school age children remained out of school. Out-of-school
children were disproportionately girls, Dalits, and other disadvantaged children.
Repetition rates remained relatively high at the primary level and completion rates
remained low, indicating inefficiencies in the system. The quality of public primary
education remained low causing an outflow of children from families who could afford to
send their children to private school, where quality was perceived to be higher
(Government of Nepal, 2003a). Finally, central recruitment of teachers through the
Teacher Service Commission (TSC) reduced the accountability of teachers to schools,
contributed to an inefficient deployment of teachers (in favor of urban and semi-urban
posts to remote rural areas), and created a mismatch between teacher subject knowledge
demand and supply (World Bank, 2004b).

1.23 Donor support to the Government’s Education for All program was designed to
address these challenges and to support the Government’s commitment to the global
Education for All initiative. Nepal had committed to attain Education For All as a
signatory to the Jomtien Declaration on Education for All (1990). Nepal recommitted
itself to achieving its goal of universal access to basic and primary education by adopting
the six goals introduced in the Dakar Framework for Action in 2000. In collaboration
with the United Nation’s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
the Ministry of Education3 (MOE) designed its National EFA Plan of Action which
outlined the strategic framework to achieve each of the EFA goals by 2015 and forms
Nepal’s primary education strategy to 2015.



2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
Objectives
2.1    The objectives of the project as stated in the Development Credit Agreement
(DCA) and the Financing Agreement were to ensure access and equity to primary
education, improve efficiency and institutional capacity; and contribute to sustainable


3
    Originally the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES).
                                                    8


socioeconomic development and equity through the enhancement of quality and
relevance of basic primary education to children and illiterate adults (in Nepal).

2.2     The project’s objectives encompass all six EFA goals: expanding and improving
early childhood education, ensuring access to education for all children, meeting the
learning needs of all children including indigenous peoples and linguistic minorities,
improving adult literacy, eliminating gender disparity, and improving all aspects of
quality education. Emphasis on linguistic minorities and mother tongue education was an
additional requirement added by the Government of Nepal.

2.3      The project had three components – improving access and equity; enhancing
quality and relevance; and improving efficiency and institutional capacity.4 The first
component, improving access and equity supported infrastructure development, financial
aid to disadvantaged students, and non-formal education to out-of-school children. The
component was comprehensive, targeting physical and financial barriers to education for
poor girls, disadvantaged students, and the hard to reach school-age population (e.g., in
remote areas such as the Karnali region). The second component, enhancing quality and
relevance, involved overall improvements in children’s learning environments through
facilities up-grades and the expansion of programs to prepare teachers and students for
quality classroom interactions. Regularly scheduled, school-based, in-service teacher
training for primary school teachers was supposed to assist teachers transfer knowledge
to students, while early childhood development programs in remote and disadvantaged
areas and mother-tongue language support was supposed to improve children’s readiness
to learn. The third component, improving efficiency and institutional capacity, aimed to
decentralize the provision of education in Nepal through an expanded block grant
program and community school management to improve all aspects of schooling at the
local level (i.e. access, equity, and quality) through gains in efficiency. Table 2.1
describes the project’s components and activities.

PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

2.4    The project was implemented as a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) – the first in
Nepal’s education sector (Box 2.1). The project disbursed against the Government’s
Annual Work Program and Budget (AWPB) and Annual Strategic Implementation Plan
(ASIP) for the primary education sector, jointly determined by Development Partners and
the Government.

2.5    The SWAp arrangement included pooling funds for regular and development
expenditures; resources were pooled with government budgetary resources. The SWAp
had five original pooling members: the Department for International Development
(DFID), Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA), Norwegian Agency
for Development Cooperation (NORAD), Finland Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
Australian Agency for International Development (AusAid). The Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) joined as pooling
donors bringing the total to seven by project closing. Parallel funding was provided by
non-pooling donor agencies including the Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA), World Food Program (WFP), and UNCESCO.

2.6   The nature of the SWAp financing arrangement made it impossible to distinguish
IDA expenditures by activity or to breakdown IDA commitments and disbursements by
component.

Box 2.1. The EFA Sector-Wide Approach
Donors supported the Government of Nepal’s EFA National Plan of Action (NPA) (2001-2015)
through a Sector-wide Approach (SWAp). The Education for All (EFA) 2004-2009 SWAp was
introduced to support an integrated, holistic framework for education reform versus a piecemeal
approach focusing on either school infrastructure, teacher development, or curricular
development in isolation of the primary school system (Asia South Pacific Association for Basic
and Adult Education, 2010). The approach was developed in response to perceived
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of project-based development assistance due to fragmentation of
effort and heavy managerial burden placed on the Government of Nepal. The EFA SWAp was
seen as a means not only to move away from a traditional project approach but also to generate
more support for recurrent costs (e.g., teachers’ salaries); facilitate donor coordination and
harmonization; and lower transaction costs.
In studies of health and education SWAps, Vaillencort (2009 and 2012) found evidence
supporting the claim of improved donor harmonization along the dimensions of a country-led
partnership and use of national systems but little evidence to support reduced transaction costs.
Only modest evidence of improvements in the efficiency of resource allocation (improved sector
stewardship) was found. A realistic, evidence-based strategy, national and local capacity,
inclusive partnerships, and predictable funding were associated with the effectiveness of the
approach, some of which were missing in Nepal (e.g., evidence base, capacity).


Relevance of the Objectives and Design
RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.7    The relevance of the project's objectives was rated high. The objectives were
relevant at the time of approval and remain relevant today. Significant progress in access
to primary education had been made in the period prior to this project – primary net
enrollment rates had increased but the hardest to reach student populations remained out
of school. For example, both enrollment and retention of girls, Dalits, and other
disadvantaged students remained lower than their more advantaged peers (Government of
Nepal, 2011). High repetition and drop-out rates were symptomatic of the inefficiency
and low quality of the primary education system (see Section 1). The project’s objectives
sought to address the remaining challenges in the primary education sector and to attain
universal primary education, defined as a quality primary education for all relevant
children and an equivalent level of literacy for adults.

2.8      The objective was fully aligned with the Government of Nepal’s national
priorities. The objective was consistent with the goals of the Government’s Tenth Plan
(2002-2007) to improve broad-based economic growth, social sector development, social
inclusion, and good governance. The objectives supported the Tenth Plan’s over-arching
goal to reduce poverty through inclusive and equitable growth and improved processes
for service delivery (HMGN, 2003c). Post-conflict, the project remained consistent with
the Government’s objectives as outlined in its National Development Strategy Paper
(2008) and successive Three Year Interim Plans, the most recent of which (2011-2013)
remained committed to improving the living standard of all Nepalese people through
equitable and sustainable economic growth. Education remained a priority sector to
achieve poverty alleviation, sustainable peace through employment-centric, inclusive,
                                           11


and equitable economic growth (Government of Nepal, 2010a). The objective remains
highly relevant in the context of the Government’s basic and primary education strategy
and the National EFA Plan to 2015.

2.9     At approval, the objective was fully aligned with the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) in Nepal (2004-2007), which supported broad based economic growth
and social sector development. Universal access to an inclusive, quality primary
education system was emphasized in the CAS. The Interim Strategy Note in 2009
adopted more flexibility and selectivity given the post-conflict situation. The Bank
committed to the over-arching goal to consolidate peace and promote development. The
project’s objective supported the Bank’s objectives to promote capable state structures
and systems, foster accountable institutions, and to lay the foundation for sustainable
inclusive development (World Bank, 2009). Education served the dual purpose of
fostering both economic development and peace-building. At project closure, the
objective remained relevant to the Bank’s strategy in Nepal. Equitable access to
education remains a priority for the Bank’s goal to increase inclusive growth and
opportunities for shared prosperity (World Bank, 2013).

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.10 The relevance of project design is rated modest. Project activities were designed
to be complementary and synergistic and many activities supported more than one
intended outcome. There was a theoretical link between project inputs and intended
outcomes. However, project design was ambitious and complex in a low capacity
environment like Nepal.

2.11 Project activities were relevant to achieve the first objective of increased access
and equity to primary education. Given the improvements in net enrollment rates between
1995 and 2003 expanding and rehabilitating classrooms to improve the availability of
education was highly appropriate. Taking into consideration the relatively high overall
level of enrollment, the project rightly emphasized increasing the demand for education
among historically excluded and hardest to reach populations.

2.12 The design for the objective to improve efficiency and institutional capacity had
shortcomings. Activities to improve school-level efficiency emphasized decentralized
provision of education and empowerment of school management committees and local
communities, in particular decision-making authority and control over flexible resources.
The necessary conditions for successful school-based or site-based management were not
fully met (CERID, 2007; Barrera-Osoria, Felipe, et al. 2009). There were ambiguities in
the definition of autonomy and the precise levels, ways, and means to achieve
participation in decision-making. In particular, roles and responsibilities of SMCs were
inconsistent between the Acts and Regulations and relevant Operational Directives and
Guidelines (CERID, 2007). The accountability mechanisms were weak and support for
capacity building limited. There was some ambiguity in the need for incentive grants
when all schools were required to establish SMCs. The project scaled-up school
improvement planning tied to non-earmarked Government grants disbursing directly to
schools however, the amount of flexible funding was small limiting the potential benefits
of community control over resources. The ambiguities between formally transferred
                                             12


community schools and regular community schools have been noted (Independent
Evaluation Group, 2010). Finally, little evidence of the effectiveness of school-based
management existed at project approval, as the project was designed to scale-up the
model before the pilot project was completed and evaluated.

2.13 Capacity building activities for district and school level stakeholders were
incorporated into project design, however, the project lacked a clearly defined and
strategically prioritized capacity development plan. Institutional capacity was poorly
defined and no outcomes were provided to measure attainment toward the objective. This
was a significant shortcoming in design in a low capacity environment like Nepal.

2.14 Low capacity at all levels and weak internal controls limited the SWAp’s
appropriateness as a funding vehicle. Concerns remain about central, district, and local
(e.g. school management committees) capacity to implement the SWAp. There are also
concerns about sustainability, as these processes are significantly donor driven (Asia
South Pacific Association for Basic and Adult Education, 2010).

2.15 Project activities were relevant to achieve the objective to enhance the quality and
relevance of basic primary education to children and illiterate adults, with the above
qualification on school based management. The link between project inputs and intended
outcomes was generally clear. Activities addressed quality from several different angles
such as teacher training, privatization of textbook delivery (to improve the timely
delivery of learning materials), early childhood development (to improve readiness to
learn), and support to literacy programs (to achieve basic literacy for all). Given the slow
progress in improving the quality of education with continued donor support, insufficient
emphasis was placed on improving the quality of education. Activities supporting early
childhood development focused on establishing of centers with little emphasis on quality
of provision. Activities to support adult literacy were insufficient for the attainment of the
objective.

2.16 Improvements in the quality of education were also assumed to follow from
activities supporting decentralization and improved accountability. While a theoretical
link between decentralization, accountability, and improved student learning had been
established (World Bank, 2004a), little empirical evidence of the effectiveness of school-
based management existed at project approval.

Implementation
2.17 The project was approved on July 8, 2004, became effective on August 27, 2004,
and closed on January 31, 2010. There were no extensions and the project closed on time
but at significantly higher cost than at appraisal.

2.18 Project Costs. At closing, total project cost amounted to US$989.3 million. The
Government financed the majority of the project – US$703 million. Donor support
totaled US$286 million. Initial funding for the project was through an International
Development Association (IDA) credit of US$50 million. Additional Financing of US$60
million in the form of an IDA grant was approved in November, 2007. Additional grant
financing was approved to accommodate the Government's commitment to provide free
                                           13


primary education which required: more classroom space to accommodate increasing
enrollment; an increase in the number and amount of scholarships for girls and Dalits;
additional teachers to reduce high student-teacher ratios in some regions; an unexpected
27 percent increase in permanent teachers’ salaries; and an 11 percent fluctuation in
exchange rates (World Bank, 2007a).

2.19 Project costs exceeded appraisal costs. Table 2.2 presents the appraisal and actual
financing from IDA, pooled donors, and the Government.

2.20 Implementation Experience. The project’s primary Implementing Agency was
the Department of Education (DOE) working in close consultation with local education
offices. Most of the project’s activities were implemented by District Education Officers
(DEO) and schools.

2.21 The main implementation challenge during EFA was insufficient capacity at all
levels. Local level capacity building activities did not provide enough support to DEOs,
Head Teachers, teachers, parents, or communities to fulfill the new requirements imposed
under EFA. The Mid-Term Review concluded that simplification of the processes for
grant allocations, clear guidance on school improvement plans, and measures to improve
accountability were needed (DANIDA, 2006). Activities to address capacity constraints
were proposed post-Mid Term Review but the project continued to concentrate resources
on improving access, equity, and quality without sufficiently addressing capacity
development.

2.22 Fiduciary. Financial management was considered high risk at project appraisal.
IDA and other SWAp partners jointly financed (along with Government finance) the
Government’s EFA Program, including both development and regular expenditures. Each
year, a mutually agreed upon Annual Strategic Implementation Plan (ASIP) and
accompanying Annual Work Program and Budget (AWPB) for the sub-sector were
determined by donors and the Government of Nepal. IDA funds financed a percentage of
all eligible expenditures covered under the AWPB. IDA funds were disbursed into a
Foreign Exchange account with Nepal Rastra Bank.

2.23 The World Bank took the lead among donors on financial management in this
SWAp. Financial Management remained a concern throughout implementation. Weak
internal controls and low capacity were major shortcomings in financial management.
The Office of the Auditor General consistently highlighted shortcomings in financial
                                             14


reporting. Audited financial reports highlighted areas of improvement including:
integration of financial reporting with the Financial Comptroller General’s Office
(FCGO); capacity for financial reporting at the school level (often done by head teachers
or teachers with no financial or accounting training); alignment of planned donor
allocation and expenditures and actual allocations and expenditures; elimination of
ineligible expenditures, such as over-disbursements of school grants for teachers’
salaries; timeliness of late audits and financial reporting; and compliance with social
audits.

2.24 The Bank commissioned a detailed Financial Management and Procurement
Review at the Mid-Term Review and DFID undertook another assessment in 2007. The
Government of Nepal produced a Financial Management Action Plan which was
accepted by the Bank and donors. The DOE made slow progress toward implementing
the Action Plan.

2.25 Safeguards. The project was classified as a Category B project. Two safeguards
were triggered: environment (OP 4.01) and indigenous peoples (OP 4.10).

2.26 Environmental impacts were assumed to be minimal given that the majority of
construction would entail rehabilitation of classrooms on existing school properties. An
Environmental Management Plan and National Environmental Guidelines (His Majesty’s
Government of Nepal, 2004b) were prepared for school improvements. An Environment
Assessment was not conducted although there was some concern that proposed new
construction would be located in forests or other protected areas. Concerns were also
raised that construction prove resilient to natural catastrophe e.g., to ensure construction
in earthquake prone areas was compliant with safety guidelines.

2.27 A Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP) was prepared to address
possible negative impacts on the learning needs of indigenous peoples which
recommended home-to-school transitional support programs, recruiting bilingual female
teachers in areas with a majority of linguistic minority students and families,
disaggregation of education statistics by gender and ethnicity, and efforts to enhance
partnerships between SMCs and the communities. The VCDP was consistent with the
Government’s Indigenous People’s Development Plan. All VDCP recommendations
were incorporated into project design.

2.28 The project in-and-of itself was considered a mitigating factor for OP 4.10 given
its strong focus on removing barriers to educational opportunities and emphasis on social
inclusion especially of individuals who had historically been excluded from education
based on their gender, caste, ethnicity, or other considerations.


3. Achievement of the Objectives
3.1     The project’s design relied on a set of mutually reinforcing activities to achieve
three outcomes: ensuring access and equity in primary education; improving efficiency
and institutional capacity; and enhancing the quality and relevance of basic primary
education to children and illiterate adults.
                                               15


Ensuring Access and Equity in Primary Education
3.2    The project’s results framework was designed to measure access using net
enrollment rates by gender, caste, and ethnicity (Table 3.1). The two primary activities
under increasing access and equity were construction, rehabilitation, and improvement of
physical sites and provision of scholarships to disadvantaged students.

3.3     Prior to the earthquake, output targets were met or exceeded (Table 3.2). National
survey data support the evidence of increased enrollment and achievements in gender
parity. National survey data also indicated progress toward equity using outcome
measures by income quintile (Figure 3.1 and Table 3.4).

3.4    However, the 2015 earthquake destroyed approximately 30 percent of the 2011
stock of community schools, and destroyed or damaged 40 percent of the stock of
classrooms in the basic primary subsector (including facility improvements).5 In light of
the Region’s comments that “In most parts of the country, classes were resumed in newly
constructed transitional/temporary learning centers within a month after the
earthquake…” the achievement of this objective is rated substantial.

  These figures were calculated based on damage estimates in the Nepal Earthquake Post Disaster
Needs Assessment Report (World Bank, 2015) and the stock of existing schools and classrooms
as of 2010-11 (Government of Nepal, 2012). On April 25, 2015, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake
struck Nepal along with several aftershocks. Fourteen districts in the Kathmandu Valley were
heavily impacted by the earthquakes. In total 8,242 community schools were impacted by the
earthquake: 26,080 classrooms were completely destroyed and another 26,090 classrooms
partially destroyed. Further damage to toilets, sanitation, and compound infrastructure assets was
estimated to be around 6,200 in number. Recovery and reconstruction estimates in the basic
education sector are estimated at US$361 million. The number of EFA funded schools destroyed
or damaged in the earthquake was requested but not available as of November 2015.

OUTPUTS

3.5     Prior to the earthquake, construction and rehabilitation of classrooms
targets had been exceeded. Overall, the project supported the construction of
classrooms throughout the country on a cost-sharing basis with communities.
Construction grants were provided to schools through DEOs; schools were responsible
for contracting and monitoring civil works under overall supervision of District
Education Officers. The project prioritized building and rehabilitating classrooms and
providing essential services to enhance the learning environment of students and to
accommodate enrollment and attendance (i.e., improving school sites through additions
of drinking water, toilets and separate toilet facilities for girls).

3.6    The project targeted building 8,000 new classrooms. An unforeseen shortfall of
classrooms was identified during implementation, stemming from the lack of primary
schools in some areas and rising enrollments in others. This led to significant increases
in expenditures related to construction. The project constructed over 17,000 classrooms,
exceeding its target.

3.7    Similarly, the targeted number of 6,000 rehabilitated classrooms was exceeded
with 9,379 rehabilitated prior to the earthquake. The project exceeded its target to
improve 5,000 school sites by providing fencing, water, and toilet facilities to 7,934
schools (Table 3.2). Although the baseline and achievement data are not strictly
comparable, in 2010, 94 percent of classrooms were useable and in need of no repairs. No
data were available on classrooms meeting the minimum conditions outlined at project
approval.

3.8     Scholarship distribution for girls was close to targets but fell short of targets
for Dalits. Table 3.3 presents the annual number of scholarships reported. Scholarships
were the primary vehicle to incentivize poor girls and disadvantaged students to enroll in
and stay in school. Caste and ethnicity are highly correlated with income; scholarships to
these groups were also used to improve equity in access to education. The project
document set an annual target of 650,000 scholarships per year (World Bank, 2004b).
However, actual targets set by the ASIP varied by year. For example, the target for girls’
scholarships ranged from 560,000 in 2005 to 829,000 in 2009.

3.9     There were shortcomings in the use of scholarship to increase enrollment. The
scholarship incentive mechanism was complex. Scholarship money was disbursed as part
of earmarked grants to schools, however, the rules for allocation and distribution were
not well understood causing delays in disbursement at the school level. Overall
responsibility for identifying scholarship recipients and distributing and monitoring
scholarships was assigned to the SMCs. In practice, the amount disbursed was
determined by the District Education Officer based on enrollment data provided by the
school.

†No revision to the targets was made even though additional financing was granted. The flexible nature of developing
ASIPs and setting the AWPB along with the shortfall of classrooms reported in Implementation Status Reports suggests
the these targets may have changed. For example, for the 2007/08 school year, the Government’s targeted number of
new classroom construction was 11,568 of which 4,670 were built (Government of Nepal. Flash II 2007-08).
a Based on 2001 EMIS data.
b Not strictly comparable to the baseline figure. The share refers to classrooms that are usable, adequate, and not in

need of repair or renovation.

3.11 Reports, supervision documents, and discussions with stakeholders both in
Kathmandu and in the field suggested that scholarships were insufficient to cover the
opportunity cost of attending school. Originally the scholarship was set at 250 Nepalese
Rupees (NPR) per year, later the amount was raised to 350 NPR per year. A 2006 study
reported the direct costs to parents of a primary education were NPR 819 per year (books,
fees, etc.) and that the value of household chores done by primary school aged child was
as much as NPR 4,607 per year (Acharya and Luitel, 2006).

3.12 During field visits, some stakeholders told IEG that the actual number of
scholarships distributed to students were of smaller amounts and likely greater in number
than the officially reported numbers (Table 3.3). Scholarships for girls and Dalits were
distributed based on criteria other than those outlined by the project. Scholarships to
promote enrollment, attendance, and retention of excluded groups were sometimes
distributed based on students’ academic merit or distributed to all girls, since distribution
to only 50 percent of girls seemed unfair, or distributed to students outside targeted
groups based on teachers’ selection criteria (Acharya and Luitel, 2006). Receiving school
uniforms or stationary instead of money was also found.

OUTCOMES: WAS THERE ACHIEVEMENT IN ACCESS AND EQUITY?

3.13 Nepal made substantial progress toward enrollment and inclusion. By 2010,
access to primary education had substantially increased, gender parity was achieved in
primary education, and improvements were made in access to primary education for
otherwise disadvantaged students. Equity in educational outcomes by income improved
(Table 3.4).

3.14 Reliability of education data remains a major concern. Net enrollments rates
as reported by the Education Management Information System (EMIS or Flash Reports)
differ substantially from those reported by National Living Standards Survey (NLSS)
data (Figure 3.2). The NLSS reports enrollment rates approximately 15 percentage points
lower than those in Flash reports. By either source, net enrollment for girls increased
substantially over the project period. NLSS data show a slight decrease in the net
enrollment rate for boys over the project period. Net enrollment in 2010 according to
NLSS was 78 percent; higher for girls (80 percent) than boys (77 percent). Flash data
report 95 percent net enrollment for both boys and girls. These data are not strictly
comparable but the difference is something to note especially given concerns over the
quality of Flash data.6

  Recent evidence has shown that there are issues with the validity of the reported data. Per capita
financing creates an incentive to inflate enrollment figures. Technical reviews, CERID research,
commissioned studies, and stakeholder interviews indicated a tendency to over-report student
numbers. Recent data from a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) conducted as part of
the School Sector Reform Project suggests enrollments are inflated by 8 percent, confirming
reports of “ghost” students – students who do not exist but still figure into textbook and PCF
grants (World Bank, 2014).

3.15 Figure 3.1 also shows that the number of students enrolling in community schools
rose and fell over the project period, especially for boys. The number of students was
higher overall at project closure.

3.16 Gender parity is widely recognized as having been achieved. By any data
source, the enrollment of girls has increased substantially (Figure 3.2). The share of out-
of-school girls has decreased substantially from 22 percent to 6 percent (Table 3.4).7
Enrollment of boys has stabilized or decreased slightly between 2003 and 2010. The
stabilization in boys’ enrollment may stem from already high rates of enrollment.

3.17 Parity in enrollment across income groups was also achieved. (Table 3.4). In
2003, fewer poor children were enrolled in primary school than rich children. By 2011,
students in the lowest income quintile had almost identical enrollment rates as those in
the highest income quintile. The pattern of enrollment rates by income quintile suggests
the project was successfully pro-poor and improved equity in enrollment.

 Over the same period the proportion of out-of-school boys was reduced from 10 percent to six
percent.

3.18 Primary education had become more inclusive as of 2009. Good progress was
made toward achieving overall population representative enrollments by caste and
ethnicity (Figures 3.3 and 3.4). However, the extent to which Dalit and Janajati students
were included in primary education varied by district (Norad, 2009).

3.19 Net attendance rates were considerably lower than enrollment. This raises
concerns about the achievement of a larger access-related objective, especially among the
poor where attendance is lower still, which has implications for equity (Figure 3.5). The
Midterm Evaluation for the School Sector Reform Program reports a net attendance rate
of 78 percent in 2010 (Flash data). Survey data suggest net attendance rates between 66
and 69 percent (World Bank, 2014). Low attendance points to an area that Nepal will
need to address in order to boost low student achievement. The pattern of net attendance
rates suggests an area to focus on within attendance is equity.

3.20 There are factors outside the project that may have impacted access and equity in
primary education. Education is a normal good and increases in income increase the
demand for education. Over the project period Nepal experienced increases in remittance
inflows. While remittances are largely believed to increase expenditures on private
schools, the increase in income has likely impacted public school enrollment and
retention as well, especially for poorer families. There is some evidence that suggests
much of Nepal’s success in improving its human development outcomes, at least during
the conflict period, was a result of remittances (World Bank, 2006).

Improving Efficiency and Institutional Capacity
3.21 Achievement of improving efficiency and institutional capacity is rated modest.
Institutional capacity received little attention. Gains were made in improving internal
efficiency, however, it is difficult to connect these gains with project activities.

3.22 Under the Education For All project, the Government of Nepal introduced and
strengthened a number of reforms to improve efficiency and institutional capacity. The
kernel of this objective was to decentralize decision-making powers to the local level, in
particular to the SMCs. This was to be achieved through two channels: (i) control over
education resources and (ii) control over school management. The results chain is
presented in Table 3.5.

3.23 In both cases, the underlying assumption was that education resources would be
used more efficiently when individuals closest to the schools decided how to improve
educational performance. Due to the diversity of community characteristics in Nepal,
local solutions were assumed to be the best way to boost efficiency at the school level
through more efficient allocation of resources, increased accountability of resource use
(e.g., teachers), and improved transparency. Improvement in institutional capacity was
critically linked to the achievement improved efficiency through decentralized decision-
making.

3.24 Project activities also focused on improving efficiency in the early grades through
expansion of ECD to reduce the number of children under the age of six attending first
grade classes (see discussion under quality below, for achievement of ECD outcomes).

3.25 Capacity building was not well-defined in project documents. The institutional
capacity objective was pitched at the output level; no outcome measures were defined.

OUTPUTS

3.26 Most schools have a School Management Committee. The Department of
Education reports that 93 percent of schools in Nepal have SMCs8 (Government of
Nepal, 2012a). Formation of SMCs was not a new concept introduced under EFA.
Community managed schools have a long history in Nepal. And, as noted earlier, the
provisions for SMCs were formally laid out in the 7th and 8th Amendments to the
Education Act of 2001 and included teacher recruitment authorities such as the authority
to hire and fire community-recruited teachers, allocate grants monies to implement SIPs,
and oversee the use of earmarked grants e.g. distributions for textbooks and scholarships
(His Majesty’s Government of Nepal 2001, 2004; CERID, 2004; CERID, 2009; World
Bank, 2014). In theory, SMCs in community managed schools have more authority over
Government-funded teacher positions than SMCs in community schools. In reality, the
DEO has retained significant power over teacher appointments, placement, and transfers.
Community managed schools and community schools have the same authority over the
teaching cadre – SMCs in both schools only recruit community-funded teachers (Khanal,
2011).9 High performing schools as well as high-functioning SMCs are still a function of
dynamic Head Teachers.


8
    SMCs are required in all schools, including private schools.
9
  Currently there are five categories of teachers in Nepal: permanent, temporary, fixed-term
government teachers (rahat teachers), Per Capita Financed, and community teachers. Permanent
teachers have passed the TSC’s selection criteria and are appointed by the Commission.
Permanent teachers are government employees who enjoy government salaries, benefits, and job
security. Temporary teachers are teachers in government approved positions who have yet to sit
                                                 23


3.27 Limited Government support was provided through SIP grants. By project
closure, 77 percent of funding was allocated through block grants surpassing the target of
60 percent (Table 3.6). These flexible resources were intended for teacher learning
materials, capacity development, library development, etc. (UNESCO, 2014) to be
determined by the local community. Earmarked grants for recurrent expenditures (e.g.,
teacher salaries and textbooks) accounted for 80 percent of grant funding. Grants were
disbursed from the DEO directly to schools. The expanded block grants were contingent
on SMC preparation of SIPs.

3.28 The Ministry of Education produced guidelines for the provision of block grants,
conducted communication and outreach programs, and training for district staff, SMCs,
teachers, and communities on the grant program. However, reports indicate that the rules
and procedures for distributing grants were not well understood and a clear understanding
at the school level was lacking often causing delays in the distribution of grant money.
The Mid-Term Review suggested simplifying the entire block grant facility.

3.29 SIPs are prepared in the majority of schools in Nepal. By project closure,
18,000 schools report preparing SIPs. Although envisioned as vehicles for needs-based
educational planning to improve access and quality through an efficient allocation of
resources, SIPs were generally numbers-based reports based on previous year enrollment
figures. The MTR found the SIP ineffective (DANIDA, 2006).

3.30 The targeted number of schools was transferred to community school
management. By July 2011, there were 28,057 community schools in operation in
Nepal. Of these, 11,902 were community managed schools (Government of Nepal,
2012a). Approximately 9,867 schools were transferred to community management under
EFA, just shy of the target of 10,000 schools. The number is not broken down between
primary and secondary school levels. Over the EFA time period, including activities
under CSSP, 7,944 schools offering primary education had transferred to community
management. The rigidity of the teacher management system hindered successful
implementation of school autonomy (CERID, 2009). Interviews with staff confirmed no
significant difference between community schools and community managed schools.

3.31 No systematic capacity building efforts were undertaken at the local level
(CERID, 2009). Capacity building activities generally cited as part of EFA included
orientation for SMCs, PTAs, and HTs on aspects of access; school management, school
grants, and parental awareness; and social mobilization. Successful capacity building
measures to improve participation of SMCs, school-level education planning, allocation
of SIP resources, etc. were intended to contribute to both efficiency and quality
outcomes.

3.32 Capacity building at the central level was assumed through the use of Government
systems to implement EFA. The Ministry of Education produced guidelines for the


for the licensing test. In an attempt to rectify the unequal distribution of teachers, the DOE began
to fund rahat and contract teachers (per capita financing or “PCF” teachers). Finally,
communities have the authority to hire community-funded teachers.

provision of block grants, conducted communication and outreach programs, and training
for district staff, SMCs, teachers, and communities on the grant program.

OUTCOMES: DID EFFICIENCY AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY IMPROVE?

3.33 Overall the internal efficiency10 of primary education has improved. The
project likely contributed to the reductions in repetition and drop-out rates, although
drop-out rates remain high in grade 1. Output targets were generally met.

3.34 Repetition rates began to improve during the project period. A major source
of internal inefficiency is grade repetition. As discussed above, net attendance in Nepal is
low which can result in the need to repeat grades. Repetition can also result from poor
quality of education. The project did not set targets for reductions in repetition rates. It
did, however, expect lower repetition in grade one due to a reduction in under-age
students and improved quality of entry through the increased ECD experience.

3.35 There is some evidence to suggest that the reductions in repetition and drop-out
rates are due to the transfer of schools to community school management. Still, net
attendance rates remained low over the project period, the quality of ECD was low, and
the quality of education did not improve over the project period (see discussion below).
The liberal promotion policy introduced in 2003 could also have contributed to
reductions in repetition rates – moving students through the system regardless of
achievement of learning.

3.36 Repetition rates declined over all grades but remained high in grade one. Table
3.6 shows the repetition rates by grade.

to compare the trend prior to the project. Low student retention especially in the early

    In the education sector, internal efficiency measures the number of years it takes a student to
graduate a particular grade, for example grade five (the end of primary education in Nepal)
relative to the number of years it should take a child to pass through grade five (i.e., the optimal
number of years). Ideally, the coefficient of efficiency would be one (1). Common measurements
of internal efficiency include the repetition rate and the dropout rate, as well as aggregate
indicators of enrollment (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2009).

grades was a significant problem in Nepal. Drop-out rates decrease after grade one but
increase again at grade five indicating many students never graduate from primary
education. Table 3.7 shows the specific dropout rate per grade in 2003 and 2010. A
substantial reduction in the grade one drop-out rate was achieved – from roughly 15
percent of students to eight percent – and again at grade five (from 14 percent to six
percent), indicating a greater share of students remaining in primary education to the end
grades. The trend is reflected in the survival rate to grade five which improved over the
project period (see discussion below).

3.38 Community managed schools have made greater strides in reducing
repetition rates as compared to community schools. Chaudhury and Parajuli (2010)
conducted an impact evaluation comparing access, equity, and quality indicators of
community managed schools transferred during the EFA period, with those obtained in
community schools. The authors’ estimates found positive impacts associated with
community school management with respect to efficiency outcomes – a 12.3 percentage
point reduction in primary school repetition rates which was significantly greater than the
reduction in repetition rates in community schools. Qualitative evidence supports these
findings. Full Bright (2011) reports lower drop-out rates were associated with community
managed schools (as reported by stakeholders randomly selected for the study).

3.39 While the project targeted reduction in repetition and dropout rates
improved, other systemic efficiencies persist. Approximately two-thirds of the
Government’s spending on its EFA Program was allocated to teachers’ salaries and
pensions. In 2006, the MTR reported that the allocation of teachers was not based on
need, having identified an unequal and inefficient allocation of teachers across Nepalese
schools. In one set of schools, a surplus of 12,000 teachers was identified while in
another set of schools, a shortage of 37,000 teachers was found.

3.40 Implementation Status Reports indicate actions to rectify or mitigate the situation
were not implemented. In order to deal with the shortages of teachers in some schools,
additional per capita funding was allocated to hire teachers where needed. Additional
funding financed salaries for additional teachers to compensate for the imbalance of
teachers. At the time of IEG’s mission, the Government had still not proposed a plan of
action of redeploying teachers.
                                             26


3.41 The capacity of SMCs has remained low. Limited improvements in capacity at
the local level played had a hand in limiting the scope and effectiveness of project
activities. For example, effective use of the SIP as a tool for school improvement
requires additional capacity at the local level but trainings were short-term, generally
two-three days (Norad, 2009) and insufficient for successful implementation. Insufficient
school-level capacity also hindered successful implementation of school autonomy
(CERID, 2009).

3.42 SMCs have not focused on teaching and learning. Early evidence suggested
that participation in school activities increased with the presence of an SMC but SMCs
tended to focus on activities related to physical improvement of school sites. The most
recent qualitative evidence found that SMCs still focus on improving physical facilities
but have also begun to focus on student and teacher attendance (CERID, 2009; Full
Bright, 2011; and New Era, 2014).

Enhancing the Quality and Relevance of Basic Primary Education to
Children and Illiterate Adults
3.43 Achievement of this objective was rated modest. The results chain is presented in
Table 3.8. Overall, the project fell short of meeting output and intermediate outcome
targets (Table 3.9) and there is little evidence that the quality and relevance of education
improved.

3.44 Two major shortcomings under the quality objective were (i) the failure to
measure outcomes associated with learning achievement and (ii) the absence of the
planned performance-based accreditation system for schools.

OUTPUTS

3.45 The quality of Early Childhood Development is low. Limited Government
support for early childhood development (ECD) reduced the quality of ECD offered in
Nepal. The number of ECD centers established was exceeded but fewer grade one
entrants than expected had ECD experience. As part of the EFA program in Nepal, early
childhood development was supported as a means to improve quality of primary
education focusing on marginalized communities. The project’s goal was to establish
11,000 new ECD centers and provide remuneration and short-term training for two ECD
facilitators in new and existing centers. The project surpassed its goal and by 2009,
24,773 community-based ECD/PPE centers had been established from a baseline of
7,200 (Government of Nepal, 2012a). At project closure, 50 percent of new entrants into
primary school had ECD experience, falling short of the project’s goal to achieve a 60
percent rate of new grade 1 entrants with ECD experience (i.e., having attended an early
childhood development center or preprimary school program).

3.46 Cohort analysis of primary school progression prior to EFA implementation found
a significant relationship between ECD and the progression of students through grade 5.
For cohorts entering post project implementation, ECD experience had no measurable
effect (was uncorrelated with) on progression rates. The rapid expansion in ECD under
                                             27


EFA, which lowered the overall quality of the ECD experience is one plausible
explanation for this effect (CERID, 2009).

3.47 Interviews in the field and interviews with Bank staff and donors confirm the low
quality of ECD. Communities were responsible for the lion’s share of resources to open
and operate ECD centers and were also responsible for establishing partnerships with
I/NGOs to enhance the quality ECD provided to students. Anecdotal evidence from the
field suggests that, where NGO partnerships were established and outside support and
technical assistance provided, the quality of ECD was higher than in centers without
NGO support. Quality enhancements included supplemental training for ECD
facilitators, classrooms equipped to introduce the main developmental activities
associated with ECD, and more materials on the walls, including students’ work.

3.48 Little recurrent, in-service teacher training was provided by the project. The
project expected to strengthen the existing model of in-service teacher training by
providing recurrent school-based in-service training for primary school teachers.
Documentation and interviews with teachers suggests there was limited training, which
was short in duration and generally offered at district headquarters. In more remote areas
it is often difficult for teachers to travel to district headquarters to receive training.

3.49 A teacher is considered trained if s/he has completed and passed a ten month
certification program or has majored in education at the higher secondary or university
level. During EFA implementation, parallel financing from the Asian Development
Bank’s Teacher Education Project (TEP) provided a 10 month teacher certification
program. The increase in the percentage of trained teachers from 31 percent to 79 percent
(Table 3.10) is likely due to TEP and not EFA.
                                            28


3.50 The official statistics on teacher training do not reflect the objective of providing
recurrent, school-based, in-service training. Resource Persons (RP) envisioned as leading
both school-based trainings and monitoring teachers’ classroom activities were unable to
support the number of schools assigned to each RP and were reportedly overburdened
with administrative duties (DANIDA, 2006).

3.51 Knowledge transfer due to training remains low. One study suggests that less
than half of what teachers learned in training translated into changes in classroom
behavior (in terms of knowledge transfer) in Nepal’s schools (as cited in Norad, 2009)
reducing any likely impact on the quality of education. Observations from the field and
reported by New Era (2014) suggest that the vast majority of teachers continue to use
traditional modes of instruction as opposed to interactive methods, at least at the basic
and primary level. Only 18 percent of basic and primary school teachers incorporate high
student involvement in teaching-learning practices.

3.52 Delivery of textbooks improved but the target was not reached. Improving
access to textbooks is a quality enhancing measure that can have a positive impact on
education under certain circumstances – depending on the quality and relevance of the
materials delivered to the students not simply the timeliness. The privatization of
textbook printing and distribution was expected to reduce the number of students who
were not receiving textbooks at the start of each academic year. Delays in piloting and
expanding the program created delays in progress on this indicator. Privatization began
in 2007 in the Eastern region with grade five textbooks, expanding in 2008 to all primary
grades in the Eastern and Western regions covering 47 percent of the market. In 2009,
57.6 percent of students received a full set of textbooks within two weeks of the
beginning of the school year (Government of Nepal, 2012a). The percentage is in line
with interviews with teachers and SMCs in the field. While a significant increase from
the percentage at the start of the project (30 percent), the achievement was well below the
targeted 72 percent.

3.53 Limited resources were devoted to activities supporting adult literacy,
focusing on female literacy. The project expected to provide basic literacy to 60,000
women and assist another 48,000 become functionally literate (PAD, p. 34). World Bank
documents report 387,257 women had enrolled in literacy programs by project closure.
Most project activities were contingent on successful coordination between the project
and on-going national efforts such the Women’s Literacy Program and National Literacy
Campaign. A 2006 estimate of EFA expenditures reported two percent of program funds
supported adult literacy activities. Bank documents confirm resource allocation toward
female literacy was minimal compared to other project supported activities (World Bank,
2010).

OUTCOMES: WAS THE QUALITY AND RELEVANCE OF BASIC PRIMARY EDUCATION TO
CHILDREN AND ILLITERATE ADULTS ENHANCED?

3.54 There is little evidence supporting improvement in the quality of primary
education as a result of the project. Project outputs associated with quality were not of
sufficient quantity or quality to improve overall educational quality.

3.55 Since no outcome measures were provided for quality and relevance, survival
rates are used. The survival rate to grade five measures the percentage of a cohort
enrolled in grade 1 which is expected to reach grade five. Using a promotion indicator as
a measure of quality assumes children learn the longer they are retained in school.
Remaining in school is also commonly considered a requirement for sustainable literacy.

3.56 Increases in survival rates over the project period were driven by boys. The
target of 85 percent survival rate for both boys and girls was not achieved; for girls the
improvement was minimal (Table 3.10). The extent to which improvement in the
survival rate reflects the Government’s liberal promotion policy for grades 1-3 or student
learning is not known.

3.57 There is no evidence supporting a change in student achievement. There are
no comparable test score data to judge improvement over time. However, on a nationally
representative test of student achievement administered in 2012, students in grade five
community schools answered 49 percent of math questions, 54 percent of Nepali
questions, and 44 percent of English questions correctly. The corresponding scores for
                                                           30


students in grade five private schools were 67, 78, and 79 percent, respectively
(Government of Nepal, 2014).

3.58 Community managed schools have not out-performed community schools.
Chaudhury and Parajuli’s (2010) impact evaluation compared learning outcomes between
community managed schools transferred during the EFA period with those obtained in
community schools. The evaluation found no impact associated with community
managed schools on grade three and five tests of student achievement conducted by the
impact evaluation. The interval between pre-transfer (baseline test) and post-transfer to
community management could have been too short for significant impacts to materialize.
International evidence suggests it takes at least five years to institutionalize decentralized
reforms and even then the evidence from developing countries on the effectiveness of
decentralized reforms is mixed (Bruns, et. al, 2011).

3.59 Nepal has become more literate over time. Adult literacy increased from 48
percent at project approval to 79 percent in 2006, exceeding the project’s target of 66
percent. A comparison of data from successive Demographic Household Surveys (DHS)
shows improvements in literacy rates among both men and women ages 15-24 and 15-49
years of age (Table 3.11). By 2011, 67 percent of women age 15-49 were literate. Still,
significant variation remains by income quintile. Less than half of Nepal’s poorest
women achieved literacy by 2011 while more than 90 percent of the wealthiest were
literate.

3.60 Adult literacy measures the cumulative effect of long term changes in education.
Few resources were devoted to this particular goal under the project. Improvements in
adult literacy are unlikely to be associated with project activities but with likely
associated with previous achievements in education reform in Nepal.

4. Efficiency
4.1    The PPAR rates the project’s efficiency as modest.

4.2     Economic analysis. The PAD (pp. 60-64) presented a cost-benefit analysis of the
project at appraisal. The ex-ante internal rate of return (IRR) to the EFA project was
estimated at 16.1 percent using a discount rate of 12 percent. Net present value was
estimated to be US$235 million. The rational for the analysis was based on a set of
widely cited public and private benefits of primary education. The analysis does not
consider benefits beyond primary education, for example, the increased benefits of more
children attending and graduating from lower secondary education. The ex ante rate of
return was conservative given this omission.

4.3     Sensitivity analyses were conducted using different rates of internal and external
efficiency such as (i) an increased number of students passing more efficiently through
the primary education sector (e.g., repetition and drop-out rates) and (ii) improved
productivity resulting in wage premia for primary school graduates (as compared to
individuals with less than five years of schooling). The latter assumption was based on
improved education quality as a result of the project; the individual impacts of years of
schooling versus quality of education were not distinguished. At the time, increased
labor market returns to quality primary education were assumed to be eight percent
(PAD, p. 62). Public and private costs, both direct and indirect were taken into
consideration in calculating EFA Project costs. This resulted in an estimated range of
returns to the project between the low case scenario (8 percent) and the high case
scenario (24 percent).

4.4     The ICR recalculated the IRR with realized data at project closing (most recent
available was 2009). The new estimation clearly established a set of assumptions and data
sources used for the calculations including: gross enrollments in publically funded
primary schools only, the cumulative number of students completing grade 5, cohort-
based completer versus non completer wage differentials, full EFA Program costs
(Government cost and pooling and non-pooling donor costs), and the public and private
savings from a reduction in the average number of years it takes a student to complete
grade five (ICR, p. 26-27).

4.5     The ex post IRR to the EFA Program was estimated at 21 percent using a discount
rate of 12 percent and a 10 percent unemployment rate of primary school completers.
The net present value was estimated to be US$992 million.

4.6    Sensitivity analyses with varying quality premia and unemployment rates were
presented and resulted in a range of rates of return between 17 and 21 percent. The net
present value ranged from US$574 to US$992.

4.7    The ex post estimates may be overstated given (i) the accuracy of enrollment and
completion data (noted in Section 3) and (ii) the assumption of an unemployment rate of
10 or even 20 percent. Benefits to the project accrue primarily through completer versus
non completer wage differentials. The World Bank (2013b) reports an average
                                              32


unemployment rate of 46 percent. Efficiency would also be impacted by the extent that
EFA-funded schools suffered damage from the earthquake.

4.8    The Government and donors generally regarded the SWAp as a cost effective
approach to implementing the Government’s primary education sector strategy. The
Government reported reductions in transaction costs.

4.9     Although overly complex rules and procedures for the distribution of grants
resulted in these resources arriving at schools with delays, the project was completed on
time with no extension of the closing date.

5. Ratings
Outcome
5.1     This PPAR rates the project’s outcome as moderately unsatisfactory. Relevance
of the Objectives is rated high. Relevance of Design is rated modest due to shortcomings
in project design, in particular insufficient attention to capacity building at all levels and
inadequate emphasis on appropriate activities to improve the quality of education.
Efficacy in the achievement of the objective to improve access and equity is rated
substantial. Efficacy in the achievement of the remaining two objectives is rated modest.
Efficiency is rated modest. Together these ratings result in a moderately unsatisfactory
outcome rating.

Risk to Development Outcome
5.2    Risk to development outcomes is rated moderate.

5.3     Political instability remains a reality in Nepal – the Peace Accord was signed in
2006 but a Constitution was only introduced in September 2015. The new Constitution
extends free and compulsory education to the basic level. Even without a Constitution,
the Government has remained committed to promoting education for all as a lever for
social inclusion, peace building, and economic growth. The final phase of the EFA
Action Plan began in 2009 with the follow-on project (SSRP), which wraps up Nepal’s
15 year EFA strategy.

5.4     Commitment to goals does not ensure commitment to existing reform strategies
and this has been a concern. The Bank has played a key role ensuring reforms stay the
course. Political uncertainties remain at the highest levels of government. Continued
dialogue may be required between the Bank, other donor agencies, and the DEO to stem
reversals in reform policies depending on the results of the next election.

5.5     Fiscal constraints are a reality in Nepal and while Government support to
education has remained high so has its reliance on donor and local support for education.
Fiscal concerns are increasingly important in light of the strains imposed by
reconstruction and recovery efforts post-disaster. Prior to the earthquake, the share of
education spending in the national budget had fallen slightly. Given these realities, gains
made during EFA will remain heavily reliant on donor support. Estimates for the
                                             33


education sector alone are upwards of US$400 million (World Bank, 2015). According to
the Region’s comments, the Government was quickly able to mobilize US$300 million in
additional funding from donors for post-disaster reconstruction efforts.

5.6     A follow-on project continues to support the EFA reforms. The number of
pooling partners has increased from seven at the end of EFA to nine during SSRP
implementation. A strategic plan for capacity at all levels – central, district, municipality,
village, and school – has not yet been established.

Bank Performance
5.7    Overall Bank Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.8    Quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.9     The Bank and other donors had been coordinating their efforts in Nepal for many
years. Adopting a SWAp approach reduced the administrative burden on the Government
and harmonized donor support – directly funding the Government’s sector strategy.

5.10 During preparation, the Bank team correctly identified improving service
provision as the means to attain access, equity, and quality in education however there
was little evidence from either Nepal or other countries to support large scale
implementation of decentralized provision of education to attain these goals. This is
especially true in the case of quality. The Bank team incorporated lessons learned from
experience during Basic and Primary Education Project II into program design but it was
too soon to incorporate lessons from the on-going pilot of transferring schools to
community school management under the Bank’s Community School Support Program.
The Bank prematurely supported the scaling-up of both SIP funding and community
school management.

5.11 The project was designed and implemented at a time of conflict, political
instability, and nascent decentralization. The team identified the significant risks
associated with the project and incorporated appropriate design features to these mitigate
risks. However the Bank underestimated the risk associated with local level capacity. The
Bank did not ensure that sufficient activities were supported such that necessary
conditions for successful decentralization were in place, in particular capacity at the local
level.

5.12 Fiduciary concerns were noted at appraisal but were not sufficiently addressed
and remained troublesome throughout project implementation with late reporting and
ineligible expenditures – requiring significant Bank oversight.

5.13 Quality of Supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The formal
arrangements for annual reviews and consultations between the donors and the
Government of Nepal provided well-coordinated oversight of project implementation. At
the annual reviews, shortcomings were identified and plans to mitigate the shortcomings
were collectively developed. The Government’s Implementation Progress Reports
initially provided little information on targets achieved, reporting only the percentage of
                                            34


physical achievement. Reporting improved with donor oversight, however, the
arrangements for more timely supervision reports remained weak.

5.14 Donors reported strong Bank leadership throughout project implementation
whether or not the Bank was the Contact Point for the Pooling Donors Working Group at
the time.

5.15 Throughout implementation, the Bank’s Implementation Status Reports rated
implementation progress Satisfactory based on progress toward output and outcome
targets. This rating seems optimistic given the data irregularities and significant
shortcomings in implementation progress identified in annual progress reviews,
Technical Reviews of School Education, and the Mid-Term Review, and discussed by the
Government and Donors’ at annual consultative sessions.

5.16 The Bank’s strength in the area of Financial Management was of considerable
importance and greatly appreciated by the other donors given that throughout project
implementation, financial management and reporting remained a concern. The Bank’s
fiduciary oversight was regular and follow up was consistent.

5.17 The Bank supported increased monitoring to accompany validation of progress
reports; these reports were supplemented with validation of program implementation
relative to the agreed upon program. However, the Bank was slow to respond to findings
in the technical reviews produced, which included concerns over data quality, the need
for capacity building, and the appropriateness of the decentralization policy in Nepal
(DANIDA, 2006).

5.18 Throughout project implementation, political and policy instability threatened
progress in key education reforms. The Bank played a key role in protecting reforms in
the face of changing political circumstances, including, but not limited to various aspects
central to decentralization. For example, revoking the teacher licensing scheme.

Borrower Performance
5.19   Overall Borrower Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

5.20 Government Performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Over the project
period, regardless of political party, successive Governments in Nepal have reiterated
their commitment to education reform. During project implementation, the government of
Nepal changed three times. Nepal was an absolute monarchy (2002-2005), a
constitutional monarchy (2006-2007), and a multiparty democracy (2008-present).

5.21     At the time of the PPAR mission, the current Ministry of Education was less
reform minded than in previous years which was providing an element of uncertainty,
especially concerning the up-coming Amendment to the Education Act. The
Government’s commitment to specific reforms being implemented varied. At various
times the Government sought to revoke teacher licensing and reverse the gains made in
privatizing textbook printing and distribution. Concerted effort on the part of the Bank
and other donors was required to ensure reforms stayed the course.
                                            35


5.22 Coordination between the Ministry of Education and the SWAp partners worked
well. The process followed a twice yearly review and consultation cycle between Donors
and the Government (which chaired the meetings) where mutually agreed upon actions
were determined based on strategic areas in need of additional support as identified in
Aide Memoires. A majority of actions were taken up in annual plans.

5.23 Implementing Agency Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The
Department of Education (the technical arm of the Implementing Agency) was
committed to achieving the project’s objectives. However, the new school grant program
was overly complex and the DOE was slow to provide the necessary guidelines and
capacity building required for smooth implementation of the program. Information flows
from the central level to the district and school level was weak.

5.24 The same issues recurred throughout implementation, such as those surrounding
the need for better communication, capacity building, simplification of the fund flow
process, low attention to ECD, and lack of attention to quality aspects of education.

5.25 The Government reported on both financial and physical progress toward
implementation on a trimester basis. Implementation Progress Reports provided
information on several input activities associated with the key performance indicators for
example, the number of scholarships distributed, orientations for SMCs, inputs on non-
formal education and adult literacy. For the most part, Government reporting consisted of
the percentage of physical and financial progress under each EFA goal. The MTR
highlighted the issue of late, inconsistent, unreliable, and non-transparent reporting.

5.26 The Education Management Information System (EMIS) was the primary vehicle
to collect and disseminate education indicators. Fund allocations were based on EMIS
(or Flash) data. Verification of self-reported data proved inadequate, especially given the
reliance on the data for resource allocation.

5.27 As noted earlier, a weak internal control system in the Department hampered
effective implementation. Financial reporting was delayed; not all shortcomings
identified in audit reports were addressed in a timely fashion. Progress on implementing
the Financial Management Action Plan to remedy these shortcomings was slow.

Monitoring and Evaluation
5.28   This PPAR rates overall Monitoring and Evaluation of the project modest.

5.29 M&E Design. A range of indicators were proposed and to a large extent collected
to provide inference of changes along the causal chain. These indicators, for example the
share of trained teachers, the share of schools receiving textbooks on time, the number of
schools transferred to community management, or the number of schools preparing SIPs,
are output indicators. Measures of teacher skills, use of class planning/preparation or
learning materials, participation and engagement of SMCs, parents, and communities,
would have provided more information leading to final outcomes.

5.30 The key performance indicators were (i) net enrollment rates; (ii) grade five
survival rates; and (iii) learning achievement outcomes in grade five. Baselines were
                                             36


provided for all indicators in the aggregate and broken down by sex; targets were not set
for boys versus girls. Neither baselines nor targets were provided for Dalits or Janajati.

5.31 There was a clear plan and timetable for collecting most of the monitoring data.
No clear plan was presented for collecting data on the quality of education. Although
Nepal had not systematically tested student learning in the past, it had tested students at
grades 3, 5, and 8 in several subjects at various points in time. The project planned on
conducting three tests over the duration of the project. Baseline data on student test
scores presented percentages (correct answers) with no reference or benchmark for pass,
fail, or proficiency levels.

5.32 A common monitoring and evaluation framework under the SWAp streamlined
data collection and analysis systems. The project relied on the EMIS data collection
system initiated under BPEP II – a bottom-up reporting system from the school to the
district to the central level. All schools were to report data on key indicators.

5.33 The comprehensive M&E system emphasized local reporting for more efficient
resource allocation. Participation of communities was crucial to generate the data
required for the project monitoring. An integral component was output-based
expenditure reporting and decision-making based on collection of EMIS data in
conjunction with SIPs.

5.34 Other monitoring arrangements were built into design such as social audits,
national survey data validation studies (e.g., NLSS and DHS data), and an impact
evaluation on girls' scholarships (PAD, p. 11). Government Implementation Progress
Reports collected additional data on all EFA goals. A Mid-Term Evaluation and Final
Evaluation were planned to asses overall project performance.

5.35 M&E Implementation. The expanded and upgraded EMIS provided twice yearly
school-level reporting on relevant project indicators, once at the beginning of the
academic year (Flash I) and again at the end of the academic year (Flash II). School-level
data were collected by Head Teachers and reported to the District Education Office for
validation before submission to the Department of Education for aggregation and
publication.

5.36 The system encountered significant shortcomings in the reporting of data at the
school- and district-levels. Schools reported data to the districts; DEOs were responsible
for verification and correction of the data. Capacity at both the school level and DEO
level was lacking. Verification systems established by the project in the initial years of
implementation concluded the Flash and EMIS system were accurate. These technical
reviews of data quality were suspended in 2006, perhaps prematurely, having determined
that data reporting was accurate. The issue arose again in 2014 when the data on
enrollments were found to be inflated. A recent study estimated that 15 percent of school
level report cards were improperly filled in (Aasaman Nepal and ISPC, 2014). Newly
published results prepared for the World Bank provide similar evidence to that cited
above with differences in many of the key performance indicators (New Era, 2014;
World Bank, 2104).
                                             37


5.37 Certain indicators were not systematically collected or reported. There were no
indicators defined to measure progress toward the objective to improve institutional
capacity. Not all data were disaggregated as stated in the project’s results framework.

5.38 The Mid-Term Evaluation and Final Evaluation were undertaken as planned as
was a large amount of formative research during project implementation. The impact
evaluation on girls’ scholarships was not undertaken.

5.39 Social audits were introduced as a tool to increase accountability, participation,
and efficiency at the school level. The Mid-Term Review reported significant issues with
the process and reporting through social audits (DANIDA, 2006). Schools seemed to
have limited understanding of the role of social audits, often confusing them with
financial reporting.

5.40 M&E Utilization. In practice, DEOs used EMIS data to allocate grants to schools
based on the previous year’s reporting, i.e., on last year’s enrollment figures. Issues with
the reliability of the data suggest major issues regarding utilization of the EMIS data.

5.41 A vast amount of research was generated in conjunction with the project. Donors
funded technical assistance to support learning and accountability throughout
implementation. Issues and areas of improvement were noted along the way, including at
the Mid-Term Review, however few course corrections were made over the life of the
project. For example, simplifying the grant process, increasing the emphasis on quality,
or preparing a strategic plan for capacity building.

6. Lessons
6.1    Since 1992, the Bank, in coordination with other donors, has supported the
Government of Nepal build institutional capacity; improve efficiency and quality of
education services; and improve equity in access to education, especially for girls and
students from disadvantaged communities. Since that time, IEG has conducted three
PPARs, including the current one, to evaluate achievement toward these objectives. The
findings from each evaluation are similar: increased funding and decentralization can
improve access but direct attention to educational inputs is required to improve quality.

6.2    Based on the experience of this project, lessons for future education projects in
Nepal and elsewhere can be drawn:

6.3    To improve the quality of education, in particular learning outcomes, it is
important to emphasize the quality of learning inputs such as teachers and instructional
and learning materials. There is little evidence to suggest inputs to the teaching learning
process improved due to the project: the quality of ECD suffered from limited
Government support; teachers received limited training; and children still received
textbooks late.

6.4    In a low capacity environment, a strategy to build local level capacity is critical in
a decentralized service provision model. Low capacity limits the potential of various
instruments under communities’ control to improve the efficiency and quality of schools.
                                               38


Under EFA, distribution of grants was often delayed due to overly complex rules and
procedures which were not well understood at the school-level. Low capacity limited the
impact of School Improvement Plans which were meant to focus on teaching and
learning activities.

6.5     It is important that central, district, and local level roles and responsibilities are
clearly defined when education provision has been decentralized. In Nepal, ambiguities
existed as to where ultimate responsibilities for education decision-making lie. These
ambiguities contributed to the failure of decentralization to bring about increases
expected in the quality of public education.

6.6    Quality assurance in M&E data is essential when funding is linked to school-level
data. Verification of the current system suggests irregularities in reporting data:
scholarship distribution has not followed guidelines and the incentive to over-report
enrollment data has increased with the introduction of per capita financing.
