Project development objective

Theproject's long-term developmentobjective is to improve access to andbenefit from basic and
primaryeducation for children, especially girls andchildren from disadvantaged groups, and
from literacy programs for poor adults.
Project description

The proposed Education for All Project will support the Government'sEducation for All 2004-
2009 Program. Usingthe EFA indicators, specific targets are to further increasethe net
enrollment rate from 81percent to 96 percent; increaseachievement ingrade five from 40 to 60
percent, further decrease the gender and social gaps, andincreaseliteracy of the 15+ age group
from 48 to 66 percent.

Theproject aims to achieve three strategic goals: 1) improvingaccess to andequity of basic and
primary education; 2) enhancingeducational quality and relevance; and 3) improving efficiency
andinstitutional capacity of education service delivery.

Improving access and equity. Equitable access will be approachedthrough measuresto increase
boththe demandfor education andthe supply of services. Onthe demandside, expanded
involvement of community-based organizations; increasedliteracy for mothers; scholarship
programs targetedto poor girls, dalits andout o f school children from disadvantagedethnic
groups, and expansionof the number of classrooms andnon-formal programs basedinschools,
will accommodategrowing demand. Alternative classroomdesigns will be introduced. Inline
withthe philosophy that no child shouldbe left out of school, resourcesfor buildingadditional
classrooms will also beprovided to communities. Double shifting will also beoffered as an
option to local communities. Literacy programs for adult women, targetedto dalits and ethnic
minorities with lowest literacy rates, will be expanded.

Enhancing quality and relevance. Early Childhood Development (ECD), deliveredthrough
community managedcenters andthrough pre-primary classes, will be expanded.Recurrent in-
serviceteachertraining will be strengthenedby making it school based. Resourcesfrom school
grants will enable School Management Committees (SMCs) to procure local expertise for school
improvement activities, includingteacher training. Improvedschool facilities (including water
supply andtoilets), andnewly developedtransitional linguistic support on entry for non-Nepali
speakingstudents, are expectedto further improve the quality of learning, retention of children,
andhence school completion rates.

Improving efJiciency and institutional capacity. Key to effective program performance i s the
shift from centrally managed sub-programsto an expandedSchool GrantsProgram (SGP) that
will empower SMCs inimprovingthe performance of all schools.

A. STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

Since the beginningo f multi-partydemocracy in 1990, Nepal has seen many positive changes.
However, political instability andthe insurgency are severely hamperingefforts for reform.
Growth inGross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 5 percent annually inthe 1990s, fell to
negative rates in2001/2002, and recovered to 2.5 percent in2002/2003. Over the last ten years,
poverty rates have fallen very little, ifany. About 40 percent o fNepal's citizens, the majority o f
whom reside inrural areas, live on less than $1.OO a day. The distribution o f income has grown
more unequal, with wide variation across regions and social groups.

Decentralizationhas been a key strategy o f His Majesty's Government o fNepal (HMG/N) to
improve the equity, efficiency and quality o fpublic service delivery. Elected local bodies
(district, municipality andvillage) havebeenexpected to play key roles infacilitating, funding
andmonitoring the delivery o f social services, including education.' Unfortunately, these bodies
completed their term in2002 and no new elections have taken place. As an interimmeasure, the
Government has appointedmembers o fpolitical parties to filfill the functions o fthese local
bodies.

The Nepal Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) highlights three characteristics of the
development context: (1) an unstable political environment; (2) poor delivery and quality o f
basic social services, including education; and (3) wide disparities inaccess to and benefitfrom
public services for females, dalits and children from disadvantaged ethnic communitiesS2Clearly,
improvements inthe effectiveness and equity o f social services for the rural poor, with basic and
primary education havinghighpriority, will be essential to achieving the social and political
stability needed for growth and to reduce poverty.

On a more positive note, the current crisis has ledto a numbero freforms ledby committed
technocrats within government. A key achievement i s the development o f a Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS) based on the lothPlan, which underpins the Bank's CAS and a Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC).3 More rigorous andprioritized allocation o fpublic funds is
being addressed through a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and an Immediate
Action Plan. Both a Country Procurement Assessment Report and a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) havebeencompleted and the Government i s implementing
the recommendations.

Nepal has achieved much inbasic and primary education (BPE), both inbuildingthe capacity to
planandmanage a sub-sector investmentprogram andinimproving educational outcomes.


'Nepalhas    a system o f elected district and village development committees. These bodies, which do not have
legislative power, enjoy much less authority than conventional local govemments.
 Nepali society encompasses many cultures and languages. Dalits are l o w caste Hindus who suffer from highlevels
o f poverty and social exclusion. Poverty and social exclusionvary across more than 90 officially identified ethnic
poups; many are disadvantaged, some are not.
 A key objective o fthe Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) is to improve the delivery o f social services,
including education, by strengthening the participation o f communities.

                                                             1

These achievements have rested to date on HMG/"s policy framework for the sub-sector,
supported by a Core Investment Program (CIP)4 and other parallel bilateral and multilateral
assistance.

Educational outcomes have improved. Primary (grades one-five) net enrolment rates (NER) were
reported to have increased from 69 percent in 1998 to 81 percent in2001. Duringthe same
period, the gender gap inenrolments was reportedto have fallen from 20 percent to 12percent,
while primary completion rates rose from 44 percent to 59 per~ent.~Over the last twenty years,
adult literacy rates increased from 34 percent to 66 percent for males, and from 12percent to 43
percent for females. These statistics may, however, be biasedupwards due to weaknesses inthe
present administrative data collection and analysis system.

Significant challenges remain for Nepal inmeeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
o f universalprimary education by 2015, and the EducationFor All (EFA) targets. These include:

   0   When dropouts are considered, more than 25 percent o f children remain out o f school, with
        girls, children from dalits andvulnerable ethnic communities disproportionately
       represented.
   a   The quality o f public education is poor, as signaled by low scores on primary level
        achievement tests and parental flight to private secondary schools, which achieve 73
       percent pass rates on the School Leaving Certificate exams compared to 22 percent for
       public schools.
   a    Completion rates, while improved, remain low, reducing system efficiency.
       While the practice is illegal, many public primary schools are charging student fees which,
       inturn, reducethe chancesthat poor childrenwill enroll.
   0   Fundingfor schools is low and frequently released late.
   0   Efficiency and reliability o f the textbook provision system requires significant
       improvement.

Perhaps most importantly, implementationhas beenuneven. Under the CIP, educational services
were delivered through 17 centrally managed components, often with unsatisfactory results.
Inputs arrived at schools inunpredictable fashion with little adaptation to local issues and
conditions, little synergy, andconsequently less than satisfactory impact.

Policy development and implementationremain incomplete inthree key areas:

   0    Teacherappointment is constrained by central control o frecruitment bythe Teacher
       Service Commission (TSC) that limits local appointments by School Management
       Committees (SMC), and leads to uneven deployment o fteachers;




 The CIP is an integralpart of the Govemment'sfive-year BPE investment programthat began in fiscal year 1999/00. The
IntemationalDevelopmentAssociation(IDA), partnerdonors (DANIDA, EuropeanCommission, FinlandandNorway), andthe
Govemment committedUS106 million to pooledfunding for the CIP under the Basic and PrimaryEducationProject(BPEP).
Additional parallelfinancingfor the programis providedby ADB, WFP, UNICEF, UNESCOand JICA.
 However,Govemment estimatesofNERsdo not yet adequatelytake student dropoutor repetitioninto account, with the
implication that the number of childrennot enrolled in school is likely to be substantiallyhigher.


                                                                2

  0    Lack of female teachers inmore than halfo fpublic schools that hindersprogress towards
       genderparity; and
       Textbookpublishing and distribution is poorly managed by a public enterprise.

At the institutional level, effective financing andmanagement mechanisms needed for
decentralization to schools are inthe early stages o f development. The EducationManagement
Information System (EMIS) is cumbersome and slow, with a two to three year lag inreporting
education statistics, inpart because the system has yet to be fully computerized at the district
level.


phase o f the BPE program inconsonance with the country's lothPlan. Extensive consultations
To address these issues, HMG/Nprepared in2003, an EFA Core Document to guide the next

on the program were undertaken at the regional and district levels. The EFAprogram i s
grounded inthe DakarFramework for Action on EFA, and provides a vision statement, a policy
matrix to support the vision, time-bound outcome indicators and performance targets, and an
indicative budget. Usingthe international EFA indicators, the targets are to: (a) further increase
the NER from 81percent to 96 percent; (b) increase learning achievement scores ingrade five
from 40 to 60 percent; (c) further decrease gender and social gaps; and(d) increase literacy o f
the 6+ age group from 54 to 73 percent, and o f the 15+ age group from 48 to 76 percent by 2015.
The broad pillars on which the strategies rest are: improved service delivery, social inclusionand
improved governance.

To support the EFA Program, the Government is committed to resolving policy implementation
gaps for teachers andtextbooks. To reduce teacher shortages, particularly inremote and rural
schools, and increase the recruitment o f female teachers, actions will be taken infour key areas.
First, to create the `space' for community-recruited teachers, all teacher positions falling vacant
after July 16,2004 will be converted into community-recruited positions funded by govemment.
Second, all schools approvedby the Government and already receiving regular grants, but which
have less than the number o fteachers prescribedby the EducationRegulations, will receive
block grants for community recruitment o f teachers. Third, service conditions comparable to
those for regular government teachers, will be established for community-recruited teachers.
Fourth, two female teacher positions per school will be established inschools with four or more
teacher positions. To address deficiencies inthe textbook provision system, the Govemment will
implement a phased plan for increasingthe private sector's role intextbooks.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The World Bank has been engaged consistently with the Government inbasic and primary
education for more than twenty years, gaining considerable knowledge and experience. The
gains made under the CIP are vulnerable inthe present country context, and continued Bank
technical and financial support is crucial to enable the government to meet the MDGs for
educatione6The proposedproject insupport o fthe EFA program should make a substantial




 And also the MDGs for maternal, infant and child mortality rates which fall inNepal, as elsewhere, withincrease
inmothers' education.

contribution to achievement o fNepal's PRS goals, thus further deepening Bank support for
poverty alleviation.

To manage risks and improve impact, the Government has developed a new design for the EFA
program that places schools at the center o f efforts to improve service delivery which, inturn,
requires a new financing approach. To meet this requirement, IDA and several other donors have
established ajoint financing arrangement with the Government whereby donor funds will be
pooled with government budgetaryresources to support BPEunder a Sector Wide approach
(SWAP). This arrangement, which i s expected to reduce transaction costs through alignment o f
donor rules and procedures with government financial regulations, and improve the linkage o f
disbursements to implementationprogress, i s considered by HMG/Nto be a pilot that could have
wider application to other sectors. Key success factors will be the Bank's close relationship with
the Ministry o f Finance (MOF) and Ministryo f Education and Sports (MOES), and a shared
commitment to ensuring that financial management andprocurement policies under the recently
amended Financial Administration Regulations (FAR), will be effectively implemented within
Nepal's largest sector.

3. Higherlevelobjectivesto whichthe project contributes

The project contributes to HMG/N's long-term development objective o f strengthening the
country's human resource base to support economic growth and reduce poverty. Inthe current
uncertain socio-political environment, the project would also contribute to improved delivery o f
public services to the ruralpoor, with more effective targeting o f females and other vulnerable
groups, and hence indirectly to social cohesion and stability.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

At the request o fthe Government, donors currently supporting BPEhaveagreedto enter into a
SWAp with improved features for supporting the EFA 2004-2009program. The Department for
InternationalDevelopment (DflD), United Kingdom, a new donor to the sub-sector, willjoin
four other partners -Denmark, Finland, Norway and IDA-inpooling resources with HMG/N
for the EFAprogram. The five partner donors will be contributing approximately US$l58
million' or about 19percent o f the total BPEbudget duringthe program period. IDAwill
provide US$50 million incredit financing, equivalent to 33% ofpooled donor resources, through
a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) instrument. Credit proceeds upon disbursement, are
indistinguishable from government andother pooled donor funds and as such, cannot be tracked
by specific expenditure category. The focus instead, willbe on monitoring the basic andprimary
education sub-sector as a whole, bothinrespect o f financial performance andprogress on results
and outcomes indicators.


'Denmark,    Finland, Norway and the UK have indicated grant support inthe amounts o f approximately US$33
million, US$15 million, US$25 million, and US$35 million, respectively. Of the total o fUS$158 million (including
US$50 million from IDA), about US$150 million will be channeled through the pool. The remaining US$8 million
will be provided as bilateral TA support. The amounts providedby each bilateral donor, net o f direct fundingfor
TA, are indicated inthe summary page o fthe PAD under Financing Plan.

3. Projectcomponents

To manage effectively within the current unstable socio-political environment, the Government's
strategy i s to focus ininitial stages o f EFAprogram implementation, on core activities needed to
increase the effectiveness o f schools, and maintain normal functioning o f schools inhighly
impacted areas. Innovative non-formal educationprograms, many o fwhich have been launched
as pilots, would be maintainedat current levels o f funding and evaluated with a view toward
scaling up as the implementation environment stabilizes and as funds become available in later
stages o f the operation.

The project addresses three strategic goals: 1) improving access and equity; 2) enhancing quality
and relevance; and 3) improving efficiency andinstitutional ~apacity.~These goals will be
approached through six sub-programs under the EFAprogram aimed at: (i)              expandingearly
childhood education; (ii)    ensuring access to all; (iii)meeting learning needs o f all; (iv) reducing
female illiteracy; (v) eliminating gender disparity; and (vi) improving all aspects o f quality
education. Resources for these sub-programs will be channeled primarilythrough school
grants.'O

Improving access and equitv. Equitable access will be approached through measures to increase
both the demand for education and the supply o f services. Onthe demandside, expanded
involvement o f community-based organizations inidentifying, and motivating out o f school
childrento enroll, will strengthen school outreach. Increased literacy for mothersis also expected
to have a long-term positive impact. Scholarships, fundedthrough school grants and targeted to
poor girls, dalits and out o f school janajati children, will offset the private costs o f schooling for
these groups. Expansiono f the number o f classrooms and non-formal programs based inschools,
will accommodate growing demand. Alternative classroom designs that are adaptedto different
geographical conditions, andwhich provide better lightingand ventilation will be introduced. In
line with the philosophy that no child should be left out o f school, resources will also be
provided to communities for constructing temporary classrooms using local materials, but whose
designs are structurally sound. Double shifting will also be offered as an option to local
communities. Literacy programs for adult women, targeted to dalits and ethnic minorities with
the lowest literacy rates, will be expanded.

Enhancing qualitv and relevance. ECD, delivered through community managed centers and
through pre-primary classes, will be expanded. ECD has been shown to improve learning and
completion ingrade one; enhanced completion o f grade one inturn, will decrease class size in
grade one (15 percent o f grade one students are currently underage), contributing bothto the
quality of the leaming environment and to efficiency. Teacher education through a ten-month
certificate training course is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under a Teacher
EducationProject. Recurrent in-service teacher training will be strengthened by making it school
based. More substantial and direct funding through the School Grants Program (SGP) will enable
SMCs to select and finance local expertise for school improvement activities, including teacher
training. Improved school facilities (including drinkingwater and toilets), andnewly developed
transitional language support on entry for non-Nepali speaking students, are expected to further
improve the quality o f learning, retentiono f children, and hence school completion rates.

Improving efficiency and institutional capacitv. Key to effective programperformance is the
shift from centrally managed sub-programs to anexpanded SGP that will empower SMCs in
improving the performance o f all schools. A parallel initiative, currently piloted under the IDA-
financed Community School Support Project, will transfer 8,000 o f the 21,000 primary schools
to community management with block grant financing over the five years o f the program.

percent by 2008/2009.

All schools currently operate bank accounts andreceive earmarked grants throughDistrict
Education Offices (DEO) for salaries, andN R s 300 per year to each teacher for teaching and
learning materials. Schools transferred to community management currently benefit from
expanded block grants. School improvement planninghas been successfully piloted andis ready
to be scaled up. Though less than fully efficient, the basic administrative structure for block grant
financing i s inplace.

An important new feature o f the SGP will be the inclusiono f funding for non-salary recurrent
costs inschool grants, which comprise three main categories -basic, level 1and level 2 grants.
While all schools will be eligible for basic grants, only accredited schools will be eligible for
level 1and 2 grants (Annexes 4 and 17). Schools will be accredited, on a voluntary basis, at
different levels o f eligibility through a system o f self-assessment and ex-post audits. Depending
on the level o f accreditation, schools will be eligible to apply for grants for physical facilities
improvement, enhanced student access, capacity building, and quality improvement. The use o f
block grants by schools will be audited annually byparent committees, and the results o fthese
audits will be publicly disclosed.

The synergies among strategies to increase access, equity, quality and relevance should improve
performance on enrolling andkeeping children inschool, raising learning achievement, and
improving system efficiency. The SGP is the linchpin for the delivery o f these strategies by
providing adequate hnding for locally relevant inputdincentives for school performance, and for
reducing the imposition o f fees that i s detrimental to access by poor students.

4. Lessons learnedand reflectedin the projectdesign

Focusinaon schools to improve service delivew. The ongoing Basic andPrimary Education I1
Project (BPEP 11)has initiated district- and school-based planning, including introduction o fthe
SIP process. Delivery modalities for key activities such as in-service teacher education, civil
works planningand execution, and altemative andnon-formal education were established.
However, HMG/Nand donors identified as a key lesson duringthe mid-term review o fthe
project and subsequent joint supervisionmissions, the need to shift from a "component-driven"
modality - 17 components runby 17 units inthe DOE and other central level agencies under the
MOES, to a more holistic and decentralized planning and implementation process focusing on
schools.

A decentralizedservice delivery system centered on schools and the community they serve, will
be criticalfor managing risks arisingfrom the conflict situation. The insurgents have publicly
declared that they would not disrupt the functioning o f schools. Many private schools have been
closed because they are seen by the insurgents as profit making entities. Ifa school is providing
free educationto children particularly inpoor, rural and remote areas, there i s every reason to
believe that it will be allowed to continue hnctioning. What i s needed will be timely delivery o f
more substantivedirect fundingto schools to enable them to purchase servicedinputs according
to local priorities. This is fully consistent with the recommendation o fthe BPEP mid-term
review that the use o f school grants be significantly expanded duringthe EFAprogram to
empower schools andmake them more accountable for learning outcomes. To ensure that
schools inhighlyimpacted areas are able to utilize block grants effectively, the Government has
agreed to partner with support organizations -- including intemational and local Non-


                                                    7

Governmental Organizations (NGOs) -- for social mobilization, technical support and
monitoring, beginning intwo pilot districts.

Need for a comprehensiveapproach. Although BPEP I1represents an important first step
towards a comprehensive approach usinga basket fundingmechanism to support the sub-sector,
HMG/Nand donors realizedthat the design andfinancing modality for the EFAprogram would
need to go much further to align donor rules and procedures with government systems inorder to
increase government ownership andreduce transaction costs. Consequently, donors to the sub-
sector have agreed to adopt a SWAP with several new features: (a) pooling o f donor and
government funds to finance the EFAprogram; (b) reliance on government rules and procedures
for disbursing,monitoring and reporting program expenditures; and (c) a common and simplified
monitoring framework for program outcomes, which i s endorsed by all donors to the sub-sector.
The SWAP is underpinned by the government-led EFA strategy and program.

5. Alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection

The alternative considered to the proposed project designwas to restructure the Adaptable
Program Loan (APL)instrument supporting BPEP I1(closing inJuly, 2004). This was rejected
for four reasons. First, the EFAprogram reflects government strategies, priorities and time lines
that depart significantly from those supported inthe first phase o f the APL. Increasingpolitical
uncertainty and insurgency inthe country have mandated a sharp strategic shift away from the
gradual institutional capacity buildingapproach under the APL, to a school-centered approach.
Inrespect ofpriorities, the Governmenthaspostponedthe APL's goalofenrolling allchildren in
eight years o f education inorder to concentrate on the education MDGs. Timeline wise, the ten-
year APL with three phases i s not compatible with the five-year cycle o f the government
program.

Second, underthe APL, performance would bejudged every two or three years against a sub-set
o fweakly defined triggers that are not widely accepted by donors outside the basket funding
arrangement. The design of the new program provides a stronger annual monitoring framework,
which is endorsedby all donors and offers better linkage between disbursements and
performance, thereby increasingthe pooling donors' ability to manage risks under an uncertain
environment. Third, the design o f the APL was not consistent with the evolving objectives o f
pooling donors seeking greater harmonization. Finally, government ownership o fthe APL is
low. For these reasons, a cleanbreak from an increasingly inappropriate program design and
lending instrument was chosen.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

The partnership between the Government and donors established underBPEP I1has worked well
andwill be further strengthened through the more comprehensive SWAP for the EFA program.
HMG/"s objective o fincreasedharmonizationwith all donors (both pooling andparallel) will
be addressedthrough a donor Code o f Conduct (COC), Annex 16, that reflects mutual




                                                 8

commitment to the Government's objectives o f achieving enhanced cooperation, and decreasing
the transaction costs o fpartnership. The COC has beenendorsed byboththe Government and
donors.

A Joint FinancingArrangement (JFA) describingthe understandings reached among signatory
partners for the creation andmanagement o fpooled donor funding insupport o f the EFA
Program, has been prepared and i s expected to be signedby September 30,2004. The JFA
describes the mutual roles and responsibilities o f signatories and the process bywhich funds will
be disbursed and monitored through HMG/"s financial management and reporting system
(Annex 15). Further reduction inthe administrative burdenon government will be achieved
through streamlinedmodalities for monitoring and reportingon selected output, results and
outcome indicators.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

Implementation o f the JFA underpinningthe SWAP will strengthen national systems and
capacity. The MOES will be the pilot for implementing a new model o f development assistance,
which is based on the pooling o f donor and domestic resources for financing a sub-sector, and
reliance on the Government's FARto account for andreport on the use o f these resources. The
adoption o f a common monitoring and evaluation framework under the SWAP will streamline
data collection and analysis systems, and buildcapacity at the district and central levels to
produce more timely andreliable information on program outputs and outcomes.

Financial Management. The MOF and the Financial Comptroller General's Office (FCGO) will
be responsible for the accounting and reporting of EFA expenditures financed through the pool.
The FCGO will provide access to its Financial Management Information System (FMIS) to the
DOE. This will enable D O E staff inthe Accounts section to extract the relevant information
from the FMIS for preparation o f reports on EFA accounts, which are identified by specific
budget codes inaccordance with the Govemment's cash-based accounting system. These reports
will be verified by the FCGO before submission to pooling donors. DOEstaffwho are familiar
with the govemment accounting system and donor requirements, will manage the EFA accounts
with the assistanceo f short term local consultants. To ensure that the financial management
arrangements will work satisfactorily, the Government has committed to implement a financial
management improvement plan(Annex 7)to strengthen capacity inthe DOE, MOES andother
programcost centers.

Implementation. The DOE, under the broadpolicy guidance o f the MOES, will have overall EFA
program implementation responsibility. As most o f the program activities will be undertaken by
stakeholders at the district, sub-district and community levels, the DOEwill coordinate with
other line education agencies' as well as support organizations (international NGOs, local
NGOs) to provide technical backstopping to these stakeholders, and monitor implementationo f
program activities. Responsibility for overall program monitoring will be assigned to a Program
Management Committee (PMC) comprising mainly o f senior officials from education line
agencies.



I'These include among others, the National Center for Education Development, Distance Education Center,
CurriculumDevelopment Center, andNon-formal Education Center.

                                                       9

The SGP will be the primary mechanism for EFA program implementation. The DE0will be
responsible for preparing annual district educationplans, review o f SIPS, release o f grants to
school bank accounts, monitoring school performance, andpreparationofreports on key
outcome and output indicators.

The MOES will support the implementationo f the SGP through: (a) provision o f operational
guidelines; (b) public communication and outreach programs to build awareness o fthe new
opportunities for schools; (c) a program o fworkshops to introduce the SGP to district staff,
SMCs and teachers; and (d) capacity building for school-community partnership and for social
audits by community groups.

A Joint Annual ReviewbyHMGNand all donors to the BPE sub-sector inApril o feach year
will assess implementationprogress inrespect o f outcomes and expenditures as providedthrough
anAnnual Progress Report (APR) prepared bythe MOES for the fiscal year endinginJuly o fthe
previous year. The APR will report on the agreed outcomes andresults indicators for the EFA
program as well as on expenditures and outputs. The AWPB for the next year will also be
presented by MOES at this review. Donor partners will commit to fundinglevels for the next
year on the basis o fthe previous fiscal year's progress, and the AWPB.

Inadditionto the Annual Review, aconsultativemeetingwill beheldinDecember ofeachyear
duringwhichthe signatories to the JFA will review the preliminary consolidated financial
statements for the previous fiscal year as well as financial and output reports for the first
trimester o f the current year. Both the Annual Review and the consultative meetingwill be
preceded by independent technical reviews,I2 which provide additional information to pooling
partners on financial and overall implementation progress. The technical reviews will include
visits to a sample o f districts and schools inthose districts. Inlight o fthe conflict situation and
consequent difficulty o f donors to travel to the field, suitably qualified agents would be
contracted locally for carrying out the site visits to assess implementationprogress.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

Streamlined and more timely data collection and reporting systems on key output and outcome
indicators will be inplace at the start o f the program. Indicators for outcomes/processes and
outputs will be incorporated ina new system o f `flash reports' from schools, which will be
aggregated at the district level and consolidatedby the MOES. Outcome data will be reported in
disaggregated format to track enrolments, completion rates, and distribution o f scholarships for
girls, dalits and students from disadvantaged ethnic groups. The timeliness and availability o f
school grants will be m~nitored.'~The output data cover approximately 75 percent o fplanned
program expenditures. The outcome/process indicators are a subset o fthe current and much
larger and slower EMIS; the output indicators are a subset o f a much larger set currently
monitoredby the National Planning Commission (NPC).




l2These reviews will be financed outside the pool with each o f the five donors inthe F A talung turns to finance and
organize the reviews each year.

Routine monitoring o f EFAprogram and expenditure data will be supported by learning
achievement tests (three times duringthe program) and independent national sample surveys,
conductedby the Central Bureauo f Statistics for the NPC.14A pilot test o f an education
expenditure tracking survey was completed in2003. Itwill be expanded to include limited
household data (including citizen satisfactionwith public schools) administered on a sample
basis in2007.

Social audits, which will include disclosure o f income and expenditure statements to
communities, will be undertaken by committees formed by the Parent-Teacher-Association to
monitor the use o f school grants, the achievement of school improvement objectives, and
community satisfaction with school services. This approach, which has been successfully piloted
inthe IDA-supported Community School Support Project, will be implementedinaphased
manner with the objective o f covering all schools by the end o f the five-year program.

A robust evaluationprogramwill focus on: (a) education outcomes usingNLSS data;" (b) cost
effectiveness o f literacy andnon-formal programs; (c) impact evaluation o f scholarships for
girls, dalits and disadvantaged janajati groups; and (d) operations research on key delivery
mechanisms. Findings o f the evaluation program will be presented duringthe mid-term review o f
the project to inform desigdimplementation modality modifications and/or up-scaling.

The APRs and supporting data, the results o f learning achievement assessments, andthe results
o fhousehold surveys and evaluations will provide substantial information for the project
Implementation Completion Report.

The EMIS will be strengthened and streamlinedto enable rapid monitoring o f key outputs and
outcomes at the school and district level (Annex 3). The focus will be on system redesign, data
collection procedures, computerization, and capacity buildingat all levels.16

4. Sustainability

Four elements o fthe project support sustainability:

0   Highgovernmentpriority. The EFA rogram for which project support isprovided, is
    embedded inHMG/N's PRS and 10 Plan, and is supported by the PRSC. It is a Priority One
                                               ,R
    program under the government's MTEF, thus safeguarding it from expenditure cuts.
0   Strong$nancing commitment. The Government currently allocates approximately 15 percent
    o f the nationalbudget to education, o f which around 60 percent goes to basic andprimary
    education. The Government intends to gradually raise the budget share o f education to 17.5
    percent, with the share going to basic andprimary education being maintained at around 60
    percent.




l4The surveys are the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS, reported in2004,2009) andthe Demographic and
HealthSurvey, which will incorporate the NLSS education module (reported in2007).
l5A comprehensive analysis o fchanges inNLSS education indicators between 1996 and 2003 is currently being
conducted by the Bank
l6UNESCO's Institute o f Statistics will provide technical support for EMIS development.

                                                         11

0  Advancedproject design. The move to a SWAP whereby donor funds are pooled with the
    Government's own resources should improve the flow o f funds, financial monitoring and
    reporting.
0   Community and school-centered implementation. The strategic shift to implementationby
    schools and communities should leadto less dependence on services from the central
    ministry. It will contribute to enhanced local capacity for improving schools andmobilization
    o f local finance (including from local bodies when they are re-established).

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

Economic: Enhanced primary educationis strongly correlatedwith poverty reduction, economic
development andproductivity growth. The project aims to provide quality primary school
education to the children o fNepal to put them on the road towards better employment and
income-earningpossibilities. Challenges to enhance educational quality and increase access to
the disadvantaged can be classified into three types: (a) Demand side     - thosethat prevent
children from going to school or from benefiting from the educationalservices providedby the
school e.g., poverty, direct costs of schooling, opportunity costs; (b) Supply-side - factors that
limit the capacity for providing quality education opportunities for children livingininaccessible
areas (which is likely to be a significant issue given the insurgency), inadequate facilities, lack o f
teaching and learning resources, teacher absenteeism; and (c) Institutional - policies and
administrative arrangements that can keep the system from performing at an acceptable level,
e.g., weak organizational capacity, centralizedmanagement, and inadequate funding
arrangements. The project aims to address these constraints by increasing primary school access,
participation and completion rates; and through improving learning outcomes.

Preliminary rates o f returnhave been computed on the basis o f alternative assumptions regarding
the internal and external efficiency o f the system. Basedon these assumptions, the project yields
an Internal Economic Rate o f return o f 16percent. Sensitivity analysis using alternative
assumptions on the external and internal efficiency o f the system demonstrate that the rate o f
return will vary between 7 percent inthe low case scenario to 24 percent inthe highcase -these
figures will o fcourse be affected depending on how educationservices are impactedbythe
insurgency. The assumptions and scenarios are discussed indetail inAnnex 9.

Financial: Project sustainability is dependent on two key factors: (a) the availability o f revenue
to meet the additional costs that will arise inevitably from the adoption o f the EFA strategy; and
(b) the willingness o fHMG/Nto meet those new costs at the possible expense o fsecondary and
tertiary education (or at the expense o f allocations to other sectors). Inits MTEF, the
Government has stated clearly that it regards the successful development and maintenance o f
highqualityprimary educationas one ofits highestpriorities. Sustainability beyondthe project
period appears to be financially feasible under most plausible growth scenarios. Using the base
case scenario o f GDP growth (Le., 4.5 percent per annum), the analysis shows that for the project
to be sustainable, HMG/Nwill need to maintain education spending at around 3.5 percent o f


                                                   14

GDP.Under this scenario, to maintain EFA spending at 55 percent o foverall education
spending, close to 18 percent o f government expenditures will need to be spent on education (as
compared to the 15 percent currently being spent).
2. Technical

The overall design o fthe EFAprogram, which will be supported by multiple donors including
IDA, builds upon lessons learned from BPEP I1and earlier educationprojects. Giventhe
importance o f improving access to and quality o f primary educationthrough more effective
school management, the design supports a process wherebypublicly financed and managed
schools with low accountability to parents and students for education outcomes, can be
transformed into more effective schools that enjoy greater management autonomy and increased
access to resources. This process is fully consistent with the ongoing initiative to transfer
government-funded schools to community management, and infact, may offer a transition path
for schools which cannot be transferred inthe medium to longer term.

Key to the transition process is the SGP, which is the primary mechanism for project
implementation. Fundingfor non-salaryrecurrent costs will be substantially increasedthrough
provision o fbasic block grants to all schools. This will be critical for improving the teaching
learning environment as schools will now have more adequate resources to purchase basic
learningmaterials andmaintain the physical condition o f classrooms. The grant also provides an
incentive for SMCs to recruit female and dalit teachers who are essential for improving the
retentionrate o f girls and children from vulnerable communities. The opportunity for schools to
become eligible for higher levels o f grant fundingthrough a voluntary accreditationprocess, will
motivate SMCs to meet performance criteria such as enrolment o f girls and out o f school
children from disadvantaged ethnic groups, and greater accountability inthe use o f resources.

Cost effective and child friendly classroom designs will be developedto suit the topography o f
Nepal's different regions, and allow for the use o f locally available buildingmaterials.
Communities will be able to choose from several alternative designs and undertake the civil
works themselves with the help o f construction manuals containing a complete set o f
specifications, bill o f materials, detailed drawings, and step-by-step guidelines on how to
construct the classroom o f the selected design. To meet the demand for additional classroom
space as and when it arises (e.g., incommunities which have to accommodate a sudden increase
inenrolments as aresult ofout-migration from insurgencyimpactedareas), resources willbe
provided for the construction o ftemporary classrooms. Although these will be low cost
structures, district overseers and technical personnelwill ensure that they meet the technical
specifications for safety andproper ventilation.

3. Fiduciary

The pooled fundingdonors have committedto the principles o fharmonization(as reflected inthe
JFA),which aim to achieve the highest degree o f alignment with HMG/"s          budgetary and
accountability systems, and legislation. Staff inthe implementation agencies (FCGO, MOES,
and DOE) are familiar with government financial management procedures, andhave adequate
knowledge o f the Bank's procurement guidelines from previous involvement inIDA-financed
projects. National consultants will also be appointed from time to time to support their work.



                                                   15

Inview o fthe needto strengthen the internal control system, DOEwill recruit independent
reviewers to visit districts and evaluate the performance o fthe DEOs and SMCs. The reviewers
will submit an independent assessmentreport to the DOEwith recommendations for
improvements inthe system. Communities benefiting from school block grants will be required
to organize local committees (e.g., local parents' committees) to undertake social audits, the
findings o fwhich will be reported to the responsible DEO. These audit reports will be carefully
monitored byDOE and included as a key output inthe EFAprogram monitoring framework. A
mechanism will also beput inplace for performance audits to assess the outcomes o fthe EFA
program.

The Auditor General (AG) o fthe Kingdom o fNepali s the statutory auditor o f the project. Since
the Constitution has mandated the AG to undertakeboth financial and performance audits,
MOES and the pooled fundingdonors will request the AG to carry out periodic performance
audits on the EFAprogram inaddition to the required financial audits. An audit committee under
the chairmanship o fthe Secretary, MOES, will be established to monitor the actions taken on
audit findings.

Overall, the financial management arrangements for the project and the EFA Program as a
whole, meet the Bank's minimumrequirements for effective financial control o f the project.
Areas needing further improvement/capacity building are indicated inAnnex 7.

The EFA 2004-2009 program will begin inmid-July 2004. Since the proposed IDA credit will
not be effective by this date, HMG/Nwill require retroactive financing o f eligible expenditures
prior to the Credit effectiveness date but after July 15,2004.

4. Social

Based on the findings and recommendations o f a social assessment study, HMG/Nhas prepared
a Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VCDP). The VCDP, which was finalized after
extensive consultation with stakeholders, lays out a number o f steps that should be taken to
comply with OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples and ensure that the project not only causes no
negative impacts on indigenous people and other vulnerable groups, but that it provides the
necessary measures to ensure that they get equal access to project benefits. These measures
include: (i)introducinghome-to-school language transition program inareas where there are
large populations for whom Nepali is not a mother tongue; (ii)   providing incentives for
recruitment o f local bilingual women teachers inprimary schools where necessary; (iii)
disaggregating EMIS data by gender, caste, ethnicity and special needs to permit tracking o f
progress on inclusive educationobjectives; and (iv) enabling partnerships between the SMC and
local community groups.

Experience has indicated that for effective implementation, more trained staff who are based in
the field are needed, as mainstreaming o f accountability for social inclusionhas beendifficult.
More than rules, a shift inattitudes andbehavior i s needed to stimulate real social transformation
inschools. The EFAprogramenvisages support to SMCs from localwomen's, children's and
other community groups to create increased ownership and broadparticipation insocial
monitoring o f education service delivery. Partnerships with such groups will be encouraged to
strengthen the EMIS and monitoring through community social mapping, and to carry out social

audit of school expenditures, including allocation o f scholarships to the most needy girls and
Dalits.

5.Environment

N o large scale, significant andor irreversible impact is anticipated inthis project. An
environmental review by the DOE has identified several small-scale and local environmental
issues potentially associated with project activities. These issues relate to site selection and
planning (natural hazards; sensitive ecological regions; arsenic inthe drinkingwater supplied in
the schools; site drainage); buildingdesign and construction (indoor air quality and daylight
factor inside the classrooms, sanitation facilities and waste management, water supply); and
maintenance duringthe operationperiod (site cleanliness and hygiene, prevention o f enteric
infections).

The DOEhas completed studies on: (a) the implications o f arsenic inwater supply, especially in
the Terai area, and testing andmitigation requirements under the project; (b) systems for
ensuring and improving sanitation facilities inschools; (c) appropriate methods for site selection
o f school buildings, sanitation andwater facilities; and (d) appropriate designs and materials for
creating a good learning environment with adequate lighting, ventilation, and acoustics. The
findings o f this assessment were used to prepare the National Environment Guideline for School
Improvement and Facility Management inNepal. This guideline will be followed while
constructing new schools, or inadditions or rehabilitations o f the existing schools/classrooms.

The National Environment Guideline for School Improvement and Facility Management in
Nepal, prepared inthe course o f Environmental Assessment (EA) o f this project, includes: (a)
guidelines for site selection and planning o f school buildings; (b) guidelines for design o f school
buildingsincluding provisions for sanitation, sewage disposal, site drainage, solid waste
management, and landscape development; (c) guidelines for managing environmental issues
duringconstruction including environmental monitoring duringconstruction; and (d)
arrangements for regular supervision and periodic environmental audits.

Environmental Clearances. The project does not require any environmental clearance bythe
Government. Inthe course o fproject implementation, there mightbe a few schools located in
forests or other protected areas. Ifsuch cases arise, site-specific clearance will be obtained, and
all requisite government conditions will be fulfilled.

Community Consultations and Public Disclosure. Community consultation is an integral part o f
the overall EFAprogram. The local communities and institutions are involved inidentification,
planning,design, implementation, operation andmaintenance o fthe schools andall other
program activities. Consultationswith schoolteachers, experts, NGOs and other stakeholders will
continue throughout the implementation period. Duringthe review o f current school construction
activities, as part o fthe EA, consultations were heldwith schoolteachers andNGOs/CBOs.

Nepal is one o f the poorest countries inthe world, with about 40 percent o f the population living
on less than US$1per day. Although there has been some progress against the MDGs, social
indicators remain weak and it will be difficult to attain most of the MDGs.

Nepali society is marked by inequity. Poverty i s largely a ruralphenomenon, and 85 percent o f
the total populationo f23 millionreside inrural areas. Poverty is highest inthe mountain region'
and inthe mid- and far-westem districts.

Political Context

The political environment inNepal is markedby instability. Democratic govemance is on hold
since the Parliament was dissolved in2002. Elections for local governments were also cancelled
inthe same year.

The insurgency that beganin 1996 as a low intensity rural campaign escalated in2001. A state of
emergency was declared and the armywas mobilized. Over 10,000 lives have been lost to
assassination and armed conflict. Insurgents have destroyed infrastructure such as local
government offices andtelecommunications. The conflict has spread across the country; as a
result, access o f the Government apparatus to many parts o f the country has beenconstrained.

There is no detailed account o f the impact of the insurgency on rural education. Education
officials are hopeful that insurgents will allow schools to function. However, it is known that
several hundredschools have been closed and teachers are taxed by the insurgents. Bothteachers
andstudents havemigratedto district towns. Travel, includingvisits to schools, hasbeen
curtailed for manydistrict and local education officials.

Social Context

Society is characterized by significant ethnic and caste-based disparities. A hierarchical caste
structure defines social status for the Hindupopulation. The lowest castes (Dah), which
comprise approximately 15 percent o f the population, have a very highpoverty incidence and are
subject to significant social exclusion. Beyond this, some 37 percent o f the population are
categorized into 93 ethnic groups with their own mother tongue. These communities fall within
the international definition o f indigenous peoples; inNepal, they are generally referred to as
`janajati'. There i s considerable income variation across these groups; many are poor, some are
not. Janajatis are found inmost o fNepal's districts, and comprise more than halfo fthe
population in26 o f the 75 districts. Ofthe 93 ethnic groups counted inthe census, 81 have less
than one percent each o f the total population.

Education Status

Although there has been progress inachieving equitable access to education for girls, dalits and
janajatis, disparities remain, especially for dalits. The primaryNER increased from 67.5 in 1995
to 81.1 in2001, but the rate for girls was 75.1 and for boys 86.9.           *  The NER for dalit students is
not officially reported, but is estimated to be about 40 percent for boys and 20 percent for girls.

Over the past twenty years, the adult male literacy rate has increased from 34 percent to 66
percent, but the gap betweenmale and female literacy has remainedthe same over this period,
with 43 percent o fadult women being literate in2001. The literacy rate for dalit women is 12
percent; among the larger Janajati communities the overall literacy rate ranges from 53 to 66
percent.

The public primary school system i s highly inefficient. Fifteenpercent o f students enrolled in
grade one are under-aged, and 39 percent o f these repeat the grade. The survival rate to grade
five is 67 percent. Less than a thirdofthe studentswho begin primary school enter lower
secondary school and only about 12 percent enter higher secondary school. Gender, caste and
ethnic disparities inenrolments increase with the level o f education, andpoverty plays a key
role. Only 5 percent o f secondary students are from the lowest income quintile; at the university
level, less than 1percent are drawn from the poorest fifth o f the p~pulation.~

The quality o f public education i s also low, with students gettingless than one-half o f answers
correct on grade three and grade five achievement tests. The pass rate for students from public
schools on the grade ten school leaving exam have ranged from 25 to 35 percent over the past
decade; private school students do more than twice as well. Causes of low achievement at the
primary level include inadequately trained teachers, highlevels o f student and teacher
absenteeism, long delays inthe delivery o f textbooks and leamingmaterials, and delayed
provision o f (inadequate) funding to school^.^

PrimaryandBasicEducationSystem

Nepal's education system is overwhelmingly publicly financed and managed.5 There are 21,000
public primary schools, o fwhich 19,000 are inrural areas. There are 1,900 schools financed and
managed by communities and 2,100 private primary schools, almost all o f the latter inurban
areas. The number o f private primary schools is falling as insurgents are targeting them for
closure. Public primary schools serve 3.4 million children. The overall teacher to student ratio is
1:40, but this varies byecological region with the ratio insmall mountainschools being 1:31. In
the larger and usually overcrowded Terai schools, the ratio is 155. Ofthe 78,000 teachers in
public primary schools, 13,000 (21percent) are female. Only 15 percent o fprimaryteachers are
fully trained. Dalit andjanajati participation inthe teachingwork force isvery low incomparison
with their share o fthe total population.

Teachers have been certified and appointed nationwide through the TSC. Recently, the MOES
has taken steps to break the hold o fthe TSC on teacher appointments so that teachers can be
appointed locally by SMCs. Currently, a SMC can appoint teachers only ifthe TSC cannot
assign one to the school.

Teacher education i s provided through B.Ed and M.Edprograms incolleges and universities. A
ten-month certification program i s provided nationally through a combination o fresidentialand
distance education. Recurrent in-service training is provided at the school and cluster level by
trained resource persons.

The system is managed by the DOE, MOES inKathmandu through Education Offices ineach o f
the 75 districts. DEOs are responsible for all levels o fpublic education. DEOs work through
resource persons inResource Centers, which provide monitoring and professional support to a
cluster o f 10-25 primary schools. DEOs are responsible for ensuring the flow o f funds to schools
(currently grants for salaries and 300 N R s Grants to teacher for teaching materials), distribution
o f textbooks, organizing teacher in-service and other training activities, preparing expenditure
and output reports every four months, and EMIS reports every year. DEOs also prepare an
annual District EducationPlan andbudget for review inthe MOES.

The system as a whole has been characterized by weak leadership andmanagement. Despite the
hierarchy o f management, schools are frequently isolated. Reporting is slow and o f uneven
quality.

Decentralizationo f funding for andmanagement o fpublic services is a pillar o fthe
Government's PRS; increased authority o f communities has beenshown to improve efficiency
and outcomes because communities can find local solutions for local problems. Efforts to
decentralize management authority and resources to schools have been uncertain untilrecently.
However, the program o f transferring schools to SMCs, with substantial grant financing, has
taken hold. One thousand schools are expected to bemanagedby SMCs in2005; the
Government's target for scaling up this effort is 12,000 schools by 2009. The EFA 2004-2009
program should provide major impetus to the decentralization effort through substantially
increased grants tied to school performance.

                                     NEPAL: EducationFor All Project

Background

Primary education inNepal comprises grades one to five. Public, community-funded, andprivate
schools account for 85 percent, six percent and nine percent, respectively, o fprimary enrolments.
Publicly-funded primary schools are not allowed to levy fees on students. Privateprimary schools
offer pre-primary programs of up to three years' duration. Public schools are also starting to add
pre-primary classes, which are not funded by the Government.'

In2002, the NERinprimary education(as reportedbythe EMIS) was 82percent. Since 1995,
except for one year, the NERhas been increasing at approximately one percent per annum. The
completion rate increased from 44 percent to 59 percent between 1998 to 2001. Ifthe current
pace o f improvement inaccess i s not accelerated, and the survival rate does not improve, Nepal is
not likely to be able to meet the MDGtarget o fUniversal Primary Education by 2015. This
challenge seems even greater considering the possibility that enrolment statistics may havebeen
inflated due to weaknesses inthe present data collection and analysis system.

Inspite ofconsiderable investments inthe basic andprimary educationsub-sector, the quality of
education still remains poor with average examination scores at grade three and grade five
reaching only about 51percent and 50 percent, respectively, in2001. The perceived quality gaps
between private andpublic provision, which are reinforcedby a significant difference insuccess
rates inSchool Leaving Certificate Examinations - 85 percent for private schools and 15 percent
for public schools -has ledto flight o f children from well to do families to private schools that
has created segregation ineducation along income lines.

Respondingto the deep public mistrust o fthe public school system, the Parliament in2001,
passed the Seventh Amendment to the EducationAct paving the way for schools to be made
more accountable to the community they serve. The Amendment calls for the formation o f school
management committees (SMC), the members o f which will be elected byparents and/or
guardians from among themselves. Subsequently, the Government has issued directives allowing
transfer o fpublic schools to community management, and decentralizing significant authority to
the SMCs o f community-managed schools. To date, about three percent o fpublic schools have
been transferred to community management. The Government has set a target o f transferring to
community management, over a thirdo f public schools by 2007.

Important lessons have been leamed from the ongoing Basic and Primary EducationProject
(BPEP 11)being supported by eight donors including IDA.First, fragmented and uncoordinated
deliveryo fdevelopmental inputsto schools byvarious units o fthe Government has helpedlittle
to improve service delivery o f schools. Second, artificial segregation between regular and


'The  Government does not provide grants for pre-primary teachers nor bear other costs o f the program. Parents who
send their children to pre-primary classes will have to pay fees unless the schools finda means o f cross-subsidizing
these classes.

developmental activities o f schools hinder synergy o f investments inschook2Third,
empowerment o f schools and a school-centered approach will be critical for ensuring greater
returns from investments. Basedon the lessons learnt, the following strategies will be adopted in
the EFA: (i)   fundingo fschools throughblock grants allowing communities to maketheir own
choices interms o f inputshnvestments and thus nurturingcommunity/school initiative; (ii)
introduction o f a full sector wide approach with a financing arrangement that calls for integration
o fregular operations and developmental activities, thus ensuring synergy o f investments; (iii)
increased focus on social inclusion and accountability; and (iv) introduction of a school
accreditation system linking award o fblock grants with achievement levels o f school^.^ These
strategies will not be completely new to Nepal. Since August 2003, the IDA-financed
Community School Support Project, has led the way to introduce block and performance grants
to schools, and partnership o f schools with Support Organizations including NGOs to achieve
school improvement targets, including those related to social inclusion and accountability.

The current conducive policy environment and rich experience from BPEP I1will enable the
project to achieve significant improvements inthe sub-sector. Duringproject preparation, a
careful policy analysis was carried out to ensure that all policy gaps are addressed. This analysis
has revealed four critical policy gaps inthe sub-sector. First, central recruitment o f teachers by
the TSC reduces the accountability o fteachers to schools, and leads to unevendeployment o f
teachers given that centrally recruited teachers are unwilling to move to ruralhemote areas.
Second, the lack o f female teachers inmore than halfo f the schools has hinderedprogress
towards gender parity. Third, as a result o f grossly inadequate non-salary recurrent budgets,
schools are unable to deliver quality education. This has forced many schools to levy fees, which
is contrary to the Law, and consequently, denying access to the poor. Fourth, late delivery o f free
textbooks i s a persistent problem hindering children's learning.

To address the above policy gaps, the Government has committed to: (i)                 convert all teacher
positions incommunity-managed schools that fall vacant after July 16,2004 into community-
recruited positions funded by the Government, but which are not subject to recruitment through
the TSC; (ii)   fund additional teachers requiredinschools through block grants allowing schools
to recruit teachers without referring to the TSC; (iii)       establish two female teacher posts inevery
primary school; (iv) increase school non-salary recurrent budgets through block grants; and (v)
increase the role o f the private sector intextbook development, production and distribution.

The EFA Program

The Government's Education for All (EFA) 2004-2009 programwill support the basic and
primary education sub-sector with a view to meet the international andnational commitments for
"education for all" as well as the targets o fthe MDGs with respect to universal primary education
and gender parity. This program builds on the: (i)         Tenth Plan (2002-2007), which constitutes
Nepal's PRS; (ii)    MTEF(2003-2006); and(iii) NationalPlano fAction (2002-2015). The
                                                        EFA
program, estimated to cost about US$789 million, will be hndedby the Government (US$514



  The development budget is predominantly fhnded through external assistance while the regular budget is financed
by domestic resources. Recognizingthat this does not meet international norms, the Government is inthe process o f
reclassifying development and regular expenditures into recurrent and capital categories.
  The block grants program and the associated school accreditation system are described inAnnex 17.

                                                         31

million, 65 percent), with donors providing the balance under a SWAP ledby the Government
and underpinnedby the EFA strategy. JICA, WFP, IDA, ADB andUNICEFwill provide
approximately US$125 million or 16 percent o fprogram requirements through parallelproject
financing. Denmark, Finland, Norway, DfIDKJnited Kingdom and IDA will pool their funds
(US$150 million or 19% o fthe EFAbudget) with government resources under the SWAP. IDA
will contribute US$50 million incredit financing to the pool through a SIL.

The pooled funding is designed to meet the hnding gap for the Government's EFA program
rather than financing a particular set o f activities under the program. Hence, the pooled donor
resources, which will be blendedwith government resources, cannot be attributed to any specific
set o f development activities under the program. By virtue o fthis design, the IDA-financed
project will monitor the outputs and outcomes o fthe sub-sector wide EFA program. Financial
monitoring under the project will, however, not extend to parallel donor funding, implyingthat
from the public expenditure monitoring perspective, the estimated costs o f the EFAprogram will
be around US$664 million (Annex 5).

Drawing from the goals o fthe Dakar Framework for Action, the EFAprogram is built around the
following six thrusts: expanding and improving early childhood development; ensuring access to
education for all children; meeting the leaming needs o f all children including indigenous peoples
andlinguistic minorities; reducingadult literacy; eliminating gender disparity; and improving all
aspects o f quality education.

Expandingand ImprovingEarlyChildhoodDevelopment

Completion o f early childhood development program has been shown inNepal to improve
learning gains and completion rates. Therefore, ECD programs will have particular relevance for
children from deprived families. Recognizingthis fact, the EFA program will target ECD
interventions to most remote districts and other disadvantaged areas.4 The program also addresses
the problem o f underage enrolment ingrade one (approximately 15% o f enrolment) leading to
highrepetitionrates with significant negative impact onbothleaming outcomes and system
efficiency. At present, the program i s being implemented on a cost sharing basis. The
Government provides N R s 500 per month towards remuneration o f an ECD facilitator. As this is
significantly less than the salary o f a primary school teacher (over N R s 4,000 per month), there i s
intention to raise this to N R s 1,000 per month. Increased subsidies proposed for the ECD
programs under EFAwill increase the access o fpoor families to the programs.

At present, there are around5,700 community-based and school-based public ECD centers. In
addition, there are about 1,500 pre-primary classes contributing to the same purpose. The EFA
program envisages establishment o f 11,000 new ECD centers. The centers will cater for around
270,000 children annually. The program aims at increasing the percentage o fnew entrants to
grade one with ECD experience from eight percent in2001 to 60 percent in2009.




  Targeting will also be basedon low participationrates, and targeting within districts may be necessary to serve
pockets with lower participation rates.

EnsuringAccess to Educationfor All Children

The second thrust o fthe EFAprogram is to ensure that all children, particularly girls, children in
difficult circumstances and those belonging to ethnic minorities, have access to andcomplete
primary education o f good quality. A specific objective will be to increase the NER from 81% in
2001 to 96% in2009. This will be a tremendous challenge, given that the promotion rate at grade
one is only around 50% in2001. To mitigate economic, social and cultural barriers to access,
financial assistance will be provided to girls from remote districts, dalit children, children from
disadvantaged janajatis5 and other children from households below poverty line. Social inclusion
will bepromoted throughpartnerships with local organizations, and incentivesto schools.
Support from local bodies, particularly Village Development Committees (VDCs) and
municipalities i s envisioned for facilitating access to school for excluded groups through
development o f village education plans and incentivesprovided to local bodies.

Enrolment opportunities will be improved through construction and fumishing o f 8,000 new
classrooms, rehabilitation o f 6,000 classrooms, improving site services in5,000 schools with
special focus on toilets for girls and safe drinkingwater. A key objective will be to meet the
classroom requirements o f all schools so that no child is denied access to school. Schools that
have not qualified for new permanent classrooms but have highdemand for access, will be
provided with temporary classrooms. Duringthe EFAprogramperiod, about 1,000 temporary
classrooms, which are low-cost, safe, well lit, and well ventilated structures will be built using
local materials. Inaddition to the standard classroom designs developed for BPEP, alternative
designs that are adapted to different geographical and site conditions will offer schools a choice
inwhat best suits the local environment (details providedinAnnex 2). Civilworks will
undertaken by schools on a cost sharing basis, and the DE0 will assist insite supervisionto
assure quality. Inaddition to school works, the EFAprogramwill also finance construction o f23
DEOs and250 Resource Centers (RCs), which are components o fthe overall infrastructure for
service delivery.

The EFA program will continue to support altemative schooling for children aged six to eight
years invery small and remote hamlets through 1,000 school outreach programs. For children in
the eight to 14years age group who could notjoin school, 800 flexible schooling programs will
be available. Support will continue duringthe programperiod for special needs education to cater
to children with leaming difficulties, and to promote inclusive education. A conflict anddisaster
fundwill be established to support school children victimized bythe insurgency, natural
calamities, and HIV AIDS. An operational framework for this fund will be prepared before
commencement o f the EFAprogram.

Meetingthe LearningNeeds of all ChildrenIncludingIndigenousPeoples and Linguistic
Minorities

Home to school transition support to non-Nepali speaking children, constituting about 50% o f
children inNepal, will be developed andpiloted inabout 50 schools serving predominantlynon-
Nepali speakingpopulations infive districts. The design o f the pilot will be completedby



  Indigenous ethnic groups.

                                                   33

December 2004. Pilot results will guide expansion o f the initiative to cover about 50% of schools
serving predominantly non-Nepali speaking populations. Inaddition, support will be provided for
activities aimed at: (a) promotion o fprimary education inmother tongue; (b) incorporationo f life
skills and local content inthe school curriculum; and(c) communication ofprogram objectives
and strategies.

ImprovingAdult Literacy

A primarygoal is to increase the adult literacy rate (15+ years) from 48 percent in2001 to 66
percent in2009. At the same time, the literacy gender parity index will be raised from 0.6 in2001
to 0.9 in2009. To achieve these goals, support will continue for the ongoing Women's Literacy
Program andNational Literacy Campaign. It i s expected that the Women's Literacy program will
provide basic literacy to 60,000 women and enable 48,000 others to become functionally literate.
Ten percent o f the women who attain functional literacy will be trained inself-employment skills.
Women's Literacy programs will be focused in 18 low literacy districts. Duringthe EFAprogram
period, an achievement test for adult literacy will be instituted.

Support will also be provided to 205 community learning centers catering to out o f school
children and neo-literates. Out o f School Programs will be targeted to school dropouts with the
primary purpose o f redirectingthem to schools. About 250,000 children will benefit from this
program. Supervision o f Out o f School Programs and adult literacy programs will be shifted from
DEOs to VDCslschools as the capacity o f the latter is built up.

EliminatingGenderDisparity

The MDGs aim to close the gender gap inprimary educationby 2005. InNepal, NER for girls
laggedbehind that for boys by about 12 percent in2001. The gender gap i s muchwider among
dalits, deprived ethnic and other disadvantaged groups. This implies that the gender gap can only
be closed ifefforts to increase girls' enrolment are integratedwith efforts to enroll dalits,
deprived ethnic andother disadvantaged groups. The Government's strategy has been andwill be
to provide scholarships o fN R s 250 per year to girls, dalits, and children from other
disadvantaged groups. These scholarships will be fimded through the School GrantsProgram
(SGP) andbenefit about 650,000 students per year. Under the SGP, booster scholarships o fN R s
500 per year will be introduced to mainstream about 120,000 children from excludedhouseholds
per year. Takinginto account the additional costs due to higher enrolments as well as the need for
providing incentives to schools, an additional amount o f N R s 100per scholarshiphooster
scholarship per year will be awarded as an untied grant, which may also be usedto provide
additional support to needy students.

Discrimination o f dalits, comprising about 15% o f the population o f the country, inschools has
beenrecognized as one o f the major factors hindering access to andretention o f dalit children. In
spite o f the legal provisions for making discrimination illegal, deep rooted traditions andlack o f
an operational framework for preventing discrimination have limitedprogress towards reduction
o f discriminatory behavior. An important step inaddressingthis problemwill be development of
a framework (rules and enforcement) for preventing the discrimination o fgirls, dalits and other
groups.



                                                 34

To encourage females and dalits who aspire to become teachers, scholarships will be provided to
100pre-service teacher trainees for undertakingthe ten-month teacher's training course. To
motivate schools to recruit female and dalit teachers, a one-time bonus o fN R s 5,000 per newly
recruited female or dalit teacher will be awarded to schools. These scholarships and bonuses will
be paid out o f school grants.

ImprovingAll Aspects of QualityEducation

The major focus o f the EFA program will be empower SMCs to take initiative for school
improvement inpartnership with the community. The first step inthis direction will be
articulation o f a shared vision for the school and the community through a participatory process.
This will be the corner stone o f school improvement planning, aninitiative that will be supported
through various types o f earmarked andblock grants to schools to cover quality andphysical
improvement needs, non-salary recurrent costs, capacity buildingneeds, and support for
children's access to and retention inschools. School improvement plans are now being prepared
in12districts; all schools areexpectedto preparethese plansbythe endo fthe EFAprogram
period.

Training andcapacity buildingfor SMC members, head teachers and community organizations
will be providedto enable them to effectively access anduse grant resources. Key elements of the
grants program will be award o fperformance bonuses to schools, incentive grants to community-
managed schools, and free textbooks andbasic learning materials to all children. Inaddition,
support will beprovided for the purchase o fmaterials for book comers inclassrooms, research
anddevelopment activities at the center anddistricts, including school-based actionresearch, and
piloting of computer education.

Recurrent training for teachers developed duringBPEP I1will be strengthened to make it more
relevant to local contexts. A ten-month certificate training course to enable teachers to qualify for
certification i s being strengthened and expanded with support from the ADB.

The EMIS will be strengthened and streamlinedto enable rapid monitoring o f key outputs and
outcomes at the school and district level (Annex 3). Evaluation o f initiatives such as scholarships
to girls, dalits and children belonging to disadvantaged janajati and other disadvantaged groups,
alternative education, and adult literacy programs will be undertaken to inform design
modifications and/or up-scaling.

SpecialEFA ProgramFeatures

 School Grants: The critical difference indesign and implementationmodality betweenthe EFA
program and BPEP 11,lies inthe expanded use o f block and earmarked grants to replace in-kind
 support provided to schools. Grants will be tied to a school accreditation system that will be
 introduced under the program. Under this system, schools will be classified into three categories:
unaccredited, grade one, and grade two. Unaccredited schools will be eligible for basic grants.
 Grades one and two schools will be eligible for level 1andlevel 2 grants, respectively.

 According to a proposal prepared by the DOE, accreditation will bebased on eight indicators: (i)
 accountability/transparency; (ii) physical facilities; (iii) availability and training; (iv)
                                                           teacher


                                                    35

extemal environment (drinkingwater and sanitation inparticular); (v) intemal environment
(classroom, leaming materials and fumiture); (vi) co-curricular activities; (vii) school operating
processes; and (viii) outcomes. Schools meeting grade one benchmarks for the first seven
indicators will qualify for level 1block grants. Ifthey meet the eight indicator for outcomes, a
bonus will be awarded as well. Similarly, schools meeting the higher benchmarks set for grade
two, will be eligible for level 2 grants. Grade two schools that perform well on outcomes will also
berewardedwith bonus payments. These criteria will be finalized byJuly, 2004 andincluded in
an Operational Manual for administration o f school grants.

Education outcomes will be improved through the synergy o f sub-program activities. ECD and
pre-primary classes improve leaming readiness and increase system efficiency by reducing
underage enrolments; both factors should contribute to enhanced learningachievement and
completion rates. Involvement o f community organizations for mainstreaming out o f school
children, combined with scholarship programs, improved school facilities, increased literacy for
mothers, and support to students for language transition, will increase demand for schooling.
Expansiono f the number o f classrooms will accommodate growing demand. The impact o f all o f
these programs will be increasedby giving schools the central role inservice delivery through the
expanded block grants andcapacitybuildingprograms.

EFAProaamFunding:Inaddition to the `development budget' costs associatedwith the six
main EFA thrusts (US$182 million), the Government andpoolingpartners will support `regular
budget' costs - salaries andbenefits o f teachers andmanagerial staff under the MOES, which are
estimated to be around US$482 million. Parallel hndingi s also provided for the sub-sector
through projects outside the pooled financing arrangement. These projects, contributing about
US$125 million, include: (i)  PrimarySchool ConstructionProject (JICA); (ii)     PrimarySchool
NutritionFoodProgram (WFP); (iii)       School Transfer and Incentive Program (IDA); (iv) Teacher
EducationProject (ADB); (v) Basic and Primary Education includingthe ECD Project
(UNICEF); and (vi) UNESCO Support to Community LeamingCenterdECD.

Joint Financing Arrangement: Thejoint financing arrangement between HMG/Nandfive pooling
donor partners -Denmark, Finland, Norway, DfID/UK, IDA- enables the use o f the
Government's financial management and reporting procedures for the EFA program. This has the
benefit o fnot only reducing transaction costs for all the parties concerned, but will also increase
MOES compliance with HMG/"s          recently amended FAR. Further reduction inthe
Government's administrative burden will be achieved through a strengthened and streamlined
EMIS, which will provide output and outcome information needed for monitoringprogress
against program objectives and results indicators.

Under thejoint financing arrangement, IDA and pooling partners will track all EFAprogram
expenditures inboth the regular and development budgets excepting those financed through
parallel projects supported bynon-pooling partners.

This implies that the program budget for financial monitoring purposes will beUS$664 million
for the five-year period.




'Regular  budget comprises mainly recurrent expenditures (salaries, administrative costs). Under the present system,
HMG/Nfinances 100%o f the regular budget.
 Developmentbudget includes both capital and recurrent cost items, which are predominantly funded through
external assistance. HMG/N contributes a small share (around 18%) to development expenditures, mainly inthe form
of counterpart fundingfor donor-supported projects.
 Donors supporting projects outside the pooling arrangement include JICA, WFP, ADB and UNICEF.
 Denmark, Finland, Norway, DflDM( and IDA will enter into ajoint financing arrangement with HMG/N.

                               NEPAL,: EducationFor All Project

The partnership between the Government anddonor partners established for the Basic and
PrimaryEducation Project I1(BPEP 11)has worked well, andwill be strengthened inthe
proposed operation. Basedon successful use o f basket financing for BPEP 11, and the
Government's objective o f increased donor harmonization, a Donor COC has been agreed upon,
and a Joint FinancingArrangement (JFA) for fund pooling by four donors and the Government,
has been developed. The JFA, details o fwhich are given inAnnex 15, i s expected to be signed by
all parties before the EFA program commences. The COC reflects donor and government
commitment to enhance aid effectiveness by decreasing the transaction costs o fpartnership, and
improve coordination amongst the partners.

The JFA sets forth the agreements to be reached between the Government and signatory partners
for the creation and management o fpooled donor funding arrangements insupport o f the EFA
program. Donor funds will be deposited ina government bank account andmanaged bythe
Ministryo fFinance through government budget andfinancial management procedures (Annex
7).

Implementation arrangements are largely based on those used for the BPEP 11, and reflect the
highprioritythat the EFAprogramholds for the Government, includingextension o fthe sector
wide approach. The maindeviation from BPEP I1inrespect o fimplementationmodality will be
the enhanced role o f schools andcommunities, and a shift from the component driven approach
to a holistic, school-centered approach.

Financial Management. The MOF/FCGO will be accountable for the financial management o f
pooled government and donor funds for the EFAprogram. To ensure timely production o f
financial reports, the FCGO will provide access to its database to the DOE.The Financial
Controller inthe DOEwill extract the relevant information from the FCGO database for the
compilation o f reports, which are endorsedby the FCGO before submissionto pooling donor
partners. The D O E will maintain the accounts o fpooled donor funds identifiedby specific budget
codes inaccordance with the Government's cash-based accounting system.

EFAProaamManagement. The MOES will bethe implementingagency for the program in
coordinationwith the MOF, Ministry o f Local Development (MLD), other line education
agencies and specialized institutions, civil society, international NGOs andNGOs, including
those representing dalits andjanajatis.

A ProgramManagement Committee (PMC) will be established to: (a) oversee preparationo fthe
ASIP and AWPB; (b) monitor overall program implementationprogress; and (c) bringto the
attention o fthe Secretary, MOES,any cross-cutting issues impacting on program
implementation, which require inter-ministerial coordination among MOES,M O F andMLD.
PMC members comprise:

  1. Joint Secretary, PlanningDivision, MOES (Chair)
  2. Director General, DOE
  3. Joint Financial Comptroller General, Office o f the Financial Comptroller General

Planning and Proaamminq. Decentralizedplanning and programmingwas introduced during
BPEP through pilot tests o f school improvement and district education plans. These plans serve
as a major strategy for empowering communities and achieving holistic implementation o f EFA
strategies at the school and community level. SIPSare reviewed at the District level and provide
the basis for the award o f SIP grants to schools.

DEOs will prepare annual District Education Plans, review school improvement plans, disburse
grants to school bank accounts, monitor school performance, and report twice annually onkey
outcome andprocess indicators, andthree times a year on key output indicators (Annex 7).

School Grants Program. The expanded SGP will be the primary mechanism for implementation,
including for areas affectedby the insurgency. MOES will support the implementation o f the
SBG through public communication and outreach programs to build awareness o f the new
opportunities for school, a program o fworkshops to introduce the SBG to district staff, SMCs
and teachers, and capacity building for the establishment o f local school support organizations
andparent committees for school audits.

A school accreditationsystem will be introducedas a part o fthe program. Schools will take part
inaccreditationvoluntarily. Schools takingpartinaccreditationwill conduct selfassessment,
which will be verified ex-post by experts inthe accreditation roster approved at the district level.
To leverage school improvement, block grants to schools will be linked to accreditation. Schools
will be encouraged to use block grants to engage outside support for school improvement from
NGOs and Support Organizations. DEOs will disburse grants to school bank accounts and
monitor performance. Social audits of school performance anduse o f funds will be conducted by
committees formed by communities (e.g., parents' committees) and reviewed by DEOs. A
random sample o f social audits will be reviewed by DOE, andthe results reported inthe APR.

Operational manuals for the school grants program will be developed and tested. Training will be
provided to district staff, school management committees and head teachers. SIPSand
accreditationwill be the instruments through which schools can apply for grants. School
Management Committees will be required to publicly disclose their finances byposting the
information at the school and the office o f the VDC.

The delivery o f services from the DOE and other central agencies will be sharply reduced as the
school grants program i s scaled up. The DOEwill increasingly focus on program monitoring and
technical support to districts.

Donor Coordination. All donor partners are coordinated by the Foreign Aid Coordination Section
(FACS) o fthe MOES. FACS will convene meetings o f the local representatives o f all donors,
including those providing parallel financing.

A Joint Annual Review inApril o f each year will assess implementationprogress, outcomes and
expenditures as provided through the APR prepared by the MOES for the fiscal year endingin
July o fthe previous year. The APR will report on outcomes, intermediate outcomes, outputs and
expenditures. The ASIP andthe AWPB for the next year will also be presented and reviewed.
Pooling donors will make funding commitments for the next year on the basis of the ASIP,
AWPB andperformance as reportedinthe APR (Annex 7).

Inaddition to the April Annual Review, a consultativemeetingwill beheld inDecember ofeach
year betweenpooling donors andthe Government. Inaccordance with JFA provisions, this
meeting will review the preliminary consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year
as well as financial and output reports for the first trimester o f the current year. Both the Annual
Review and the consultative meeting will be preceded by independent technical reviews financed
outside the pooling arrangement, which provide additional information to pooling partners on
financial and overall implementationprogress. The technical reviews will include site visits to a
sample o f districts and schools inthose districts. Inlight o fthe conflict situation andconsequent
difficulty o f donors to travel to the field, suitably qualified agents would be contracted locally for
carrying out the site visits to assess implementationprogress.

CountryFinancialIssues

The Nepal CFAA, jointly conducted byHMG/Nand IDA, was completed in2002. The
assessment concluded that the failure to comply with the impressive legal and regulatory
fiduciary framework makes fiduciary risk inNepal "High" by the standards o fthat framework.
Faithful implementation o f the framework would have brought risks closer to good practices
found indeveloped countries. Fiduciary risk inNepal is similar to that inmost developing
countries.

The Government has put inplace a sound financial management system, with the introduction o f
a computerized Financial Management Information System. The FMIS, which is an integrated
system connecting 64 out o f 75 districts (of which, 57 are currently functional), allows the FCGO
to receive on-line expenditure reports from District Treasury Controller Offices (DTCO).

The development budget was prioritized in2002 (as part o fa three year MTEF), and the number
o fprojects/programs was significantly reduced. Priority projects are requiredto have trimester
work plans with detailed outputlphysical achievement targets and expected results. Expenditure
reporting and fund release procedures are now linked to performance ofpriority project; this
requirement will be extended to all other projects/activities. Information on budget allocations,
expenditures andoutputs are now published, and made available to the public. A web portal for
HMG/N, containing information onprojects and activitieshas been created, with links to
government departments.

Starting from FY2005, HMG/Nintends to reclassify expenditures under the regular and
development budgets as recurrent and capital expenditures. The Government has also constituted
the Accounting Standards Board and Auditing Standards Board inMarch, 2003, which since
then, havereleased four Accounting Standards andeight AuditingStandards, respectively.
Overall, implementation o f the development actionplan as agreed inthe CFAA for the public and
private sectors, is satisfactory.

EFA Programand FinancingPlan

The EFA National Plan o f Action (NPA) i s designed to meet national and international
commitments ineducation. The EFA Core Document reflects the NPA for the period 2004-2009.
Donor partners agreed that this document provides a largely satisfactory policy andstrategy
framework for implementation o f the NPA.The objectives o f the EFAprogram, as described in
the Core Document are to: a) ensure access and equity inprimary education, b) enhance quality
andrelevance o fbasic and primary education, and c) improve efficiency andinstitutional
capacity.

The sub-sector program that HMG/Nand donor partners arejointly financing i s the total public
expenditure on basic and primary education, including both development and regular
expenditures. As such, the program incorporates planning and monitoring ofthe contributions o f
HMG/N,pooling donors (DANIDA, DfID,Finland, N O W , IDA), and donors providing
parallel project financing outside the pool. The pooling donors have committed to harmonization

                                                 42

principles as reflected inthe JFA for providing financial support to the EFAprogram. Under the
JFA, which also serves as a coordination and consultative framework for the signatories, the
pooling partners will subscribe to the use o f government systems for disbursement and
accounting o fpooled government and donor funds (Annex 15).

The FinancialManagementSystem

The MOF/FCGO will be accountable for the financial management o fpooled government and
donor funds for the EFA program. To ensure timely production o f financial reports, the FCGO
will provide access to its FMIS to the DOE.The Financial Controller inthe DOEwill extract the
relevant information from the FMIS for the compilation o freports, which are endorsed by the
FCGO before submissionto pooling donor partners. The DOE will maintain inspreadsheets, the
accounts o fpooled donor funds identified by specific budget codes inaccordance with the
Government's cash-based accounting system. The accounting systems contain the following
features: (a) application o f consistent cash accounting principles for documenting, recording, and
reporting financial transactions; (b) well-defined chart o f accounts that enables meaningful
summarization o f financial transactions for financial reporting; (c) asset register; (d) monthly
closing and reconciliation o f accounts and statements; and (e) production o f annual financial
statements acceptable to all donors. These financial management arrangements, including key
components described below, are adequate to meet the minimum financial management
requirements for the project supporting the EFAprogram.

PlanningandBudgeting

The budgetingprocedures for preparation, approval, implementation, and monitoring are
elaborated inthe FAR. At the beginning o f the fiscal year, the NPC and MOFwill set budget
ceilings for all line ministries based on the overall development policy o fHMG/Nand
availability o f financial resources. These agencies also issue budget preparation guidelines, which
are passed on through the ministries to subordinate units. Work programs andbudgets are then
prepared by these units and consolidated for submission to the NPC and MOF.

The above process is followed by the MOES inthe preparationo f the AWPB for the EFA
program.' Pooling donors will review the AWPB and A S P at an annualmeeting inApril o f each
year. Based on the outcome ofthe review, they commit resources and agree on the share o f
pooled donor funding inthe program budget for the next fiscal year. After the budget i s approved,
the MOF releases spendingauthorization to the MOES, which will, inturn, release expenditure
authorization to DOEand thereafter to spending units. Giventhat the EFA i s a priorityprogram,
funds will bepromptly released as soon as the DOEreceives authorization from the MOES
accompanied by the AWPB. The DTCO will also receive a copy o f this documentation.

Separate and identifiable budget codes will be provided by the MOFto enable monitoring and
reporting on EFAprogram expenditures fundedthrough the pooling arrangement. Public
expenditures that arejointly financed by the Government and pooling donors will be tracked to
those associated budgetheads and sub-heads for basic andprimary education under the EFA

program. Program support from donors outside the JFA are subject to separate agreements and
monitoring arrangements.

Staffing

The Accounts Section inthe DOE is headed by the Financial Controller supported by six
accounts staff. Each staff has the responsibility for maintainingthe accounts o f specific budget
heads. Two staff will be primarilydedicated to maintain the accounts o fEFA expenditures
financed through the pooling arrangement; other staff will maintain accounts financed by donors
outside the pool. Each cost center will be staffed by at least one accountant who is responsible for
maintaining the accounts inaccordance with government procedures, and for submitting monthly
statements o f expenditures to DOEandDTCO. While it may take some time for DOEto receive
monthly expenditure statements from its cost centers, such statements are promptlytransmitted
through network connectivity between DTCOs and the FCGO. To enable the DOEto obtain and
reconcile the required accounting information more speedily, on-line access to the FCGO
databasewill be provided. The DOEwill take the lead inmonitoring expenditures at the district
level, and to train new staff.

Internal Controls

The financial accounting policies andprocedures inplace are sufficient to ensure that the EFA
program complies with minimumfinancial management requirements. These include the
establishment o f internal controls andproper accountingprocedures described inthe FAR. The
DEOs are responsible for maintainingdistrict level accounts by budgetheads. DEOs forward
monthly expenditure statements to the DOE and the respective DTCOs. The DOE also prepares a
consolidated expenditure statement for the program funded through the pooling arrangement
based on expenditure reporting byDEOs. The DOEperiodically reconciles this informationwith
information generated by the FCGO's database.

The Constitution o fNepal mandates the Auditor General to carry out performance audits in
addition to financial audits. As such, the MOES andpooling donors will rely on these audits to
assess EFAprogram impact. The DTCOs are responsible for monthly internal audits o f all district
cost centers; however, insome districts, these audits are not undertakenina timely manner due to
lack o f staffing and/or remoteness o f cost centers. Inorder to address this deficiency, a
mechanismwill be put inplace whereby DOE will recruit independent reviewers, preferably
professionally qualified audit firms, to visit districts and evaluate the work o f DEOs and
communities. The reviewers will submit an independent assessment to the DOEwith
recommendations for improvement. Assurances o f effective grant utilizationwill be obtained
through a system ofpublic disclosure o f statements o f accounts and social audits by communities
benefiting from EFA program funds. The social audit committees formed by the communities
will mandate that schools receiving grants be subject to sociab'public audit. Findings will be
reportedto the respective DEOs and carefully monitoredby DOE and technical review missions
organized bypooling donors.

FinancialReporting,MonitoringandDisbursement

MOESDOE will use the government reporting system to the extent possible to prepare and
submit the FMRs on a trimester (every four month) basis, duly certified by the FCGO, within 45
days o f the end o f each trimester, which will provide the basis for disbursement by pooling
donors each trimester into a foreign exchange account established at the Nepal Rastra Bank
(NRB).The FMRwill constitute the following reports:

  a. for each trimester and year to-date, a report on the transfers to and withdrawals from the
      foreign exchange account, with a copy o f the bank statement for the account;

  b. consolidatedfinancial report for allocations and expenditures from the FCGOfor the
      budgetheads, comparing actual andbudgeted figures bybudget line item, for the trimester
      and cumulatively for the fiscal year to-date;

  C.    output based progress report relating EFA expenditures to outputs for the first and second
      trimesters;

  d. cash forecast statement for the following two trimesters accountingfor the current balance
      inthe foreign exchange account; and

  e. update on the procurementplan.

Formats for the FMRwere discussed at Negotiations, which will be finalized by June 30, 2004.
Inaddition, semi-annual `Flash' reports onprogress relatedto keyeducation indicatorswill be
submitted inJuly and September. The following programperformance reports will also be
produced by MOESDOE on an annual basis:

  a. consolidatedoutput based progress report relating EFA sector expenditure andoutputs for
      the fiscal year (to be submittedby 15 November o fthe followingyear); and

  b. progress report on outcomes and outputs (a consolidatedflash report) for the previous year
      (to be submitted by 15 November).

On an annual basis, MOESDOE will compile and submit the un-audited annual financial
statements for the EFAbudget heads by January 15tho f the following fiscal year, comparing
actual and budgeted figures by cost center and line item. The annual financial statements for the
EFAprogram, which is fundedjointly bypooling donors andHMG/Nwill include: (a) Summary
o f Sources and Uses o f Funds; (b) uses o fFunds byprogram activity; (c) summaries o f
statements on Pooled Accounts; and (d) notes to financial statements.

                                  monitoring by pooling donors. Delayed funds flow from donors
                                  is also likely. The JFA, which explicitly states the obligation o f
                                  pooled donors for timely release o f funds, will help to enforce

FundsFlow Arrangements

Funds Flowfrom Donors to HMG/N

HMG/Nwill establish a foreign exchange account inUnitedStates Dollars withNRBto which
the pooling donors will contribute funds for the EFAprogram. The donors will provide indicative
funding levels for the program for the following fiscal year duringthe consultative meetingwith
HMG/NinDecember. Fundingcommitments, which take into account the sub-sector budget and
cash flow needs for program implementation, will be made duringthe Annual Review meeting in
April. The Signatories o fthe JFA will, inlighto fthese commitments, determine the donor share
inprogramfundingfor the comingfiscal year. Thepooling donors will advance into the foreign
exchange account, their share o f the estimated expenditure for the first two trimesters. For each
trimester disbursement thereafter, donors will replenish the Foreign Exchange (FE) Account
based on FMRs, which indicate the amount o f funds utilized duringthe trimester, the cash
balance position o f the FEAccount, and the cash forecast for the subsequent two trimesters. In
the event o fthe cash balance position exceeding funds needed for the next two trimesters, the FE
Account will not be replenished. At the end o f each fiscal year, HMG/Nwill carry out a
reconciliation o f the funds deposited into and withdrawn from the FE Account.

The MOF/FCGO is responsible for certifying the relevant financial reports and submittingthe
request for disbursement inwriting to the Contact Point for the Pooling Donors Working Group
(PDWG). The Contact Point, inconsultationwith PDWG, will have 10 days upon receipt o fthe
request, to review the attached reports and clarify any outstanding issues, including validity o f
cash forecasts for the following two trimesters with the MOFLFCGO andMOESDOE.

Funds from the FEAccount willbetransferred to HMG/N's consolidatedfund following the
certification o f actual expenditures. There will be no direct payment from the FEAccount for
expenditures on imported goods and services. Foreign exchange currency payments requested by
the MOESDOE will be promptly facilitated by HMG/Nas per government regulations.

Funds Flow at the CentralLevel from MOF to DTCOs and to DEOs)

Untilthework program andbudget isapproved, all cost centers includingthe DEOs, will receive
an initial advance through the respective DTCOs, o f one-third o fthe previous year's expenditures
or projected expenditures for the first trimester, whichever is greater. MOF arranges for the
release o fthese funds through its consolidated fund. Following approval ofthe work program and
budget, an adjustment will bemade against advances to cost centers. Ifadvances are less thanthe
approved trimester budget, cost centers will receive an additional amount. As expenditures are
incurred, cost centers may request the respective DTCOs for reimbursementbased on monthly
expenditure statements. Since the EFA program i s a priority (Pl) program, fund release inthe
first trimester i s based on expenditure statements. The second and third trimester releases are
contingent upon performance, and submission o fphysical progress reports, as requiredby
Schedule 2 o f the FAR. Ifperformance achieved i s at least 80 percent o f the target, funds are
released automatically to the cost center. For performance between 50 to 80 percent o f the target,
fundrelease is only made after the DTCO obtains authorization from FCGO andthe line ministry
secretary. The third trimester budget will not be released ifperformance is less than 50 percent.

Expenditures incurredby cost centers are consolidated by the FCGO. The consolidatedreport,
together with a request for reimbursement, are submitted to the Contact Point o f the PDWG.
Funds are transferred from the FEAccount to HMG/"s                                      consolidated fund only when the Contact
Point provides a confirmation inwriting within 10days o f receipt o f the reimbursement request.

Funds Flow at the District Level from DTCOs to DEOs and other cost centers)

The MOES sends an authorization to the DOE, which i s thereafter passed on to DEOs and other
cost centers to permit them to obtain funds from the respective DTCOs. The DTCOs will get an
authorization from the FCGO to disburse funds to DEOs and other cost centers when these units
appear with a similar authorization from their line ministry. Fundswill be provided by the DEOs
to schools inthe form o fblock grants. Procurement o f consultancyservices and goods may be
carried out directly by the DOE andother cost centers at the central level.

Funds Flow at the Community Level from DEOs to Schools)

The DEOsrelease block grants to schools on a trimester basis. Once disbursed, the block grants
are considered as expenditures incurred. Two types o fblock grants under basic, level 1andlevel
2 grants are released: (a) earmarked grants, which are intended for specific purpose such as
school construction; and (b) non-earmarked grants, which can be spent by schools for any
purpose as decidedby the school management committees. Earmarkedblock grants provided for
school construction are released intranches based on specific outputs to ensure that the final
release is made only after the completion of the works. Schools are required to maintain a book o f
accounts, which has to be audited annually by registered auditors. Schools are also requiredto
submit progress reports to DEOs on a trimester basis. These trimester reports are consolidated by
the DEOs and the consolidateddistrict reports are sent to the MOES.

Social audits will be the primary vehicle to ensure accountability inthe use o fblock grants by
schools. These audits will be undertaken by a committee comprising three to five members
formed by the Parent Teacher Association (PTA). Schools also requiredto report to the DEOson
physical progress (i.e., outputs) and intermediate outcome indicators through `Flash' reports
twice a year.

ExternalAudit

The EFA program will be audited bythe Auditor General o f the Kingdom o fNepal (AG/N) as
requiredby the country's Constitution. HMGNand poolingdonors will agree on the scope o f the
audit, which will be proposedthereafter to the AG/N for consideration. Audit reports are due
withinsix months ofthe endo feach fiscal year. However, since submissiono fthe audit report
within six months is unlikely due to the wide geographic spread andremoteness o fmanycost
centers, IDAwill provide a 90 days' grace period for the submission o f overdue audit reports.
The audit report will be submitted with detailed observations. The Audit will also include the
audit o fthe FE Account to ensure that hnds from this account are transferred only for the
intendedpurpose ofthe EFAprogram. The signatories may request performance-related audits to
be undertaken from time to time by the AG/N, or at his discretion, by other appropriate auditors.

For statutory audit purposes, the grantsreleased to communities will be considered as
expenditures and accounts will be maintained as incurred expenditures, and audit thereofwill be
based on total grants released.

Schools will be required to submit social audit reports or publicly disclosed statements o f
expenditures once a year. The extemal auditor willjudge whether grants have been utilized
effectively or not through these reports, and random visits to selected schools. Ifall reports from
DEOs and schools are maintainedcentrally at the DOE, the extemal auditor can complete the
audit based on available documentation at the center. However, it may not be practical to bringall
these records to the center. Inthe case o f records beingkept at the district level, verification and
confirmation o f reports will be done through visits by the extemal auditor to a random sample o f
districts.

Fiduciary Role and Supervision

Program implementation progress will be continuously monitoredby the pooling donors through
the PDWG.The Contact Point for the PDWGwill coordinate several important tasks associated
with financial supervision o fthe EFAprogram. These tasks include: (a) FMRreview and
approval o f eligible expenditures; (b) ex-post reviews at cost centers to identifyand report on any
ineligible expenditures andrecommend remedial action; (c) review o f audit reports and
preparation o f a summary o f audit findings for discussion with pooling donors; (d) periodicjoint
supervision to keep pooling donors informed o f emerging issues or improvements needed on
financial management; and (e) monitoring o f the financial management actionplanto ensure that
adequate progress is beingmade.

Retroactive Financing

Inorderto expedite EFAProgramimplementation, there is aneed for retroactivefinancingby
IDA.The Association will reimbursefrom the proceeds o fthe IDACredit, payments made for
eligible expenditures prior to the Credit effectiveness date, but after July 15,2004, inan
aggregate amount not to exceed the equivalent o f SDR 2.0 million. Inorder to be eligible for
retroactive financing, procedures for procurement, processing and clearance, are subject to the
Association's Procurement and Consultants Guidelines with respect to ICB. Inaddition,
documentationrequirements for expenditures claimed under retroactive financing are the same as

             Manual.

         Since schools receiving classroom construction grants do not have the capacity to
         undertakeprocuremento ffabricated steelworks, theywill have to route their requirements
         for suchmaterials to the concerned DEO. Inthe case o f districts where decentralized

         procure pre-determinedquantities o f such materials, which will be made available to the
         requesting schools. Inthe case ofnon-pilot districts, the steelworks will be procured
         centrally by the DOE and supplied to requesting schools through a network o f storage

Sector Wide Approach

IDAcredit proceeds will support Nepal's EFAprogramunder a sector wide approach subscribed
to by all donors to the basic andprimaryeducation sub-sector. Inaccordance with ajoint
financing arrangement, IDAwill be pooling funds with four partner donors (Denmark, Finland,
Norway and DfIDAJK)and H i s Majesty's Government o fNepal (HMG/N) to support the
program, which covers all activities inthe basic and primary education sub-sector. Since the EFA
program i s underpinnedby a national strategy and its implementation will be ledby HMG/N, the
basic premise i s to allow government procedures to be followed inall procurement-related areas
o f the program, provided these are satisfactory to all pooling partner donors.

ProcurementArrangements

Although the DOEunder the MOESwill be the nodal agency, under the proposedimplementation
arrangements, procurement will be carried out at three levels:

(i)DOElevel

       There are no civil works contracts to be implementedthrough the DOE. Instead, the DOE
       will be responsible for the procurementof:

          (a) fabricated steel structures and corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) roofingmaterials
          required inthe construction o f modular two-classroom school blocks o f standardized
          designs, estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent per contract; and (b)
          vehicles estimated to cost more than US$200,000 per contract. These items shall be
          procured through ICB inaccordance with World Bank procedures' andusingthe Bank's
          Standard BidDocuments (SBD) for Goods. Contracts for fabricated steel structures and
          CGI roofing materials estimated to cost below US$500,000 and contracts for vehicles
          estimated to cost below US$200,000 may be procured through National Competitive
          Bidding(NCB) usinglocalprocedures;

          (a) consultants for baseline and other studies, technical reviews, and monitoring through
          Quality and Cost Based or Consultant Qualification or Single Source methods depending
          on the nature o f the assignment and availability o f capable firms; and (b) NGO services
          for information campaigns, and the services o f specialized training agencies such as the
          Nepal Administrative Staff College (NASC) through single source or Consultant's
          Qualifications (CQ). All suchprocurement shall be done using procedures and
          documents specified inthe EFA ProcurementManual, which i s prepared based on the
          provisions inthe FARo f HMG/N; and

        accordance with the simplified procedures, forms/documents contained inthe EFA
        Procurement Manual. SMCs may use community participation for labor and occasionally
        provide local construction materials.

NationalProcurementEnvironment

Public procurement i s governed by the FAR, 1999. However, inkeeping with the Government's
commitment to procurement reform, a second amendment to the FARwas introduced in2003,
bringingprocurementprocedures closer to international (UNCITRAL) andBank procedures.
Some significant variations vis-A-vis World Bank procedures still remain inthe FAR.These are
described inthe Country Procurement Assessment Report and summarized as follows:

   i.bidopeningatonlyoneplaceandimmediatelyafterdeadlineforbidsubmissionisnot
        mandatorybut provided as an option only (FAR clause 66-6);

    ii.biddersforaworkscontractinvitedthroughIntemationalCompetitiveBidding(ICB)
        mustwork inajoint venture with aNepali construction company or a firmworking in
        Nepal (FAR clause 73-2-k-1);

    iii.institutionswheretheGovernmenthas50%ormorecapitalareexemptfromfbmishing
        bidandperformancesecurities (FAR clause 86);

    iv. preference for localbidders competing with foreign bidders inNCB (FAR clause 58 (3));
        and

    v. bidders' qualification criteria are not inaccordance with the World Bank's standard
        procedures.

Reform Agenda: HMGiNis currently implementing a ProcurementReformProject usingthe
proceeds o f a World BankIDFGrant. The objectives o f this project are to:

    a) prepare a draft Public Procurement Law for Nepal based on UNCITRAL procedures by
        July 2004; and

    b) develop the procurement capacity o fEFA implementationpersonnel through provisionby
        the NASC, o fregular courses on public procurement for selected government
        procurement staff, including accountants and staff o f the AGiN.

With the enactment o fthe Public Procurement Law (expected to happenbyDecember 2004), the
country's public procurement procedures will be inline with internationalpractices and would
thusbeunconditionally acceptable to IDAand other donors. Untilthis happens, procurement for
the EFAprogram not subject to ICB will be conducted as per localprocedures with the exception
o fthe five variations listed above, which shall be inaccordance with World Bank procedures.

ProcurementCapacity andRemedies for Enhancement

In DOE and DEO:

Duringregular supervisiono fthe ongoingBPEP, andinthe course o fpreparingthe proposed
Project, an assessment was made o f the capacity o f the key agencies -the DOE and DEOs-to
undertake procurement under the EFAprogram. Since procurement under BPEP was conducted
as per World Bank procedures, DOE procurement staff are familiar with these procedures as well
as those under the FAR.There is therefore, adequate capacity at this level.

At the DE0 level, although mostprocurement staffdo not have experience inWorld Bank
procurement procedures, they do have adequate knowledge o f government procedures, which will
be needed for district levelprocurement under the EFAprogram. To ensure that procurement
capacity i s not adversely affected by staff transfers, several actions to institutionalize such
capacity is recommended. These include:

i.preparationofanEFAProcurementManual2,basedonproceduresandprovisionsdetailedin
    the FAR and the Government's Public Works Directives, for use by designated procurement
    staff at the DOE andDEOs; and

ii.provisionofshorttrainingcoursestoselectedDOEandDE0staffintheuseofFAR
    procurement procedures. It is expected that this training would be conducted by the NASC
    where the Procurement Training Cell i s expected to be inplace by end-2004.

Itis notedthat the standard biddocument for Goods andWorks, whichwill bepart o fthe EFA
Procurement Manual, will incorporate amendments to reflect the five exceptions listed inthe
section on National Procurement Environment. Inrespect o f consultant selection, since FAR
provisions are not as explicit about procedures for consultant selection as they are for goods or
works procurement, the forms and documents inthe Procurement Manual will be developed by
the DOE inconsultation with the World Bank.

In Schools:

Though a similar assessment has not been done for schools, almost none o f them have personnel
with adequate knowledge or experience o fFARprocurement procedures. The SMCs, comprising
representatives o fteachers, parents and the community, will not have the capacity for carrying
out procurement at the school level. Therefore, to enable the SMC to undertake the responsibility
for procuring goods and services using school block grant funds, capacity buildingmeasures will
be necessary at the beginning o f the EFAprogram, and before any procurement i s initiated. These
include:




 The EFAProcurement Manual will contain instructions on how to choose the most appropriate method(e.g.
shopping, competitive bidding) for each type o fprocurement, and will provide details on the corresponding
procedures (e.g., notifications, short-listing and bidding, bidevaluation etc.) and standard formats (e.g. for
quotations, standard bid documents, request for proposal documents etc.), as well as step-by-step instructions on how
these formats are to be tailored for each procurement need.

ExpenditureCategories

Underthe EFAprogram, fimd allocations will depend on the progress achieved on the agreed
results indicators and targets, performance o f schools, and the need to amend annual work
programs to improve achievement o f results. Therefore, it is not possible to determine ex-ante,
the total value o fworks, goods and services to be procured duringthe life of the program.
However, based on the current description o f components andrelated activities, a tentative
estimate o f expenditure categories i s given inthe table below. It is understoodthat this
distribution i s indicative, andcould vary greatly from year to year.

ReviewMechanisms

DOE and DE0 level procurement:

All ICB, contracts for Goods estimated to cost the equivalent o fUS$500,000 or more, vehicles
estimated to cost the equivalent o fUS$200,000 or more, contracts with consultant firms
estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or more, and contracts with individuals costing the
equivalent o f US$20,000 or more, shall be subject to the Bank's prior review. All other
procurement, conducted inaccordance with agreed local procedures shall be subject to ex-post
review by consultants engaged by the World Bank3.This will be inaddition to the Government's
regular internal audit and audit by the AG/N.

Schoolprocurement:

Besides social audits and review by the Government's regular intemal audit and audit by AG/N
teams, local consultants engaged by the World Bank will periodically conduct a sample review o f
school level procurement indifferent districts. All the eligible schools receivingblock
grants/funds under the EFAprogram shall be requiredto maintain records and documentation
pertaining to procurement. When requested, these records shall be made available to community
representatives concerned with SMC oversight, the DEO, and World Bank consultants.

Misprocurement

The goods, works and services that have not beenprocured inaccordance with the procedures
stated inthe EFA ProcurementManual shall be treated as misprocurement. The expenditures
incurred on such procurement shall not be eligible for financing from EFA funds.

ProcurementPlan

The DOE has prepared a procurement plan for the first 18 months, which provides details on
procurement activities, the procedures to be followed (e.g. NCB, QCBS), estimated values and
review requirements and includes all itemsto be procured under ICB.

Approximately 20 percent o f children remain out o f school, with girls, disadvantaged castes and
indigenous ethnic groups disproportionately represented. Completion rates, while improved,
remain low, reducing system efficiency. The quality o fpublic educationi s poor, as signaled by
parental flight to private schools, which achieve 73 percent pass rates on the School Leaving
Certificate exams compared to 22 percent for public schools. Less thanhalfthe students complete
the primary cycle while only one out o ften reach grade 10. Furthermore, there are large
differences ingross enrolment rates across geographic/ecological areas and income levels, The
rates inprimaryschooling range between 64 percent inthe Eastern Terai to 104percent inthe
Eastern hills/mountains, and from 68 percent for the poorest quarter o f all households to 118
percent for the wealthiest quarter. Most o f the 30 percent or so o fchildren not enrolled inprimary
school are members o f socially disadvantaged groups and a majority are girls.

These symptoms can be traced to the lack o f effective governance. The system lacked a holistic
vision and strategies for developing accountable institutions and for developing an effective base
o f administrators and teachers who are critical inensuringthe efficient and equitable delivery o f a
quality education. Furthermore the role communities play inschool management has been eroded
- while school management committees played an effective role prior to the introductiono f the

National Education System Plan in 1971 when all schools were brought under the control o f the
Government, they are usually not formed democratically and do not always represent the most
immediate stakeholders. Only recently has this trend beenreversed with the government moving
back towards givingcontrol o f schools to communities.

The poor quality o f education arises out o fconstraints which canbe classified into three types:

    Demand side factors that prevent children from going to school or from benefitingfrom the
    educational services provided bythe school. For example, poverty, direct costs o f schooling,
    opportunity costs, the special needs o f some children, cultural constraints and prejudices.
    Supply-side factors that limit their capacity to provide adequate quality education
    opportunities for children livinginthe area. For example, schools not beingaccessible -a
    major issue currently under the insurgency, inadequate facilities, untrained and poorlytrained
    teachers often with inadequate knowledge, lack o f teaching and learning resources, teacher
    inertia and absenteeism. A related supply-side issue is the fact that teachers lack adequate
    incentives to perform well and have limitedavenues for career growth.
    Institutional policies and administrative arrangements that can keep children from attending
    school or performing at an acceptable level or limit the school and classroom's capacity to
    provide an effective education. For example, weak organizational capacity, the high level o f
    centralizedmanagement, staffing policies that create inefficiency, inadequate funding
    arrangements, and the inability to make the most effective use o f available funds.

Primary-level educationis universally regarded as a public good, with significant externalities.
Enhanced primary educationi s strongly correlated with economic development andwith
increased productivity. Without EFAprogram, the majority o fthe labor force will continue to
lack the foundation o f a good-quality basic education, will remain unskilled, leading to low levels
o fproductivity. The program, through providing better quality primary school education to
children, will put them on the roadtowards better employment and income-earningpossibilities.
The main economic arguments for a proactive role for the Government and the Bank inthis
sector are as follows:

    Returns. There are highprivate andsocial returns to investing inprimaryeducation - cost-
    benefit analysis studies o f primaryschool education show very highrates o freturn.
    Furthermore, enhanced primaryeducation is strongly correlatedwith economic development
    and with increasedproductivity. Without a high-quality primary education system, the
    majority o f the labor force will continue to lack basic skills that will be crucial to increasing
    efficiency andproductivity inthe labor market. The EFA program aims to provide an a better
    quality primary school educationto the children o fNepal, will be to put them on the road
    towards better employment and income-earningpossibilities.
    Equity.The government has an importantrole to play inensuringthat access to education -
    especially education o fhighquality - is equitable. EFA interventions, such as the
    stipendscholarship programs, and community grants are aimed at achieving this objective.
    Relationship with higher levels of education. Unsatisfactoryperfonnance o fthe primary
    education system has a ripple effect as it contributes to a significant loss insystemic
    efficiency. The outputs o f a poor quality primaryeducation system proceed to the secondary
    level andhigher levels and are unable to perform well and this ultimately leads to a loss in

    primary education system.
    Information. Currently, systematic monitoring and evaluation o f the primary education
    system does not take place. The government has a crucial role to play inthe collection,
    analysis and disseminationo f information on the quality and effectiveness o f education
    provided indifferent institutions, and on analyzing how efficiently public and private funds
    flow through the administrative and budgetary system and ultimately reach teachers and
    schools; and determining how those resources are combined with other inputs at the school
    level to generate education outcomes. Byputtinginplace effective monitoring and evaluation
    mechanisms, EFA will aim to ensure that such information is readily available and can feed
    back into policy.

Cost Benefit Analysis

Project cost-benefit analysis has produced an approximate internal rate o freturn (IRR) o f about
16.1 percent for the project investment usinga discount rate o f 12percent. The proxy for project
benefits is increased earning ofprimary school graduates resulting from quality enhancements.

Benefits Stream: The program design focuses on quality improvements that will establish the
necessary foundation for a more efficient and effective primary education system. The investment
will promote quality improvements ineducation, beneficiaries o fwhich will be the incremental
students entering the education system as well as those who are already inthe primary education
stream. The proxy for capturing the benefits arising from quality improvements are estimated to
be increased earnings inthe labor market at around 8 percent.

Economic benefits are estimated inaccordance with the following assumptions:

    Population growth rate is based on World Bank projections: 2.2% (2000-05); 0.8% (2006-
    2010); 0.5% (2011-2020), -0.8% (2021-2030);
    Improved access to primary education is achieved for educationally disadvantaged children,
    especially children o fminority groups, through enhanced school facilities and resources and
    improved classroom resources and teaching;
    The defined GER target for primary schooling o f 105 percent i s achieved by 2008/9 (and 100
    percent by 2015);
    The defined NERtarget for primaryschooling o f 96 percent is achieved by 2008/9 and 100
    percent by 2015;
    Repetition rates are reduced to 10percent by 2008/9;
    Dropout rates are reduced to 5 percent by 2008/9;
    The benefits are estimated for completion o f the primarycycle only. No allowance is made
    for the fact that the improvements inprimary educationwill allow more children to attend
    secondary school and thereby have access to even greater earning power; and
    Incrementalearnings benefits are calculated on the basis o f increased earningwith each
    additional year o fprimaryschooling.




                                                62

Cost Stream: The estimated direct costs o fthe project comprise the project investment, the public
and private cost o f each additional pupil-year, and the opportunity cost o f retaining each student
inschool for an additional year. Public costs are estimated to beequal to government expenditure
perpupilattendingpublic primary schools, that is approximately $20/year, andprivate costs are
those incurred by the families o f each pupil on school fees, books and school supplies,
transportation, etc., estimated at $10/year. The opportunity cost o fretaining each student in
school for an additional year is estimated equal to the wage for an unskilled worker with no
school certificates completed.

Using these assumptions, the project yields an Internal Economic Rate o f Return (EIRR) o f 16.1
percent (Table 2). Net present value has been calculated based on a discount rate o f 12percent.

                           Table 2: EconomicInternalRatesof Return

                                                  Net Present Value
                            Present Value         US$234.9 million
                            IRR                    16.15 percent



It should be borne inmindthat the real rate o freturnis likely to be somewhat higher reflecting
positive externalities and longer-term intergenerationalsocial benefits that come with increased
levels o f education, including lower fertility rates and improved health outcomes to which it is
difficult to assign monetary values.

SensitivityAnalysis

Rates o f retumare also computed on the basis o f alternative assumptions regardingthe intemal
and external efficiency o fthe system. For the purpose o fthis analysis: (a) dropout andrepetition
rates are utilized as proxies and changes inintemal efficiency are assumed to be captured by
changes indropout and repetition rates (and hence completion rates); and (b) potential wage
growth rate is utilized as proxy for changes inextemal efficiency. While these distinctions are
somewhat artificial, they provide us with some interesting information about the changes inrates
o freturns based on different assumptions regarding the system efficiency.

Table 3 highlights the rates o f returns under different assumptions. The "low" case for the
intemal efficiency i s based on dropouts and repetitions risingby 50 percent as compared to the
base case, while the "high" case is based on dropouts and repetitions falling by 50 percent as
compared to the base case. With regards to the extemal efficiency-the "low" case i s based on a
wage growth o f only 50 percent as comparedto the base case, while the "high" case i s based on a
wage growth o f 50 percent more as compared to the base case. These rates are highlysensitive to
changes inassumptions regardingthe extemal efficiency o f the system - controlling for changes
ininternal efficiency, a 50percent change inwage growthroughly corresponds to a 50percent
change inthe rates o fretum.

Trends in Education Spending

Table 4 presents data on educational expenditures inNepal over the past four years. As the table
shows, i t i s difficult to point to any trends regarding overall expenditures inthe education sector
(inrealterms). Expendituresoneducation hasdroppedsignificantly since 2001/2 (which may
have been an aberration). Consequently, expenditures as a proportion o f GDP and government
expenditures have also dropped. Primary education trends are clearer. Expenditures have
systematically increased over the four years -reflecting the commitment o fHMG/Ntowards
moving forward to meeting the EFA goals. Primary education expenditures now account for close
to two percent o f GDP and around nine percent of government expenditures.

                            Table 4: Education Expenditures 2000/01-2003/4

                                                  2000/01      2001/02       2002/03     2003/04

However primary education seems to be crowding out expenditures insecondary andtertiary
education -while primary education expenditures accounted for 45 percent o ftotal education
expenditures in2001/2, these expenditures are expected to account for over 70 percent o f such
expenditures in2003/04.

Financing E F A 2004-09: MOES Proposal and Potential Donor Funding

The MOES EFA 2004-09 lays out the financing plan for basic education for 2004-09. Two
scenarios are given - a highcase scenario and a low case scenario (Table 5). Recurrent
expenditures are identical under both scenarios and are fully funded by the government. Under
the highcase scenario, HMG/Nwill finance 16 percent o f developmental expenditures while
under the low case scenario HMG/Nfinances 18 percent o f developmental expenditures (the
absolute value o f HMG/"s        contribution is identical under both scenarios).

Financingfor the Education Sector 2004-2009: Projections

Inthis section, projections o fthe likely expenditures for primary educationover the planperiod
have been made usingseveral assumptions regarding growth o f GDP, government expenditures,
allocation o f government expenditures to education, and the share ofprimary education within
the education allocation. The aim is to examine whether the proposals made by MOES -
described above - are financially sustainable within HMG/N's overall budget envelope.

The EFA core document states that HMG/Nhas a policy to allocate 15 percent o f its total
expenditure to the education sector with 55 percent ofthis being allocatedto the basic and
primary sub-sector. It also states that by 2009, 3.7 percent o f GDP will be allocatedto education.
There is an inconsistency inthat ifHMG/Nallocates 3.7 percent of GDP to education -this may
not be equivalent to spending 15 percent o f total government expenditure on education.2 Hence              -
two sets o f scenarios are constructed.




 Infact, onaverage (between2000 and2004) the government is spendingabout 15.35 percentofgovernment
expenditures on education. However, as a proportionof GDP -only about 3.1 percent are beingspent on education.

                                                      65

Scenario I: HMG/Nwill continue to spend 15percent of government expenditures on education

Three cases are considered here based on projections regarding macro-growth rates. The first case
utilizes conservative assumptions to assess the consistency o f the EFA planwith the
macroeconomic framework. GDP projections and growth rate are based on IMFprojections. GDP
growth rate is assumed to be constant at 3.5 percent from 2004-09. The second case uses the
MTEFbase GDP growth rate o f4.5 percent throughout the period andthe final caseusesthe
MTEFhighgrowth scenario o f6.2 percent per annum. Inall three cases, total government budget
as a percentage o f GDP is based on an average o fthis ratio over the previous four years -20
percent - and i s assumed to remain constant over time. The proportion o f education sector budget
to government expenditures is assumed to remain at 15 percent and it is assumed that 55 percent
o f the education budget is allocated to primary education (as opposed to the 70 percent).

Scenario 11: HMG/Nwill gradually increase education expenditures to 3.7% of GDP by 2008/9.

This scenario i s identical to scenario I, that the assumption is that education expenditures
                                               except
rise gradually to 3.7 percent o f GDP by 2008/9 from the current 3.1 percent.

Table 7 presents total projectedbudget for 2004-9 for primary educationunder these alternative
scenarios, and compares these projected expenditures to MOES highcase and low case proposals
presented inTable 5. As seenbelow, under either o f the scenarios, the projected budget available
for education will fall below the proposed MOES expenditures.

Plannedprimaryeducation expenditures can fall within the overall budget envelope under a
variety o f scenarios. To demonstrate a few, we have undertaken another set o f simulations (Table


 This is consistent with the indicative donor commitments of around $150million.

                                                       66

8). For these simulations, we have assumed that the base case option interms o f economic growth
(4.5 percent annual growth rate o fGDP).

    Simulation A: Assume that proportion o f government expenditures to education remain at 15
    percent. Then, for plannedprimary education expenditures to fall within the budget envelope,
    expenditures on primaryeducation must reach around 65-71percent o f the total education
    budget.This implies primary education may crowd out expenditures on secondary andtertiary
    education.
    Simulation B: Assume that proportion o f education expenditures going to primary remain
    fixed at 55 percent. Then, for plannedprimary education expenditures to fall within the
    budget envelope, the proportion o f government expenditures going to the education sector as
    a whole must rise to around 18-19.5 percent (this i s equivalent to stating that the government
    commits to spending about 3.75 percent o f GDP on educationbeginning 2004/5). This
    implies that the government needs to commit to raising education expenditures relative to
    expenditures inother sectors.
    Simulation C:A similar result can be achieved through a combination o fthe above two
    scenarios - the government decides to raise the proportion o f education expenditures going to

Sustainability Beyond Planned Period

Inorder to assess longrunsustainability, aroughassessmentofthe costs ofachievingthe goal of
100% NERby 2015 was undertaken. MOES projections o fthe school-age population and an
assumed GER o f 104%were used to estimate school enrolments to 2015. Unit costs per pupil
were applied to this total inorder to arrive at a rough estimate o f EFA costs to 2015. Some points
to note about this procedure:

       Unitcosts were derivedbydividingtotal EFAcosts bytheprimary school enrolments,
        although some o f these costs relate to expenditures not related to primary education. This
        approximationis valid ifthe percentage o fnon-primary expenditure remains broadly
        constant from 2008/9. This i s a pessimistic assumption, since improved primary education
        should gradually begin to reduce the needfor non-formal provision.
        Estimated unitcosts in2008/9 were projected forward on the assumption o f 2% per
        annum real increase. This implicitly assumes continuation o f capital expenditure at the
        rates planned for inthe EFAprogram. This is a pessimistic assumption ifit is assumed
        that classroom shortage will be largely addressed by 2009. The 2% per annum increase
        allows for some growth inteacher salaries and some continued improvement innon-salary
        costs.
        Enrolments increase sharply from 2012 as the extension o fthe primary cycle to 13 years
        i s phased inover 2012-2014. The cost o f adding these enrolments inEFA spending has
        been included inthis calculation.
        A 6% growth innon-EFA education costs is assumedthroughout, but secondary
        education costs have been adjusted by assuming that there are offsetting savings to the
        secondary education budget, equivalent to one sixth o f secondary spending for each year
        that is added to the primary cycle.

                                Table 9: LongTerm Sustainability




                                                   68

IfGDP growthof6.2% p.a. isachieved, andignoringfor themomentthe cost ofextendingthe
primary cycle, the costs can be sustained with Government expenditure on education o f about 3%
o f GDP, with the EFA share declining slowly. Ifgrowth achieves 4.5% per annum, the
improvements initiated under EFA can be sustained with spending o f 3.3% o f GDP, marginally
above the share budgeted in2003/04. With growth of only 3.5% per annum, the share o f GDP
required to sustain the program continues at about 3.5% of GDP.' Ifnon-EFA spending has to
increase fast enough to reduce the EFA share to 55%, the share of education spending will need
to be around 3.4%-3.7% o f GDP (depending on the projected rates o f GDP growth), requiring 17-
18% o f Government spending.

Inconclusion, sustainabilitybeyondthe programperiod appearsto befinancially feasible onmost
plausible growth scenarios. Using the base case scenario o f GDP growth (4.5% per annum), our
analysis shows that for the program to be sustainable, HMGNwill need to maintain education
spendingat around 3.5% o f GDP. Inthis scenario, to maintainEFA spending at 55% o foverall
education expenditures, close to 18% o f government expenditures need to be spent on education.




  Inallcases, the additionofthe extra yearshas significant cost implications, requiring Governmentto allocate 3.9%
ofGDP inthe moderate growthcase. The 6-13 compulsory cycle will require 74% ofthe total education budget in
201312014. With low GDP growth, achieving the EFA targets for universal enrolment ofthe 6-13 age group would
imply a rising share o f GDP and government expenditure, and the addition of the extra years would be difficult to
finance, requiring 4.3% o f GDP and over 20% o f Government spending by 2015.

EnvironmentalAssessment

Backnound. The DOEwill be implementing the EFAprogram covering all 75 districts o f the
country, supported by the IDA and other donors. This program intends to consolidate the
achievements made inthe earlier and ongoing primary educationprojects supported by a number
o f donors including IDA. The EFA goals are to improve access and equity; to enhance quality
and relevance; and to improve efficiency and institutional capacity. The EFAprogram aims to
ensure that all children, particularly girls, children indifficult circumstances and those belonging
to dalits, disadvantaged janajati and other disadvantaged groups, have access to and complete
primary education o f good quality.

A specific objective o fEFAwill beto increase the net enrolment ratio from 81% in2001 to 96%
in2009. Enrolment opportunitieswillbeimprovedthrough construction and furnishingof8,000
new classrooms, rehabilitation o f 6,000 classrooms, improving site services in5,000 schools with
special focus on toilets for girls and safe drinkingwater. The EFAprogram will meet the
classroom requirements o f all schools so that no child is denied access to school. Schools that
have not qualified for new permanent classrooms but have highdemand for access will be
providedwith temporary classrooms. Duringthe program period, about 1,000 temporary
classrooms, which are low-cost, safe, well lit, and well ventilated structures will be built using
local materials.

Civil works and improvement o fphysical facilities will be undertaken by the schools on a cost-
sharing basis between the Government and communities. The DE0will assist insite supervision
to assure quality. Inaddition to school works, the program will also finance construction o f 23
district education offices and 250 Resource Centers, which are components o fthe overall
infrastructure for service delivery.

Environmental Issues. N o large scale, significant and/or irreversible impact i s anticipated. An
environmental review by HMG/Nhas identified several small-scale and local environmental
issues potentially associated with the program activities. These issues relate to school site
selection andplanning (natural hazards; sensitive ecological regions; arsenic and fluoride
contamination inthe drinkingwater supplied inthe schools; site drainage); buildingdesign and
construction (indoor air quality and daylight factor inside the classrooms, sanitationfacilities and
waste management, water supply); and maintenance duringthe operationperiod (site cleanliness
andhygiene, prevention o f enteric infections). N o long-term impact is anticipated, except that
supply o fpotable water inthe schools couldbe an issue infuture, giventhe deteriorating trend o f
water quality inthe country, as a whole.

Environmental Assessment. The DOE has undertaken an EA for the program. The EA was based
on a series o f reviews o f construction works undertakeninthe ongoing BPEP, field visits and
consultations with stakeholders with respect to practices related to school physical facility
improvement, and operation andmaintenance o f facilities. The findings o f this review were used
to prepare the National Environmental Guidelines for siting and construction o fnew schools,
improvement o f physical facilities inschools, as well as additions or rehabilitations o f classrooms


                                                    70

inthe existing schools. Inparallel, the DOEhas completed anassessment o fthe implications of
arsenic ingroundwater supply, especially inthe schools located inthe terui area, and testing and
mitigation requirements under the project. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been
prepared, which lists the environmental mitigation and management measures, and assigns
responsibilities for implementation.

The EFAprogram, as a whole, does not require any environmental clearance. Normally, school
sites would be located inareas already approved for suchpurposes. Duringprogram
implementation, there mightbe a few schools that are proposed to be located in forest or other
protected areas. Ifsuch cases arise, site-specific clearance will be obtained, and all requisite
HMG/Nconditions will be fulfilled.

Analyses o f Alternatives. At the program level, there i s no alternative. However, at the level o f
individual school buildings, alternatives will be available interms o f selection o f individual
classroom buildingsites, buildingmaterials, buildingdesign andtechnology, and water and
sanitation facilities. These alternatives have beenreviewed; the choice o f alternatives and the
process of selecting the optimal alternative from an environmental management perspective are
included inthe Nepal National Environmental Guidelines for School Improvement andFacility
Management (NEGSIF).

Community Consultations. Community consultation i s an integralpart o f the overall program.
The local communities and institutions are involved inthe identification, planning, design,
implementation, operation and maintenance o f the schools as well as all other program activities.
Consultations with schoolteachers, experts, NGOs and other stakeholders will continue
throughout the implementationperiod.

Duringthe review o fcurrent school construction activities, (which was apart ofthe EA),
consultations were held with schoolteachers, Community Based Organizations (CBOs)/NGOs
and local communities. The consultations were inthe form o f school and community meetings.
Consultations were held with educationists, engineers, architects, planners, and DOE Officers on
different aspects o f school facilities andmanagement. Students and parents were interviewed.
The draft National Environmental Guidelines (NEGSIF) were discussed with selected experts and
the DOE, and the comments have been incorporatedinthe final document.

HMG/Nhas disclosed the NEGSIFandrelateddocuments on their website, andwill also place
the reports inpublic places for wider disseminationproject documents.

MitigationPlans. The DOEhas set a goal o f creating a safe and healthier learning environment
 for children. Improving the physical facilities inschools is key to achieving this goal and
therefore an important component o fthe EFAprogram. To ensure that the program will not have
 adverse impacts on public health, the surrounding environment and communities, the NEGSIF
will be strictly adhered to inmanaging environmental issues inthe planning,construction and
 operation o f schools inthe varied geographical and climatic conditions ofNepal.

 Guidelines: The NEGSIF,which form essential parts o fthe EnvironmentalManagement Plan
 (EMP), include the following:



                                                  71

    guidelines for site selection andplanning o f school buildings: these include criteria to avoid
    locating schools inhighlyvulnerable sites (steep slopes, vulnerable river banks, sites
    inundatedby floods or prone to water logging), and ensure selection o f safe slopes inhilly
    areas as well as proper drainage at ando f f the site;
0   guidelines for design o f school buildings: these relate to ensuring adequate day lightingand
    windows, ventilations within the classrooms, use o f solar or other renewable energy systems,
    analyses related to alternative construction materials and buildingtechnology; and
0   guidelines for provision o f sanitation and sewage disposal facilities, solid waste management,
    landscape development, and rainwater harvesting.

The EMP describes how the provisions o fthe NEGSIFwill be implemented, monitored and
evaluated. All schools will prepare complete infrastructure plans, which will include water and
sanitation facilities, rainwater harvesting, and landscaped boundary enclosure or live fencing. The
construction program will encourage the use o f local buildingmaterials, and minimize the use o f
timber or other naturalresources. Buildingswill designed for designated levels o f earthquake and
fire resistance. Quality o fwater supply will be tested, including periodical testing for
bacteriological and chemical contamination, especially for arsenic and fluoride. Particular
attention will be paid to ensure good health and hygiene o fthe schoolchildren. Topics such as
food, health, personalhygiene, and common illnesses will form part o f classroom instruction.
Personal hygienic, health and sanitation issues will be integrated into teacher training programs as
well as schoollcommunity outreach campaigns. Separate funds will be allocated for maintenance
o f water supply andtoilets, and for regular repair and maintenance o f the school building, site
drainage and solid waste management facilities.

As school constructionwill be managedbycommunities, the NEGSIFwill be incorporatedinthe
School Design and Construction Manual. For the construction o f the district education offices and
resource centers, the EMP will be included as part o f the contract documents.

Environmental management issues will be included inEFA program supervision and monitoring
activities, especially the Annual Reviews conductedjointly by HMG/Nand donors. Inaddition,
periodic environmental audits are plannedto assess the quality o f implementation o fthe EMP/
NEGSIF, and to identify andresolve residual issues.

Implementation Capacity. The MOESDOE has implementeda number o f Bank and/or donor
supported basic and primary educationprojects since 1984. The ongoing project covered all 75
districts o fNepal inwhich the physical facilities ina largenumber o f schools have been
improved, with a cost-sharing arrangement betweenthe DOE and local communities. The
Government has demonstrated institutional capacity to manage the EFAprogram, including
planningand implementationo f actions to meet social and environmental needs and safeguards.

To further strengthen capacity to manage environmental issues inthe planning, implementation
and operationo f schools and associated facilities, substantial training is proposed. The DOEwill
coordinate the trainingprograms and ensure that adequate resources are available for this
purpose. The DEOs will be responsible for conducting the training programs, which will include
workshops and on-site training. The NEGSIF will form the core training material. Community
training on construction management will also include complete training on the use and
implementationo f the NEGSIF.


                                                   72

Institutional Arrangements. The roles and responsibilities for implementing the NEGSIF in
respect to the planning, construction, and operation o f schools and associated facilities have been
clearly assigned inthe EMP.

At the school level, the SMCs will maintain an inventory o fnatural, cultural, and other resources
inor near the school; identify the resources needingprotection; implement the NEGSIFduring
planning, construction and operation adopting environmentally sound technologies and
alternatives; and launch school level environmental awareness programs aimed at improving the
health and hygiene o f schoolchildren. At the district level, environmental coordinating units will
be set up (or responsibilities will be assigned within the existing institutional set-up) inthe DEO.
This unit will prepare and maintain: (a) an inventory relatedto environmental conditions o f
schools; (b) monitor and advise on the implementationo f the NEGSIF; (c) review the resource
requirement for managing environmental issues inthe schools; and (d) conduct environmental
training programs. Inaddition, the DE0 will be responsible for regular supervision and
monitoring o f construction activities, and confirm inregular reporting that all environmental
management issues are adequately addressedthrough application o f the NEGSIF.

At the national level, the DOEwill assign environmental monitoring responsibilities to existing
staff and/or sections. These staff will ensure that: (a) the EMP andNEGSIF are adequately
integrated in school improvement plans and civil works proposals; (b) resources are provided to
the SMCs andDEOs for implementing the EMPmEGSIF; (c) environmental training programs
and awareness campaigns are carried out; (d) periodic site supervision are conducted with DEOs;
(e) annuaVperiodic environmental audits for all civil works inthe EFA program are undertaken;

necessary; and (0all relevant environmental management issues are discussed and resolved
(0the environmental guidelines for schools arereviewedperiodically andrevisions made as

duringthe Annual Reviews o fthe EFAprogram.

Social Inclusion

HMGmhas carriedout a SocialAssessment (SA) to analyze the socialimpacts oftheproposed
EFAprogram, andto recommend actions to help meet the national objective o f `inclusive
education' by special targeting o fproject benefits to poor andvulnerable groups. The specific
focus o f the SA was to understand the major barriers, which exclude children from socially
disadvantaged communities, and to recommendways to reduce institutional barriers and enhance
incentives to increase the access o f girls andboys from diverse social groups, ando f children
with special educationneeds.

Additional relevant on-going national studies include: (i)   Gender and Social Exclusion
Assessment,currently underway withjoint funding from Dm> and the Bank;(ii)            Review and
Redesign of Incentives and Scholarships Programsfor Primary and Secondary Education, I;          and
(iii)Situation of Indigenous Peoples in Nepal and National Frameworkfor theDevelopment,.
The latter two studies, which are supported by Denmark, provide valuable insight into the impact
o f current scholarships and incentives to socially disadvantaged communities.




                                                  73

Safeguard Related Risks and Measures Proposed. Based on the SA findings, the EFA program
will not entail any involuntary resettlement or land acquisition. As inthe earlier and ongoing
basic and primaryeducation projects preceding the EFAprogram, no land purchase or donation
will be involved as no new schools will be constructed. Furthermore, schools tend to have ample
grounds for the construction o f new classrooms should the SMCs decide that more space i s
needed. Land for the construction o fpublic schools inNepal i s not purchased; wealthier members
o f the community either donate the landor schools are built on public land not owned by any
individual. Therefore the EFA program does not trigger OPBP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement.

However, O D 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples does apply. After conducting a separate and detailed
study, the Government prepared an Indigenous People's Development Plan (IPDP) as part ofthe
SA work. The IPDPfocused on language-based social exclusion inprimary education and
assessedthe capacity o f the EFAprogram to meet the learningneeds o f indigenous peoples and
linguistic minorities. This study has determinedthat the program will not have any negative
impact on indigenous people or those from socially disadvantaged communities such as Dalits.
Based on the findings andrecommendations o f the SA and the IPDP study, a VCDP has been
prepared. The VCDP lays out a number o f steps that shouldbe taken to comply with OD 4.20 on
Indigenous People and ensure that the EFAprogram not only causes no negative impacts on
indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups, but that it provides the necessary measures to
insure that they get equal access to program benefits.

These measures include: (i)   introducinghome-to-school language transition program inareas
where there are large populations o f indigenous people or linguistic minorities who do not speak
Nepali as their mother tongue; (ii) incentives for recruitment o f local bilingual women teachers in
primaryschools where necessary; (iii)   segregation o f EMIS data by gender, caste, ethnicity and
special needs to permit tracking o fprogress on inclusive education objectives; and (iv)
partnerships between the SMC and local community groups. Tasks that could be undertaken by
these community groups include: (a) social mapping to identify out-of-school children from poor
households and vulnerable communities; (b) organizing campaigns to encourage enrolment o f
out-of-school children, andregular follow up to track their attendance andprogress; (b) acting as
a catalyst to change attitudes towards caste, gender and ethnic exclusion among parents, teachers
andstudents, andmonitoring school response to discriminatory behavior within the school; (c)
lobbying for SMC membership to better reflect the gender, caste and ethnic profile o f the
community as revealedinthe social mappingprocess; and (d) carrying out social audits to track
the allocation o f funds from school block grants, particularly to ensure that scholarships go to the
most needy D a h , girls and indigenous children.

Consultations with Stakeholders. Duringthe SA and preparationo f the VCDP, a series of
meetings and interviews were conductedwith a wide range o fpeople and scholars working inthe
field o f primary education, language development, gender, anthropology and social exclusion
issues. Memberso f community organizations representing socially excluded groups, indigenous
people and linguistic minorities were interviewed. Fieldvisits were made to rural andurban
community schools to assess different social inclusion issues o f indigenous and Dalit children.

Five stakeholder discussions were organized at the central level. As a first step, three separate
thematic meetings were heldwith national stakeholders -women, Janajatis and Dalit activists.
Participants were from government, non-government and academic institutions working at


                                                 74

national, district as well as community levels, including representatives from the National
Commissions for Dalits and Women, andthe Nepal Federation o fNationalities. The SA team
presented their preliminary recommendations, and solicited ideas and inputs from the
participants. The keyrecommendations from each o f these thematic group meetings were
incorporated with S A recommendations into the VCDP.

A final consultationwith a larger group ofparticipantsrepresenting government, international
NGOs and other concerned organizations was ledbythe MOES on January 9,2004. Feedback
from the consultations confirmed the validity o f several key recommendations to ensure the
inclusion o f vulnerable groups. These include: (i)    provision o f grants to SMCs to enable them to
enter into partnerships with local groups for implementing EFA activities; (ii)      development o f
modalities to reduce discriminatory practices and behavior inschools; and (iii)      piloting o f home-
to-school language transition for non-Nepali speaking children.

Cauacitv and Commitment o f ImulementationAgencies. The DOEMOES as the lead
implementation agency, hastheprimaryresponsibility for delivery o fprogram outcomesin
coordination withother central agencies(e.g., FCGOMOF, NPC). Withinthe DOE, the Women's
Education, Special Needs Education, Training and the Planningand Monitoring sections have
key accountability for components related to social inclusion. Experiencehas indicated that for
effective implementation, more trained field-based staff are needed for mainstreaming
accountability for social inclusion. More than rules, a shift inattitudes andbehavior is needed to
stimulate real social transformation inschools. The EFAprogram envisages support to SMCs
from local women's, children's and other community groups to create increased ownership and
broadparticipation insocial monitoring o f education service delivery. It is proposed that
modalities for monitoring andtracking cases o fdiscrimination be set up at appropriate offices.
The existing Women's Educationand Special Needs Education sections would benefit from a
more holistic framework for addressing inclusive education inapproach and content.

Drawing on the rich experience and demonstrated success o f the many international NGOs and
community-based organizations inNepal in social mobilization, the program will support
partnerships with such groups to strengthen monitoring and social audits o f school block grants.
At the national, district and community levels, there are thousands o fwomen's groups engaged in
women's and children's development through advocacy and empowerment. Similarly, over 1,500
Children's Clubs and Children's Federations have been formed inschools and communities.
These and other local groups will be tapped to build the capacity o f SMCs to implement program
activities.

Arrangements for Fundingand Schedule for Implementation. It is anticipatedthat all the program
activities, including the review of national policies, regulations, guidelines and directives on
social inclusion, will be initiated within the first year o fprogram implementation.

Funding at the Community Level: (i)R s 100,000 as a one-time incentive will beprovided to all
                                         N
 community-managed schools; (ii)      all publicly-managed schools will get an initial basic grant
 duringthe first year o fprogram implementation; and (iii) year two onwards, accredited
                                                                 from
 schools will receive additional block grant fhding linked to the accreditation level o fthe school
 (details on the qualification criteria for different levels o f grant funding are described inAnnex
 17). These funds canbe used for: (a) establishing partnerships between SMC and local


                                                    75

community groups to carry out social mapping, social audits and capacity buildingactivities; (b)
hiringfemale teachers (bilingual where necessary); and (c) scholarships for girls, dalits and
students from disadvantaged households.

Funding at the CentralLevel: Central hnds will be used (probably on an outsourcing basis) for:
(i) providing technical expertise on integrating positive images o f diverse socio-cultural and
religious groups into the on-going curriculum development process; (ii)    developing a home-to-
school language transition modulelcwriculum for teaching non-Nepali speaking children; and
(iii)developing a framework for sanctions against discrimination, which will be carried out by the
Monitoringand Inspection Section inDOE. It i s recommended that development o f the
curriculum be initiated inthe first year through outsourcing o f technical inputs for development
o f modules. Pre-testing and piloting ina number o f districts with highindigenous population
should follow insecond and third years to inform up-scaling o fthe activity.

Mechanisms to Monitor the Implementationo f the Agreed Plan. The EMIS and appropriate
Monitoring and Evaluation systems will be strengthened/developed to ensure accountability o f all
stakeholders. EMIS data will be segregated by gender, caste (Dalithon-Dalit) and ethnicity
(Janajatihon-Janajati) andincorporated into flash reports for monitoring progress on process and
outcome indicators.

Community ManagedInformation System data will be collected with the help o f local group to
supplement information from the EMIS. Mechanisms such as social audits and social mapping
will help to track school absenteeism anddropout rates by gender, caste and ethnicity o f children,

both guiding and operational principles for the management o f partnerships betweenHis HMG/N

Government Organizations - inNepal's education sector. The Code i s inclusive, recognizingthe
and International Development Partners - bilaterals, multilaterals and InternationalNon

variety o fmodalities through which different Partners support the HMG/N's goals, objectives,
policies andprograms, and management and administrative procedures. The Code i s guidedby
HMG/N's Foreign Aid Policy 2002 and informed by the Rome Declaration on Donor
Harmonization


                                        11.   Participation

3. While participation i s voluntary and open, HMGMencourages prospective external partners
to accept and adhere to the COC. This implies that they will all a) share Nepal's goals and
objectives for education, b) contribute financial, technical or service delivery support to those
goals and objectives, and c) have the status o f external Partners. For all Partners, the National
Plan o f Action for Education For All (EFA) 2001-2015, the EFA Core Document 2004/09, will
constitute the main vision, objectives and strategies to which they subscribe. It is understood
that while the Code o f Conduct is neither legally bindingnor enforceable, Partners will subscribe
to both guiding and operational principles ingood faith

                               111. SharedGoalsandObjectives

are consonant with those o f the Dakar Framework for Action, and also Nepal's strategies to
achieve the MilleniumDevelopment Goals for education. Government also recognizes and
endorses, through multilateral and bilateral agreements, the goals and objectives that guide the
work o fPartners.

              missions and to increase efficiency and knowledge sharing among Partners and
              with Government, and to reduce the burden o f transactions at the central, district
              andcommunity levels.

              To collaborate among themselves and with HMG/Nto ensure that the particular
              competencies o f each Partner are identified and usedto the best extent, with the
              possibility that, at the request o f Government, principal responsibility for a given
              technical area may be delegated to a given Partner.

              To planjointly with development partners to the extent possible all technical
              inputswith HMG/N, at national and local levels, to ensure direct linkages to

                               NEPAL:EducationFor All Project

Background

Prior to the nationalizationo f schools in 1972, school education inNepal almost exclusively
depended upon schools managed and funded by communities. At that time, all authority for
management o f the schools rested with the Boardo fDirectors. Schools received block grants
from the Government to cover about 20-25% o f the schools' operating costs. The main source o f
school income was tuition fees. Some schools supplemented their income from endowments
received from philanthropists.

After nationalization, schools began receiving earmarked grants to cover teacher salaries, which
significantly strengthened the schools' financial base. Inaddition to grants for teacher salaries,
government schools have been receiving substantial in-kindinputs from the development budget
funded primarily by donors. Despite large government investments inschools, education quality
not only didnot improve but started to decline. This decline has been attributed to two main
reasons: (i) a shift inthe accountability o f schools (and o f teachers inparticular) from
stakeholders to the Government; and (ii)   disempowerment o f schools through in-kindsupport
provided by district andcentral authorities.

The key objective o f school block grants as envisaged inthe EFA program, is to allow publicly
managed schools to make their own choices inrespect o f educational inputs, and to have the
resources for financing these inputs.A conducive environment for accountable use o f block
grants by schools now exists due to the recent amendment o f the Education Act. The amendment
stipulates that schools should establish management committees that are accountable to
stakeholders, and includes a provision for the transfer o f government schools to community
management. Schools opting for community management are given a one time incentive grant.

Accreditationof Schools

School grants will be usedto leverage school improvement by linking hndingwith performance.
An accreditationsystem will be introducedbasedon assessment o fschoolperformanceineight
areas: (i)accountability/transparency; (ii)  physical facilities; (iii) availability and
                                                                      teacher
training; (iv) extemal environment (drinkingwater and sanitation inparticular); (v) internal
environment (classroom, learningmaterials and furniture); (vi) co-curricular activities; (vii)
school operation processes; and (vii) educational outcomes. The DOE has established basic
criteria for evaluating schools ineach o f these areas (Attachment 2). Consultations with
stakeholders -SMC, academia, professionalbodies, teachers' unions, andparents' associations -
will be undertaken to confirm the validity o fthese criteria for classifying schools into three
categories: unaccredited, grade one and grade two.

Participation inthe accreditation process will be on a voluntary basis. Eachparticipating school
will carry out a self assessmentonce a year. Self assessmentresults will be verified ex-post by
qualified experts included ina roster of accreditation experts. The procedures for preparingthe




                                                  106

roster, and guidelines for implementation o fblock grants will be included inan Operations
Manual for the school grants program.

School Grants

School grants will comprise three levels: basic, level 1and level 2; the last two are linked to
accreditation at grades one and two, respectively. Basic grants comprise block grants inaddition
to the earmarked grants that schools are receiving at present, while level 1and 2 grants comprise
earmarked, block andbonus grants (Attachment 1).Unaccredited schools will receive only basic
grants.

Basic grants are designed to provide a minimumlevel o f financial support to unaccredited
schools to help them improve and aspire to grade one status. Schools meeting grade one
requirements will be eligible for a Level 1grant. Inaddition, ifthese schools are able to achieve
the outcome standards for grade one, they will qualify for a Level 1bonus grant. A similar
process will be used for awarding level 2 grants and bonuses. The grants system i s designed such
that schools will not be penalized for being unable to meet the standards related to resource
requirements (e.g., desirable student to teacher ratios, physical facilities) for which help from the
Government i s needed.

Basic Grunts.These grants will have an earmarked component inaddition to block funding. The
earmarked component covers: (a) salaries o f teaching and administration staff; (b) textbooks for
students; (c) scholarships for poor students; (d) existing programs for pre-school/ECD, special
needs, and inclusive education; (e) planning andmanagement training for SMCs, PTAs, and
head teachers; (0school-community partnerships; and (8) construction and major rehabilitation
o f classrooms. The block grant component o f the basic grants, estimated at N R s 70 per student
per year (about US$l.O) is expected to be usedfor teachingmaterials, book comers, non-salary
recurrent costs (school, office and cleaning supplies), andbasic maintenance o fphysical
facilities.

Level 1 Grants.Grade one accredited schools will receive these grants, which comprise three
components. First, there i s an earmarked component for salaries, scholarships and existing
programs for special needs and inclusive education. Second, the block grant component will
increase the allocation per student per year as it represents an amount equivalent to what schools
are already receiving as earmarked grants plus additional funding for non-salary recurrent
expenditures. Third, bonus grants amounting to NRslOO per student (about US$1.4) will be
given to schools, which meet the outcome standards associated with the accreditation level.
Since there will be annual self-assessments, schools will receive the bonus grant as long as they
continue to meet the outcome standards for the level at which they have been accredited.

Level 2 Grants. Schools meeting grade two requirements will qualify for earmarked grants for
salaries and special needs education. The block grant component o f level 2 grants will cover non-
 salary recurrent expenditures at a higher level than Level 1grants, as well as school expenditures
that are currently ear-marked. It i s expected that grade two schools will be able to manage a
relatively largenon-earmarked budget.Bonus grants amounting to NRs150per student (about




                                                  107

US$2.0) would be given to schools, which meet the outcome standards for grade two. Schools
are required to maintain outcome standards inorder to continue receivingbonus grants.

Based on the results o fperiodic monitoring at the school level, and observations on SMC
management capacity, the Ministry o f Education and Sports may adjust the composition o f ear-
markedand non-earmarked block grants duringimplementation ofthe EFAprogram.

ImplementationArrangements

The Director General, DOEwill have overall responsibility for oversight and evaluation o fthe
school block grants program. Resource Persons (RPs) located inthe Resource Centers, as well as
DEOs will be responsible for providing technical support to schools and monitoring program
implementation. To carry out these functions, they will be supported by qualified local NGOs
and persons contracted for this purpose.

Duringthe first year o fprogram implementation, all schools will receive abasic grant andan
accompanying Operations Manual describingthe block grants program, andthe roles and
responsibilities o f school personnel, SMCs and PTAs. The Manualwill provide: (i)      thebasic
formats for financial reports; (ii)the rules and procedures for procurement o fgoods and services;
(iii) formonitoringprogressonprocessesandoutcomes(flashreports); and(iv)self-
      formats
assessment form for school accreditation. Duringthis period, schools will be requested to carry
out a self-assessment, which will be verified before the start ofthe next academic year (April
2005) to ensure that schools qualifying for grade one and grade two accreditationstatus, will
receive the enhanced block grants.

Since DEOs are key to the success o fprogram implementation, an incentive system will be put
inplaceto motivate staffinthese offices to assist schools inimproving their performance.
Beginning inthe second year o f program implementation, an excellence award will bepresented
at an annual celebratory event to DEOs, which have the largest numberhhare o f schools
qualifying for Level 1and Level 2 grants. The award o f around N R s 500,000 (US$6,800
equivalent) is expected to be a sufficiently attractive incentive for DE0 staff to promote
teamwork inthe offices.

FinancialAspects

Block grants will be transferred to SMCs usingthe existing mechanisms for transferring funds to
 schools. A plan to reduce present delays inthe transfer o f funds for non-salary expenditures is
beingdeveloped, andwill be implemented duringthe first year o fthe program. Fundswill be
 transferred to SMCs once every trimester (Le., every four months). To promote transparency in
 the use o f grant resources, SMCs are required to post income and expenditure reports
 periodically ina visible area at the school. Parents' associations are expected to monitor the use
 o f funds as well as undertake social audits. Simple financial reports will be prepared bythe
 SMCs and maintained at the school for record-keeping purposes, and for periodic audits that
 will be carried out by a thirdpartyina sample of schools.

                                  NEPAL:EducationFor All Project

Background

Primary school education has been free inNepal since 1975. From 1978 onwards, free textbooks
were provided for all students ingrades one to three andfor students inremote areas ingrades
four and five. Since 1999, all students ingrades four and five receive free textbooks. The
entitlement o f all students to a new set o f free textbooks every year i s inthe process o f changing
for all grades except for grade one with the introduction o fre-usable textbooks, which are
designed to last for three years.

The Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) under the MOES is responsible for both curriculum
and textbook development. Production and distribution o ftextbooks is the responsibility o f Janak
Educational Materials Centre (JEMC), a state-owned enterprise incorporated under the Company
Act and reporting to the MOES. The JEMC has been sub-contractingtextbook distribution to
Sajha Prakashan (SP), which is a cooperative.

Private schools accounting for about 9% o ftotal primaryenrolment o f the country, are required
to use textbooks developed by the CDC. However, EducationRegulations allow private schools
to supplement CDC textbooks with additional textbooks subject to approval by the CDC.
Practically all private schools use additional textbooks that are developed, produced and
distributed by the private sector.

Despite continual efforts to ensure timely delivery o f textbooks to students, delays persist. To
address this problem and improve the quality o f textbooks, the MOES has decided to open-up the
development, production and distribution o f textbooks to the private sector. The action plan for
implementationo f this policy initiative envisages opening-up o fprintingand distribution o f
textbooks to the private sector from April 2005 (Le., beginningo f academic year 2005/06), and
the development o ftextbooks inthe followingyear. Expert review o fthe actionplanindicated
that the proposed pace and scale o f introducing competition into the textbook development,
production and distribution process may not be manageable and could lead to disruption in
textbook supply inthe short run. The MOES has therefore revised the action plan,which is
summarized inthe next section.

The Action Plan

The Government's ultimate objective i s to rely uponthe market for the development, production
 anddistribution o ftextbooks, while retainingregulatory functions with the MOES.
 Implementation o fthe actionplan i s expected to lead to timely delivery o f quality textbooks to
 students at a competitive price. Under the actionplan, beginning inApril 2006, the development,
printingand distribution o ftextbooks through the market mechanismwillbepilotedinseven
 districts for all titles and all primary grades. Schools inthe pilot districts will receive block
 grants for purchasingtextbooks. The scale o f the pilot i s estimated to be big enough to attract
 private sector interest, while beingmanageable incase the market mechanism fails to function
 effectively, andthe Government has to rely on the JEMC as a backup supplier. The pilot districts
 account for about 19% o fthe total market share intextbooks (including demand from private

schools). To increase the probability for success, districts with well functioning markets have
been selected for the pilot. Up-scaling of the approach will be based on the experience gained
from the pilot.

Innon-pilot districts (68 districts), competitiveproductionofall grade five textbooks developed
bythe CDC, will be introducedinApril 2006. Textbooks for other grades will continue to be
producedby JEMC. Competition for textbook distribution will be introduced inApril 2005 in
five selected districts, with five more added the following year. SP will continue to be the
primary textbook distributor indistricts yet to be opened to competition.

 Preparationsfor OpeningDevelopment,Productionand Distributionto PrivateSector

 Opening development, production and distribution to the private sector is a complex exercise.
 For successfbl implementation of this initiative, the MOES would need to undertake serious
 preparations. The mainpreparatory activities for opening textbooks to the private sector are
 briefly described below.

 Management of TextbookProvision. The agency responsible for overseeing textbook production
 and distribution was the CDC untilthis responsibilitywas transferred to the DOE'SEducational
 Materials Section (EMS) inacademic year 2003/04. Both o fthese agencies are not properly
 staffed and equipped to manage the production and distribution o f textbooks worth several
 millions ofUS dollars. Staff are regularly transferred andnew staff are appointedwith no
 experience nor understanding o f the process, which normally requires handlingby a team o f
 professionals.



                                                 116

To implement the first phase o f the action planbeginning academic year 2005/06, the EMS will
need to undertake the following tasks:

   0   Coordinate the collection of, and verify schools' annual textbook requirements.
       Plan the annual production and distribution o f textbooks.
   0   Allocate responsibility for textbook production and distribution among single source
       suppliers (i.e., JEMC and SP), andprivate and public sector suppliers using competitive
       procurement.
       Draw up biddingdocuments and organize competitive process for selecting textbook
       distributors.
       Contract with the winners o fthe competitive procurement process.
       Agree on timetables with distributors, and ensure that these are adhered to. Penalize the
       distributors for late deliveries.
        Ensure that delivery o f textbooks and payment of invoices are made on time through
        monitoring o fproduction, distribution and coupodreimbursement slip collections.

Duringthe secondphasebeginningacademic year 2006/07, the EMSwill:

        Continue all activities included inthe first phase.
    0   Establishprocedures (including evaluation criteria and their weights) for approval o f
        textbooks developedby the private sector.
        Agree on quality standards and timetables with suppliers and ensure that these are
        adhered to, penalizing those responsible for unacceptable quality and late deliveries.
        Fix the amount o f schools block grants for textbooks and the timing for their availability,
        working with schools and private and public sector suppliers to ensure that schools have
        access to a wide range o f competitively priced textbooks.

For successful management o fthe above tasks, capacity inthe EMS will need to be considerably
strengthened. This could be achieved through either the appointment o f specialized government
staff or the recruitment o f suitably qualified consultants. At the minimum, two experts
experienced inbook development, production, distribution, procurement and data processing,
will berequired. Inaddition, the existing staffhas to undergo specialized training. Inorder to
meet the action plan schedule, the experts should be inplace by September, 2004. Depending
upon the experience o f locally recruited staff/consultants, some short-term international
consultancy services may be required.

Once textbook development i s open to the private sector, the CDC's continued engagement in
textbook development while being the responsible agency for approving manuscripts, may
constitute a conflict o f interests. It is recommended therefore, that the CDC discontinue its
involvement intextbook development by transferring this function to the DOE. At the same time,
the section responsible for textbook approval inthe CDC will need to be strengthened through
training o f its staff, and technical support fromthe newly recruitedspecialists inthe EMS.

Transfer o f responsibility for textbook development from the CDC to the DOE will require
amendment o fthe Education Regulations. To meet the action plan schedule, this amendment has
to completed by December, 2004.


                                                  117

Status of JEMC The JEMC, beinga state-owned enterprise incorporated under the Company
Act, and reportingto the MOES, will not be eligible to bidfor textbook production contracts
under a competitive process that i s managed by the DOE. For the JEMC to be eligible, it will
have to become a financially autonomous entity not linked to the MOES. Steps will need to be
taken to change the status o f JEMC inorder that it i s eligible to compete for production contracts
from academic year 2006 onwards.

Cost.The action plan for opening textbook development, production and distribution to the
private sector envisages single source procurement o f textbooks from the JEMC duringthe
interim period before competition i s applied to the procurement o f all primary grade titles. This
implies that the DOEwill need to determine a commercially justified price for textbooks, which
are procured from the JEMC. To this end, an analysis o fproduction costs based on JEMC's
balance sheet and profit and loss statements, together with a market survey o f textbook prices,
will be required. Similarly, the market price for distribution o ftextbooks will also needto be
determined. The MOES has committed to undertake these tasks as part of action plan
preparations.

                        Annex 19: SchoolPhysicalFacilitiesImprovement
                                 NEPAL:EducationFor All Project

The major construction component o f the EFA program is improvement o f school physical
facilities. This component entails: (a) the construction o f new classrooms, o f which 11,000 will
be permanent and 1,000 will be temporary structures; (b) rehabilitation o f 10,000 existing
classrooms; (c) improvement o f site landscaping; and (d) addition or improvement o fwater
supply and sanitationservices in 10,000 schools. The program will also fund construction o f250
RCs and 11DE0buildings.

The EFA objective o fincreasingaccess to quality primary education cannot be achieved unless
there i s a well functioning and safe school environment, which is friendly to girls, children with
disabilities, and children o f disadvantaged groups. The vision for an effective and safe learning
environment is one inwhich the classroom is spacious, well lit, well ventilated and adequately
fumished. Hence, the main thrust o f school physical facility improvement will be to increase the
conduciveness o f classrooms for the teachingleaming process, while ensuring that adequate
environmental, structural and safety standards are maintained.

Meeting classroom needs. There are about 21,000 primaryschools with a total enrolment of
about four million students. Out o f the existingstock o f about 80,000 classrooms, about 41,000
classrooms constructed through various projects over the last two decades, are deemed to meet
minimumstandards. However, most o fthe stock -about 30,000 classrooms -built mainly
through community efforts, do not meet these standards. Inaddition, there are schools with
classroom shortage that is exacerbated by influx o fpeople from insurgency impacted areas. The
physical facilities improvement program is therefore, not expected to meet all the requirements
for replacementhew classrooms. As availability o f classrooms for all primary age children is a
basic prerequisite for meeting the commitment towards education for all, the program will
introduce low-cost temporary classrooms to ensure that children are not denied access to primary
education because o f the lack o f classrooms. Temporary classrooms will be constructed by
communities using local materials, technology and labor. The design oftemporary classrooms,
which will meet buildingcode requirements for safety, including resistance to earthquakes and
adequate lightingandventilation, will be completedby July, 2004.

Alternative designs for classrooms. Assessment o f classroom designs used inearlier projects
 against the objective o f improving construction quality brought to light, several concerns. First,
there i s concem about the quality o f construction, which i s managed by local communities with
 limitedskills inthis area. Second, construction using timber could lead to depletion o f this
resource, which, inturn, brings about undesirable environmental impacts. The third main
 concern pertains to the structural ability o f school buildingsto resist earthquakes. To address
 these concerns, a standard classroom design usingsteel structures and CGI sheet roofing was
 adopted under the second basic and primary education project (BPEP 11). Since the quality o f
 fabricated steel structures could be assured at the factory, and the structures transported manually
 to construction sites where they are assembled under limitedsupervision, use o f such a
 classroom design has the advantage o f lowering transport and supervision costs. However, there
 are also shortcomings inthat use of local materials for wall and floor construction i s now limited,
 and the cost o fmanual transport o f steel structures has beenprohibitive invery remote, high



                                                   119

terrain districts with narrow and steep trails. Although designed for manual transport, delivery of
steel structures i s often delayed as a result o f the difficult terrain.

Althoughthe existing designs meet safety requirements and ensure spacious, well lit and
ventilated classrooms, fbrther improvements could be achieved through: (i)       use o f locally
available materials (e.g., strawkhatch mats) for better noise andheat insulation; (ii)    allowing
local architecture, interior design preferences and local materials to be integratedinto classroom
construction; and (iii)  providing the design for additional amenities, which could be financedby
communities ifthey choose to include such amenities inthe school facilities.

Based on the experience o f BPEP 11,the DOE i s developing alternative designs for schools
located indifferent geographic terrains.

(i)Mountain/Hill districts with dgjcult access (i.e., more than five days' walk from the nearest
road-head). This design is basedprimarily on the use of local materials and construction
methods, but will adhere to nationally prescribedconstruction standards, particularly for
earthquake resistance.

(ii) Mountain/Hill/Terai districts with moderate access (ie., maximumwalking distance o f five
days from the nearest roadhead). Options for interior design and material specifications for the
BPEP I1model classroom will bemade available to schools inthese districts. The interior and
material specifications will aim to improve the teachindlearning environment, noise andheat
insulation as well as facilitate local procurement. Appropriate local materials will be usedto
improve wall elevations, door/window, floor and damp-proof specifications. The options will
 also include the design for additional amenities to be financed by communities.

 (iii)
     Accessible districts (urban areas inparticular) with demonstrated construction capacity have
 the option o f usingindustrial/modem materials and methods primarilyintended for community-
 managed schools receiving block grants. The design recommendations will take into
 consideration, the availability of skilled labor and technical supervisory capacity inthe
 distridarea.

 The alternative designs were reviewedby the appraisal mission. At least three options will be
 prepared for each ofthe above terraindcategories by July, 2004. These will take into account, the
 comments provided bythe appraisal mission, includinginterior design options. Inaddition,
 tentative site layouts will be prepared; actual layout for each school will be prepared by technical
 supervisors from DEOs after completion o f site mapping and surveys.

 All schools underthephysical facility improvement programwill have improvedsite services,
 including bio-fencing, leveledplay spaces, water and sanitation facilities (especially toilets for
 girls). Cost-sharing by the community for physical facilities improvement will remain at the
 present level o f about 20% o ftotal constructioncosts.

 Criteria for identifving, targeting:and prioritizing districts and schools. The government will
 prioritize districts on the basis o f four equally weighted criteria: (i)classroom requirement as
 reportedby the school through the EMIS; (ii)       classroom requirement as determined using



                                                     120

prescribed student teacher ratios, (iii) number o f classrooms per school constructed to-
                                          average
date, under all externally-supported projects; and (iv) human development index for districts. In
the first year o f program implementation, construction will start in 18 priority districts. This will
be followed by 19 other districts every year till the end o f the program period. School physical
facilities improvement ineach district i s expected to be completed within two years. Based on
these criteria, the Government has selected the following 18 districts for the first year: Gulmi,
Nawalparasi, Baglung, Jajarkot, Palpa, Baitadi, Salyan, Arghakhanchi, Bardia, Rolpa, Rautahat,
Ilam, Tanahu, Bajhang, Doti, Khotang, Myagdi and Kathmandu.

The prioritization criteria for schools within each program district is a composite index o fthree
weighted factors: (i)  share o f dalit students intotal enrolment; (ii) o f disadvantagedjanajati
                                                                     share
and other disadvantaged groups (iii) o f girls intotal enrolment; and (iv) ratio o fgrade five
                                         share
to grade one enrolment. These shares are weighted at 25%, 25%, 30% and 20%, respectively.
The list o f schools selected for construction duringthe first year was reviewed by the appraisal
mission. To assure appropriate use o f school selection and prioritization criteria, and timely
implementation o f annual physical facilities improvement plans, the Government will submit the
list o f selected schools for each district for discussion duringthe EFA program reviews inApril
o f each year. The requirements o f `priority' schools for construction andrehabilitationhervice
improvements will be established through survey andmapping o f the three districts selected for
pilotingo f decentralized procurement for steelworks and CGI sheets.

Management, supervision and monitoring. Physical facilities improvement will be managed and
monitored centrally by the Physical Services Section o f the DOE. The works will be executed by
SMCs under the supervision o f technical units inthe DEOs. The technical units will undertake
supervision o f works on a roving basis. Depending upon the terrain and accessibility o f districts,
one overseer is expected to supervise eight to ten schools usingsteel component assembly at site.
Ifreinforcedcement concrete is usedfor classroomconstruction, eachoverseer willbeable to
supervise only four to five schools. It has been proposed that teams o f six to eight overseers led
by a graduate engineer, be formed intechnical units. Forproper implementation o fthe design
options for urbanand community-managed schools, an additional posting o f one architect to
cover two districts is proposedinthe technical unit. The Physical Services Section i s headed by a
Senior Divisional Engineer (Deputy Director), and staffed with three Engineers, one Architect
and five Overseerddraftsmen. Giventhe increase incomplexity o f the construction program, an
additional engineer will be posted at the DOE.

The size o f the annual program for each district i s prorated from the overall EFAtargets
proportionally to the average projected demand ineach district. Physical facilities improvement
ineachdistrict isexpectedto becompletedintwo years so that the technical supervisionload
will remainat a maximum o fthirty districts. Inorder that school selection criteria canbe
effectively applied and the survey o fphysical facilities done intime, these activities have to be
completed inApril each year for the coming fiscal year. Inthe near-term, to avoid large-scale
transfer o f technicians from districts with ongoing classroom construction to EFA year one
districts, a detailed survey will be conducted only inthe three districts where decentralized
procurement o f steel structures i s to be piloted. Surveys inthe remaining districts will be
completed byNovember, 2004.




                                                    121

Procuremento fmaterials and construction services. The process o f N C B at central or district
level will be followed for construction of resource centers andDE0buildings. Procurement o f
steel trusses, other structural materials, roofing and door/window materials for standard
classrooms will be made boththrough InternationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB) andN C B
procedures depending upon the size o fthe contract. Decentralization o f this procurement process
to the district level will be piloted inthree districts duringthe first year o f EFA program
implementation. Capacity for procurement and quality inspection inthe technical units inthese
districts will need to be enhanced through consultancy services inthe first year. Works for
constructing classrooms and other school facilities will be procured under community
management and overseen by the SMC. Schools are reimbursed at different construction stages
based on progress and on approval o f the supervisingtechnician. The works will also be subject
to social audits by community groups.

The procurement plan for civil works was reviewedduringthe appraisalmission and found to be
satisfactory.

Manuals and guidelines. The DOEhas completed an Environmental Management Plan (EMP),
which provides guidelines for design and construction o f classrooms to create a safe and
conducive environment for leaming. Inaddition, these guidelines will help to mitigate any
environmental risk that school construction, and external facility improvement (Le., drinking
water and sanitation facilities) may pose. The DOEis preparing a School Design and
Construction Manual comprising one booklet each for each type o f classroom design to assist the
communities to undertake classroom construction. The booklets will contain drawings for the
classroom design, bill o f quantities, specifications o f materials, clear step by step guidelines on
how to construct the class room, skills required and supervision needs for the particular design.
The DOEhas also beenpreparing a School ConstructionManagement Manual (SCMM). This
manual will specify classroom construction norms, and clearly define what has to be done, who
will be doing it, how it will be done, and when it should be done. The manualwill also list
construction targets and describe how each target will be achieved, giving the specified dates and
labor requirements. The altemate designs and environmental guidelines will form part o fthe
SCMM, which will be utilized as a guidance andmonitoring tool by all persons involved inEFA
program implementation. All the manuals and guidelines are expected to be ready by July, 2004.
