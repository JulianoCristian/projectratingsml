Education for All Project's\n            long-term development objective is to improve access to, and\n            benefit from basic and primary education for children,\n            especially girls and children from disadvantaged groups, and\n            from literacy programs for poor adults. The project will\n            achieve three strategic goals: a) improving access to, and\n            equity of basic and primary education; b) enhancing\n            educational quality and relevance; and, c) improving\n            efficiency, and institutional capacity of education service\n            delivery. This additional grant will help fill the financing\n            gap - estimated at US$87l million for the remaining two\n            years - resulting from a cost overrun of core project\n            activities and scaling up of reforms for improved quality\n            and efficiency. The financial gap estimated at US$25 million\n            at the beginning has increased very significantly due to:\n            (a) government's commitment to provide free primary\n            education and meet the popular aspirations of universal\n            primary education, which entailed funding additional\n            teachers and non-salary costs including additional\n            classrooms; (b) unforeseen rise of 27 percent in teacher\n            salaries; (c) increase in number and amount of scholarship\n            for girls and dalits; and (d) a fall of US$ against Nepali\n            Rupee by about 11 percent."}, "docdt": "2007-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
