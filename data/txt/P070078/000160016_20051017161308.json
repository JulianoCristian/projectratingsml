Some lessons learnt from the project: included\n            1) the need for interagency cooperation at border cross\n            points to sustain changes and promote pragmatic approaches\n            in problem resolution; 2) the multiplying effect of economic\n            returns that come from replicating procedures at pilot\n            sites; 3) the frequent rotation of staff in the General\n            Directorate of Customs that made it difficult for the\n            organization to \"own\" the project, and contributed\n            to project delays; 4) the better results in detecting\n            irregularities that come with customs control; 5) the need\n            for further cooperation and support from government agencies\n            to make the regional website sustainable and successful; 6)\n            designing border inspection facilities as multifunctional so\n            they could be adapted for other uses after their current use\n            becomes no more relevant; 7) the need for the Bank to focus\n            on legitimate security arrangements and anti-terrorism\n            aspects as well as trade facilitation; 8) the fact that\n            project was result-oriented  with measurable indicators\n            contributed to project success; 9) the importance of\n            starting the policy dialogue at the very beginning of the\n            project; and 10) achieving better project results by\n            adopting a regional approach, which creates peer pressure\n            among participating countries and generates competitive\n            spirit and motivation, leading to better performance."}, "docdt": "2005-10-12T00:00:00Z"}
