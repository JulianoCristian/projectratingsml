Background- The collapse of the Soviet Union and the break-up of the
Yugoslav Federation led to radical changes in the direction of traffic flows
and the creation of new frontiers and customs services. Performance of the
border control agencies has been unsatisfactory: traffic has been subject to
long waiting times, raising the cost of transport services and making them
unpredictable; customs revenue collection has fallen short; and smuggling
and corruption have become widespread. These deficiencies have amounted to
bottlenecks to trade, with macro-economic effects similar to those of
protectionist trade policies; they undermine incentives to improve
competitiveness; and deter foreign direct investment. To address these
problems, the EU has been advising Romania and Bulgaria on customs reform and
computerization, as part of its pre-accession assistance. In
Bosnia/Herzegovina it has provided substantial direct operational support to
build up the customs administrations after the war and likewise in Albania
after the civil unrest of 1995-97. The Southeast European Cooperative
Initiative (SECI) has, in parallel, set up national "PRO" committees to
mobilize public and private sectors to simplify procedures and otherwise
facilitate trade. In this connection the governments of Albania,
Bosnia/Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, FYR Macedonia and Romania have each
asked the Bank to finance improvements to border crossing points
Program Objectives and Description- The border crossing problem, by its
nature, requires coordinated and mutually reinforcing action in many areas.
The Program therefore aims to integrate the efforts of the EU, SECI and the
World Bank Group for: (a) physical improvements to border crossings, (b)
technical assistance to strengthen the customs administrations, (c)
computerization of procedures at the border crossings and electronic filing
of customs declarations, and (d) improved exchange of information between the
border control agencies and the business community, through seminars and the
development of Internet web sites ("trade facilitation"). At the regional
(i.e. international) level a steering committee has been created to provide a



forum for the exchange of experience among the countries, the collective
aligning of procedures on EU standards, and the coordination of operating
practices at "paired" crossing points. Thereby the Program aims to: (i)
reduce costs to trade and transport; (ii) reduce smuggling and corruption at
border crossings; and (iii) strengthen regional partnerships and expand
regional trade.
Program Costs and Financing- The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$ 15.5 million equivalent. An IDA Credit of US$ 10.6 million would finance
about 68 percent of this total. The US government has been asked to provide
grant funding of about $ 1.1 million. The government will finance the
remaining US$ 3.8 million, about 25 percent of the total estimated cost. The
EU is providing additional assistance through on-going grants.
Preparation and Implementation- The Project is one of six nearly
simultaneous country operations linked under the TTFSE Program. The projects
will be implemented over three years, starting in the fall of 2000. The
borrower for each World Bank loan/IDA credit will be the government. The
customs agencies will be responsible for implementing most components,
although the border police will also be involved in some countries; trade
facilitation activities will be hosted by the chambers of commerce in
cooperation with the ministries of trade. The regional steering committee is
responsible for coordination across countries; each government is
represented by a high-level project coordinator authorized to speak on behalf
of all border control agencies. To the extent possible the project
implementation teams are being built around officials already managing the EU
assistance and SECI coordinating functions. The PIRS will assist each
government in procurement and loan management.
Albania is scheduled for negotiations September 5-7, 2000. It would go to
the Board in October and be effective in January, 2001. Romania, Bulgaria,
and FYR Macedonia are well advanced in preparing their projects; the Bank
negotiated loans with them in April-May 2000. The remaining two countries
are expected to be negotiated by early Fall 2000.

Annex
Because this is a Category B project, it may be required that the borrower
prepare a separate EA report. If a separate EA report is required, once it
is prepared and submitted to the Bank, in accordance with OP 4.01,
Environmental Assessment, it will be filed as an annex to the Public
Information Document (PID) .
If no separate EA report is required, the PID will not contain an EA annex;
the findings and recommendations of the EA will be reflected in the body of
the PID.
