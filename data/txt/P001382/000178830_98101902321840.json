services. It would develop Lesotho's water\n            resources; strengthen sector institutions; and upgrade\n            domestic water supplies. The project would, by 1986, provide\n            public water service to some 20,000 new consumers who now\n            rely on unprotected sources and would improve reliability\n            and quality of water now supplied to about 21,000 current\n            consumers. In addition, the Project would strengthen a key\n            Government institution, the Water and Sewerage Branch (WSB)\n            of the Ministry of Works (MW)."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
