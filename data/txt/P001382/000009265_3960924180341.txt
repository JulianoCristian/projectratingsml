PROJECT PEIFOIMANCE AUDIT JIPOMt
LESOTHOt SEVEN TOWNS WATRR SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 887-LSO)
MIJACS
This report presents the results of a performnce audit of the
Seven Towns Water Supply Proj et for which Credit 887-LSO of US$6.0 million to
the Kingdom of Lesotho vas approved oo March 20, 1979. Tho Credit Agreement
was signod on April 6, 1979, becae effective a yer ant a half later, on
October 30, 1980. The Closing Date was originally September 30, 1983. It was
*xtended to December 31, 1984, but final disbursement took place July 10,
1985.
The  Project   Performance Audit  Report  consists  of  a  Project
2erformance Audit Memorandum (PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) and a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by the Water
Supply and Urban Development Division of th Eastern and Southern Africa
Region.   ORD has reviewed the PCR, the Appraisal and President's Reports, end
the transcripts of the meeting of the Executive Directors when the credit was
approved,  Bank staff  familiar with the project have been interviewed to the
extent possible, and documents in the Bank Group file have ben r-eviewed.
Further, arL O D mission visited Lesotho in February 1987, inspected four of
the seven constructed facilities, and had discussions with the higher officers
of the Water and Sewerage Branch (W33) of the Ministry of Water, Energy and
Mining  (MINWEM),  and  other  Government - officers   involved   «n project
implementation end administration.
The PPAM generally agrees with the findings of the PCR. Howover,
the   PPAM   provides   Supplementary   Coments   on   project  achievements,
institutional improvemont, including manpower development and training, and
public health education.
Following standard ORD procedures, copies of the PPAR were sent to
the Borrower for their coments. These coments have been reproduced as
Attachments A and 3 to the report.

PROJECT PEUPORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
LISOTHO: SEVEN TOWNS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(MCDIT 887-LSO)
Z                            g~~~~~~~~~VALUATION 8SOMARI
- X~NTRODUCTION
I.        The  DA  Credit  of US$6.0 million  to the Kingdom of Lesotho was
approved by the Bank on March  20, 1979.   It was IDA's  first credit  to the
KinSdom of Lesotho in the water supply sector.
1i.       The project  originated from various studies, the two most Important
of which, includeds (1)  surveys  and  outline  plar  of extension  of water
supplies for 11 towns, which were carried out in 1971 and were financed by
UNDP, with tho lank acting as  executing  agency   and  (2)  the  1974 Federal
Republic of Germany's financed pre-investment studies for water supplies for
13 towns. In 1977, KfW appraised a project which included only 6 of the 13
towns.    In  early  1978, the  Governaent requested the Bank's assistance in
financing improvements in the remaining seven towns. The project was prepared
by th   Government with  assistance by consultants, and appraised in the flcd
by an IDA aission in May 1978.
The Proiect and Its Oblectives
iii.      The project was designed to provide water supply to about 20,000 new
consumers, most of whom were to be among the poorer segment of the towns'
population. It also aimed at improving services to 21,000 current consumers
through control of vater quality, and enhanced access through provision for
additional public stndpipes. Project's objectives included also the strong-
thenig of WSB, the sector entity, through the provision of consultants for
the design of a  commercial accounting  system, including  a tariff  study and
proposals for a phased introduction of tariff changes.
iv.       The Development  Credit Agreement was signed  on April 6, 1979, and
the original date of  effectiveness was  July 5,  1979.   Due to  the delay in
filling the positions of a Chief Executive Engineer and a Financial Con-
troller, the Credit became effective only on October 30, 1980.
Implementation Experience
v.        In addition to a slow start-up, project Implementation was hindered
by the Inaccuracies of WSB's consultants' pre-investment studies, preliminary
designs and cost estimates upon which the project was appraised in May 18,
1978.   There was  a 300S  cost escalation when new cost estimates were worked
out AA August/September 1980.    As  a  result,  the  Gov-rnment  Informed the
Association of its decision to reduce substantially the scope of the project.
The revised project included new water supply schemes for two of the seven
towns (Leribe and Teyateyaneng), but only *xtensioalrehabilitation works were



to bo carrdod out in the remaining five towns (Mafeteng, Hohale's Hoek,
Mokhotlong, Quthing and Roma).
vi.       Following IDA's formal approval of the revised project, construction.
works for th schemes in Leribe and Teyateyaneng began in January 1982, i.e.-
two years later than originally contemplated.   VSB*s  engineering consultants
prepared  detailed  engineering  designs  and bid documents and were entrusted
with the responsibility for the supervilsion of construction works for the two
schemos. In spite of late start-up, constructlon work ws" completed in August
1983, ahead of the contract completion tim  (PCR, para. 3.06).
vii.      Detailed enginering design for the five rehabilitation schemes were
prepared  by WSB,  and  construction works  which were carried out by force
account began in the middle of 1982. Progress made at the beginning proved to
be satisfactory, but slowed down considerably, after the installation of the
schemes' networks. Construction work in Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek and Quthing
were completed in December 1984, a little more than a year later than the
original closing date of September 1983. Due to the remoteness of the town of
Hokhotlong, and to WSB1's inability to carry out construction work in all five
ocowuns at the same time, the completion of the schemc in Mokhotlong was
achieved in July 1985.
Results
Viii.     The physical  objectives of  the originally designed schemes for the
towns of Leribe and Teyateyaneng were achieved on time, and within the revised
cost estimates (PCR, para. 7.01). However, at the time of the audit mission
in Lesotho in February 1987, the well pdint of the Teyateyaneng-scheme was out
of service, and two of the adjoining intake pumps were damaged, and apparent-
ly, beyond repair (PPAM, para. 22).
iX.       The construction objectives of the revised projoct for the remaining
five towns were accomplished. The revised project for these towns amounted to
extension of the systems' networks and rehabilitation of the sources of
supplies" intakes, and existing treatment facilities. The implemented schemes
contributed to improving water quality, and brought water closer to the
consumers, thus reducing the number of people who depended on unsafe water
supply (PCR, para. 7.01).
x.        Institutional objectives were partially  achieved.    Although WSB's
managerial efficiency, along with the billing and collection operations
improved substantially and accounted for a reduction of the Agoncy's operating
deficit from M. 1.4 million in  1981 to M. 0.27 million in 1984 (PCR, para.
7.02), the commercial accounting system, which proved to be incompatible with
the government's own accounting system, was not implemented.
xi.       Similarly,  financial  objectives  fell  short of expectations for a
variety of reasons, the most important of which include: understaffing of
WSB's accounting department; unsuitability of WSB's non-commercial accounting
pystem, whereby, for instance, WSB prepares payment vouchers, but the respons-
ibility to pay and record expenditures, rests with other government agencies;
likewise, while WSB prepares the bills for water and sewerage services, other
government departments are in charge of revenues collection. The inaccuracies
of data which these agencies generate, allied to the unduly delayed production



vl
of such data, defeat any attempt to reconecle WS'r3s *counts with those of
other government agencies.   It is  unlikely that  the situation  will improve
unless WS3  is empowered  to develop  and Implement a eoprehensive coumrcial
accounting system, and to exerese full control over tho system's components.
xii.      Paragraph 6.04 of the PCR states that considerable progress ha been
made in training local personnel, with an avorage of 8 man-years training per
annum being provided. However, project files failed to provide any meaningful
liformation on training neted, and the pertinence and suitability of training
progrms. The audit's review of proj3et  documentation confirm   that the Bank
under this project generally limited its role to calling attention to the
Importance of these components In the appraisal report.
Sustainability
xiii.     The major institutional and financial probl es revealed at appraisal
have  not  been  fully  resolved.    For benefits to be enhne-td and sustained
through follow-on projects, the Government votld need to develop a national
long-term water supply pricing policy. In addition, the Government would need
to confer sufficient autonomy and authority to WSB to achieve financial
viability, i.e. to generate, over a period of yesa, rovenues sufficient to
cover operating expenses, depreciation and a  reasonable return  on the  ssets
used for WSB's services.
Findings and Lessons
xiv.      The  initial project was  appraised on the basis of pre-investment
studies carried out by consultants, with assistance from kfW who financed the
preparation ofs (a) long-range 15 to 20 ytars plans for water systems develop-
mant, and (b) engineering and feasibility studies, considering first phase (5
to 10 years) development for the project towns. Operational, financial,
accounting, managerial and other institutional matters were also to be
investigated (SAR, para. 3.01).   In  July 1980,  it was established that the
preliminary studies contained substantial inaccuracies, particularly, with
regards to  cost estimates.   New  estimates were prepared in August/September
1980, showed a cost escalation amounting to about 3002 (PCR, para. 3.02).
xv.       The oxtension/rehabilit-tion works carried  out by  force account in
five of the project towns were a successful operation.
xvi.      Overall, the  project proved  to be a useful learning experience for
WSB. It was successful in terms of construction activities.   This, however,
must b- viewed in the context of a project whose scope wos substantially
reduced. Institutional development objectives were only partially achieved.
More importantly, it is unlikely that WSB will recover from its financial
difficulties any time in the near future without being granted adequate opera-
tional autonomy.

1.        Located clo - to the Southerly extremity  of the  African continent,
Lesotho, with an area of about 12,000 square silos, o completely surrounded
by the Rpublic of South Africa (RSA). At appraisal, Lesotho's population was
estimated  at  1.2  dillion,  growing  at  a rate of 2.21 por annu. The urban
population of the capital city, Maseru, amounted to about 40,000 people. The
country is mountainous, and nearly 752 of it ranges from 6,000 to 11,000 feet
in ground surface elevation, and only about 132 of the country's lend  area is
suitable for crop cultivation. Soil erosion Is extesive, representing one of
Lesotho's major environmental problem.
2.        Poor  health  and  sanitary  conditions  allitd   to  poor hygienic
practices, account for substantial incidence of vater-borne diseases such as,
diarrhea, typhoid, hepatitis, infectious skin and eye diseases.
3.        The country's  economy is  dominastd by  subsistence agriculture and
livestock rearing and constitute the main economic activities for ibout 902 of
the resident population.  It Is also characterized by a critical dependence on
South Africa. In the early 70Ws, about 165,000 Basotho workers, I.A., about
half of the country's male labor force, were estimated to be employed in South
Africa, as  migrant orkers.   Between  1970 and  1977, due  to rapidly rising
wages, the number of Basotho workers In the mines was estimated to have
inareased by 40,000, and remittances of migrant workers accounted for over 50
percent of GNP. Lesotho is a member of the lend Monetary area and over 602 of
the Goverament's revenues are derived from receipts from duttes and taxes
collected by the Southern Africa Customers Union (SACU) on behalf of the
member countries. Industrial developmnt is limited by the small size of the
dom-estic market, lack of raw materials and resources (other than water), the
proximity  to   highly  industrialized  South  Africa,  and  the  shortage  of
entrepreneurial, managerial and technical manpower.   In its  Second National
Dovelpment  Plan  (1975/76-1979180,  the  Government  proposed  to expand the
country's  industrial  base  through   strengthening   the   Lesotho  National
Development Corporation.
4.        Lesotho's water  resources are  substantial, amounting to an average
annual total of some 4,500 million =3, of which surface water represents over
99S.   Surface sources  are commonly used for urban water supplies, but due to
their high turbidity, and fecal contamination, they require treatment.
Springs and boreholes are the main sources of supply in the rural areas. There
are no economically feasible proposals for the local exploitation of Lesotho's
abundant water resources of which less than 1% is currently utilized. In



order to obtain benefltr  from  hat  Is, in  fact, Lesotho's  only significant
natural resource plans have recently been drawn up to export water. IDA
Credit No. 1747 was approved on December 11, 1986 for SDR $8.0 uillion to help
finance engineering design work for the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. This_
project, In its ultimate phase, will deliver up to 70 m3Isec of water to the
Republic of South Africa. The resulting royalties will About double Lesotho's
GDP.
5.        At the time of project appraisal, about 132  of the  country's rural
population and 63S of the urban population had access to safe watcr. In
Mareru, approximtely 652 of the population wa  served by piped water supply.
Government Developmont Plan covering the period 1980-1990, projected the
provision of safe water to 1002 of urban population and 602 of rural
population.
6.        The   provision of water supply In urban areas is the responsibility
of the Water and Sewerage Branch (WSB) of the Ministry of Water, Energy and
Mining (MINWEM).  In  rural villages,  the same responsibility rests with the
Villago Water Supply  Sectic  (VWSS)  of the  Ministry of  Agriculture (MOA)
Urban and Rural sanitation/wsto disposal are the responsibilities of the
Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Health respectively.
B. The Proiect and Its Ob1ectives
7.        The project covered seven towns, and its main objectives were to (i)
provide public water service to 20,000 new consumers who, in the past, relied
on unprotected sourcs; and (ii) improve the reliability and quality of water
supplied to some 21,000 existing customers.  In addition, the ptoject provided
for the strengthening of WSB, the executing *gency for the project. Project
components  includeds    (i)  construction  of  new water supply systems; (ii)
Improvement and extension of existing systems; (iII) provision of equipment,
vehicles, spare parts; (lv) strengthening the managerial capabilities of WSB
through the design and implementation of a commercial accounting system and a
tariff structure; and (v) consulting engineering services for pre-investment
studies for future  extensions  of  the water  supply  systems  in  tha seven
selected towns.
8.        In order to improve public health in the project area, and to foster
the practice of personal and community hygieno, the appraisal mission
emphasized the need for a complementary public health education program,
together with the construction and operation of the water supply schemes.
Although the project did not provide funds for the program, it was agreed, at
appraisal, that GOL will keep IDA informed of the steps taken to improve
public health education and to take the Association's views into consideration
regarding such steps.
C. Prolect Revision and Implementation
9.,       The date of the credit offectiveness was extended from July  5, 1979
to October 30, 1980 due to the delay in the recruitment of the Chief Executive
Engineer and the Financial Controller, thus causing an initial delay in the
start of  the project  implementation.   More importantly, however, in 1981, a



3
project revision became necessary when it became clear that, the cost of the
project as designed was likely to come out at about four times the estimated
amount set forth in the SAR and that the Government would not be in a position
to mobilize  the additional  funds required.   The  main reasons  for the cost
increases weres (i) poor preliminary design; (Ui) underestimation of unit
construction costs; (iiI) contractors premium for small, remote jobs and (iv)
underestimation of price contingencies.    (For  detailed  analysis,  see PCR,
Annex 3). This revision further contributed to delaying the start of construc-
tion In Leribe and Tey-t-yaneng to January 1982, i.e. two years behind
schedule.
10.       The scope  of the revised project included the construction of water
supply system in two of the seven towns, and only rehabilitation works for
the systems in the remaining five, thus implying levels of service in these
five locations lower than in the other two; the technical assistance component
of the original project remained unchanged. There was no need for additional
financing, since the revised cost estimates for the reduced project were about
the same as those estimated at appraisal.
11.       Following the  scaling down  of the  project, and IDA's agreement to
the revised project proposal in early 1982, WSB assumed responsibility to
prepare final engineering designs for the five towns in which extension/
rehabilitation works were to be carried out. Considerable further implementa-
tion delay was experienced for a variety of reasons, including the replacement
of the Project Engineer and the site engineers, and frequent breakdowns of
vehicles and other mechanized equipment. All schemes, but one, were finally
completed in December, 1984.   The  Mokhotlong  scheme  was  completed  a year
later.
D. Pro lect Costs and Procurement
12.       At  appraisal,  the  total  project  costs were estimated at US$6.96
million, and the estimated total costs of the much reduced revised project
were US$6.89  million.   Actual costs amounted to US$5.79 million, hence a 16Z
cost under-run with respect to the 1981 revised estimate which were due to:
(a) savings  on the water schemes in Leribe and Teyateyaneng; (b; deletion of
the tariff studies, and (c) exchange rate fluctuations.
13.       Estimated eost of the revised project and the actual cost on comple-
tion are sumnarized in the PCR (para. 3.17) as follows:

exchange rate prevailing In January 1982, namely US$1.00 - Maloti 0.952.
The actual cost are based on disbursement records (varying exchange
rates).
bI Including contingencies.
14.       Disbursements lagged behind the  projected  disbursement  profile by
about three years in line with the implementation delays. Nevertheless, due
to the significant reduction of the project scope the IDA ciedit of US$6 .0
million proved to be adequate to cover actual foreign exciange costs and the
enhanced  proportion  of  local  expenditures.    In  fact,  US$947,882.47 was
cancelled on July 10, 1985.
j. Performance of Consultants and Contractors
15.       Initially,  the  engineering  consultants performed poorly, as their
preinveJtment studies contained substantial miscalculations and inaccuracies.
Nevertheless, after the revision of the project, their services were retained
to prepare final engineering designs and bid documents, and to supervise the
construction works in Lerib- and Teyateyaneng.
16.       Accounting consultants  designed a commercial accounting system, and
their performance is rated satisfactory  in  the  PCR.    The  audit  will not
quarrel with this rating, but has difficulty in expressing full concurrence,
since the accounting system proposed was implemented only to a limited degree
because it was largely incompatible with the government's accounting system.
17.       The performance of the civil worka contractor w"  satisfactory.
F.- Performance of the Implementint Atency
i8.       Despite  delays  in  the  execution  of the expansion/rehabilitation
works, WSB's performance in the preparation of detailed engineering designs



5
*nd th implementation of these works was satisfactory. Similarly, although
project progress reporting did not com up to expectation during the initial
yesrs of project implementation, the situation greatly improved from mid-1983.
Institutional Performance
19.       At appraisal, WSJ vas headed by a Chief Water and Sewerage Engineer,
who had limited authority end responsibility over personnel and accounting
matters. Staff recruitment, compensation, transfers, and dismissals were
mainly handled through the Personnel Department of the Ministry of Works,
which followed unifors government personnel practice.   Accounting  staff were
employees of the Ministry of Finance, who followed government accounting
practices, which were inappropriate for effective commercial management.  WSB
functioned, therefore, as a branch of the Ministry of Works, and not as a
public utility,  though one  of the   objectives  of the  AfD? operation, with
which IDA concurred - was to have WSB become a utility. However, during
project implementation, WSB improved its organizational structure to includte,
in addition to a Chief Engineer and a Financial Controller, one officer each
in charge of administration and manpower training and it functions efficiently
in areas over which it has direct control.
Financial Performance
20.       In  accordance with  the  stipulations  of  the  Development Credit
Ag=eement, WSB was required, Inter alias (i) to establish for its services,
annual financial performance standards based on the outcome of a tariff study,
provided for by the project, including the requirement to produce revenues
sufficient to cover all operating expenses, and to generate a reasonable rate
of return on its assets; and (ii) to introduce a comercial accounting system
based on the recommendations of the accounting consultants. Eventually, the
tariff study was deleted from the IDA-supported project, and incorporated in
the loan agreement signed between the African Development Fund (AfDF) and the
Government. This agreement required that WSB should be transformed into a
public utility corporation within two years after the loan signature. The
commercial accounting system designed by consultants, was implemeuted  only in
are"s where WSB exercised direct control, such as, billing and collection,
stores control and, to  a  limited  extent,  financial administration.  The
reasons for not Implementing the commercial accounting system in full are
detailed in paragraph 5.01  of the  PCR.    Financial  results  are  given in
paragraphs 5.02, 5.03, 5.04 and 5.05 of the PCR which shows that WSB's
revenues did not cover its overall operating cost. The situation was of course
even worse in the small town operations (PCR, para. 5.10), a result that was
qualitatively expected at appraisal but not to the quantitative extent it
actually occ4rred.
G. Bank Performance
21.       It is  evident that  the consultants who carried out the engineering
studies on which IDA based its project appraisal were definitely unfamiliar
with the local economic environment. Indeed, although between 1976 and 1979
there were marked increases in baseline costs in Lesotho, it is difficult to



6
explain the magnitude of the discrepancies that appeared within three years of
the appraisal *stimat- (PCR, para. 3.02) without assuming that they used
thoroughly erroneous information. Further, It seems that IDA relied too much
on the consultants, though its staff could have been expected to have a
judgment of its own, as the Association had been involved in the water supply
sector of Lesotho since 1971, when it acted as executing *gency for UNDP (PCR,
para. 1.09).  Obviously, IDA only become aware of a problem during the second
half of 1979, when it reacted by requesting the consultants to prepare a fully
updated cost estimate that reflected delays in the project timetable and
design changes. IDA's request wv only met in August 1980.
22.       In order to overcome the situation  created by  the existence  of an
ineffective accounting system at WSB at the time of appraisal, the IDA credit
provided financing for consultant services for the design of a commercial
accounting systm.  This  was accomplished  satisfactorily, but the system as
designed, proved to  be  incompatible with  the  government's  own accounting
system,  and,  therefore,  w"s  not  implemented  in  full.   As no compromise
solution could be found, the issue was left to be tackled at a later stage, by
an AfDF financed project, the primary objective of which, is to transform WSB
into an autonomous public utility corporation. While the introduction of a
commercial accounting system, by itself, was a desirable objective, Bank staff
should have recognized that, given WSB's position as a government department,
it was unrealistic to expect such a system to operate effectively within the
larger government cash accounting system.
23.       The Bank's appraisal mission should be commended for  calling atten-
tion to the importance of public health education, taking into accourt the
rural and other socio-cultural characteristics of tho project -area. However,
there were no IDA funds available to carry out public health education
activities; Instead, the appraisal mission emphasized the need for GOL to take
appropriate steps through other activities, such as those of a USAID supported
rural development project which was to include an important health education
component. While this project has been delayed, the GOL in 1983/84 formulated
a comprehensive water supply/sanitation "sectoral Action Plan" with the
assistance of WHO which includes an extensive "community Hygiene Project'.
Bank staff had contributed to the review of the Action Plan.
24.       Similarly, the Bank's  role  in  respect  of  training was limited,
although the lack of trained manpower, at both the professional and technical
levels, was recognized to be, at appraisal, an issue, which, if not dealt
with, could threaten the sustainability of the project's expected benefits.
Paragraph 6.04 of the PCR asserts that considerable progress has been made in
training local personnel, and the success of the training effort is expressed
in terms of an average of 8 man/years training per annum. The project's files
fail to provide information on training needs and programs, the pertinence and
relevance of the latter, nor do they indicate whether the training activities
were carried out locally in accordance with a comprehensive training plan.
The audit's review of the project's documentation suggests that the Bank's
role was limited to calling attention to the importance of training in the
dppraisal report.   Paragraph  6.05  of  the  PCR  indicates  that  a Manpower
Development Study for the water and sanitation sector was carried out outside
of the project scope and was completed in 1984. Bank involvement was limited



7
to the Informal review of the study which contained us-ful reco endations and
provisions, in particular a manpower suecession plan* for the intended
wlocalisationu of WSB positions.
B. Supplementary Comients
Osr*tion
25.       The audit agrees with the findinag  and conclusions of the PCR (para.
8.01)  in respect of project achievemnts.  Bwever, at the time  of the audit
mission in February 1987, the well point of the Toyatayanang water supply
schem* was out of service, and two of the adjoining Intake pumps were damaged,
apparently, beyond repair indicating possible serious saintenance pioblems.
Temporary arrangements have been usde to pimp raw water directly to the treat-
ment facilities to ensure the continuity of supply to the population and new
sources of supply are being investigated.    Other  system   supported  by the
project are reported to function satisfactorily.
Institutional Financial Achievements
26.       Initially, project  success was predicated upon adequate *ngineering
construction works to meet consumer's needs, as well as upon instituti nal and
financial improvements. Accordingly, provilson was made for consulting servi-
c-s for the design and implementation of a commercial accounting system, and
for a tariff study to recomend a water supply and sewerage pricing policy,
and make proposals for a phased introduction of tariff changes (SAR, para.
3.09 and  3.10).   The report  of the  accounting consultants was completed in
1981.
27.       Similarly, the initial project included a component for the prepara-
tion of preinvestment studies for further extension of the water supply
schemes in each of the seven towns (SAR, para. 3.11 and PCR, para. 4.04).
This  activity was  deleted  to  become part of the AfDb's project which was
appraised in October 1982 (PCR, para. 4.04). AIDE required, as a condition of
the project, that WSB be transformed into a Publie Utility Corporation. IDA
supported this proposal and recomend*d that the proposod  tariff study should
be  carried   out  and   as part   of  the  broader  *transformation' study.
Accordingly, the tariff study was deleted from the IDA project and was incor-
porated in the AfDB project but under separate EEC financing. The transfor-
mationmation study, under terms of refearnce prepared by an IDA financed
consultant, was completed in May 1986.
Training
28.       At appraisal,  training was  recognized to  be an activity deserving
attention. The appraisal report identified local training institutions in
which training could be undertaken; It also emphasized the need for a detailed
identification of the skills required to carry out WSB's functions, an assess-
mant  of when  they will  be  required,  including the identification of the
sources and  amount of  funds to  implement a  training program.   The project
budget did not include a training component and a training program was to be



a
implemented by bilateral assistance and providing an average of 8 rn-years
training per annum (PCR, par&. 6.04).
Public Health Education
29.       The appraisal report asserted that the effectiveness of the improved
water supply schemes in raising the public health level In the project towns
Is also dependent upon other factors, such as, th. level of personal hygsine
practiced at comanity and household levels (SAR, par&. 4.01), indicating
further that Improvement in the area should be brought about by other organi-
sations and programs, which arte mainly concerned with public health and other
aspoets of consnity development. The audit found no evidence that eo-ordina-
tion with such organizations on programs did take place during project implem-
entation.
I   Conclusions
30.       The audit concurs with the conclusions  of  the  PCR  to  the effect
thats    (i)  the  project was  poorly  prepared  by consultants, and project
appraisal was based on studies which wert later proved to contain substantial
Inaccuracies; (ii) the preparation of detailed engineering designs for the
five towns rehabilitation schemes was carried out satisfactorily by WSB, and
the  iplementation of  the  schemes  through force accounts was a successful
oporation; (iiI) WSB's Institutional and  financial performance  at WSB was
constrained by its lack of autonomy, and the inappropriateness of the
conmercial accounting system, which  conflicted with  the    government's own
accounting  system;  (iv)  improved management  at WSB  contributed  to  the
reduction of operational deficits; (v) financial viability is not likely to be
achieved as long as WSB continues to operate as a non-commercial entity under
the Ministry of Water, Energy and Mining without managerial and financial
autonomy.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I * NTRODUCTION
Country Bac!%round
1.01      Lesotho, with an area of 30,344 sq. ke, is situated close to the
southern extremity of Africa and is entirely surrounded by the Republic of
South Africa (RSA), with which It sust co-exist, notwithstanding
ideological diffferences. The country is dominated by the highest part of
the great plateau of southern Africa and nearly 752 of the elevation ranges
from 1,800 to 3,300 m above sea level. Lowlande, situated in the west and
southwest, are associated with the three principal southwest flowing
rivers, namely the Mohokare (Caledon in RSA), the Makhaleng, and the Sengu
(Orange in RSA).
1.02      The climate, despite the sub-tropical latitude (about 300 south),
is moderate due to Lesotho's nigh elevation.  The topography strongly
influences the distribution of rainfall which amounts to 8nO mm per year
in the western part of the country and up to 1,200 mm in the highlands.
Frequent heavy downpours create serious soil erosion, one of Lesotho's
major environmental problems.
1.03      About 132 of the land in Lesotho is suitable for crop farming,
but only 0.4S has high potential. Due to the climate and poor land quality
crop production is a high risk occupation. Livestock raising is the
country's principal agricultural activity, but overstocking and inadequate
herd management have led to overgrazing, widespread soil erosion and
limited production. However, agriculture is still an important sector of
the domestic economy, providing employment and contributing partially to
the income of up to 702 of the population of 1.4 million.
1.04      The most significant characteristic of Lesotho's economy is its
heavy dependence on South Africa where more than 95 percent of its imports
originate, as do all of its electricity and most of its foreign investment
and tourists. Over 60% of the male labor force is employed in South Africa
(mainly in mining). Remittances of migrant workers constitute over 50
percent of Lesotho's GNP, and over 60 percent of Government revenues are
derived from receipts from taxes and duties collected by the Southern
Africa Customs Union (SACU) on behalf of the member countries. I/
Development of a modern industrial sector is limited by the small size of
the domestic market, lack of raw materials, the proximity of the highly
industrialized South African economy, and a shortage of skilled
1/   South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland.



12
entrepreneurial, managerial and technical manpower. Consequently,
manufacturing contributes little more than six percent of value added in
the economy.
1.05      Despite constraints to Its development, Lesotho's economy grew
rapidly in the 1970's. Real GNP rose by *bout seven percent per annum
during the mid-to-late 1970s, and as a result of increasing employment and
wages for Basotho In South Africa, real GNP expanded by about nine percent
per annum. The gains in domestic output were the result primarily of large
increases in public investment and In the provision of government
services. The project, aimed at improving the water supply facilities and
service levels in the major population centers, was also conceived in this
period.
Project Background
1.06      Lesotho's water resources are substantial, although availability
is constrained significantly by location and season. The total annual
resource has been estimated to be 5,500 million s3, of which surface water
represents over 99%. However, due to more extended durations of flows and
generally better and more uniform water quality, springs and boreholes are
widely used in Lesotho to meet domestic water demands in rural areas. Due
to high turbidity, suspended solid concentration and pollution in the more
densely populated areas, surface sources normally used only for urban
supplies involving relatively large quantities, and for which water
treatment is provided.
1.07      Little use (less than 1%) is made of the total water resource in
Lesotho, due to the country's limited potential for agriculture, industry
and energy consumption. Allowing for increased water consumption resulting
from normal population growth and additional use for industry and
irrigation, available water resources far exceed future requirements.
Agreement has recently been reached between Lesotho and RSA on exporting a
portion of Lesotho's surplus water resource (approximately 2,200 million
m3/year) to RSA. 2/
1.08      GOM's water-sector objectives and development strategy, as
reflected by the first and second five-year development plans
(1970/71-1974/75 and 1975/76-1979/80, respectively), included surveying the
country's water resources and projecting future water needs. Although
there were no stated objective as to levels of service or percentage of
population to be served by target dates, the plans provided for the
construction of water supply facilities to serve 13 major population
centers and about 200 villages during the plan period. The sector
expenditures represented about 6% of the total public investment, which
also included the extension and improvement of water supply and sewerage
works in the capital city of Maseru.
1.09      The Bank's involvement in the water supply sector dates back to
1971, when it acted as executing agency for UNDP, which financed the
2/   Lesotho Highlands Water Project.

preparation of water supply studies for 11 towns. Following these
preliminary studies, KfW agreed to finance more detailed pre-investment
studies which included (a) the preparation of long-range (15 to 20 years)
plans for water system developoment; and (b) engineering and feasibility
studies for 12 towns. 3/
GOL financed the studies for the 13th location, the university town of
Roma. The consultants' work was completed in 1977 and KfW appraised a
project in November 1977 that, due to limitation in funds, included only
six of the 13 towns. 4/  GOL requested the Bank's assistance in financing
isprovesents in the rieaining seven towns in March, 1978.
1.10      The  even towns project was appraised by the Rank in June, 1978
and later revised in January, 1982.  The work covered by the revised
project was about 90% completed by the revised Credit Closing Date of
December 31, 1984, but due to late submission of withdrawal requests the
last disbursement was made on July 10, 1985.
1.11      This Project Completion Report is based on information obtained
from the Appraisal Report (No. 2230-LSO), President's Report (No.
P-2461-a-LSO), supervision reports, a project completion report prepared by
WSB, Lesotho's Third and Fourth Five-Year Development Plans, International
Decade for Water Supply and Sanitation Development (IDWSSD) Position Paper-
of the National Steering Committee, and the WSB Transformation Study.
The Sector
1.12      At the time of the appraisal of the proJect, approximately 13% of
the rural population and 63% of the urban poulation had access to safe
water. In Maseru about 65% of the population was served by piped water
supply. The actual and planned coverage during the Third and Fourth
Development Plans are shown in more details in Annex 1.
1.13      There has been no basic change in the sector organization during
the project Implementation period. The creation of a new Ministry of
Water, Power and National Resources, in which water supply activities would
have been concentrated, did not take place as planned and the sector is
still handled by four ministries. However, at the start of the
International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, a National
Steering Committee was formed which substantially improved the planning and
coordination of sector activities both at policy and operational levels.
1*14      The sector is divided into four sub-sectors detailed below:
a)   The provision of water supplies for villages, utilizing
technical assistance and self-help labor, is undertaken by
the Village Water Supply Section (VWSS) of the Ministry of
Agriculture (MoA), previously under the Ministry of
Cooperatives and Rural Development (MCRD). The
3/   Butha-Buthe, Leribe, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek, Quacha's Nek, Outhing,
Teyateyaneng, Mapoteng, Morija and Peka.
4/   Butha-Buthe, Mapoteng, Maputsoe, Morija, Peka and Quacha's Nek.



14
Environmental Health Section (EHS) of the Ministry of Health
(MOH) continues, as part of its regular activities, to
encourage and assist the protection of springs where piped
supplies do not exist.
b)   The protection of public health and  anitary disposal of
solid wastes is the responsibility of the Environmental
Health Section of the MOH. 'IOH has recently undertaken a
three-year Pilot Rural Sanitation Project which has laid the
foundation for future district-based projects utilizing the
services of health assistants and village health workers, in
cooperation with MCRD.
c)   WSB administers the supply and distribution of drinking
wt-er in the urban district centers and to all urban areas
as defined in the Land Act of 1979.
d)   The Ministry of Interior (MOI) is responsible for waste
disposal in urban areas. It operates refuse collection and
bucket latrines emptying services in all district centers
(but not all the newly-gazetted urban areas).  MOI now has
an Urban Sanitation Improvement Team (USIT) which is
encouraging the installation of improved-types of pit
latrines and phasing out the bucket latrine system. MOI Is
also legally responsible for public waterborne sewerage,
where it exists, (at present, only in Maseru and Thaha
Tueka), but the day-to-day operation of these services has
always been delegated to WSB since that organization has the
appropriate technical staff.
II* PROJECT PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS
Origin
2.01      The project originated with a formal request from the Government
of Lesotho in March, 1978 for a development credit to help finance the
improvement and extension of water supply systems in seven towns and
strengthening of the administrative capabilities of WSB.
2.02      The project was identified from a number of preliminary studies
with some of which the Bank had close association. These studies included
surveys and outline plans of extension of water supplies for 11 towns in
1971 (pars. 1.09). The results of these studies Indicated that each of the
towns studied required extensive additions to existing water supplies.
However, the studies were only preliminary in nature and hence did not
provide sufficient details for project appraisal. Furthermore,
institutional needs were not investigated.
freparation and Justification
2.03      Project identification and preparation took place from 1974
through 1977 with the assistance of KfW which financed the preparation of
long-range development of water supply schemes in the secondary towns and
the feasibility and engineering studies for a first-phase (5 to 10 years)
development (see also para. 1.09).



15
2.04      The objectives of the project were to provide water supplies  to
about 20,000 new WSB consumers in seven towns by 1986 and to improve
service to 21,000 current consumers through better control of water quality
and enhanced access through provision of additional puiblic *tandpipes. The
project also included provision for strengthening a key-institution (WSB)
through the appointment of consultants to design and impleoent a
comereially-oriented accounting system and recotmend changes in the tariff
structure; and through appointment qualified and experienced Chief
Executive Officer (Director), Financial Controller and two additional water
supply engineers.
2.05      The project had many of the characteristics of a rural water
supply project due to the small size and nature of the project towns.
Common with slmilar projects, the economic rate of return (ERR) was
estimated to be negative, in spite of the planned improvement in the tariff
system, billing and collection and the gradual introduction of a
comercially-oriented accounting system.  As the ERR does not includes
health and amenity benefits, as well as consumers' surpluses, which are not
possible to quantify for projects of this nature, the project's
justification was based on non-financial benefits.
Project's Role in Long-Term Plan
2.06      The project had a significant role in the WSB's long-term plan
through:
a)   contributing to the institutional development to l'SB; and
b)   providing the technical base for further extensions of the
water supplies In the secondary towns as provided in the
Five-Year National Development Plans of Lesotho.
Project Description
2.07      The project as described in the Development Credit Agreement
included the following:
Part A:   Improvement and extension of existing water supply systems and/or
the construction and installation of new water systems, and
acquisition of equipment, vehicles and spare parts, to meet water
demands projected for 1986 in the towns of Leribe, Mafeteng,
Mohale's Hoek, Mokhotlong, Quthing, Roma and Teyateyaneng.
Part B:   Strenghtening the administrative capabilities of WSB through the
design and institution of a comRercial accounting system,
undertaking a tariff study for the water supply and sewerage
sectors including inter alia the tariff structure, as well as the
recommendations of methods to implement appropriate changes in
such structure and level, and the phased introduction of tariff
changes, all with the assistance of consultants and experts.



16
Part C:   Pre-investment studies for further extension of the water supply
systems in the towns listed in Part A:
2.08      A more detailed description of the project components was
included in the Staff Appraisal Report. This is presented in the revised
project (see para. 3.03 and Annex 2).
2.09      During the Implementation period, a major revision of the project
scope, especially Part A of the project, became necessary, due to project
cost escalation. The revision and its impact on the project as a whole are
discussed in the next chapter of this report.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Credit Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01      The Development Credit Agreement was signed on April 6, 1979.
The original date of effectiveness (July 5, 1979) was revised and the
Credit became effective on the revised date of October 30, 1980. The delay
was caused by difficulties in filling the posts of the director and the
financial controller.
3.02      Project appraisal was based on WSB's consultants' pre-investment
studies, preliminary designs and cost estimates.  These studies and reports
covered the water supply extensions in 13 towns, of which KfW agreed to
finance six and IDA the remaining seven (see paras. 1.09 and.2.03).  In the
period between the signing and effectiveness of the Development Credit
Agreement, the KfW loan had become effective and final designs and bid
documents for the KfW project were completed by the consultants. When bids
for the civil works contract for the KfW project were opened in July 1980,
the inadequacy of the project cost estimate became clear and new estimates
were prepared in August/September 1980 which had shown a cost escalation
amounting to about 300%. An account of the evaluation of project cost
estimates is given in Annex 3 to this report.
Revision
3.03      As a result of project cost escalation and the inability of the
Government of Lesotho to raise additional funds to meet the projected
increase in project costs, the Govertment was faced with the inevitable
decision to cut back drastically the,scope of the project. In January
1981, the Government informed IDA of its decision to reduce the project to
include the proposed water supply schemes for only two of the seven towns
(Leribe and Teyateyaneng), together with rehabilitation works for the
systems in the other five towns and the technical assistance that was
originaliy agreed upon. The revised estimated cosa of the curtailed
project was about the same as the estimated cost of the original project
,made at the time of the appraisal and therefore additional financing was
not required. IDA agreed in pricinple to the proposed restructure of the
project on May 8, 1981, but requested additional information the proposed
contract for the works at Leribe and Teyateyaneng and the rehabilitation
and improvements planned for the other towns.  By mid-January 1982, IDA
received the required information, which comprised:



17
a)   evaluation of tenders and a recommendation for award of
Contract No. I for construction of the Leribe and
Teyateyaneng project;
b)   details, Including estimated cost, for the work to be
carried out in the other five towns; and
c)   revised project cost estimates.
3.04      According to the proposal, original water supply objectives for
Leribe and Teyateyaneng would be met, although at a higher cost, and the
works proposed for the other towns would meet 1986 water demand, but with
lower standards of water supply service than originally planned. Detailed
description of the revised project is given in Annex 2, evolution of
project cost estimates in Annex 3, and the project cost estimates
(appraisal, revised and actual) in Annex 4.
3.05      The proposal was reviewed by IDA, .nd GOL was advised on January
19, 1982, that IDA formally approved the revision and no modification of
the Credit Agreement was considered necessary.  Subsequently, on January
19, 1983, at the request of GOL, Schedule I of the Development Credit
Agreement was modified to permit disbursement of credit funds against labor
costs incurred under works carried out by force account for the
rehabilitation of the water supply schemes in five towns.
Implementation Schedules
3.06      The slow project start-up, the recognition of the cost escalation
before the actual commmencement of the implementation and the consequent
revision of the physical project components had an adverse effect on the
timely implementation of the project. Construction of the full schemes for
Leribe and Teyateyaneng began only in January 1982, two years behind
schedule. Good progress was made throughout the entire construction period
and works in both towns were completed ahead of contract completion time,
by August 30, 1983.
3.07      Following the project revision, WSB started to work on the
detailed engineering designs, 'in house' for the five rehabilitation
schemes. Construction, which was carried out by force account, commenced
in the middle of 1982. Works at Roma started first but had to be
suspended at the end of the university recess. Works at Mafeteng, Mohale's
Hoek and Quthing were commenced simultaneously and progress was reasonable
in the beginning but slowed down considerably after completion of the
reticulation components. The reason for the delays were manifold: there
was a change of the project engineer in the early stages and thereafter the
site engineer had to be replaced twice. Another major problem was the
procurement of materials when numerous small articles had to be purchased
4roi the construction of the staffhouses.  Frequent break-downs of the
equipment and vehicles, however, contributed mostly to the much delayed
completion which was finally achieved in December, 1984.
3.08      At Mokhotlong, construction commenced in early 1984 and progress
was hampered from the beginning hy the fact that works were still



18
continuing In the other towns. Although the well organized direct labor
force of WSB produced good quality works, it was too small to handle
efficiently the works at all location at the same time. The remoteness of
this town was also a major factor in the problems that were experienced and
resulted in poor communication and transport facilities, as well as the
unavailability of most materials and spare parts. Therefore, the
anticipated completion of the project, which was set at July 1984, could
not be met and had to be extended for a full 12 months.
3.09      Due to the revision and change of the physical project
components, the Implementation schedule (bar chart) as shown in the SAR,
cannot be directly compared to the actual Implementation. Hovever, the
implementation schedule as provided in Annex 5 shows, besides the original
schedule, the actual implementation periods by location.
Procurement
3.10      The consultants were first retained by WSB in 1974 to prepare pre
investment studies for 13 secondary towns and later to prepare the detailed
engineering designs and bid documents. As a result of project revision,
however, detailed designs for the rehabilitation works in 5 towns (under
the IDA project), were prepared 'in house' by WSB. The consultants were
also retained for the construction supervision of the works under Contract
No. 1 (Water Supply for Leribe and Teyateyaneng). For the construction
supervision of tle rehabilitation works independent consultants (site
engineers) were retained by WSB.
3.11      Design and bid documents of Contract No. 1 (Leribe and
Teyateyaneng Water Supply Schemes) were completed in May 1981, and issued
to prospective bidders on May 20, 1981. The original date for bid opening
was July 28, 1981, but this was subsequently postponed to August 11, 1981
at the request of the bidders.
3.12      Although allowed in the conditions of the Credit Agreement, the
Borrower did not elect to grant a margin of preference to domestic
contractors. Eight addenda and one circular letter were issued during the
tender period. Most changes made by the addenda were to items in the
specifications and the bill of quantities.
3.13      Five firms took the tender documents and four submitted bids.
The Report on Tenders prepared by the consultants is dated August 31, 1981,
and was received by WSB on September 2, 1981. No tenderer submitted a
tender free of errors. However, these defects were not serious enough to
disqualify the tenderers. The evaluation of tenders and the recommendation
to award the contract to the firm with the lowest evaluated tender was
acceptable and the contract was awarded on January 21, 1982, for the sum of
M 4,471,000.
3.14      Works under contract No. 1 commenced in January 1982, and were
completed on schedule. No claims were made and final total cost was
M 4,270,863, 4% less than the contract sum.
3.15      The rehabilitation works in the five towns were carried out under
force account (see para. 3.07) by WSB's direct labor unit, established



19
specifically for this purpose. Schedule I of the Development Credit
Agreement was amnded to Include labor costs under works carried out by
force account (see para. 3.07). Ths rehabilitation works by the direct
labor unit were of satisfactory quality.
3.16      In accordance with Section 3.02 (a)(ii) of the Developmnt Credit
Agreesent accounting consultants were employed to review WSR's accounting
system and to prepare an accounting manual. The consultants began to work
In December 1980, and submitted their final report on August 3, 1981.
Their work also includ3d training of personnel of WSU's accounting
section.
Cost and Disbursement
3.17      Due to the inaccurate original cost estimate, enhanced by the
slow project start-up, the project ws revised in 1981 (see paras. 3.03,
3.04 and Annex 2). Detailed cost estimates of the revised project are
shown in Annex 4, and sumarised a  follows:

The actual costs in Maloti are well in line with the revised project
costs. The cost under-run in US dollars is due to savings on Contract No.
1, the deletion of the tariff study, and to exchange rate fluctuations
enhanced by larger ratio of local to foreign costs than originally
expected.
3.18      Cumulative disbursements are shown on the Basic Data Sheet
(p,(v).). US$4.44 million was disbursed from the Credit of US$6.0 million
by the revised Closing Date of December 31, 1984. WSB chose not to request
disbursement for some of the local expenditure amounting to about
US$740,000 equivalent.

The remaining amount of US$947,882.48 was cancelled on July 10, 1985.
3.20      The original SAR disbursement profile was 4 years, custom iade
for the project. This was justifiable considering the small size of the
project. However, due to initial delays in project start-up and the
revision of the physical project components as a result of
price-escalation, the length of disbursements was 5.5 years. 5/ After
commencement of physical implementation, the rate of disbursement was
satisfactory: the total credit was disbursed within two and a half years.
Operations
3.21      As it has been discussed under paras. 3.03 and 3.04, only the
Leribe and Teyateyaneng sub-projects were carried out as originally
planned. Both schemes were substantially completed on schedule (August 30,
1983), fully commissioned in early September 1983 and, apart from a few
minor mechanical problems, have operated satisfactorily.  Higher manganese
levels than expected have, however, been identified in the water. These
are being monitored by WSB to determine whether some form of manganese
removal would be necessary at a later stage.
3.22      The rehabilitation works for the other five sub-projects were
designed 'in house' by WSB, and reflected the proper application of
'appropriate technology'. The quality of the rehabilitation works were
outstanding and the rehabilitated plants have been operated on an
acceptable professional level.
5/   Implementation and actual disbursement commenced only in 1983 and the
last disbursement was made on July 10, 1985.



21
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.23      WSB's engineering consultants were originally retained to carry
out all enginvering required under the project.  The extensive revision of
the project became necessary partially due to the less than satisfactory
cost estimates and engineering in the early stages of the pre-investment
studies and detailed design. Although these were later corrected and the
consultants finalized the engineering designs and bid documents for Leribe
and Teyateyaneng, WSB decided to carry out the designs of the
rehabilitation works 'in house'. The consultants, however, were retained
for the construction supervision of the works in Leribe and Teyateyaneng.
3.24      Accounting consultants were appointed to design a comiercially
oriented accounting system for WSB and to provide training for the
personnel of WSB's accounting section. The consultants performance was
satisfactory, although for other reasons, their study and recommendations
did not have the desired impact (see para. 5.01).
3.25      The performance of the civil works contractor was entirely
satisfactory. All works were completed in good quality, on time and within
the contract price.
?erformance of the Borrower and the Implementing Agency
3.26      The Borrower is the Kingdom of Lesotho, and the Minister of
Finance has been designated as the Borrower's representative. The
executing agency for the project was WSB.                       :
3.27      Credit effectiveness (originally scheduled for July 5, 1979) was
revised due to delays in complying with the conditions of effectiveness
(see also para. 3.01). The Borrower's performance concerning the project
revision was satisfactory. WSB's performance in handling the design of the
rehabilitation works was outstanding and the physical implementation of the
project, though some delays occurred in the execution of the rehabilitation
works carried out by direct labor, was also generally satisfactory. The
financial and institutional performance of WSB is dealt with under Chapter
V and VI.
3.28      Project progress reporting in the initial stages was not fully
satisfactory, but it gradually improved during the implementation period.
Fully satisfactory and regular reporting was made from mid 1q83.
IV.   OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market
4.01      Water requirements (demand and production) for the sub-projects
are shown in Annex 2. Out of the total estimated population in 1986 (in
all 7 towns) of 41,000, the revised project provides water to about 20,000
new consumers. Average per capita consumption is about 100 to 120 litres
per day (including institutional consumption). However, service levels and
reliability of supply were reduced in the five rehabilitation schemes.



22
Project Role
4.02      Besides providing and/or improving safe water supply to most of
the population in seven secondary towns, the project was designed to assist
the Water and Sewerage Branch in strengthening its institutional and
financial management. The project also provided a base for further
pre-investment studies for the preparation of a follow-on project for
further extensions of the water supply systems in the seven towns.
Project Spin-off
4.03      As a result of the employment of a director and a financial
controller as stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement, WSB's
operational performance improved significantly. The direct labor unit,
established for tlhe implementation of the rehabilitation schemes, was well
organized.
4.04      The project included a component for the preparation of
pre-investment studies for further extension of the water supply schemes in
the project towns. As these studies were to be covered under an African
Development Fund (AfDF)-assisted project, appraised in October 1982, this
project component was deleted from the IDA-assisted project. AfDF
indicated that one of its conditions would be the transformation of WSB
into Public Utility Corporation. IDA supported the idea and, using a
Bank consultant, assisted WSB to draw up the terms of reference for the
transformation study. As the transformation study also included a tariff
study, this project component was deleted from the IDA-assisted project.
V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMNCE
Accounting System
5.01      Section 4.02 of the Development Credit Agreement provided for WSB
to introduce accounts on a commercial (accruals) basis, and to revalue its
assets by April 1, 1978. Although accounting consultants designed a system
in 1981 (see para. 3.16), no commercial accounts have been produced.
While understaffing of the accounts department of WSB at the senior and
supervisory levels has been a problem in producing commercial accounts,
there have been more fundamental problems, namely the set-up of WSB's
accounting within the government system. For example (i) WSB makes out
payment vouchers but thereafter other government accounting offices pay and
record expenditure; (ii) WSB does not own vehicles and equipment but hires
from government pool, and consequently, it has no control over either the
amount or the timeliness of the bills; and (iii) while WSB raises bills for
water and sewerage charges, various government offices and departments are
responsible for cash collection. In theory, it should be possible to
reconcile WSB's accounts with the other accounting sections of the
Government but this assumes that the other accounting sections are up to
date, accurate, reliable and interested. Unfortunately, they do not appear
to be. Consequently, reconciliation produces a plethora of unresolved
differences. Until full accounting control is given to WSB, even it is
still on the government cash system, production of commercial accounts will
be an unrewarding exercise out of proportion to expected benefits. The
financial controller, under these restricting circumstances, concentrated
his limited resources on improving WSB's revenue collection and stores
control (as they have been addressed in the accounting study). He has



23
produced annual accounts from the various sources of Government accounting,
to a reasonably high standard. Taking one year with another, they provide
a reasonable proxy for the results had the accounts been produced on an
accrual basis. A major deficiency of the accounts is the absence of a
meaningful assets and liabilities position.  An encouraging feature of the
accounts, as produced, is that Government and parastatals have a good
record of paying their water bills (by interaccount transfers).
Financial Results
5.02      As descrlbed in the previous paragraph, WSf has not operated as
an accounting entity but as a branch of the Ministry, Energy and Mines, and
accounting has remained on a cash basis. While there has been significant
improvement in controls over uncollected revenues or accounts receivable,
there is inadequate information on debtor, creditor or inventory levels.
Capital expenditures are brought together from various sources in the
government accounts and fixed asset ledgers and controls do not exist.
Production and consumption data is recognized by WSB's management as being
an approximation. The consumption data reflect the actually billed
consumption collected in the month or year - rather than the actual
consumption for the period.
5.03      In order to provide a picture of WSB's financial situation,
however, financial statements were prepared for the years comprising of the
project implementation period (see Annex 6). These financial comparisons
and projections are based primarily on the best inrformation ZISB has been
able to provide, but the quality of this information is limited by the
inadequacies of the records and the inexperience of WSB's personnel.
5.04      The Income Statement and Balance Sheet compare the actual results
and latest forecast with the original appraisal report for the years
1979-1986. A forecast for the years 1987-1990 has been prepared and is
also included. A comparative cash flow statement was omitted, as there was
insufficient data for its preparation for the years 1979-1983. The Income
Statement and Balance Sheet have been prepared on the same basis as the
appraisal report - namely as though WSB is functioning as an autonomous
entity.
5.05      A review of the data in the income statement indicates that over
the period 1982-1985, actual physical sale of water amounted to only 77% of
the forecast in the appraisal report (the appraisal report forecast sales
of 3,594 million gallon 6/ versus an actual sale of 2,783 million
6/   Imperial gallon.



214
gallons). There appear to be several reasons for this:
a)   Ul projects appear to have been completed about 2 years
behind the schedule In the Appraisal Report. The Seven
Towns project itself was scheduled for 89% comj._;ion by
March 1983 (see Appraisal Report, Annex 6), whereas actual
capital expenditures by that date amounted to 4.1 million
Maloti out of a total of 6.7 uillion Maloti - or 61X
completion.
b)   Physical sales billed and collected were at lower levels
than projected in the years up to 1981, due to deteriorating
collections of accounts. This situation was corrected by
the appointment of a director and a financial controller in
1981 who instituted a drive to improve collections.
c)   The result of the above was that the major increase in
physical sales (forecast in the Appraisal Report to occur in
1982) did not occur until 1984 in which year sales of 765
million gallons or 3,473,000 a3 were approximately equal to
the sale of 787 million gallons which the Appraisal Report
had forecast for 1982.
Tariffs
5.06      Section 3.02 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement required
that a tariff study should be prepared by June 30, 1980. Due to. (a) delays
of credit effectiveness (October 30, 1980); and (b) lack of reliable-
revenue and expenditure figures on which to base an estimate of the
covenanted tariff requirements, i.e. to modify the level and structures of
the water and sewerage tariffs to produce adequate revenues to cover at
least operating expenses (including provisions for maintenance and
depreciation), the tariff study was deferred to a later date. In May 1982,
it was agreed that it would be timely to appoint tariff consultants.
However, considering that the draft loan agreement between the African
Development Fund and GOL for the financing of the 'Four Centres Water
Supply Project required that within two years of loan signature WSB would
be transformed into a public corporate body with full judicial and
financial autonomy, it was agreed, inter alia, that the tariff study should
not be undertaken prematurely and in isolation but should be incorporated
in the transformation study, financed separately by EEC (see para. 4.04).
The transformation study was carried out in 1985/86 and the final report
was submitted by the consultants to WSB in May 1986. 7/
7/ -Almost one year after the IDA project completion mission in June
1985. Its conclusions about the inadequacy of the present tariffs are
well in line with the conclusions of the IDA project completion
mission. Some of their findings were being used in preparation of
this report.

5.07      Lesotho currently operates a pricing policy which seeks to
recover only operational costs directly from the consumer by way of water
and sewerage charges. Water Is charged on the basis of volume used. The
same tariffs are applied in the capital, Maseru, and all the other
secondary towns.  Sewerage is charged by  eans of fixed charges related ..o
the number of toilet units (points) within particular premises. The
following table shows the tariff rates.

a/   In December 1986 the tariff was increased to M 0.65 per a3 for
domestic consumers and M 0.75 per m3 for all non-domestic consumers.
(Source: Transformation Study).
While tariffs have generally increased at the rate envisaged in the
Appraisal Report, the combinatian of lower seles volumes and higher
operating expenses has meant that the tariff levels have been inadequate to
secure profitable operation (see paras. 5.08 and 5.09).
Expenses
5.08      1982 was the first year for which reasonably reliable expenses
(on a cash basis) were available. These were produced by the financial
controller who was also very familiar with the GOL's accounting system.
The total operating expense of M 2,009,000 for 1982 compares with the
Appraisal Report forecast of M 1,146,000 - i.e. the actual was 752 higher
than the Appraisal Report. It is apparent that lack of adequate data at
the time of its preparation resulted in the appraisal report grossly
underestimating the operating expenses for the WSB. Actual expenses were
higher in the categories of employment (due to substantial overmanning
which has not yet been corrected), transport (due to the rate structure of
the Government vehicle pool and significantly higher petrol prices) and
others, which includes significant cash expenditures on minor equipment
purchases which are expensed rather than capitalized. This pattern has
cpntinued through 1985.
Operating Earnings
5.09      As a consequence of the above, the WSB has never broken even at
the operational level - before depreciation and interest expense -
although, as the result of improved management, there was a significant



26
trend towards a reduction of losses from 1,435,000 Malotis in 1Q81 to
270,000 Malotia in 1984.
The Effect of the Secondary Towns Water Supply
5.10      There is a sajor strategic factor impacting on the financial
performnce of WSB (besides the overmanning issue) - namely, the economics
of water supply to the 13 small towns, of which this project is a pert. In
1984, the operating deficit of 270,000 Maloti wes distributed as follow.
000 Maloti tarnings (Deficit)
Maseru Water                             372
Maseru Sewerage                         (154)
Small TOwns                             (402)
New Connections                           29
(165)
Special Expenditures                    (105)
(270)
Merely to achieve cash break even at the operating level in the small towns
in 1984 would have required an overall 135.71 tariff increase for the small
towns which presently are charged the same tariff as Maseru. Thus the
expansion of water supply in the small towns will lead to an ever-worsening
financial contdition for WSB mnless the expansion is accompanied by an
explicit policy decision with respect to tariffs or Government
subsidiastion designed to deal with the above disparity between revenues
and expenses for small towns water supply. The need for such policy
decisions will be unavoidable if WSB is to function as an autonomous
entity.
Depreciation
5.11      Depreciation is not charged in the Government books.  The
provisions made in both the Appraisal Report and the 'actualr of the
Project Completion Report are therefore "notional", and are both based on a
depreciation rate of 2.52 applied to revalued assets in service. The lower
depreciation provision in the completion report is due to the previously
mentioned delay in bringing assets into service.
Interest Charged to Operations
5 12      Interest charged to operations represents the interest payable on
loans relating to assets once they have been placed in service. In 1985,
this amounted to 533,000 Maloti versus the appraisal forecast of 542,000
Maloti. Approximately 450,000 Maloti is related to the 'DA credit.
However, GOL is not actually charging any interest to WSB; therefore, the
interest shown is "notional". Thus, Govarnment is concealing from itself
the true extent of WSB's deficit. The uncollected interest represents a
hidden loss of revenue to Government.



27
Rate of Return
5.13      All towns served by the Seven Towns Water Supply project had
significant operating cash deficits (see follciing Table) in 1934 which
have increased in 1985. These deficits will continue unless tariffs are
adjusted significantly upwards i:n real terms. Therefore, while the capiTUl
investment data does not perit an indiviu-ual computation, it is quite
apparent that the economic and financial return on the Seven Towns Water
Supply Project is negative.

5.14      A negative rate of return was anticipated in the Appraisal Report
(see para. 4.05):
" The project has many of the characteristics of a rural water
supply project due to the small size and nature of the Project
towns. As indicated in para. 6.07, Project water consumers,
together with WSB consumers located elsewhere, would pay a tariff
based on the recovery of cash operating costs and debt service.
The internal financial rate of return ......would be negative
a/...
a/   Ranging from -4.7% in Mafeteng to 1.7% in Teyateyaneng.
VI.   INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Management and Organizational Effectiveness
6.01      WSB's organizational structure was modified since the appraisal
of the project. Proposals for the modifications were prepared by WSB's
management and were discussed and reviewed by the WSB's parent ministry and
by the Office of Management Service of the Cabinet (Personnel). The
recommendations have been implemented and the structure now represents a



28
'model' approach which, with minor changes also represents an appropriate
structure for use in a future public corporation. The transformation study
(completed in May, 1986) again reviewed the current structure in detail and
proposed a further up-date of the organization chart, with a future
transformation of WSB into a public corporation in mind.
6.02      The current organization structure has four members of staff
reporting to the General Manager - the chief engineer, the director of
administration, the financial controller and the manpower development
offices. The Inclusion of the manpower development office reflects the
current high priority attached to training.
6.03      WSB operates efficiently in those functions where management has
direct control. Administrative, maintenance and accounting functions are
less satisfactory, resulting from lack of autonomy either in respect of
the functions themselves, or in the ability to hire/fire employees and to
set conditions of service. The accounting system is separately commented
on in para. 5.01.
Manpower Development and Training
6.03      There is currently an imbalance in the distribution of manpower.
It is evident that a number of vacancies exist within the structure, the
filling of which is critical to improving efficiency. Besides the need to
fill the presently vacant post of the chief engineer and strengthening the
accounts department, serious shortfalls exist in sub-professional
(technical) levels.  A surplus of labor-exists in the semi-skilA:ed and
unskilled categories.
6.04      Considerable progress has been made in training local personnel,
with an average of 8 man-years training per annum being achieved. This
current level of training should be at least maintained and where possible,
accelerated, with priority given to operator and supervisor training.
6.05      A Manpower Development Study for the water and sanitation sector
was carried out outside of the project scope. This study, completed in
February, 1984, contains very useful recommendations, inter alia, a
manpower succession plan which is required for the intended localization of
WSB's staff.
VII.   PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01      The project was originally designed to extend and improve water
su?ply services in the seven project towns, providing safe water to some
20,000 new consumers and raising the reliability and service level for the
existing customers. It became obvious in 1982 that due to a price
escalation of about 300%, the project scope had to be drastically reduced.
As a result of the project revision, the original project scope was carried
out only in two towns and in the other five the works were reduced to some
extension of the reticulation systems and rehabilitation and upgrading of
the existing source works and treatment plants. However, the revised



29
project still considerably improved the quality of the water In the five
towns, and brought the water nearer to the customers, thus reducing the
number of population dependent on unsafe sources. The economic rate of
return on the project is negative, but it was justified on unquantiflable
secondary benefits. The physical components of the revised project were
implemented a designed, on time and within the revised cost estimate.
7.02      The planned institutional lmprovements were only partially
achieved. WSB's organixation was remodeled and the impact of the
appointment of a director and a financial controller on the operational
efficiency of WSB is undeniable. However, the isplementation of the
couercially-oriented accounting system was not achieved, due mainly to its
incompatibility with the government accounting system. However, the
financial administration considerably improved within the limits of the
existing system. Billing and ^ollection also improved and due to improved
sanagement the operating deficit was reduced during the implementation
period from M 1.44 million in 1981 to M 0.27 million in 1984.
7.03      Financial results, however, are below expectations.  Although the
tariffs have generally risen at the rate envisaged at the time of the
appraisal, the combination of implementation delays and conseuqently lower
sales volumes and higher operating expenses than foreseen prevented the
profitable operation of WSB. It is unlikely that this situation will
change fundamentally unless government changes its pricing policy. It must
be noted, however, that WSB's operations in Maseru produce positive
operating earnings.
Bank Performance
7.04      The project was the fir,'t Bank operation in the country's water
supply sector and as such was expected to be difficult. Some of the
difficulties were foreseen at appraisal and measures were taken, such as
the appointment of a director and a financial controller. However, WSB's
inexperience in implementation of similar projects in the country,
enhanced by external economic factors and inaccuracies in the
pre-investment studies led te a 300 percent cost-escalation which required
an extensive revision of tle original project. This experience indicates
that it is important that Bank staff be closely involved in project
preparation and be thoroughly familiar with country and sector
characteristics.
7.05      The project revision was carried out in a thorough and acceptable
manner. The institutional aspects of the project were not modified. It
should be noted, however, that the condition of introducing a commercial
accounting system was unrealistic.
7.06      The average interval of about 5+ months between supervision
missions was the minimum required to adequately follow-up the problem
issues WSB was and has been facing. The relationship between the Bank and
the executing agency was frank, but pleasant.



30
VIII.   CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project was not adequately prepared and the appraisal was
premature, which led to a major cost escalation and project revision, which
in turn caused a considerable delay in the Implesentation of the project.
The revised project was successful in achieving the physical targets. Due
to good management, the rehabilitation works by force account was a
successful operation.
8.02      The instltutional performance of VSB was acceptable, considering
the limits of autonomy within which 1S1 had to operate. The introduction
of the coercially oriented accounting system was not achieved (though
some of the recommendations in the accounting study like improved store
control, wer^ carried out well). Retrospectively, owe of the conditions,
specifically the Introduction of the comercial accounting which has been
incompatible with the government accounting systeu was not realistic.
Similarly, the condition of taking over the operation of the water supply
in Roma, which provides water almost exclusively, to the university was not
practical. It has been operated by and under the university's
administration and would have only aggravated W8B's manpower problems.
8.03      It is present Govarnment policy that it seeks to recover only
operation and maintenance costs of the water supply services. The tariff-
levels (increases) during the project cyle were not adequate to achieve
even this target, mainly due to the very high incremental cost of water in
the secondary towns. The same tariffs applied in Maseru and in the
secondary towns means a high level cross-subsidy. The strengthened
technical and financial coftrol due to improved management substantially
decreased the operational deficit.  WSB is comnited to work further towards
this goal, but the situation is not likely to substantially improve without
fundamental change in government pricing policy.

SEVEN TOWNS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CR 887-LSO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Description of the Physical Project Components
I.   General
1.01      As described in the Credit Agreement, the project included
lmprovement and extension of existing water systems and/or construction and
installation of new water systems, to meet water demands projected for 1986
in each of seven towns. The Staff Appraisal Report and the consultants'
reports describe those estimated water demands as being the "medium"
projections based in part on the assumption that the average population
.growth rates in each town between 1966 and 1976 (ranging from 2.2Z per year
to 5.3X per year) would continue until 1996 In the existing water service
areas In each town and in areas to which the water distribution systems
would be extended. It was assumed also that there would be a gradual
increase in the quality of domestic water service (and per capita
consumption) until by 1996, when only 101 of households would be served by
public standposts, 70% by on-plot taps outside the dwellings and 20% by
Inside taps. Allowances were made for increased water use for commerce and
Industry and by institutions (hospitals, schools and prisons).
1.02      Criteria used originally for functional design of the improved
water systems to meet the projected water demands for each town icluded the
following:
(i)   peak daily demand (maximm demand over a 24 hour period)
ranging from 1.8 to 2.0 times average daily demand;
(11)   peak hourly demand in distribution system equals 2.0 times
peak daily demand;
(iii) all new works to be compatible with most economic schemes to
meet projected demand in 1996;
(iv) water sources to be capable of meeting peak daily demand In

risk of failure - i.e., water use restrictions would be
acceptable in event of drought more severe than anticipated
in one year out of twenty;
(v) source works, treatment plants and pumoing stations to have
capacity equal to 1986 peak daily demand;

(vi) transmission and trunk mains to have capacity for 1996 peak
daily demand;
(vii)  distribution storage capacity to be equal to 24 hours
requirements on peak days In 1986; and
(viii)  public standposts in built-up areas to be within 150 a of
dwellings.
1.03      The sub-projects, as planned originally and as developed by the
consultants in the final designs, conform generally to acceptable economic
and engineering practice and are not extravagant. However, faced with high
costs and financial constraints, less expensive means of meeting short-term
water supply demands (through 1986) for five of the towns were needed.
1.04      The rehabilitation/improvement sub-projects in these towns were
revised to meet basic water supply needs projected for 1986, but the
quality of the service was lower than planned originally.  The expansion of
the water supply systems, both in delivery capacity and in area coverage,
was reduced, allowing more risk of periodic restrictions on water use
during dry periods, and lower distribution pressures during periods of peak
demand, and slowing down the pace of the conversion from public standpipes
to on-plot domestic water supplies.
1.05      The paragraphs which follow describe the major changes-'from the
original design of each sub-project and compare the expected water service
levels of the original and revised sub-projects.

2.02      The principal change in design for Mafeteng was modification of
the existing treatment works and transmission main rather than replacing
them and postponement of additions to treated water storage and of some
repairs to the Scot's Vlei Dam. An addition was the extension of thq
distribution system to two adjacent villages which accounts for the
Increase in population from the original plan as shown in the table above.
2.03      The average water availability for per capita domestic use - 35
lcd for the total population In the service area Is about 502 more than
,provided in 1976 and is about the same as the estimated use with outside
taps at each dwelling. Maximum production capacity is adequate to cover
peak daily requirements, but reliable dry weather yield would he only about
1.65 times average daily use, indicating that there could be water use
restrictions for as long as a month in dry years. Water available for
commercial and industrial use are adequate for projected 1986 requirements,
but requirements for institutions fall short of projected needs - a 652
increase from 1976 rather than the 8 fold increase that was forecast.

2.05      The proposed rehabilitation and improvement program for Hohale's
Hoek was limited to distribution extensions to two villages. There was no
extension of water production, treatment, transmission or distribution
storage capacities as planned originally.
2.06      The water supply system at Mohale's Hoek has now adequate
capacity to meet 1986 requirements during normal weather conditions
provided the distribution system is not overextended, the level of domestic
seivice is not raised significantly and no industrial demands are placed on
t'he system. Domestic demand averaging at least 40 lcd - considered
adequate for on-plot outside tap residential service in Lesotho - for the
total population in the service area could be met. Commercial water
requirements as projected for 1986 could be satisfied. Water available for
use at institutions, while low, would be twice the asount provided in
1976. The principal problem would be during dry periods occuring every 5

2.08      Changes between the original plan for Mokhotlong and the
rehabilitation works and improvements under the revised project is mainly
that the existing water treatment facility was rehabilitated and improved
but not expanded. Under normal conditions, the original projections of
average water demand for 1986 probably could not be met even in a normal
rainfall year because of the constraints in the treatment and transmission
facilities. Consequently, during the month of maximum demand there would
be daily periods of low pressure or service interruptions in some parts of
the distribution system.

2.10      Under the revised project of the Quthing water supply system, the
intake and treatment plant were repaired and remodeled to a lesser degree
than proposed originally; reliable capacity is about 300 m3/d. The
facilities proposed for transfer of water from the Sengu Rivet to the
Qomoqomong River during low flows were omitted. Existing distribution
storage was rehabilitated but no additions were made.
2.11      The revised scheme would meet the same water demands projected
for the average day in 1986 as was planned in the original project except
that water available for institutional use would be three times the 1976
*upply rather than five times. However, the new scheme probably would not
meet projected peak daily demands during the maximum month; at such times
water use would have to be restricted to about 75% of the demand. On the
other hand, Quthing appears to have less growth potential than indicated by
the demand projections. One shortcoming in the revised scheme is a lack of
attention to repair of tubewells required as standby sources to meet peak
demands under some circumstances.

2.13      The major components of the original plan for development of
Rosa's water supply aystem were a dam on the Ohobosheaneng River and a new
treatment plant. Plans for these works have been shelved indefinitely.
The revised scheme involved use of a nearby soil conservation reservoir to
supplement Roa 's surface water supply during dry periods, and the
rehabilitation of the existing treatment works.
2.14      The revised Roma sub-project is expected to satisfy average 1986
daily requirements of the university and of the population which uses the
same supply, but at a lower standard of service than the original
objective. Peak daily water demands in 1986 probably would not be met with
the revised scheme, requiring water restrictions to reduce peak demands by
about 20% during a period of about one month.

LESOTHO
SEVEN TOWNS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CR 887-LSO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evolution of Project Cost Estimates
1.        The first cost estimates appeared In two reports dated December
1977 and prepared by WSB's consultants. These estimates were based on
March 31, 1976 prices and the assumed 2 years construction period
1978-1980. According to admissions made later by the consultants, there
was in 1976 "very limited information available on construction costs for
this type of work outside of Maseru. This made it difficult to maintain a
comparative check on the estimated costs."
2.        During appraisal (May 1978) of the IDA financed Seven Towns Water
Supply Project, baseline costs as of March 1979 were established using the:
March 1976 estimates and inflation factors developed by the consultants
based on historic construction cost indices for the Southern Africa Customs
Union Area. The implementation timetable assumed that procurement and
construction activities would start mid-1979 and end mid-1982; The price
contingency factors were based on construction cost trends in
Southern Africa at that time and were higher than those shown in the
Central Projects guidelines for price contingency factors at the time the
IDA Credit was made.
3.        No further information on cost estimates for either the KfW or
IDA projects became available until late 1979. In a July 1980 report on
tenders for the Project financed by KfW, and in their letter of August 15,
1980 to WSB on the same subject, the consultants wrote that the estimates
for the KfW six towns project as given in the December 1977 reports had
been updated and submitted to WSB in October 1979. The updating took
account of inflation (construction period 1980-1982 rather than 1978-1980)
and "certain design changes" since 1976. About the same time, the XfW
financed consultants also did some work on new estimates for the IDA
financed Project. A Bank supervision mission in November 1979 reported
that the consultants had reviewed the designs for some of the towns covered
by the IDA project and had prepared an interim revised estimate of costs.
Following the mission, IDA wrote to the consultants requesting a fully
updated cost estimate that reflected delays in the project timetable and
design changes. This request was repeated in further correspondence, but
was not met until late August 1980, and then only partially. The reason
*              given for the delay was continued uncertainty about technical design.
4.        The report and correspondence of July and August 1980 relating to
the costs of KfW's 'Six Towns' Project made it clear that the October 1979
cost-revisions had not been of the type normally expected in advanced
stages of detailed design. In the July 1980 report, the consultants wrote,
"Following discussions with the Employer, an accurate estimate of cost of



ANNEX 3
42                           Page 2 of 3
the civil works was never prepared by the Engineer." Also, in the August
15th letter the consultants stated, "As you are aware, we did not do a
detailed estimate of the cost of the works based on the tender documents
and the full bill of quantities. This was with the agreement of KfW and in
the expectation that a sufficiently large number of tenders would be
received to ensure that several would be fully competitive and provide a
cross-check on tendered rates for the principal items.'
5.        Although the cost estimate revisions In October 1979 were not
thorough, they already indicated subatantial cost increases for both the
KfW and the IDA financed projects. For the KfW project, the estimated
increase in baseline costs since 1979 was about 302 at 1979 prices and
about 501 at 1980 prices.  Design for the IDA project was much less
advanced than for the KfW project, but the Interim estimates already showed
a cost increase of about 252.  In accordance with WSB, the consultants
conceded that the 1976 estimates had seriously underpriced certain items,
including pumping stations and dams, and excavation in rock had been
omitted from pipeline estimates.  The October 1979 estimates were supposed
to correct these deficiencies and to reflect design changes introduced with
the approval of WSB.
6.        No further costing was done until the bids for civil works for
the RfW project were received in July 1980. The bid prices revealed the
inadequacies of the October 1979 estimates. The lowest bid, before
allowances for variation of prices, was about 150% of the liaseline cost
that had been estimated at 1980 prices and about 2252 of the original 1976
baseline cost.  The second and third bids were about 202 above the lowest
bid.  These bid prites precipitated considerable review and analysis of
what had gone wrot-g and prompted the preparation of new cost estimates for
the IDA project. These were received by IDA in October 1980, at about the
time the Credit became effective.
7.        The new (August/September 1980) cost estimates for the IDA
project were developed from the consultant's analysis of data from the
civil works bids. The analysis included studies of the principal rates
offered by the bidders, both in relation to each other and in relation to
contract rates for civil works-in-progress in Maseru. There were also
consultatations with firms of quantity surveyors operating in Lesotho. The
revised estimate of total capital costs, before allowances for price
contingencies, but inctuding engineering and physical contingencies, was
about 3802 of the appraisal estimate. The revised estimates of the total
project, including the institutional component and engineering for Phase II
and prica contingencies, expressed in local currency was about 2R5% of the
appraisal estimate. Expressed in US dollars, the revised estimate ($33.3
millions) was approximately 380% of the appraisal estimate due to a 25%
decrease in the relative value of the US dollar compared to the Maloti.
8.        A number of reasons were given by the consultants for the large
differences between the original cost estimates (as updated for the project
appraisal) and the latest estimates. These boil down to the following:
Mi)   errors and omissions in the preliminary designs and
estimates (e.g., inadequate flood protection at intake works
and pumping stations, underestimation of rock in pipeline



43                             ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 3
excavation and faulty location and sizing of the dam for the
scheme for one of the towns);
(ii)   design revisions with the approval or at the request of WSB,
zone of which could cove under (1) above;
(i)   underestiuation of original baseline unit construction
costs; and
(iv)   underestimation of escalation In construction costs between
1976 and 1980.
9.        An indication of the apportionment of the Increased costs which
relate to the various factors listed In paragraph 8, obtained from figures
provided by the consultants, show that items (i) and (ii) resulted in an
increase equivalent to about 80% of the baseline costs including related
allowances for physical contingencies. Underestimation of the original
baseline estimate (item iii) was due partially to the lack of applicable
cost experience in Lesotho for works of this type.  It is possible, but by
no means certain, that more research and consultation with contractors at
the time of the pre-investment studies would have produced a more realistic
evaluation of costs for a project involving several relatively small jobs
at widely scattered sites. For example, a contractor type estimate might
have been better than one which depended entirely on estimated quantities
of work and unit prices. From the XfW project experience, tfe c6nsultants
came to the conclusion that in bids for this type of project contractors
may include a mark-up of 302 or more for mobilization and obligations not
covered in usual bills of quantities.
10.       With regard to item (iv) in paragraph 8, the consultants were
caught by drastic changes in the Republic of South Africa's construction
industry - upon which Lesotho is largely dependent - between the early
1970's and 1980. At the time of the original estimates, there was a
general shortage of construction work in RSA, contractors were particularly
competitive and there was considerable interest in work in other
countries. However, a construction boom beginning in 1978 soon took up
slack capacity and resulted in sharp increases in contractor prices.
During 1978/79, bid prices increased about 161, and in 1979/80 they rose
about 23X, substantially more than the increases in labor and material
costs. Furthermore, interest declined in small jobs outside RSA. The
original costs for the project were developed during a time of relative
price stability. Annual escalation factors in the order of 81 to 10X to
1982 were used in the project cost estimates. Actual costs escalated at
least 501 faster over the same estimating period, resulting in an
additional overall Increase in project costs of at least 30%.

SEVEN TOWNS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (CR 887-LSO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Operating Results and Forecasts
Notes to Financial Projections and Prior Year's Pesults
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.01      WSB has not operated as an accounting entity but, as a branch of
the Ministry of Water, Energy and Mines. Past revenues and expenditures
(particularly up to 1982) are not reliably determinable. Accounting is on
a cash basis. While there has been significant improvement in controls
over uncollected revenues or accounts receivable, there is inaacquate
information on debtor, creditor or inventory levels. Capital eipenditures
are brought together from various sources in the Government accounts, and
fixed asset ledgers and controls do not exist. Production and consumption
data is recognized by management as being au approximation. The
consumption data shown is actually the billed consumption collected in the
month or year - rather than the actual consumption for the period.
Consequently, the financial comparisons and projections are based primarily
on the best information WSB has been able to supply the mission, but the
quality of this information is limited by the inadequacies of the records
and the inexperience of WSB' s personnel.
1I.   INCOME STATEMENT
Revenues
2.01      The years 1981 through 1984 reflect actual cash collections.  The
year 1985 represents the actual collections, subject to final year-end
adjustment.
2.02      The year 1986 represents the revenues budgetted by WSB on the
basis of the revised tariff rates of M 0.55/m3 instituted on February 1,
1985. It would appear that the budgetted sales volume is slightly lower
than is likely to be achieved, given the system expansion underway.
2.03      The years 1987-1990 have been derived from physical demand
forecasts supplied by WSB's engineering department, which have been
extracted from the forecasts prepared by consultants for the various
expansion schemes - i.e. 4 towns, Maseru Phase I1, and the 13 towns. These
forecasts have been reduced by 25% to obtain forecast billable consumption
(representing 15% for system losses and uncollected accounts, and 10%
financial reserve on the physical forecast, consistent with 1985 and 1986
experience). Tariffs have been assumed to increase at the assumed forecast



47
ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 7
inflation rate of 10% p.a. No recognition has been given to the clear need
for an additional tariff increase in 1985 in the order of 30%, to achieve
financial viability and to meet the terms of the IDA credit's covenants.
2.04      Sewerage revenues for 1986 are as budgetted by WSB.  From
1987-1990, a physical increase of 2% p.a. is projected plus 10% p.a. for
tariff adjustments in line with inflation.
Operating Expenses
2.05      A 102 annual inflation provision has been allowed for all
expenses from 1986 forward, in addition to any real, physical increases
outlined below.
Employment Costs
2.06      With approximately 400 personnel engaged in recurrent operations,
the Branch is overmanned. No overall increase in personnel is thererore
envisaged prior to 1990. Growth in physical volume averaging
9-10 p.a. can be accommodated by redeployment of personnel, or by limited
recruitment offset by natural attribution.
Power, Oil and Chemicals
2.07      Consumption is increased proportionately to production,,
utilizing the average of the 1983-86 period.
Trarsport and Maintenance Costs
2.08      These are maintained at 1986 levels.
Depreciation
2.09      This is calculated on the average revalued assets in operation
for the year, at a rate of 2.5% per annum.
IIT.   BALANCE SHEET
Fixed Assets
3.01      Fixed Assets recorded are not kept by WSB.  The fixed assets
essentially represent an estimate derived as follows:
For 1979-85:
(a)   The 1978 position, as shown in the Appraisal Report (which
itself was a revaluation of the 1976 physical inventory
undertaken by Binnie Shand Lesotho) was assumed to be valid.
(b)   Additions consisted of major projects - i.e., Maseru Phase
I, 6 towns and 7 towns - as they came into service. The
value was as given by the Director of WSB and derived from
the Government accounts for each project following
completion.



48
ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 7
(c)   Revaluations of fixed assets and accumulated depreciation
were made annually using Lesotho construction price indexes
provided by Binnie Shand Lesotho.
For 1986-90
(a)   Fixed Assets additions have been based on the WSB Director's
estimation on when projects will be placed in service.
(b)   An inflation rate of 10% p.a. has been used for revaluation.
Accounts Receivable
3.02      These have been based on balances provided by WSB for the years
1983 through 1985. Figures were not available for the years 1979 through
1982. For the years 1986-90, the average ratio of receivables to revenues
experienced in the years 1983-85 was used.
Accounts Payable
3.03      The sundry creditors figure provided for 1985 was used as the
basis for estimating future years.
Loans
3.04      The KfW finance for the 6 Towns Water Project was reconstituted
as a grant, and is therefore considered as a GOL equity contribution to
WSB. The ADF financing for the Maseru Phase I Water Supply has been
on-lent to WSB at a 0.752 interest rate. The IDA credit has been
considered as on-lent to WSB at 7.52 annual interest rate. Approximately
US$5.1 million has been disbursed, equivalent to M 5.9 million at actual
exchange rates.
3.05      For 1986-90, the 4 Towns Water Project is being financed by OPEC
at 1.02 p.a. interest and ADF at 0.75% p.a. interest. The Maseru Phase II
water supply is assumed to be financed by ADB and ADF at a composite rate
of 4.92 interest p.a.  For these loans the interest is charged to an IDC
(interest-during-construction) account and then capitalized into Fixed
Assets upon project completion.
IV. CASH FLOW STATEMENT
4.01      The virtually total absence of available meaningful actual
figures for income and expenditure for the years 1979 and 1980, together
with the absence of information with respect to accounts receivable,
inventories and accounts payable makes the production of a comparative cash
flow statement for the period 1978-1985 virtually meaningless.
