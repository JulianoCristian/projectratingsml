(c) preparation, by end of 1969, of an\n            engineering and economic feasibility study of works needed\n            to protect the Georgetown Esplanade; and (d) preparation, by\n            1971, of a study of improved sea wall designs including\n            necessary hydraulic model tests and possible construction\n            methods, and of an economic/technical study for selecting\n            priority areas to be protected by sea defense works from 1972."}, "docdt": "1968-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
