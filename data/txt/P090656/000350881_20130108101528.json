both the\n            Bank and the borrower performance were moderately\n            satisfactory. The five lessons learned are as follows: (1)\n            Development of a functioning electricity market is a complex\n            undertaking which requires coordinated actions from the\n            Government, sector regulator and TSO. (2) Capacity building\n            of a TSO is crucial in facilitating effective integration of\n            a subsidiary market into a regional electricity market. (3)\n            Choice of the APL instrument could be successful in\n            addressing regional policy, country sector policy and\n            infrastructure issues when physical investments are properly\n            leveraged with appropriate policy actions and supported by\n            complimentary activities. (4) All the risks should be\n            properly mitigated at design stage, including sector risks.\n            (5) Opportune restructuring of a project should be\n            recognized through continuous tracing of project performance.<BR>"}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
