  Project aims to help Chad build capacity to implement its\n            petroleum revenue management strategy to enable it to\n            effectively absorb and allocate expected oil revenue, and\n            thus pursue the poverty-reduction objective of petroleum\n            resources development. The project consists of five\n            components: 1) The strengthening public financial management\n            component will support to prepare for a consolidated budget,\n            manage budget expenditure, manage treasury and public\n            accounting, and develop financial management information\n            system. 2) The poverty database and strategy component will\n            support activities to develop a poverty database, produce a\n            poverty profile, and formulate a participatory strategy for\n            poverty reduction. 3) The human resources development\n            component will help to improve the competence and quality of\n            civil service. 4) The oversight and control component will\n            support the said functions mandated by the law on petroleum\n            revenue management. 5) The monitoring economic reform and\n            coordinating capacity building component will support\n            pursuit of macroeconomic stabilization and privatization\n            agenda, preparation and negotiation of adjustment programs\n            with external partners, and monitoring of, and reporting on,\n            the implementation of adjustment programs."}, "docdt": "1999-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
