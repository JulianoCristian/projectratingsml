1. Country and sector issues
a. General context.
This Project Appraisal Document describes a US$8.0 million (equivalent) Technical Assistance
Credit to co finance a US$12.9 million (equivalent) Poverty Reduction Support project for the
Republic of Honduras. The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Technical Assistance Credit
(PRSTAC) i s designed to support the reforms advanced in the Poverty Reduction Support Credit
(PRSC) aimed at accelerating the implementation of the Government's Poverty Reduction
Strategy. The Honduras PRSC program consists of three single-tranche, quick disbursing
programmatic credits, the first o f which (PRSC I)w i l l be presented to the Board in parallel with
the PRSTAC.

Public Sector Modernization Program. Honduras has historically been one of the poorest
countries in Latin America. With a population of about 7 million people and an annual per
capita income estimated at US$920 in 2002, i t i s the third poorest country in the region. Despite
a steady decline in poverty indicators, an estimated 63 percent of the population currently lives
below the poverty line. Income inequality remains high, and most of the poor live in rural areas
where the incidence of poverty i s almost 75 percent. Although comparable to other lower
middle-income countries, Honduras' social indicators remain amongst the worst in Latin
America. The country's history of poor economic growth, recurrent macroeconomic imbalances,
vulnerability to natural disasters, and a decades-long legacy o f periodic fiscal mismanagement
are key factors contributing to Honduras' high poverty and weak social indicators. Against such
a backdrop, Honduras embarked on a series of ambitious economic and structural reform
programs throughout the 1990s to stabilize the economy, promote faster economic growth, and
improve social conditions. International Development Association (IDA) support to the
Government's new reform program was provided through a series of Public Sector
Modernization Projects (both in the form of adjustment and TA operations) broadly aimed at
restoring fiscal sustainability and increasing private sector participation in the provision of public
goods. The last of these operations i s the ongoing Economic and Financial Management
Technical Assistance Credit (EFMTAC), which was approved in 2000. The proposed PRSTAC
would build on progress achieved under that operation.

Honduras' Poverty Reduction Strategy. In the wake o f the devastation wrought b y Hurricane
Mitch in October 1998 the Government launched an ambitious strategy to break free from i t s
legacy of poverty and inequality. Since then, poverty reduction has remained central to the
Government's reform agenda, a commitment most recently reaffirmed b y the new
Administration which assumed office in early 2002. This continued dedication to reducing
poverty i s clearly evidenced by the Government's commitment to the HIPC initiative for which i t
developed a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2001 and an associated first Progress
Report (PRSP-PR), discussed b y the Boards of the Bank and IMF in February 2004. The main
objective of the PRS i s to reduce poverty b y 24 percent over the period 2001-15 b y meeting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

This strategy i s founded on six pillars: (i)
                                            accelerating equitable and sustainable growth to levels
                                                      i)                         i ireducing urban
consistent with income poverty reduction targets; ( ireducing rural poverty; ( i )

poverty; (iv) enhancing investment in human capital; (v) strengthening social protection for
vulnerable groups; and (vi) ensuring the strategy's sustainability through governance and
institutional reforms and enhanced environmental sustainability. These pillars are complemented
by three crosscutting themes - gender equity, environmental sustainability, and decentralization.

                                                                  The PRSP and PRSP-PR present a coherent

provision of services.

b. Key sector Issues/Challenges
Despite progress achieved in all areas related to PRS and PRSC objectives and the Government's
explicit commitment to move forward with the strategy's implementation, the latter has also
recognized that i t w i l l face difficulties in achieving such ambitious objectives. The two main
challenges to effective implementation of the PRS stem from shortcomings in the
operationalization of the strategy and the public sector's weak institutional capacity to implement
the necessary reforms. These weaknesses are also identified in the latest Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR).
Both fiduciary reports offer recommendations on how to address these problems and serve as the
principal analytical underpinnings for the PRSTAC (refer to Box 2). The proposed operation
would seek to address prevailing institutional weaknesses in the following areas: (i)
Government's capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate, and improve PRS implementation; ( i          i)
Government fiscal, financial, and fiduciary management; and ( i )     i ipublic services management
and delivery. What follows i s a summary of progress made to date in these areas and challenges
to be addressed by the PRSTAC.

PRSP implementationand monitoring
As regards progress towards strengthening the Government's capacity to implement, monitor and
undertake ongoing improvements to the PRS, the Government of Honduras has worked with
civil society throughout the last three years to establish a well-defined institutional framework.
The framework as outlined in the Poverty Reduction Fund Law (Ley de Fundu para la
Reduccidn de la Pubreza), contains clearly defined and properly coordinated responsibilities for
the strategy's implementation. In accordance with the new framework, the National Technical
Advisory Unit (UNAT) i s expected to play a key technical role in leading the other public
agencies, donors and civil society groups in the process of implementing, monitoring and
improving the PRS. However, UNAT presently lacks the necessary technical staff and resources
as well as organizational structure to undertake this leading role in an effective and sustainable
manner

The success of the PRS depends on the Government's ability to manage i t s scarce resources in an
effective and efficient manner. In this context, there i s a pressing need to enhance donor
             --
coordination particularly as regards the need to work with donors to realign their programs to
PRS development objectives. Enhancing coordination (with tools such as SWAps) w i l l help to
develop a shared vision and strategy for Government, donors, and other stakeholders in support
of the PRS.




                                                3
Finally, despite Government efforts to render the PRS a more participatory process, there i s s t i l l
a pressing need t o further engage all stakeholders in the Strategy's development and monitoring
b y establishing participatory mechanisms at the national, sectoral, and local levels.

Public Sector Management
Although significant progress has been made throughout the last two years towards modernizing
public administration and implementing a more effective and transparent fiduciary framework,
there i s s t i l l room for considerable improvement in these areas.

As regards human resource management, although the prevailing Civil Service Law o f 1968
appears to constitute comprehensive legislation on all matters related to public sector personnel
management, the fact i s that the law has not been binding throughout the last two decades.
Instead, many separate employment regimes have been created providing extraordinary benefits
to particular sectors. Meanwhile, HR recruitment, performance evaluations and dismissal
procedures have become increasingly politicized, thereby reducing the public sector's overall
capacity to attract qualified personnel and to deliver public services efficiently. Progress to date
                                                   ithe
toward correcting such deficiencies include: ( ) approval o f the Public Sector Salary and
Compensation L a w (Ley de Ordenamiento Retributivo del Sector PLiblico) which would allow
                                                                             i)
the Government to control the fiscal impacts o f the wage bill; ( i the completion o f a
comprehensive review o f the public sector's macro-structure, clarifying the roles, functions and
                                                                      i ithe
service delivery responsibilities o f different public entities; and ( i ) submission to Congress
o f a new comprehensive Public Administration L a w that would restore Government control over
personnel management.

Despite these advances, effective public sector management would require: (i) restoration o f
                                                                                      the
a sustainable fiscal situation and a more equitable distribution o f benefits v i a the implementation
                                  i)
o f the new salary regulations; ( ithe redefinition and restructuring o f public agencies according
                                      i i the
to revised roles and functions; ( i ) establishment o f new normative and institutional
frameworks governing public employment that would effectively limit the politicization o f HR
staffing procedures; and (iv) the implementation o f the new c i v i l service framework, upon i t s
approval.

In the area o f financial management, significant progress has been made throughout the past
year in developing the budget function as an expenditure management tool. Despite this, a
number o f systemic deficiencies must s t i l l be tackled before the budget function can serve as an
effective tool to monitor and evaluate the impact o f public efforts vis-&vis PRS targets.
Deficiencies include: (i) omission o f significant amounts o f donor assistance from the
                              the
             i)
budget; ( ithe determination o f budget allocations on the basis o f incremental allocations (often
with little input from ministries and without reconciliation w i t h annual operating plans); ( i )  ii
weak planning capacity at the sector level, which contributes to the need for repeated budget
amendments; and (iv) inappropriate budget formats presented o n the basis o f expenditure objects
rather than programmatic classification. These deficiencies undermine the Government's ability
to monitor and evaluate the impact o f allocations towards reaching their priorities. While
implementation o f the integrated financial management system (SIAFI) has improved the
Government's ability to control and manage expenditures, the system i s limited b y (i)      rigidities
                  i)
in i t s format; ( ia lack o f comprehensive access to the system by a l l sectors resulting in delays



                                                  4
                                i ithe
in recording transactions; and ( i ) failure as of yet to integrate SIAFI with various other
government information systems.

The Government's program to improve SIAFI's usefulness contemplates its upgrading and
                                                                                                n
expansion throughout the entire public sector and further integration to other related systems. I
parallel, the Central Government accounting function i s gradually evolving from a process of
merely recording transactions towards the international standard which includes the capacity to
undertake analyses that add meaning to Government financial statements. A complete strategy
to improve and consolidate financial management enhancement would be reflected in the new
Financial Administration Law (Ley de Administrucio'n Finunciera) to be approved in 2004, and
in the implementation of a comprehensive restructuring program for the Secretariat o f Finance
(SEFIN).

As regards control mechanisms, internal controls continue to be widely dispersed and
uncoordinated. The Office of the Budget (DGP) exerts centralized ex-ante control that does not
allow for efficient budget execution. Internal audit functions are not well defined and continue
to be managed b y the TSC, blurring the lines between internal and external audits. External
audit functions are still evolving in the wake of reforms that led to the creation of the TSC.
Although important progress was achieved towards completing the new TSC's institutional
reform, the effectiveness of this entity i s currently limited b y a lack o f qualified personnel,
insufficient financial resources to fully discharge i t s responsibilities, and a lack of operational
guidelines and regulations.

The TSC has prepared an HR strategy aimed at developing qualified staff, trained in
internationally accepted auditing standards and methodologies who w i l l be fully capable of
carrying out financial audits of the Government's accounts. I t has also prepared and formally
approved a new set of regulations to govern i t s operations and i s completing overdue annual
reports backlogged since fiscal year 2001. Further measures contemplated in the reform program
include; (i) implementation of regulations under the TSC Framework Law (Ley Orgcinica del
            the
         i)
TSC); ( ithe approval of a new financial audit manual and associated regulations; and ( i )  ii
carrying out annual ex-post audits o f government procurement processes and contracts.

Public services and Sectoral issues
As regards public services management, remarkable progress was achieved within the last two
years, especially in the telecommunications, ports, and water and sanitation sectors. The
Government has furthermore recently reiterated i t s commitment to modernize and reform the
electricity sector. The sum of these reform efforts are particularly relevant to objectives under
the PRS as they not only contribute to enhancing the foundations o f economic growth by
attracting foreign capital to the country, but to improving basic services to benefit the poor.

 n
I the telecommunication sector, poor service quality, inadequate coverage, high tariffs and
institutional irregularities have constituted important obstacles to increase productivity in this
sector. While progress toward effective private participation has been slow, the Government
recently opened the market for fixed-line local and national telephone services, and competition
in the mobile telephone sector was enhanced via the award of a second concession to a private
operator. These steps are expected to improve services and lower tariffs - a trend already being
observed in the mobile sector. Full private sector participation in the country's telecom sector i s

                                                                              the
                            i)

                                                                      i i strengthening o f the
significantly increase service coverage (especially in rural areas); ( i )
telecom regulatory agency; and (iv) the repositioning o f the state telecom company
(HONDUTEL) to enhance its competitiveness vis-h-vis private national and international call
market operators.

With regard to the power sector, the prevailing inefficiency in electricity distribution, high
generation costs, inadequate capacity, and irrational tariffs and subsidies continue to undermine
competitiveness in this sector. Honduras' state-owned power company (ENEE) i s currently
crippled b y insufficient generation, transmission, and distribution capacity, causing i t to
consistently operate at a loss. Within this context, there i s an urgent need to advance towards a
comprehensive reform o f the sector in order to overcome ENEE's capacity constraints,
operational inefficiencies, and the growing demand for electricity (increasing at an annual rate o f
7%), central to which would be the need to restructure and strengthen ENEE.

As regards the ports sector, the government's planned program seeks to increase the security,
efficiency and quality o f services o f the ports system (focusing o n the most important port,
Puerto Cortis). I t i s important to note that orts are critical to Honduras' competitiveness since
the sectors where the country enjoys the greatest comparative advantage (i.e., agricultural
products, maquila textile industry, forestry and tourism) depend on efficient and high-quality
port services). The establishment o f modern regulatory and sector frameworks i s critical to
rectifying prevailing deficiencies. Consequently, a Ports L a w (Ley General de Puertos) was
submitted to Congress which: (i)    defines institutional responsibilities for policy and regulatory
functions; (ii)enables private sector participation in ports management; and ( i ) i iestablishes the
necessary parameters to manage ports in accordance with international security standards. The
Government anticipates that the law's passage w i l l significantly increase private sector
participation in the operation and/or management o f Ports b y end 2004.

With respect to water and sanitation, access to these services has significantly increased
throughout the past years. According to a 2002 household survey, 83 percent o f households have
access to potable water and 81 percent have access to sanitation. Despite these promising
                                          ithe
numbers, problems persist in terms o f ( ) prevailing disparities in levels o f access between
                                                                     i)
urban and rural areas and between poor and wealthy households; ( iirregular service delivery
                                                                     i ipoor quality control that
resulting in an average o f 6 hours o f water service per day; and ( i )
leads to increased incidence o f water-borne illnesses affecting infant mortality and morbidity.
Resolving these problems and strengthening water and sanitation services are critical to
achieving both the Government's PRS targets and the Millennium Development Goals. The
recent approval of a new sector framework law constitutes an important first step toward
rectifying prevailing deficiencies and improving service delivery. Implementation, however,
remains key, requiring that: (i)  both the National Planning Board for Water and Sanitation
(CONASA) and the regulatory agency become fully operational and that they acquire the
                                                          i)
institutional capacity necessary to govern the sector; ( i guidelines for the establishment o f
tariffs, performance benchmarks and the development of monitoring mechanisms be developed
                   i ithe
and issued; and ( i ) state owned company (SANAA) be restructured so that the delivery o f

    to the municipalities and local water boards.

    2. Rationale for Bank involvement
    The 2003 Honduras CAS' i s based on the objectives and priorities expressed in the PRSP. The
    Bank's strategy explicitly contemplated a PRSC and a PRSTAC to support PRS implementation,
    acknowledging the shortcomings in PRS operationalization and weak public sector institutional
    capacity. The proposed PRSTAC w i l l assist Honduras in moving forward with its PRS by
    strengthening the public sector's institutional capacity to meet poverty reduction targets.

                                                                    To this end, the PRSTAC w i l l continue IDA

    The proposed operation i s specifically designed to support the Government's PRS thereby
    contributing to the higher-level objectives of alleviating poverty and meeting the MDGs.
    Moreover, competent public institutions and systems are key to streamlining the public sector,
    ensuring efficient and effective use o f public resources and ultimately implementing the
    country's PRS. Specifically, the proposed operation would support the implementation of PRSC
    targets by providing the Government with the technical assistance necessary to: (i)adequately
                                     i)

 .
1 Lending instrument
The choice o f a Technical Assistance Credit follows a Bank good practice of supporting
structural adjustment operations (in this case the PRSCs) with technical assistance operations to
help Governments to achieve structural objectives. PRSTAC components are essential to
solidifying the institutional capacity necessary to successfully implement both the PRSP and
PRSC.

2. Project development objective and key indicators
Project Development Objective. The objective of PRSTAC i s to assist the Government of
Honduras in improving i t s institutional capacity in the areas of planning, participatory
monitoring, public expenditure management, accountability, public administration, and public
service delivery thereby facilitating implementation of the PRS.

The PRSTAC i s designed to support the implementation of reforms advanced in the PRSC.
Specifically, the PRSTAC's development objectives are to: (i)       develop the Government's
capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate, and improve PRS implementation by giving all
stakeholders access to effective mechanisms for the design and control of the government's
                                  i)
poverty reduction programs; ( i improve public sector management by ensuring a more
equitable working environment with better performance incentives and improved civil service
quality, as well as strengthening the Government's fiscal, financial and fiduciary management
       i i support sector specific activities within the framework o f the PRSC for improving
and ( i )
public service management and delivery in key economic and social sectors.

Key Indicators. Specific results expected of the Government b y project close are described in
detail in Annex 3 (Results Framework). These results are in line with the objectives of the
Government's PRS and PRSC. Altogether, implementation of all PRSTAC activities w i l l
provide an institutional and operational framework for systematic monitoring and evaluation of
the PRS; a new normative and institutional framework to implement comprehensive civil service
reform; a comprehensive public financial management system that w i l l allow the Government to
control and manage expenditures; an effective TSC able to implement a financial audit o f public
Government; and a more efficient and qualitative provision of basic public services.

3. Project components

                                               8
Project Component 1: Develop the Capacity to Manage, Monitor, Evaluate and Improve
PRS Implementation. The objective of this component i s to strengthen the Government's
capacity to monitor, evaluate, and open the process of consultation for the PRSP and subsequent
progress reports. The following sub-components w i l l be supported b y this operation:

    Sub-component 1.1: Develop UNAT's Analytical Capacity. This sub-component w i l l
    strengthen UNAT's capacity to analyze and disseminate the results of public programs
    associated with the Government's poverty reduction strategy. Activities w i l l include: (i)
                                                                                               the
    recruitment o f specialized staff for UNAT; (ii) carrying-out of impact analyses and
                                                       the
    assessments o f PRS- related programs; and (iii) dissemination of such studies.
                                                   the

    Sub-Component 1.2: Strengthen the Government's Capacity to Coordinate Foreign
    Assistance. Government and stakeholders are committed to the creation and implementation
    of sector programs SWAps around PRS priorities. Activities w i l l include: (i) design and
                                                                                  the
                                                      i)
    implementation of SWAps in selected sectors; and ( ithe development and dissemination of
    adequate guidelines on SWAps.

    Sub-component 1.3: Enhance the PRS Consultative Process. This sub-component w i l l
    systematize the PRSP participatory process through regular consultations with communities
    to identify priorities, complemented b y stakeholder involvement in designing and
    implementing the Strategy's programs. Activities under this sub-component w i l l be geared
    to strengthen work undertaken b y the PRS Consultative Council (CCERP) in PSR monitoring
    and evaluation.

Project Component 2: Improve the Implementation of Public Sector Management. The
objective of this component i s to support the implementation of the new Civil Service legislation,
thereby ensuring a more equitable working environment with better performance incentives and
improved quality o f civil servants. I t w i l l also strengthen the Government's budgetary,
financial, and fiduciary management to produce a more accurate, timely, relevant, and
transparent public sector. The following sub-components w i l l be supported b y this operation:

e   Sub-Component 2.1: Implement the New Civil Service Law and Continue with Efforts to
    Reengineer the Public Sector. This sub-component w i l l help the Government implement a
    new Civil Service Law currently under discussion at the ministerial level. This legislation
    includes renewed provisions for the establishment of transparent and less politically
    influenced procedures for hiring, evaluation, and dismissal o f public servants. Activities
    under this sub-component include: (i) expansion of the Human Resource Management
                                               the
    system (SIARH) and i t s integration with SIAFI; (ii) conceptualization o f the structure and
                                                           the
    functions of the new C i v i l Service Regulatory Office and equipping the latter for i t s day-to-
    day operations; ( i )i i training o f civil servants in topics related to HR management; (iv)
    carrying out of studies on the fiscal impact of the redefined wage policy and a strategy to
    ensure i t s fiscal sustainability; (v) support to Government efforts to reengineer the public
    administration in a number o f additional public entities; and (vi) the contracting o f a
    specialized firm to conduct independent personnel evaluation activities in pilot agencies and
    to develop the capacity o f those entities to apply the new HR policies regarding posts

   development.

   Sub-component 2.2: Upgrading and expanding the Capacity o SIAFI. This sub-
                                                                      f
   component will help develop a set of norms, methodologies, and computer-based systems to
   allow the Government to prepare an effective and transparent budget compatible with the
   PRS. Activities under this sub-component w i l l include: (i)    acquisition of software,
   communications and computer equipment, and data links and licenses to use servers for the
   upgrading and expansion of web based e-SUFI, as well as preparation of an "e-SUFI users
                 i)
   manual"; and ( ia review of the Central Government's financial accounts.

   Sub-component 2.3: Strengthening the Institutional Capacity to Ensure Accountability
   through Internal and External Control. This sub-component i s geared to assist the TSC to
   establish stronger financial controls, thereby instituting greater transparency in public
   financial management. Activities under this sub-component include: (i) training of personnel
   of internal control units from all public sector entities in various skills related to new
   regulations and control abilities; and (ii) acquisition of equipment (such as computers and
                                             the
   communications) for each area o f the TSC.

Project Component 3: Support for Sectoral Activities within the Framework of the PRS
The objective of this component i s to support sectoral activities that require technical assistance
to fulfill the actions and conditions specified in the PRSC (three year program). In this context,
technical assistance would be provided to specific sectors identified by a Project Steering
Committee (PSC) during Project implementation. To begin, the following activities in the areas
of public infrastructure and service provision were identified in principle as activities to be
supported, pending ratification by the Steering Committee:

3.1 For the telecommunications sector, financial and legal advisors w i l l be hired to assist the
Government in restructuring and modernizing HONDUTEL. These advisors, together with other
consultants, w i l l help the GOH to prepare new telecommunications legislation and to strengthen
the newly established telecommunications coordinating unit.

3.2. For the power sector, consultants w i l l be hired to assist the Government in improving the
efficiency o f ENEE including i t s restructuring. Other activities in this sector that could be
supported by the fund include: the design of institutional and regulatory reforms necessary to
improve the performance o f the sector; a comprehensive study of power tariffs, as well as of
various regulatory aspects of the power sector, and o f mechanisms to stimulate private sector
participation. Activities could also be undertaken to strengthen the National Commission o f
Energy (the entity in charge of regulating this sector). Finally, technical assistance i s to be
provided to identify and implement viable approaches for providing modem energy services to
consumers in rural and semi-urban areas.

3.3. For the ports sector, activities w i l l include technical assistance geared to help the
Government restructure the National Ports Company. In addition, consultants w i l l be hired to
strengthen the organizational capacity of the regulatory entity in line with the new Ley General
de Puertos, and supporting efforts of attracting private investment for other ports.



                                                10
3.4. For the water sector, activities w i l l include supporting CONASA as well as strengthening the
Water Sector Regulator for Water and Sanitation (ERSAPS). To support CONASA, a technical
manager, a planning expert, a decentralization expert, an economist, and an information systems
specialist w i l l be contracted. In ERSAPS, an economist, two engineers, and a lawyer w i l l be
contracted. Other activities in this sector that could be supported include: support for an
information campaign aimed at the general public, NGOs, Municipalities and Government in
general on the reforms introduced by the 2003 Water Law. Finally, the project w i l l provide
technical equipment (computers and software) to allow both agencies to operate efficiently.

3.5. For the environmental sector, consultants w i l l be hired to improve the quality and accuracy
o f information. Using this improved data, consultants w i l l review the sector's policies and
regulatory framework. Other activities in this sector that could be supported include: workshops
to strengthen capacity to conduct environmental risk assessments, and a comprehensive
diagnosis of key areas to determine necessary institutional reforms in the sector.

3.6. For the social sectors, consultants w i l l be hired to produce a feasibility study to expand the
role of local education development associations (ADELs) with special attention to basic
infrastructure, transportation networks, and health; and a comprehensive teacher allocation post
review (auditorfa de puestos) w i l l be carried out in the departments of Francisco Morazin and
Cortis. Teacher allocation post review could later be extended to cover other departments.

3.7. Finally, the project will finance other sectoral activities yet to be identified. The Steering
Committee w i l l be responsible for identifying and approving those activities within the context
of the PRSC that will be supported under this sub-component. Detailed procedures governing
the identification and approval o f sectoral activities w i l l be outlined in the project Operational
Manual.

Project Component 4: Manage PRSTAC Implementation
This component w i l l finance the provision of technical assistance, equipment, training and
operating costs, as necessary, to establish, operate and strengthen the PCU and PEUs to enable
these units to effectively coordinate, monitor and evaluate (including periodic audits) the
implementation of the project activities.

4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
In Honduras, IDA-supported public sector reforms have often fallen short o f expectations. This
i s largely attributable to an overall lack o f country ownership, combined with insufficient
technical competence, and a lack o f clear objectives. The PRSTAC i s likely to confront some of
these challenges, particularly in i t s support to public administration reform and PRS monitoring
and evaluation. However, a major factor mitigating risks i s the fact that the achievement of
PRSTAC objectives (which includes not only strengthening key Government institutions, but
actual approval and implementation o f reforms) constitute the benchmarks of a series o f PRSCs,
as well as H P C , IMF and other donor programs, which together represent formidable financial
and political incentives for the successful implementation of the PRSTAC.




                                                 11
Based on lessons learned from IDA experience with Technical Assistance projects in Honduras
and elsewhere, the PRSTAC w i l l emphasize:

   Stakeholder ownership and incentives. As explained above, foreign assistance programs
   valued at several hundred million dollars coupled with high profile public debates o f results
   w i l l ensure ownership and adequate incentives for the proposed project.
   Upstream work. The proposed project was designed on the basis o f the findings o f a series
   of analytical studies including the CFAA, CPAR and other related analytical pieces (such as
   the I C A and DPR), the EFMTAC, findings of the PRSP-PR and the PRSC. It i s firmly
   grounded on such findings and recommendations and tailored to support their attainment.
   Clear objectives and close supervision. The overall objectives of the PRSTAC are provided
   by the PRSP and PRSC and reinforced b y HIPC, the I M F ' s PRGF and the IDB's program.
   In addition to regular project supervision provided b y the project team, the Government, and
   more specifically the Office of the Presidency w i l l help to identify problems within the
   context of the PRSC's continuous supervision. Consequently, feedback regarding PRSTAC
   implementation progress w i l l be constant.

    Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The PRSTAC i s a complementary operation specifically designed to provide the technical
assistance necessary to facilitate implementation of the PRSC. Consequently, during project
design, the scope of planned or ongoing Bank investment operations (particularly the EFMTAC
and sectoral credits), as well as the TA activities financed b y other donors and institutions were
carefully considered to guard against possible duplications. As a result, the PRSTAC i s
specifically designed to provide support to those areas where further T A needs were identified as
necessary to complement existing work. I t w i l l thereby promote synergies, increase the overall
impact of donor assistance, and ensure that the country i s receiving the support necessary to meet
commitments under PRSC.

C. IMPLEMENTATION (details are presented in Annex 6)

 .
1 Partnership arrangements
The PRSTAC was prepared in close coordination with the IDB program in Honduras,
particularly the Apoyo a1 Fortalecimiento de la Gestidn Fiscal (HO-0208) project, which was
approved by the IDB Board in M a y 2004 and i s to be co-financed b y Sweden. The principal
objective of that project i s to improve public resource management in Honduras by strengthening
the Government's capacity to: (i)                                       i)
                                         manage public expenditures; ( i collect and manage tax
revenues; ( i ) i ioversee international trade through a stronger customs agency; and (iv) increase
i t s ability to link fiscal and monetary policy and measure the impact o f said fiscal policy on PRS
indicators. Close coordination between the two Banks (including joint preparation missions) has
produced a common program and implementation arrangements for those activities to be covered
by both projects (Le. monitoring of PRS implementation and fiscal and fiduciary management).

With respect to arrangements with bilateral donors, i t i s expected that the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) and the British Department for International Development (DFID)
will co-finance the PRSTAC. Specifically, SIDA w i l l provide co-financing totaling US$3.8
million primarily to support implementation of a new C i v i l Service Law and the strengthening o f



                                                 12
the TSC. DFID will provide co-financing totaling US$300 thousand to support the institutional
strengthening of UNAT. IDA and DFID have agreed to deposit their contributions in a trust
fund to be administered by the Bank. Although no other formal agreements will be undertaken
other than implementation agreements with these two donors, the PRSTAC w i l l continue to
coordinate its activities with other donors in Honduras.

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements
A Project Steering Committee (PSC) w i l l be created to coordinate overall project implementation
and to ensure that all component activities are integrated under the PRS. The PSC w i l l be
responsible for approving the project's annual action plans, as well as eligible sub-projects or
studies to be financed under component three of the proposed operation. The Committee will be
chaired by the Secretary of the Presidency and w i l l include representatives from SEFIN and the
Presidential Commission for State Modernization (CPME).

The CPME w i l l maintain the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that was created under the
EFMTAC. The CPME's proven record in Bank operations i s amply evidenced by i t s successful
implementation of two other Bank financed projects2 and i t s current implementation of the
ongoing EFMTAC. In addition, the CPME i s overseeing a number of technical assistance
projects financed b y other donors, thereby further enhancing i t s operational experience. As a
result, the CPME has the demonstrated capability (both adequate systems and staff) to carry out
the project's administrative duties including financial management, administration o f the special
account, and consolidation of project progress reports and audits.

Day-to-day activities within each component or sub-component w i l l be executed by several
Government agencies (Project Executing Units, PEUs). Specifically, U N A T w i l l be responsible
for all activities under the first component; the General Directorate of Civil Service (DGSC) in
collaboration with the CPME w i l l be responsible for activities under sub-component 2.1; SEFIN
w i l l be responsible for activities under sub-component 2.2; the General Comptroller's Office
(TSC) w i l l be responsible for activities under subcomponent 2.3; and the CPME w i l l be
responsible for activities under component 3.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomeshesults
In accordance with Bank policies, monitoring and supervision of project implementation w i l l
focus on the achievement of expected results. The overall project monitoring and results
framework i s presented in Annex 3 and includes component and sub-component specific
indicators as well as aggregate monitoring indicators agreed upon with the Government for
supervision purposes.

Each componenthub-component implementing agency w i l l evaluate i t s progress vis-&vis
expected results and w i l l inform the CPME of same in order to have aggregate progress reports
twice a year. The Bank and the project's co-financers w i l l conduct joint semi-annual supervision
missions to evaluate achievement of intermediate results and to agree on adjustments when
necessary. A project mid-term review w i l l be conducted b y end 2005.

4. Sustainability
Sustainability of the PRSTAC and other reform programs in Honduras i s put at risk by three
potential problems: (i)                                                               i)
                        lack of commitment to reforming the legislative frameworks; ( ithe
absence o f public support; and (iii)
                                    weakness and inexperience of Government agencies.

0   Implementation of recommended reforms. The CFAA and CPAR identified public sector
    reforms to be supported by the PRSTAC. However, actual passage and implementation of
    these reforms will depend on strong pressure and financial incentives offered by the donor
    community as well as Government goodwill. This holds especially true in the case of civil
    service reforms. The following mitigating factors are expected to promote sustainability: (i)
    reforms encouraged by the PRS T A C are either directly or indirectly linked to the PRSP,
                                                                             i)
    PRSC, H P C and PRGF, providing a strong financial incentive; and ( ithe Government's
    endorsement of the PRSP, PRSC, HIPC and PRGF bears witness to the strong local
    commitment to public reforms being advanced under the PRSTAC.
0   Stakeholder commitment. Interest groups witnessing a loss o f privileges as the reform
    agenda advances could lobby against changes espoused by the PRSTAC. Such a risk could
    increase next year as Honduras moves towards Presidential elections. To mitigate against
    this risk, the Government (with the assistance of the donor community) i s expected to
    continue a wide scale communications strategy, aimed at broadening understanding of the
    development agenda and building public support for reforms.
0   Institutional Capacity. Weaknesses in the Government's financial management and audit
    functions could negatively affect the institutionalization of fiduciary reforms supported by
    the PRSTAC. To mitigate against this risk, the PRSTAC and other s i m i l a r technical
    assistance operations contemplate a strong element of institutional building assistance to
    ensure that CFAA and CPAR recommendations are implemented.

6. Credit conditions and covenants
Since key policy and institutional reforms constitute prior actions for the PRSC I described in
                                                                                  as
the PRSC Policy Matrix, there w i l l be no major effectiveness conditions to begin
implementation o f the project.         Administrative conditions o f effectiveness include: (i)
presentation of a satisfactory action plan for project activities to be completed during the first
                               i)
year of implementation; ( i preparation of the project Operations Manual and updated
                        i ithe
Procurement Plan; ( i ) establishment of the PSC, PCU and PEUs, including the hiring of
technical and administrative staff; (iv) the subsidiary Agreement (with TSC) and Inter-
institutional Arrangements (among CPME, UNAT, SEFINKJAP, and DGSC) w i l l have been
executed and delivered; and (v) conditions precedent to effectiveness of the Grant Agreements
(for activities to be financed b y SIDA and DFID), except the effectiveness of the Development
Credit Agreement, w i l l have been fulfilled.

Considering the importance o f supporting the adoption o f new civil service legislation, the Grant
Agreement (under the PRSTAC) w i l l consider the passage o f the Civil Service Law as a

component 2.1. The adoption o f this new legislation i s also included in the PRSC Policy Matrix.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses
The PRSTAC w i l l contribute to the definition and preparation o f a series o f fiduciary reforms
(prescribed b y the C F A A and CPAR) whose successful implementation would have a substantial
fiscal impact including budget management, fiduciary oversight, public personnel management
and transparency. More specifically it would contribute to: (i) establishment o f a better
                                                                   the
financial management system that would lead to efficient budget allocation decisions and more
                                            i)
effective control over financial flows; ( iimprovements in the overall fiduciary framework in
the areas o f financial management and public procurement; ( i )        i i an increase in the
professionalism o f the c i v i l service and improvements in public service delivery; and (iv)
enabling o f non-government stakeholders to review public sector performance thereby promoting
greater transparency o f public resource management. Successful implementation of the PRS
TAC would also contribute to improving coordination among international donors thereby
increasing foreign aid effectiveness.

2. Technical
The technical capability o f most agencies responsible for the execution o f project activities is
limited. Consequently, the project's design calls for consultants to carryout a strong supervisory
role and provides ample training to Government officials to ensure sustainability. M a n y
components w i l l also benefit from continued donor support and involvement. Finally, in order to
increase the prospects for the successful implementation o f the proposed operation, the design o f
each component has been limited to achieving simple objectives. Annex 4 details how technical
issues have been addressed for each component.

3. Fiduciary
Fiduciary and capacity assessments o f CPME and other project-implementing units have been
undertaken. Both assessments have concluded that all units would be adequately prepared t o
manage the proposed project' s procurement processes and finances upon completion o f certain
recommendations set forth in Annexes 7 and 8.

                   Annex 1: Country and Sector or Program Background
    HONDURAS: POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

A. Country Context
Present-day Honduras, reflecting a legacy dating back to Colonial times, i s one of the poorest
and most unequal countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region. With a per capita
income o f US$920 in 2002, the country i s the third poorest in Latin America, and given high
inequality, income poverty i s widespread. An estimated 64 percent of the population currently
lives below the poverty line, while 45 percent lives in extreme poverty. Roughly one-half of the
population resides in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty i s almost 75 percent, versus 57
percent in urban areas. Honduras' social indicators are among the worst in the Latin America
and Caribbean region, but comparable to the indicators observed on average among the other
lower middle-income countries. On October 1998, Honduras suffered the brunt of Hurricane
Mitch, which caused major human and physical damage, and temporarily interrupted the
progressive decline of poverty observed since 1990. Since Mitch, poverty has resumed a
downward trend although improvement has been slow due to low economic growth.

Contributing to these high poverty levels and weak social indicators are a historical record of
poor economic growth coupled with recurrent macroeconomic imbalances, vulnerability to
natural disasters, and a decades-long legacy of periodic fiscal mismanagement. Against this
backdrop, the Govemment launched a Public Sector Modernization Program aimed at restoring
sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic stability and reducing current expenditures through an
overall reduction in the size of the public sector and increased private sector participation in the
provision of public goods and services. IDA, in collaboration with the IDB, supported this
program with a series o f Public Sector Modernization Projects (both in the form of Adjustment
and TA operations). The ongoing Economic and Financial Management Technical Assistance
Credit (EFMTAC) that was approved in 2000, constitutes the last of the operations specifically
targeted to state modernization. The EFMTAC was designed to improve transparency and
accountability in the use of public resources b y supporting the development of the Government's
budgetary planning and evaluation capacities, institutional restructuring within key public
service sectors, and strengthening the technical capacity o f regulatory entities. The proposed
PRSTAC would build on progress achieved under the EFMTAC.

In the wake of the October 1998 onslaught of Hurricane Mitch, the Government presented i t s
Plan for National Reconstruction and Transformation. This plan laid out a comprehensive
agenda to rebuild the country based on: (i) adoption and implementation of a comprehensive
                                            the
poverty reduction strategy; (ii)swift economic recovery and a shift to a higher growth path; and
  i ithe
( i ) long-term sustainability of such measures. In this context, the Government began
preparing i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy, which also became a requirement to qualify for the
HIPC debt relief. In October 2001 the Govemment presented i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (prepared with extensive consultations), which analyzes the causes of poverty and
encompasses reforms and investment programs throughout a broad range of sectors. The main
objective of the PRS i s to reduce poverty b y 24 percentage points over the period 2001-2015 b y
meeting the Millennium Development Goals.

Specifically, the PRSC w i l l support efforts to:

reduced Honduras' access to assistance from the donor community. Having weathered strong
opposition from a divided Congress and other interest groups, the Government finally succeeded
in reestablishing an acceptable macro framework for a new PRGF agreement in the last quarter
of 2003, paving the way for the latter's approval in February 2004.

IDA support to the PRS was embodied in the CAS4approved by the Board in June 2003. The
CAS presents a new framework for World Bank Group assistance, which positions the PRS at
the center in terms of establishing the targets and objectives to be pursued. I t i s based on the
objectives and priorities of the PRS and as explained in the CAS, i t s core goal i s to support
Honduran efforts to shift to a sustainable, higher growth path as a key means of reducing poverty
and inequality in line with PRS and MDG targets. IDA's assistance contemplates a move

towards programmatic lending through a series of Poverty Reduction Credits (PRSCs) designed
to support implementation of the Government's medium-term PRS. Moreover, the CAS
acknowledges the difficulties faced by the Government in implementing its PRS. These
difficulties are caused primarily by shortcomings in the operationalization of the PRS coupled
with weak public sector institutional capacity. In this context, the Government and IDA both
recognize the need to support activities aimed at improving PRS implementation. The proposed
PRSTAC w i l l assist Honduras in moving forward with its PRS by improving the public sector's
institutional capacity to meet poverty reduction targets.

The PRSTAC i s designed to implement the recommendations of the CFFA and CPAR by
supporting the implementation of associated reforms advanced in the PRSC. Since several of the
objectives under the PRSC are being adequately addressed b y ongoing IDA operations, the PRS

in the management and delivery of public services. What follows i s a detailed account of the key
issuedchallenges to be addressed by the PRSTAC.

B. Key sector Challenges and Government Response
The two main challenges to effective implementation and achievement of PRS objectives stem
from shortcomings in the operationalization of the PRS coupled with the public sector's weak
institutional capacity to implement necessary reforms. The proposed operation would seek to
address prevailing institutional weaknesses in the following areas: (i)
                                                                      Government's capacity to
                                                                 i)
manage, monitor, evaluate, and improve PRS implementation; ( iGovernment fiscal, financial,
and fiduciary management; and (iii)  improvements in public services management and delivery.

PRSP implementation and monitoring
As regards progress towards strengthening the Government's capacity to implement, monitor and
improve the PRS, the Government of Honduras has worked with civil society throughout the last
three years to establish a well-defined institutional framework. Such a framework, outlined in
the Ley de Fondo para la Reduccio'n de la Pobreza, contains clearly defined and properly
coordinated lines of duty for the strategy's implementation. Within this context, U N A T i s
expected to play a key technical role on behalf of the Government in leading the other public
agencies, donors and civil society groups in the process by: (i)coordinating the monitoring of the
                              i)
strategy's implementation: ( iassessing results and impacts; ( i )i iconsulting stakeholders; and
(iv) enhancing the overall strategy in a participatory manner. UNAT's weak institutional
capacity and limited resources could however, seriously undermine i t s ability to undertake this
key role. Moreover, U N A T currently lacks not only the necessary technical staff and resources
but also a clear mandate and organizational structure to undertake this leading role in an effective
and sustainable manner.

The success of the PRS depends on the Government's ability to manage its scarce resources in
and effective and efficient manner In this context, there i s a pressing need to enhance donor
coordination, including working with donors to realign their programs with the development
objectives contained in the PRS. Specifically, enhancing coordination (with tools such as




                                                21
SWAps) w i l l help to develop a shared vision and strategy for Government, donors, and other
stakeholders in support of the PRS.

Finally, despite the Government's efforts to make the PRSP a more participatory process, there
i s s t i l l a pressing need to further engage all stakeholders in the Strategy's development and
monitoring through participatory mechanisms at the national, sectoral, and local levels. Such a
shift would entail systematizing the PRS participatory process through consultations with
communities as well as by involving stakeholders in designing and implementing the Strategy's
programs. Greater continuity in the participatory process i s expected to increase stakeholder
impact on guiding and implementing the PRSP.

Public Sector Management
A second area where despite significant progress throughout the last two years, there i s
nonetheless room for important improvement, relates to public sector modernization and public
expenditure management and control.

As regards human resource management, although the prevailing C i v i l Service Law of 1968
appears to constitute comprehensive legislation on all matters related to public personnel
management, this law has not been binding in the last two decades. Instead, many separate
employment regimes have been created providing extraordinary benefits to particular sectors.
This has led to an uncontrolled increase in the public wage bill, which has succeeded in imposing
an unsustainable fiscal burden on society and in creating enormous civil service wage disparities
across the public sector. Meanwhile, HR recruitment, performance evaluations and dismissal
procedures have become increasingly politicized, reducing the public sector's overall capacity to
attract qualified personnel and to deliver public services efficiently. Although the overall level
of public employment in Honduras i s not excessive in comparison to similar countries, serious
staff imbalances exist across sectors. Progress to date toward correcting such deficiencies
include: (i) approval of the Ley de Ordenamiento Retributivo del Sector Pziblico that would
            the
allow the Government to control the fiscal effects of the wage bill; (ii) completion of a
                                                                              the
comprehensive study that reviews the macro-structure o f the public sector, clarifying the roles,
                                                                                   i ithe
functions and service delivery responsibilities of different public entities; and ( i ) drafting
and presentation to Congress of a new comprehensive Public Administration Law to restore
control of personnel management.

Despite these advances, a number of important issues remain to be addressed in connection with
civil service administration, namely: (i) restoration o f a sustainable fiscal situation and a
                                             the
more equitable distribution of benefits via the implementation o f the new salary regulations; ( ii)
                                                                                                 ii
the redefinition and restructuring of public agencies according to revised roles and functions; ( i )
the establishment of new normative and institutional frameworks to govern public employment
limiting the politicization o f HR staffing procedures; and (iv) the implementation of the new civil
service framework, upon its approval.

Financial and fiduciary framework
The Honduran authorities have made significant progress in developing the budget as an
expenditure management tool over the last year. However, a number o f systemic deficiencies
exist, including (i) omission of significant amounts of donor assistance from the budget
                    the



                                               22
undermines the Government's ability gauge the full extent of public efforts in certain areas and
                                       i)
to coordinate public activities, ( i the determination of budget allocations on the basis of
incremental allocations (often with little input from ministries and without reconciliation with
annual operating plans) has weakened the usefulness of sector operating plans and resulted in
low budget credibility; (iii)    weak planning capacity at the sector level adds to the overall
weakness in budget preparation and contributes to the need for repeated budget amendments; and
(iv) the inappropriate budget format presented on the basis of expenditure objects rather than
programmatic classification. The sum of these deficiencies undermines the Government's ability
to employ the budget function as an effective tool to monitor and evaluate the impact of public
efforts in relation to agreed priorities in promoting economic growth and reducing poverty.

The implementation of the integrated financial management system (SIAFI) has improved the
Government's ability to control and manage expenditures. However, SIAFI' s usefulness has
been limited b y rigidities in its format; a lack of comprehensive access to the system by all
sectors that results in delays in recording transactions; and a failure to integrate SIAFI with
various other government information systems. This has led to a proliferation of information
systems in other agencies, without a common platform of operating and technical standards. The
latter has resulted in a duplication of databases and efforts and an overall incompatibility of the
flow of information within the government.

The government's program to improve SIAFI's usefulness contemplates i t s expansion
throughout the entire public sector. In parallel, the Central Government accounting function i s
gradually evolving from a process of merely recording transactions towards including analyses
that add meaning to Government financial statements, in a manner consistent with international
practice. A complete strategy to improve and consolidate financial management enhancement
would be reflected in the new Ley de Administrucidn Finuncieru to be approved in 2004, and in
the implementation of a comprehensive restructuring program in the Ministry of Finance
(SEFIN). The medium-term plan for capacity building and institutional strengthening also
includes significant actions to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity within the
ministerial units.

As regards internal and external audits, internal controls are widely dispersed and
uncoordinated. Furthermore, the Office of the Budget (DGP) exerts centralized ex-ante control
that does not allow for efficient budget execution. Internal audit functions are not well defined
and continue to be controlled by the supreme audit institution (TSC), blurring the lines between
internal and external audits. External audit functions are s t i l l evolving in the wake of reforms
that led to the creation o f the TSC. Although important progress was achieved in completing the
new TSC's reform process, i t s effectiveness i s currently limited b y a lack of qualified personnel,
insufficient financial resources to fully discharge i t s responsibilities, and a lack o f operational
guidelines and regulations.

The TSC has prepared a strategic human resource plan that aims to develop qualified staff, fully
capable of carrying out the financial audit of the Government's accounts and adequately trained
in internationally accepted standards and audit methodologies. I t has also prepared and formally
approved a new set o f regulations to govern its operations and i s catching up on finalizing the
backlog of overdue annual reports, beginning with fiscal year 2001. Further measures
contemplated in the reform program include the implementation o f the regulations of the Ley


                                                 23
Orga`nica del TSC; the approval of a new financial audit manual and regulations; and the
carrying out o f annual ex-post review audits on government procurement processes and
contracts.

Public Services Management and Sectoral Issues
With respect to public services management, remarkable progress was achieved within the last
two years, particularly in the telecommunications, ports, and water and sanitation sectors.
Furthermore, the Government has recently reiterated its commitment to modernize and r e f o m
the electricity sector. The sum of these reform efforts are particularly relevant to objectives
under the PRS as they contribute both to enhancing the foundations of economic growth b y
attracting foreign capital to the country, as well as to improving basic services to benefit the
poor. Continued progress toward increasing private sector participation in the provision of
services w i l l depend on success in addressing pending requirements in each of the sectors as
follows:

In the telecommunication sector, poor service quality, inadequate coverage, high tariffs and
institutional irregularities have constituted important obstacles to increased productivity in this
sector. While progress toward effective private participation has been slow, the Government
recently opened the market for fixed-line local and national telephone services, and competition
in the mobile telephone sector was enhanced via the award of a second concession to a private
operator. These steps are expected to improve services and lower tariffs - a trend already being
observed in the mobile sector. Full private sector participation in the country's telecom sector i s
scheduled for December 2005. Key steps that remain to be taken include: (i) creation of a
                                                                                  the
                               i)
telecom policy cabinet; ( i the implementation of a universal access policy that would
significantly increase service coverage (especially in rural areas); ( i )i i strengthening of the
telecoms regulatory agency; and (iv) the repositioning o f the state telecom company
(HONDUTEL) to enhance its competitiveness vis-&vis private national and international call
market operators.

With regard to the power sector, the prevailing inefficiency in electricity distribution, high
generation costs, inadequate capacity, and irrational tariffs and subsidies continue to undermine
competitiveness in this sector. Honduras' state-owned power company (ENEE) i s currently
crippled by insufficient generation, transmission, and distribution capacity, causing i t to
consistently operate at a loss. Within this context, there i s an urgent need to advance towards a
comprehensive reform of the sector in order to overcome ENEE's capacity constraints,
operational inefficiencies, and the growing demand for electricity (increasing at an annual rate of
7%), central to which would be the need to restructure and strengthen ENEE.

As regards the ports sector, the government's planned program seeks to increase the security,
efficiency and quality of services o f the ports system (focusing on the most important port,
Puerto Corth). I t i s important to note that ports are critical to Honduras' competitiveness since
the sectors where the country enjoys the greatest comparative advantage (Le., agricultural
products, maquila textile industry, forestry and tourism) depend on efficient and high-quality
port services). The establishment of modern regulatory and sector frameworks i s critical to
rectifying prevailing deficiencies in Honduras' port sector. Consequently, a Ports Law (Ley
General de Puertos) was submitted to Congress which: (i)         defines institutional responsibilities



                                                 24
                                        i)
for policy and regulatory functions; ( ienables private sector participation in ports management;
      i iestablishes the necessary parameters to manage ports in accordance with international
and ( i )
security standards. The Government anticipates that the law's passage w i l l significantly increase
private sector participation in the operation andor management o f Ports by end 2004.

With respect to water and sanitation, access to these services has significantly increased
throughout the past years. According to a 2002 household survey, 83 percent o f households have
access to water and 81 percent have access to sanitation. Despite these promising numbers,
problems persist in terms o f (i) prevailing disparities in levels o f access between urban and
                                  the
                                                            i)
rural areas and between poor and wealthy households; ( iirregular service delivery resulting in
an average o f 6 hours o f water service per day; and ( i )  i ipoor quality control that leads to
increased incidence o f water-borne illnesses affecting infant mortality and morbidity. Resolving
these problems and strengthening water and sanitation services are critical to achieving both the
Government's PRS targets and the MDGs. The recent approval of a new sector framework law
constitutes an important first step toward rectifying prevailing deficiencies and improving
service delivery. Implementation o f the new law has been flagged as a priority to overcome
deficiencies in service delivery and to ensure achievement o f the PRS and MDGs. Specifically,
successful implementation of the law require that: (i) the National Planning Board for Water
                                                       both
and Sanitation (CONASA) and the regulatory agency become fully operational and that they
acquire the institutional capacity necessary to govern the sector; (ii)         guidelines ,for the
establishment o f tariffs, performance benchmarks and the development o f monitoring
                                                    i i the
mechanisms be developed and issued; and ( i ) state owned company (SANAA) be
restructured so that the delivery of services i s transferred to the respective municipalities, and
that technical assistance be provided to the municipalities and local water boards.

Project Component 1 Develop the Government's Capacity to Manage, Monitor, Evaluate,
and Improve PRS Implementation
The objective of this component i s to strengthen the Government's capacity to monitor, evaluate,
and open the process of consultation for the PRSP and subsequent progress reports. In this
context, the Government has already begun an intensive effort to link the design of sector
programs with the PRS goals; to introduce modern and transparent reporting systems of
information related to the PRS; to decentralize the PRS' implementation; and to strengthen
stakeholder participation in i t s development and implementation. This component and i t s
subcomponents w i l l be executed by UNAT. The sub-components and related activities are
described in the table below:

Sub-component 1.1:Develop UNAT's Analytical Capacity
There i s a general understanding that PRS monitoring and evaluation need improvement, both in
relation to implementation, as well as in the analysis of results and impact. This sub-component
i s designed to strengthen UNAT's capacity to analyze and disseminate the results of public
programs connected with the Government's poverty reduction strategy. Activities w i l l include:

   1.1.1. Hiring a senior research coordinator and research analysts to form a new unit within
   UNAT specifically responsible for preparing studies on the results and impacts o f
   Government policies related to the PRS.

   1.1.2. Preparing Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSHs) (approximately two per annum)
   in the areas in which the Government i s introducing new policies to guide decision-making
   and to provide stakeholders with a deeper understanding of policy issues.

   1.1.3. Carrying out an information campaign to disseminate and promote studies on policy
   initiatives (within the PRS framework) supported by the Government and to promote the
   results o f the PSIAs related to these initiatives.

Sub-component 1.2: Strengthen the Government's Capacity to Coordinate Foreign Assistance
Government and stakeholders are committed to the creation and implementation of sector wide
programs (SWAps) in selected sectors via the diagnosis and mapping of existing projects, the
alignment and integration o f projects and activities, and the design of adequate standardized
administrative procedures and fiduciary framework. Activities w i l l include:

   1.2.1. Consultants working with Government agencies to strengthen their capacity to
   coordinate international cooperation potentially leading to the establishment of SWAps via
   the diagnosis and mapping o f existing projects and the alignment and integration of projects
   and activities.

   1.2.2. Development and dissemination of adequate guidelines on SWAps standardizing
   administrative procedures and a fiduciary framework.

Sub-component 1.3: Enhance the PRS Consultative Process
Despite efforts to make the PRS a more participatory process, there remains a pressing need to
further involve all stakeholders in the Strategy's development and monitoring through targeted
mechanisms at the national, sectoral, and local levels. This sub-component i s designed to
systematize the PRS participatory process through regular consultations with communities to
identify priorities, complemented b y stakeholder involvement in designing and implementing the
Strategy's programs. Activities w i l l include:

   1.3.1. Strengthening the work of the PRS Consultative Council (CCERP) in monitoring and
   evaluating the PRS implementation, including the perspective from regional-local level. This
   activity w i l l principally consist o f the mapping of all stakeholders involved in the PRS. I t
   will build on and complement the work already done with the support of SIDA, DFID,
   NORAD and the IDB, in mapping Honduras' civil society. The ultimate objective of this
   activity i s to create a viable system o f social audits that w i l l be part o f the national poverty

      monitoring system. This system w i l l contribute to the CCERP initiative to implement
      decentralized regional strategies.

Project Component 2: Improve the Implementationof Public Sector Management
The objective of this component i s to support the implementation of the new Civil Service
legislation, thereby ensuring a more equitable working environment with better performance
incentives and improved quality of civil servants. I t w i l l furthermore strengthen the
Government's budgetary, financial, and fiduciary management fostering a more accurate, timely,
relevant, and transparent public sector. This component and its subcomponents w i l l be executed
by the Direccidn General de Servicio Civil (DGSC), the Secretariat of Finance, and the TSC.

Sub-component 2.1: Implement the New Civil Service Legislation and Continue Efforts to
Reengineer the Public Sector
Informal HR management practices (including the politicization of hiring, performance
evaluation, and dismissal procedures) throughout the public sector have undermined the current
Civil Service Law's (Decree No. 126) capacity to impose effective and transparent personnel
management within the public sector. To address this problem, in December 2003 the
Government approved a new "Ley de Reordenamiento Retributivo del Sector Publico" aimed at
restoring control over public wage administration. The Government has furthermore decided to
support a new "Civil Service Law" to include renewed provisions for the establishment of
transparent and less politically influenced procedures for the recruitment, evaluation, and
dismissal of civil servants. This sub-component i s designed to help the Government enact the
new legislation currently under discussion at the ministerial level. Activities w i l l include the
following:

      2.1.1. Expansion and integration of the Human Resource Management System (SIARH) with
      SIAFI, via the training of personnel and the installment of the infrastructure necessary to
      operate the upgraded system.

      2.1.2. The conceptualization o f the structure and functions of the new Civil Service
      Regulatory Office (that w i l l replace the DGSC with additional supervisory and regulatory
      functions according to the new normative framework). In addition, the purchase of furniture
      and other equipment as necessary for the day-to-day operation of the new Civil Service
      Regulatory Office.



                                                39
   2.1.3. Training o f HR personnel in the analysis and classification o f positions, recruitment
   and selection, performance evaluation, professional development, and personnel motivation
   methods. This activity w i l l be carried out with specialized consultants in the respective
   areas.

   2.1.4. Development o f studies and the provision o f advisory services to asses fiscal impact
   and implications o f salary and remuneration schemes for the overall public sector (under the
   new c i v i l service legislation and the new salary law) in order to ensure i t s fiscal
   sustainability .

   2.1.5. Hiring o f consultants to work with additional selected pilot entities to reengineer their
   organizational structures and t o conduct a comprehensive HR gap analysis for effective
   implementation o f c i v i l service reforms in these entities; and further implement e-
   government strategies.

   2.1.6. Hiring o f an independent firm to evaluate existing personnel and to recruit personnel in
   selected pilot entities thereby initiating the implementation o f the new C i v i l Service
   legislation. This firm w i l l also work to develop the capacity o f those entities to apply the
   new HR policies vis-&-vis posts classification, recruitment and selection, performance
   evaluation, and professional development methods.

Sub-component 2.2: Upgrading and expanding the Capacity of SIAFI
Public sector financial information in Honduras i s o f mixed quality, often outdated, o f limited
coverage, and not fully transparent. This sub-component is designed t o make S I A F I a more
efficient public sector financial resource budgeting and planning tool. This w i l l in turn, improve
the linkage between public spending and PRS targets. Specifically, this sub-component will help
to develop a set of norms, methodologies, and computer-based systems. The implementation o f
Mid-Term Program Budgeting (as contemplated by the PRSC) will be covered with resources
from the ongoing EFMTAC and the IDB. Activities under PRSTAC w i l l include:

   2.2.1. Acquisition o f software, communications and computer equipment, as well as data
   links and licenses to use servers for the upgrading and expansion o f Web based e-SIAFI.
   This activity w i l l be carried out in close coordination with the IDB, which will finance e-
   SIAFI's conceptual development.

   2.2.2. A review o f the Central Government's principal financial accounts in order to improve
   the accuracy and reliability o f public financial information.

Sub-component 2.3: Strengthening Institutional Capacity to Ensure Accountability through
Internal and External Control
The TSC needs to be further strengthened to assume i t s role as the central agency guaranteeing
accountability. This sub-component i s designed to help TSC establish stronger financial
controls, thereby instituting greater transparency in public financial and non-financial
management. Activities will include:




                                                 40
   2.3.1. Training and seminars for the TSC and staff of the internal control units in monitoring
   of public debt, probity and ethics, financial audits, the evaluation of fiscal accounts, public
   procurement, and other control related areas.

   2.3.2. Acquisition of equipment (such as computers and communications) for each area o f the
   TSC.

Project Component 3: Support for Sectoral Activities within the Framework of the PRS
The PRSTAC w i l l support the implementation of public policies suggested in the PRSC. Since
the PRSC program w i l l be implemented over a period of three years, the PRSTAC has a flexible
design to support those sectoral activities that w i l l require technical assistance to fulfill the
actions and conditions specified in the PRSC. In this context, technical assistance w i l l be
provided to specific sectors identified by a Project Steering Committee during Project
implementation. To begin, the following activities in the areas of management and public
infrastructure and service provision were identified in principle as areas to be supported pending
ratification by the Steering Committee. Based on these in principle recommendations, the sub-
components and related activities are described below:

3.1. For the telecommunications sector, financial and legal advisors w i l l be hired to assist the
Government in restructuring and modernizing the Honduras Telecommunications Company
(HONDUTEL). These advisors w i l l serve in addition to other consultants to help with the
drafting of new telecommunications legislation and to strengthen the newly established
telecommunications coordinating unit.

3.2. For the power sector, consultants w i l l be hired to improve the efficiency of the Honduras
Power Company (ENEE) including its restructuring. Other activities in this sector that could be
supported include: the design of institutional and regulatory reforms necessary to improve the
performance of the sector; a comprehensive study of power tariffs, as well as of various
regulatory aspects o f the power sector. Activities could also be undertaken to strengthen the
National Commission of Energy (the entity in charge of regulating this sector). Finally, technical
assistance i s to be provided to identify and implement viable approaches for providing modern
energy services to consumers in rural and semi-urban areas.

3.3. For the ports sector, activities w i l l include technical assistance geared to restructure the
National Ports Company. In addition, consultants w i l l be hired to strengthen the organizational
capacity of the regulatory entity in line with the new Ley General de Puertos.

3.4. For the water sector, activities w i l l include support for CONASA as well as strengthening of
ERSAPS. In CONASA, a technical manager, a planning expert, a decentralization expert, an
economist, and an information systems specialist w i l l be contracted. In ERSAPS, an economist,
two engineers, and a lawyer w i l l be contracted. Other activities in this sector that could be
supported by the fund include: support for an information campaign aimed at the general public,
NGOs, Municipalities and Government in general and on the reforms introduced b y the 2003
Water Law. Finally, the project w i l l provide technical equipment (computers and software) to
allow both agencies to operate efficiently.




                                                41
3.5. For the environmental sector, consultants will be hired to improve the quality and accuracy
of information. Using this improved data, consultants w i l l review the sector's policies and
regulatory framework. Other activities in this sector that could be supported include: workshops
to strengthen the capacity to conduct environmental risk assessments, and a comprehensive
diagnosis of key areas to determine necessary institutional reforms in the sector.

3.6. For the social sectors, consultants w i l l be hired to produce a feasibility study to expand the
role of local education development associations (ADELs) with special attention to basic
infrastructure, transportation networks, and health; and a comprehensive teacher allocation post
review (auditoria de puestos) w i l l be carried out in the departments o f Francisco M o r a z h and
Cortes. Teacher allocation post review could later be extended to cover other departments.

3.7. Finally, the project will finance other sectoral activities yet to be identified. The Steering
Committee w i l l be responsible for identifying and approving those activities within the context
of the PRSC that w i l l be supported under this sub-component. Detailed procedures governing
the identification and approval of sectoral activities w i l l be outlined in the project Operational
Manual.

Project Component 4: Manage PRSTAC Implementation
This component w i l l finance the provision of technical assistance, equipment, training and
operating costs, as necessary, to establish, operate and strengthen the PCU and PEUs to enable
these units to effectively coordinate, monitor and evaluate (including periodical audits) the
implementation of the project activities.

    HONDURAS: POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

The project w i l l be implemented over a period of three years from July 2004 to June 2007.
Various government agencies w i l l take part in implementing project components and
subcomponents. This Annex describes the implementation arrangements related to: (i)   project
coordination and participating agencies; (ii)      co-financing arrangements and coordination
mechanisms; and ( i )i imonitoring and evaluation arrangements.

Project Direction, Coordinationand Implementation

Project Direction
The Government w i l l create a Project Steering Committee (PSC) to direct the overall
management, coordination, and supervision of the proposed operation. The PSC w i l l be headed
by the Secretary o f the Presidency and w i l l include the Secretary o f Finance as well as the
Executive Secretary of the CPME. The Director/Coordinator of the CPME w i l l serve as
Technical Secretary of the Committee. Representatives from IDA and bilateral donors w i l l also
participate in PSC meetings in order to ensure eligibility of all selected activities to be supported
by project proceeds.

The main roles and responsibilities of the PSC w i l l include: (i) discussion and approval of
                                                                   i)
project's annual action plans including resource allocations; ( i analysis and approval of
                                                           i idiscussion and approval o f annual
activities supported under the project's component three; ( i )
procurement plans; (iv) analysis and consolidation of semi-annual progress reports and results
monitoring frameworks; and (v) overall supervision of project implementation.

Project Coordination
The Executive Secretariat of the Presidential Commission for State Modernization (CPME) w i l l
maintain the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) created under EFMTAC. The CPME i s a
specialized technical commission created in 1992 that i s headed b y an Executive Secretary who
reports directly to the President and receives support from a technicaYadministrative unit
directed b y a National Director. Since 1996, the CPME has served as the PCU of the Public
Sector Modernization Structural Adjustment and Technical Assistance Credits, the ongoing
EFMTAC, and has furthermore been administering other technical assistance projects financed
by the IDB and other donors.

The CPME's role w i l l include overall project coordination as well as consolidation o f the
project's financial management' procurement, and auditing functions. The CPME w i l l also be
responsible for administering the Special Account and for providing the other executing units
with necessary funds to implement their respective activities.                Specifically, the key
responsibilities to be undertaken b y the PCU w i l l include: (i)
                                                                 consolidation and submission of the
project's annual action plan to the PSC for consideration and approval; (ii)      consolidation and
submission of the project's procurement plan to PSC for consideration and approval; ( i )         ii
administration of the Special Account, as well as consolidation and submission o f financial
management reports to the Bank's consideration; (iv) contracting of annual external auditing




                                                 53
services in accordance with Bank procedures; and (v) consolidation o f the project's results
monitoring framework.

Project Implementation
Separate Project Executing Units (PEUs) w i l l be organized within each o f the participating
agencies (i.e., UNAT, SEFINKJAP, DGSC, and TSC) to carry out the project's day-to-day
activities. Each PEU w i l l be responsible for implementing i t s corresponding activities and
subprojects. Each unit will furthermore be equipped with accredited staff acceptable to the Bank
to handle financial management and procurement work. The main responsibilities of PEUs w i l l
include: (i)                                                                         i)
              preparing annual action plans for their respective activities; ( i preparing the
quarterly and annual procurement plan for each o f their activities; ( i ) i iconducting procurement
processes for activities under their respective activities in accordance with Bank procedures, in
addition to signing contracts on behalf o f the Government; (iv) administering separate subsidiary
accounts in local currency; (v) implementing project activities associated with the respective
components; (vi) monitoring results indicators and preparing semi-annual progress reports; and
(vii) maintaining financial records and files o f activities for auditing purposes.

The following table presents the organizational structure o f the proposed operation and the
distribution o f responsibilities among the respective PEUs:

             4.   Proiect Management                                    CPME



The Technical Advisory Unit o f the Presidency (Unidad de Asesoramiento Tkcnico de la
Presidencia, UNAT) w i l l be responsible for the implementation o f project component 1. T o this
end, UNAT's capacity w i l l be strengthened by technical advisors and the appointment of
financial management and procurement specialists.



                                                        54
The General Directorate of Civil Service (DGSC) w i l l implement specific activities under
subcomponent 2.1 , and will have CPME administrative support to facilitate successful
implementation o f this subcomponent.

The Secretary o f Finance (SEFIN) will be responsible for subcomponent 2.2. Since activities
under this subcomponent will be closely linked to a parallel IDB project geared to SEFIN's
institutional ~trengthening,~ existing Project Management Unit (Unidud de Administrucidn de
                              the
Proyectos, UAP) w i l l also serve as this subcomponent's PEU. The coordination of related IDB
and Bank activities within a common PEU i s expected to increase economies of scale and to
promote synergies. To ensure UAP's capacity to effectively manage activities under both the
IDB project and subcomponent 2.2, an international project coordinator (ATP) w i l l be hired
under the IDB project to serve as technical leader for both projects; the UAP capacity to direct
financial management and procurement requirements under both projects w i l l also be
strengthened.

The Supreme Audit Institution (TSC) w i l l be responsible for the implementation of
subcomponent 2.3. Since a Project Executing Unit in TSC has been created under the EFMTAC,
the existing unit w i l l be maintained and enhanced in order to continue implementing this
PRSTAC subcomponent.

The CPME w i l l be responsible for the administration of funds under Component 3, which i s
geared to support various sectoral activities related to the PRS and PRSC implementation. While
certain activities w i l l be also implemented b y the CPME (i.e. telecommunications, electricity,
ports, and water & sanitation), the CPME w i l l also transfer resources to other participating
agencies.

In order to clearly define roles and responsibilities for project administration, the borrower w i l l
prepare and execute Inter-institutional Arrangements among CPME, UNAT, DGSC and
SEFINAJAP; and w i l l sign a Subsidiary Agreement with TSC.

Co-financing arrangements and coordination mechanisms
Since the project w i l l be co-financed with bilateral contributions, coordination and joint-
supervision mechanisms w i l l be set up with the Bank and other donors. The following initial
partnership arrangements will support the Government in areas related to PRSTAC objectives:
(i) direct co-financing contributions from the Swedish Agency for International Development
(SIDA) and the British Department for International Development (DFID) to support PRSTAC
activities; (ii)parallel financing for a complementary IDB project to support the institutional
strengthening o f SEFIN and UNAT; and ( i )    i i participation of other donors supporting the
Government in areas related to PRSTAC objectives in conjunction with PRSTAC implementing
agencies.

To ensure adequate coordination among donors and multilateral financial institutions, the Bank
team (in coordination with Government authorities) w i l l establish coordination mechanisms at

 Proyecto de Apoyo a la Gestio'n Fiscal. An IDB-sponsored U S $ 15 million equivalent Technical Assistance Credit
Approved by its Board on May 2004.
two levels: (i) Joint Supervision Committee with the participation o f co-financing and parallel-
               a
financing agencies; and (ii) broader coordination mechanism among all interested donors under
                           a
the existing G-15 donor coordination scheme.

The Joint Supervision Committee (JSC) w i l l include one representative from each of the
respective co-financing donor agencies, the IDB and the Bank. The JSC w i l l have a rotating
chairperson selected from among i t s members. The main responsibilities of the JSC w i l l include:
(i) analysis and ultimate authorization of the project's proposed annual action plans; (ii)
organizing and conducting semi-annual joint supervision missions to oversee project
                   i iorganizing and conducting a mid-term review o f implementation progress
implementation; ( i )
to adjust project design and priorities as warranted; (iv) maintaining policy dialogue with the
Government and other donors on strategic matters affecting project implementation; and (v)
agreeing on the scope and approach for the project's ex-post evaluation upon completion.

Co-financing plans w i l l be implemented via the establishment of a Bank-managed multi-donor
Trust Fund to disburse proceeds in parallel. Administrative arrangements for this Trust Fund
w i l l be identical to those established for the Credit's implementation and co-financing partners
w i l l receive periodic reports on the use of their funds.

IDB parallel financing w i l l be implemented with close coordination between project teams in
both Banks. Moreover, components under SEFIN and UNAT w i l l share the same project
coordinator.   Participation in the JSC w i l l also provide safeguards against overlap or
inefficiency.

With respect to the coordination mechanisms with other donors under G-15 group, the JSC
chairperson will also lead the Governance sub-group of G-15. Permanent interaction with other
donors w i l l both keep them informed of project implementation and also provide feedback from
related projects to facilitate coordination with PRSTAC activities.

Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
 n
I accordance with Bank policies, the Government w i l l implement the project under result-based
supervision and monitoring arrangements. Annex 3 presents the Results and Monitoring
Framework agreed upon with the Government for the project. This framework w i l l be the main
instrument for supervision activities.

Each year the Government w i l l prepare and present to the Bank a proposed action plan and
expected results according to the results framework. The JSC w i l l focus i t s supervision activity
                                                             n
on assessing whether or not these results were achieved. I the event that results were not
attained in accordance with the agreed plan, the results framework would be adjusted to both
reflect actual achievements and to guide future implementation towards meeting core results.
Adjustments to project implementation and action plans are to be agreed upon between the
donors' JSC and the Government's PSC during supervision missions.

While the focus of supervision activities w i l l be results evaluation and monitoring, the
management of inputs w i l l also be reviewed. The CPME w i l l be responsible for coordinating
and consolidating the integration of financial statements and audits for the entire project. Each



                                                56
PEU o f a project componenthbcomponent w i l l keep detailed records o f i t s physical and
financial operations and w i l l inform the CPME on both a quarterly and annual basis. These
records w i l l be kept in accordance with the Bank's accepted practices and guidelines, as well as
in compliance with the country's internal regulations.

The CPME w i l l prepare an Operational Manual (approved by the PSC and acceptable to the
Bank) establishing detailed procedures for project implementation and a clear description o f the
roles o f each executing agency. Presentation and acceptance o f such Operational Manual will be
a condition for demonstrated project effectiveness.

    HONDURAS: POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

The project has in place an adequate organization and staff with sufficient experience and
professional qualifications to carry out the necessary financial management activities.
Accounting and internal control procedures were found to be acceptable, although the relevant
manuals for these should be updated to reflect the proposed arrangements o f the PRSTAC.
Arrangements for the flow o f funds and recovery o f advances to the special account were
considered adequate.

The accounting system meets the Bank's minimum requirements, and financial statements for
previous projects financed b y IDA have been audited by an independent firm under acceptable
arrangements.

The project's total amount i s US$12.9 million, o f which US$S.O million (equivalent) will be
financed by IDA, US$ 3.7 million by SIDA, US$0.3 b y DFID and the Government o f Honduras
w i l l finance the remaining portion o f US$O.8 million (10 percent o f the IDA Credit). The project
i s expected to be implemented over a period o f three years.

The current IDA-financed E F M T A C (Credit No. 3414-HO) was implemented by three project-
executing units (PEU) which reported to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at the Comisidn
Presidencial de Modemizacio'n del Estado (CPME). The P C U (which was originally established
in 1996 under the Public Sector Modernization Project, PSMP - supporting both the Structural
Adjustment and Technical Assistance Credits) oversees coordination and implementation o f all
components, and has been the primary interlocutor between the government and IDA. The P C U
provides all financial and project reports as well as the single financial audit report for the
project.

Under the PRSTAC, each o f the three (UNAT, TSC, SEFINLJAP) PEUs will maintain a
separate bank account at the Central Bank, for funds that are advanced f r o m the IDA Credit's
Special Account. Each PEU has adequate staff to implement i t s component and manage i t s
fiduciary activities, including financial management. The main responsibilities o f the PEU w i l l
be to: (i)                                                                                      i)
            prepare annual work p l a n s h d g e t to implement i t s componenthubcomponent; ( i
prepare an annual procurement plan for each component/subcomponent; ( i )             i i conduct
procurement processes, in accordance with Bank and applicable national procedures and enter
into contracts on behalf o f the government, for activities under its component/subcomponent;
(iv) manage subsidiary (special) accounts in local currency; (v) implement project activities
associated with i t s componenthubcomponent in accordance with its annual work plan; (vi)
monitor results indicators and prepare semi-annual progress reports; and (vii) maintain copies o f
financial records and documentation for i t s components/subcomponents.

The PCU is responsible for keeping accounting records and supporting documents o f project
transactions, preparing requests for disbursements, presenting financial reports, and coordinating
the external audit. Under the EFMTAC, close collaboration and coordination between agencies
has made i t possible for these tasks to be adequately executed. W e expect that similar




                                                 59
arrangements (including formalllegal subsidiary agreements between agencies) w i l l be finalized
for the PRSTAC.

Experience and preparation. Through their participation in the PMSP, financial management
staff in the P C U has gained enough experience (more than four years) and possess the
appropriate professional credentials to properly carry out their fiduciary duties. The financial
management staff in both the TSC and SEFIN/UAP has also gained significant experience b y
participating in the PSMS. However, the project contemplates some activities to reinforce
fiduciary management capacity in these two institutions. As for UNAT, more substantive
preparative work w i l l be necessary to ensure that they properly fulfill their fiduciary duties.
These activities will include, among other things, the hiring o f a fiduciary specialist.

Training. Financial management staff at the P C U (and PEU-TSC) has received Bank training in
Financial Management, Procurement and Disbursements as recently as August 2003 during a
countrywide fiduciary workshop. They also hold copies o f the Bank's Manual for Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) and the Guidelines and Terms o f Reference for Audits o f Projects
with Financing by the World Bank in LCR.

Organization. The P C U maintains a description o f tasks for key personnel at project
coordination. Moreover, project administrative staff work under consulting contracts with
specific terms o f reference that are updated annually. The project's organizational chart and
structure description were prepared b y the PCU. I t i s considered that current organizational
arrangements allow the project to properly monitor and control i t s activities.

Internal Controls
Operational manual. A comprehensive "Internal Control Procedures Manual" was originally
prepared in October 1996 for the PSMP, and was updated under the EFMTAC project. Based on
the PRSTAC project arrangements and current Bank Guidelines, the PCU should update the
manual and submit a copy to the Bank. Once the manual has been reviewed and approved, i t
will be presented and distributed to staff in each o f the PEUs. Furthermore, its contents w i l l be
updated periodically and i t s observance w i l l be monitored regularly (e.g., external audits would
include selective reviews o f compliance with the procedures established in the manual).

Segregation of duties and levels of approval. The PCU and PEUs described the steps,
documentation and officials/entities involved in the processes o f contracting and payment. F r o m
an internal control standpoint, i t i s considered that critical functioning responsibilities o f
authorization/recording/custody are adequately segregated and established procedures for use o f
funds are acceptable. Even so, some treasury and accounting functions (e.g., preparation o f bank
reconciliations) w i l l be further separated.

Bank accounts. Under the EFMTAC, a Special Account for Credit funds i s held at the Central
Bank and managed by SEFIN. In order to streamline payment procedures, separate "sub-
accounts" were opened at the Central Bank for use b y the PCU and PEUs. Signatories at such
accounts are the Executive Secretariat o f the C P M E and the Coordinators o f the PEUs
respectively.    Additional accounts are held for counterpart funds.   The bank account
reconciliations are prepared on a monthly basis in a timely manner.



                                                 60
Payroll. Payments for project coordination staff are based on the annual consulting contracts
approved b y the Coordinators at the PCU and PEUs. Payroll i s paid through the project bank
accounts, following the applicable control procedures. Advances to officials are prohibited.

Fixed assets. Receiving reports signed by the three parties involved (the PCUPEU, the
Government Unit receiving the goods, and the providers) are kept for goods acquired under the
EFMTAC (as was also practiced under the PSMP). Similarly, a subsidiary record of assets
received by the project i s maintained through the accounting software. Physical inventories of
goods under the custody of the PCU are performed twice a year.

Flow of funds
The PCU has sufficient experience in the preparation o f requests for Credit disbursements, use
and reconciliation of the Special Account, control of advances and recoveries (justifications),
including the preparation of Statements o f Expenditure (SOEs). Likewise, sufficient knowledge
has been acquired on procedures for disbursing of counterpart funds. However, i t was noted that
transfers from the Special Account to the operational "sub accounts" were not made to meet
expenditures for a limited period (less than 30 days) as required by Bank/lDA guidelines. The
PCU was advised that compliance with such standard must be enforced. Disbursements w i l l be
transaction-based and w i l l be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), and the
preparation of SOEs w i l l be the responsibility of the PCU with clearance o f SEFIN.

Under the PRSTAC, a Special Account for Credit funds w i l l be opened at the Central Bank for
the purpose of advancing funds to and separating transactions related to the PEUs (UNAT, TSC
and SEFINNAP). Additionally, separate bank accounts w i l l be opened for counterpart
contributions for the project.

Planning, budgeting and financial reporting

Plans and budgets. Under the EFMTAC, in order to properly plan and monitor activities for the
project, annual operational plans, monitoring indicators and budgets are prepared and
disaggregated by quarter.

Financial reports. Currently, the PCU in coordination with the PEUs prepares quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports based on the formats recommended b y the Bank (including
reconciling the subsidiary account with the Special Account) on a quarterly basis. Annual
financial statements have been prepared and audited under Bank guidelines.

Monitoring reports. The PCU and PEUs w i l l prepare semi-annual progress reports, based on
the agreed project indicators. This w i l l eliminate the need to produce separate quarterly reports
under the FMR guidelines.

Accounting system

Accounting records. These are currently kept on a timely basis b y the PCU, based on i t s own
information and supporting documents, as well as those submitted on a monthly basis b y the



                                                61
PEUs. Analogous arrangements will be in place for the PRSTAC. Documentation of
transactions since project inception are properly kept in the PCU's offices. Such documents will
be maintained there for a period of five years in accordance with local norms.

Chart of accounts. The current chart of accounts allows for the classification of expenditures
by disbursement category, project component and source of funds. However, i t i s not integrated
to the Governmental Chart of Accounts (SIAFI). Project expenditures are recorded separately
along government budget/accounting classification for registration in SIAFI. Since the SIAFI i s
in the process o f being technology updated (along with a reclassification of government
budgeting and accounting standards), i t i s advisable to use a separate accounting for recording
project transactions, expenditures and activities.

External Audits

The EFMTAC has been audited annually b y an independent firm (KPMG Peat Marwick)
acceptable to the World Bank, under arrangements in accordance with Bank requirements. The
2002 audit report (which was considered acceptable to the Bank) contained a Qualified-
Exception opinion on the project financial statements, no material instances of noncompliance
with the clauses o f the Credit agreement and applicable laws and regulations, and only certain
minor internal control weaknesses. The cause for the qualified opinion was due to ineligible
expenditures that were incurred by the previous Contraloria General de la Repiblica (now the
Tribunal Superior de Cuentas). These expenditures lacked supporting documentation and the
amount has subsequently been returned to the Special Account.

will be prepared in accordance with current Bank Guidelines, w i l l provide for the execution o f
interim audit visits. The P C U will prepare, if needed, an action plan t o address any issues and

    HONDURAS: POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

A. General
Procurement for the proposed project w i l l be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated November 2003; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed b y the
Loadcredit, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between
the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan w i l l be updated at
least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements
in institutional capacity.

Procurement of non-consulting services: Non consulting services include: (i)   communication
                                                                   i)
services such as TV, radio and newspaper spots and Ads; and ( i Link services for IT. The
standard bidding documents w i l l be based on the Bank's SBDs for non-consulting services and
when agreed with the Bank w i l l be included in the Operations Manual.

Selection of Consultants: Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than
$200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.

The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as
model contracts for works and goods procured, are presented in the Project Operations Manual.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement
Procurement activities w i l l be carried out b y 'four agencies namely: (i)   The Presidential
                                                                i)
Commission for the Modernization of the State (CPME), ( i General Comptroller's Office
          i i Finance Ministry (SEFIN), and (iv) National Technical Advisory Unit (UNAT).
(TSC), ( i )
CPME, TSC and SEFIN are the implementing agencies under the Economic and Financial
Management, EFMTAC (Credit No. 34 14-HO). Although these agencies have gained
considerable experience in Bank rules and procedures under the EFMTAC, the hiring o f a
procurement officer acceptable to the Bank w i l l be required for each agency as a condition o f
effectiveness. In the case of UNAT, this unit has no experience with Bank's projects. Besides
the hiring o f a procurement officer which i s a condition o f effectiveness as well, close
supervision w i l l be required until such time that UNAT acquires the necessary experience with
Bank operations.

An assessment of the capacity o f the Implementing Agency to implement procurement actions
for the project has been carried out by Luis Prada on April 28, 2004. The assessment reviewed
the organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the
project's staff responsible for procurement Officer and the Ministry's relevant central unit for
administration and finance.

C. Procurement Plan
The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation which
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
Borrower and the Project Team on M a y 12, 2004 and i s available at each o f the implementing
agencies. I t w i l l also be available in the project's database and in the Bank's external website.
The Procurement Plan w i l l be updated in agreement with the Project Team annually o r as
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended one supervision mission per year t o
visit the field to carry out post review o f procurement actions.

    HONDURAS: POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

The proposed operation w i l l focus on capacity building activities, and i t i s therefore difficult to
quantify outputs and benefits, and to precisely calculate rates of return. Nevertheless, since
positive fiscal impacts are expected, project implementation i s projected to generate economic
gains. The most noteworthy economic and fiscal savings are expected to result from: (ij the
design and implementation of an integrated monitoring system and the development of indicators
to track PSRP advances that would align resources with poverty reduction activities; ( i               i)
strengthening o f social entities monitoring systems that would improve the government's ability
to track benefits paid to citizens and other services delivered to recipients, reducing the
duplication of payments and other subsidies; ( i )   i i developing UNAT' s analytical capacity to
analyze and disseminate the results of the government's poverty reduction strategy, and assess
the impact of PRS programs that would increase the economic returns of public investments; (iv)
systematizing the PRSP participatory process through regular consultations with communities
and other stakeholders in the design of PRSP programs that would result in a more transparent
and results-oriented management of public resources; (v j a more qualified and professional staff
in the civil service that would improve public service delivery and effectiveness; (vi> upgrading
and expanding the SIAFI that would make the budget preparation process more transparent and
effective, thereby permitting better budget allocation decisions and hence producing substantial
fiscal savings; (vii) strengthening the institutional capacity o f the TSC that would ensure greater
accountability and therefore more effective monitoring and control of financial flows; and (viii)
improved management and provision of public services b y introducing competition through
increased private sector involvement that would improve the quality and delivery of services in
the following selected sectors: telecommunications, energy, ports, water and sanitation,
environment and other social sectors.

Moreover, better management of the government's human resources, promoted through the civil
service reform, should lead to improved performance and efficiency gains by reducing the
unsustainable fiscal burden caused b y public sector wage disparities. Institutional modernization
w i l l reduce the government's operating costs and improve the delivery o f public services to
businesses and the public at large. The fiscal impact of improved resource allocation reduces
waste, and better planning and execution may be significant, as efficiency gains translate into
reduced administrative costs for a given level o f output. These in turn w i l l contribute to a better
investment climate, which in Honduras i s essential for long-term economic growth, the reduction
of unemployment and the improvement o f critical social conditions.
