1. 
Country and Sector Background 
Background.  
Historically, Honduras has been one of the poorest countries in Latin America, 
with a population of 6.6 million people and an annual per capita income estimated at US$920 in 
2002. Despite a steady decline in poverty indicators, an estimated 63 percent of the population 
currently lives below the poverty line. Income inequality remains high, and most of the poor live 
in rural areas where the incidence of poverty is almost 75 percent. Moreover, Honduras’ social 
indicators are among the worst in Latin America. Contributing to these high poverty levels and 
weak social indicators are a historical record of poor economic growth coupled with recurrent 
macroeconomic imbalances, vulnerability to natural disasters, and a decades-long legacy of 
periodic fiscal mismanagement. Against this backdrop, Honduras embarked on a series of 
ambitious economic and structural reform programs throughout the 1990s o stabilize the 
economy, promote faster economic growth, and improve social conditions.  The International 
Development Association (IDA) supported the Government’s new reform program by approving 
a series of Public Sector Modernization Projects (both in the form of Adjustment and TA 
operations) aimed broadly at restoring fiscal sustainability and increasing private sector 
participation in the provision of public goods, the last of  which is the Economic and Financial 
Management Technical Assistance Credit (EFMTAC) which is expected to be completed by 
mid-2005.  
 
Honduras’ Poverty Reduction Strategy.
  In the wake of the October 1998 onslaught of 
Hurricane Mitch, which had a devastating impact on Honduras’ population, economy and 
infrastructure, the Government launched an ambitious strategy to break free from its legacy of 
poverty and inequality.  Since then, poverty reduction has remained central to the Government’s 
reform agenda.  This continued dedication to reducing poverty is clearly evidenced by the 
Government’s commitment to the HIPC initiative for which it developed a Poverty Reduction 
Page  2
 
 
Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2001 and an associated first Progress Report (PRSP-PR), discussed by 
the Boards of the Bank and IMF in February 2004.  The main objective of the PRSP is to reduce 
poverty by 24 percent over the period 2001-15
 
by meeting the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs). The strategy is founded on six pillars: (i) accelerating equitable and sustainable growth 
to levels consistent with income poverty reduction targets; (ii) reducing rural poverty; (iii) 
reducing urban poverty; (iv) enhancing investment in human capital; (v) strengthening social 
protection for vulnerable groups; and (vi) ensuring the strategy’s longevity through governance 
and institutional reforms and enhanced environmental sustainability. These pillars are 
complemented by three crosscutting themes - gender equity, environmental sustainability, and 
decentralization. 
 
Despite the Government’s unyielding commitment to the reforms espoused under the PRSP, 
implementation progress during the first two years has been disappointing. The overall 
deterioration in Honduras’ public finances, combined with the Government’s inability to move 
forward on key structural reforms (due to both institutional weaknesses and political opposition), 
were key contributing factors to the PRSP’s lackluster performance.  This adverse situation led 
to the collapse of the PRGF arrangement with the IMF at the end of 2001. Having weathered 
strong opposition from a divided Congress and other interest groups, the Government succeeded 
in reestablishing an acceptable macro framework for a new PRGF agreement in the last quarter 
of 2003, paving the way for the latter’s approval in February 2004. 
 
Poverty Reduction Support Credits.  
In light of the unsatisfactory progress to date, the PRSP-
PR identifies a set of priorities, expected outcomes, and revised institutional arrangements aimed 
at improving PRSP implementation over the next few years.  In line with the above, IDA (in 
close coordination with other donors) will prepare a series of quick-disbursing Poverty 
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), designed to support implementation of this medium-term 
PRS, the first of which is expected to be approved by end-June 2004, is summarized in Box 1:

Project objective.
 The PRSCs are envisaged as a series of quick-disbursing operations which together will support 
a medium-term program of policy and institutional reforms to accelerate implementation of the Government’s 
PRS. 
 
More specifically, the PRSC will support Government efforts to: 
• 
accelerate 
pro-poor growth
, via reforms aimed at increasing competitiveness and maximizing the potential for 
new investment and employment-creation for men and women in both urban and rural areas; these reforms 
will take place in the wake of  new regional and international agreements, in particular the Central America 
Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); 
• 
increase the impact and efficiency of resources devoted to 
human development and social protection
, with a 
focus on diversification of responsibility for service provision and increased empowerment of beneficiaries of 
key services; 
• 
increase the medium- and long-term sustainability of poverty reduction initiatives through policy and 
institutional reforms to strengthen 
governance and public sector management
 and improve management of 
the 
environment
, particularly Honduras’ extensive protected areas. 
 
In addition, the PRSC will support the Government’s initiatives to systematize consultation processes around the 
poverty reduction strategy and strengthen monitoring and evaluation at both the national and community levels.

2. Objectives 
The objective of the Poverty Reduction Technical Assistance Credit (PRSTAC) is to assist the 
Government of Honduras in improving its institutional capacity in the areas of planning, public 
expenditure management, accountability, public administration, public service delivery, and 
participatory monitoring, thereby facilitating implementation of the PRSP. 
 
The PRSTAC is designed to support the implementation of reforms advanced in the PRSC. The 
Government’s institutional framework needs to overcome weaknesses that are undermining 
PRSP implementation. Specifically, the PRSTAC’s development objectives are to: (i) develop 
the Government’s capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate and improve PRS implementation by 
giving all stakeholders access to effective mechanisms for the design and control of the 
government’s poverty reduction programs; (ii) support the implementation of the Public Human 
Resource Reform thereby ensuring a more equitable working environment with better 
performance incentives and improved civil service quality, and improve public service 
management and delivery in key economic and social sectors; and (iii) strengthen the 
Government’s fiscal, financial and fiduciary management, resulting in a more accurate, timely, 
relevant and transparent public sector. 
 
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
The 2003 Honduras CAS
1
 is based on the objectives and priorities expressed in the PRSP.  The 
Bank’s strategy includes a PRSC and a PRS TAC to support the implementation of public 
policies suggested by the PRSP.  Moreover, the CAS acknowledges the difficulties faced by the 
Government in the implementation of its Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). These difficulties 
are caused primarily by shortcomings in the operationalization of the PRS, coupled with weak 
public sector institutional capacity. In this context, the Government and IDA both recognize the 
need to support activities aimed at improving PRS implementation.  The proposed PRS TAC will 
assist Honduras in moving forward with its PRS by strengthening the public sector’s institutional 
capacity to meet poverty reduction targets.   
 
4. Description 
The proposed PRSTAC would constitute a US$X million operation that would finance 30 
separate activities. The project would be comprised of an IDA credit of US$10 million, 
supplemented by co-financing from the Government of Sweden in the amount of US$X million 
and from the Government of United Kingdom totaling US$X. The project would consist of three 
main components. See Annex 4 for detailed description and Annex 5 for detailed cost 
breakdown. 
 
Project Component 1: Develop the Capacity to Manage, Monitor, Evaluate and Improve 
PRS Implementation.
 
The objective of this component would be to strengthen the 
Government’s capacity to monitor, evaluate, and open the process of consultation for the PRSP 
and subsequent progress reports. The following sub-components will be supported by this 
operation:

• 
Sub-Component 1.1
: 
Strengthen the Government’s Capacity to Monitor and Evaluate 
PRSP Advances. 
This sub-component would be implemented through UNAT and INE and 
would be geared to implement an integrated monitoring system in UNAT and to improve the 
capacity of three strategic institutions (Health, Education, and the National Registry of 
People) to track changes in key social indicators in order to improve the Government’s 
capacity to monitor PRSP advances. Activities under this subcomponent would include: (i) 
the design and implementation of an integrated monitoring system and the development of 
monitoring indicators (to be financed by the IDB’s parallel project); and (ii) the 
strengthening of INE to support improvements in the national registry of people as well as 
the administrative registries of the education and health sectors. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 1.2
: 
Develop UNAT’s Analytical Capacity.  
This sub-component would 
seek to strengthen UNAT’s capacity to analyze and disseminate the results of public 
programs associated with the Government’s poverty reduction strategy. Activities under this 
subcomponent would include: (i) the recruitment of specialized staff for UNAT; (ii) the 
definition of UNAT’s strategic vision, mission and organizational structure; (iii) the carrying-
out of impact analyses and assessments of PRS- related programs and the dissemination of 
such studies; and (iv) the design and implementation of sector wide programs (SWAPs) in 
selected sectors through diagnosing and mapping of existing projects, the alignment and 
integration of projects and activities, and the design of adequate standardized administrative 
procedures and fiduciary framework. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 1.3: Enhance the PRS Consultative Process.  
This sub-component would 
systematize the PRSP participatory process through regular consultations with communities 
to identify priorities, complemented by stakeholder involvement in designing and 
implementing the Strategy’s programs. Activities under this subcomponent would include: (i) 
the implementation of an information campaign to disseminate the PRS’ goals and targets; 
(ii) strengthening of work undertaken by the PRSP Consultative Council (CCERP) in PSR 
monitoring and evaluation; (iii) the development of systems to encourage local participation 
in PRS programs and projects monitoring; and (iv) analysis and evaluation of prospects for 
expanding decentralized services of a number of sectors to multifunctional community 
associations. 
 
Project Component 2: Support the Implementation of Public Human Resources Reform 
and Improvements in Public Service Management and Delivery. 
The objective of this 
component would be to support the implementation of the Civil Service Act, thereby ensuring a 
more equitable working environment with better performance incentives and improved civil 
service quality. It would furthermore seek to enhance competitiveness and the investment 
climate by improving the efficiency and quality of basic public services. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 2.1: Implement the New Civil Service Law.
  This sub-component would 
help the Government implement the Civil Service Law currently under discussion at the 
ministerial level. Activities under this subcomponent would include: (i) the implementation 
of the Human Resource Management system (SIARH) by gathering data from all public 
sector agencies and by training personnel to fully operate the system; (ii) support to the 
implementation of the new institutional arrangements governing civil service reform; (iii) the

remuneration scheme for the public sector ensuring its fiscal sustainability; (iv) training 
public sector personnel in topics related to human resource management; (v) support 
Government efforts to reengineer the public administration in three additional Public 
Secretariats (possible candidates could include SERNA, SOPTRAVI, and XXX); (vi) the 
contracting of specialized firms to carry out independent personnel evaluation activities in 
pilot agencies; and (vii) the carrying out of dissemination programs and information 
campaigns to build consensus around the reform. 
 
 
• 
Sub-Component 2.2
: 
Improve the Management and Provision of Public Services.
  This 
sub-component would seek to promote private sector participation in the provision of public 
infrastructure services and to encourage decentralization in the management of social 
services. Activities under this subcomponent would support: (i) legal and technical work 
underlying the modernization of HONDUTEL, the consolidation of the government’s policy-
making capacity, and strengthening of the regulatory agency CONATEL; (ii) legal and 
technical work geared to reform the energy sector and to facilitate the restructuring and 
modernization of ENEE; (iii) the implementation and strengthening of institutional 
arrangements governing the ports sub-sector and support to efforts aimed at attracting private 
investment for ports concessions; (iv) strengthening of the Planning agency (CONASA) and 
the Regulatory agency (ERSAPS) in the water and sanitation sector; (v) studies aimed at 
improving the quality and accuracy of environmental data and risk assessments as well as 
reviewing the policies and regulatory framework underlying the environmental sector; and 
(vi) CPME’s coordination and technical advisory activities.   
 
Project Component 3: Strengthen Public Expenditure Management.
  
The objective of this
 
component would be to strengthen the Government’s budgetary, financial, and fiduciary 
management to produce a more accurate, timely, relevant, and transparent public sector  
 
• 
Sub-Component 3.1: Making SIAFI Operational
. This sub-component would help develop 
a set of norms, methodologies, and computer-based systems that would allow the 
Government to prepare an effective and transparent budget compatible with the PRS.  
Activities under this subcomponent would include: (i) reform of the budget system and the 
introduction of medium-term and result-based approaches to the budget formulation and 
implementation processes; (ii) the development of an internet-based and enhanced version of 
SIAFI (e-SIAFI); (iv) the implementation of e-SIAFI at the central and de-concentrated 
levels; (v) conducting a clean-up exercise of Central Government’s financial accounts; and 
(vi) training in and dissemination of financial management  norms, procedures and systems 
for personnel of all public sector entities2. 
 
• 
Sub-Component 3.2: Strengthening the Institutional Capacity to Ensure Accountability 
through Internal and External Control.  
This sub-component would be geared to help TSC 
establish stronger financial controls, thereby instituting greater transparency in public 
financial management. Activities under this subcomponent would include: (i) the 
enhancement of TSC’s institutional capacities through the provision of necessary equipment;

6. Implementation 
Partnership arrangements.  
The PRS TAC was prepared in close coordination with the IDB 
program in Honduras, especially with the project 
Apoyo al Fortalecimiento de la Gestion Fiscal
 
(HO-0208) approved by the IDB’s Board in May 2004 and to be co-financed by the Swedish 
cooperation. This project’s principal objective is to improve Honduras public resource 
management by strengthening the Government’s capacity to effectively manage public 
expenditure, the administration and collection of internal revenue, and overseeing international 
trade. Along with, increasing the ability to link fiscal and monetary policy and measurements of 
the impact of fiscal policy on PRS indicators. The close coordination, which among other things 
included joint preparation missions, has resulted in a common program and implementation 
arrangements for those activities that are covered by both projects in the areas of monitoring the 
PRS implementation and fiscal and fiduciary management. 
 
Furthermore, since PRS TAC would be aimed at tackling key institutional development issues, 
an explicit partnership was also developed with the donor community and in particular with the 
Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the British Department for International 
Development (DFID), both of which would co-finance project activities. 
 
Institutional and implementation arrangements. 
The Presidential Commission for State 
Modernization (CPME) would serve as the project implementation unit. The CPME’s proven 
experience in implementing Bank operations is amply evidenced by the fact that it has 
successfully implemented two other Bank sponsored projects
3
 and is currently implementing the 
ongoing EFMTAC.  The CPME is furthermore overseeing a number of technical assistance 
projects with other donors further attesting to its experience in the handling of operations. As a 
result of the above, the CPME has the staff and systems necessary to carry out administrative 
activities and to consolidate the project’s financial management, the administration of the special 
account and the consolidation of project progress reports and audits. 
 
Day-to-day activities for each component or subcomponent would be carried out by separate 
Government agencies. Specifically, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) and the National 
Technical Advisory Unit (UNAT) would be responsible for activities under component 1; CPME 
and the General Directorate of Civil Service would be responsible for activities under component 
2; and SEFIN and the General Comptroller’s Office (TSC) would be responsible for activities 
under component 3.

A Project Steering Committee (PSC) would be created to oversee project implementation and to 
ensure an integrated vision for all components. The PSC would be responsible for approving the 
project’s annual action plans, as well as for overseeing the implementation of each component 
and subcomponent. More detailed institutional arrangements for project implementation are 
presented in Annex 6. 
 
Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results. 
In accordance with Bank policies, monitoring 
and supervision of project implementation would focus on the achievement of expected results. 
The overall project monitoring and results framework is presented in Annex 3 and includes 
component- and subcomponent-specific indicators as well as aggregate monitoring indicators 
agreed upon with the government for supervision purposes. 
 
Each component/subcomponent implementing agency would evaluate its progress vis-à-vis 
expected results and would inform the CPME of same in order to have aggregate progress 
reports twice a year. The Bank and the project co-financer would conduct joint semi-annual 
supervision missions to evaluate achievement of intermediate results and to agree on adjustments 
when necessary. A project mid-term review would be conducted by end 2005. 
 
7. Sustainability 
Sustainability of the PRS TAC and other reform programs in Honduras are put at risk by three 
potential problems: lack of commitment to reforming the legislative frameworks, absence of 
public support, and weakness and inexperience of Government agencies.   
 
• 
Implementation of recommended reforms.
 The CFAA and CPAR identified the public 
reforms that the PRS TAC will support. However, the actual passage and implementation of 
these reforms will depend on strong pressure and financial incentives offered by the donor 
community and Government goodwill. This is especially true for the reforms contemplated in 
the area of Public Human Resources. The following mitigating factors will help ensure 
sustainability: (i) reforms encouraged by the PRS TAC are directly or indirectly linked to the 
PRSP, PRSC, HIPC and PRGF, hence donor financing provides a strong incentive; and (ii) 
the Government’s endorsement of the PRSP, PRSC, HIPC and PRGF prove that there is 
strong local commitment to public reforms being advanced under the PRS TAC. 
 
• 
Stakeholder commitment
. 
Interest groups that are seeing their privileges reduced as the 
reform agenda advances could show political resistance to the changes encouraged by the 
PRS TAC. This risk could increase next year as Honduras moves towards Presidential 
elections. To mitigate this risk the Government (with the assistance of the donor community) 
is expected to continue its communications strategy, thereby helping to broaden 
understanding of the development agenda and building public support for reforms. 
 
• 
Institutional Capacity.
 Weaknesses in Government financial management and audit 
functions could negatively affect the institutionalization of fiduciary reforms supported by 
the PRS TAC. To mitigate this risk, the PRS TAC and other similar TA operations 
contemplate a strong element of institutional building assistance to ensure that CFAA and 
CPAR recommendations are implemented.

8. 
Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
IDA-supported public sector reforms in Honduras have often failed to fulfill expectations due 
mainly to the lack of country ownership, insufficient technical competence, and a lack of clear 
objectives. The PRS TAC is also likely to confront some of these challenges, especially in the 
areas of public administration reform and improved monitoring of the PRS.  However, objectives 
under the PRS TAC (that not only include strengthening key Government institutions, but also 
actual approval and implementation of reforms) also constitute objectives and commitments 
under a series of PRSCs, as well as HIPC, IMF and other donor programs, thereby presenting 
important financial and political incentives for the successful implementation of the PRS TAC.   
 
Based on lessons leaned from IDA experience with Technical Assistance projects in Honduras, 
the PRS TAC would emphasize: 
 
• 
Stakeholder ownership and incentives.
 As stated above, foreign assistance programs valued 
at several hundred million dollars high profile, public debate of results will ensure ownership 
and incentives of the proposed project.  
• 
Upstream work.
 The proposed project was designed principally with the assistance of the 
CFAA, CPAR, other relevant analytical work (such as ICA, DPR), and associated credits 
EFM TAC and PRSC. 
• 
Clear objectives and close supervision.
  The PRS TAC overall objectives are provided by 
the PRSP and PRSC and reinforced by HIPC, the IMF’s PRGF and the IDB’s program.  In 
addition to the regular project supervision provided by the project team, the Government, and 
more specifically the Office of the Presidency will help to identify problems and this will be 
done in the context of continuous supervision of the PRSC hence feedback on the PRS TAC 
will be constant.
