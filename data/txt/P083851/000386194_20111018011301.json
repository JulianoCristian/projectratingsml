  moderately unsatisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            the main lesson learned is that the project and its\n            implementation arrangements need to be carefully designed\n            and adapted to respond to the country's circumstances.\n            Firstly, the political context is volatile, political will\n            is not constant and country ownership is generally low.\n            Secondly, implementing capacity is weak and technical skills\n            limited, resulting in a slow implementation pace. Keep\n            project design simple and realistic with results indicators\n            specifically calibrated and linked to the activities\n            financed by the project. Avoid fragmented implementation\n            arrangements that can slow down the project."}, "docdt": "2011-09-22T00:00:00Z"}
