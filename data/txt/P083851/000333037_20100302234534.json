The closing date\n            of the project is being extended from February 28, 2010, to\n            December 31, 2010.  A ten-month extension will allow the\n            Government to complete programmed activities of the credit\n            which have been delayed as a consequence of the seven month\n            'pause' in operations supported by the World Bank\n            following the June 28, 2009 removal of the President of\n            Honduras. The project implementation unit has prepared an\n            action plan, calendar, and monitoring indicators for the\n            completion of activities by end-July 2010.  This will allow\n            achievement of the project objectives."}, "docdt": "2010-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
