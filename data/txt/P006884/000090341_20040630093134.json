sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that in view of\n            the long drawn out preparation period, changes in\n            Government, and a subsequent economic/financial crisis, this\n            project would have encountered serious problems in another\n            context, but for the strong commitment of the Government and\n            its high technical capacity, the outcome was successful. The\n            Bank's Financial Sector Review (1993) followed by the\n            Capital Markets Mission (1994-1996) report, funded by the\n            Japanese Grant, provided valuable input during the design of\n            the Project components. Bank efforts to promote the backstop\n            facility added to the delays in project preparation. The\n            design of the Technical Assistance (TA) Project was too\n            complex in terms of the number of beneficiary entities and\n            the number of sub-components. In the case of the TA Project\n            the initial Project matrix contained a very detailed listing\n            of all activities with their respective costs. In the case\n            of this Project, design took over five years, given a two\n            year pause. After the TA Project was re-started, the Bank\n            should have applied a more rigorous test to the adequacy and\n            relevancy of design. The introduction of new financial\n            instruments is a spontaneous creative response on the part\n            of intermediaries to an existing market need. Project\n            appraisal should include sensitivity analysis and\n            contingency planning regarding any unexpected budget\n            shortfall experienced by the borrower and alternative\n            restructuring of project activities. When a beneficiary\n            entity represents a significant share of project financing,\n            staff should carefully evaluate implementation capacity.\n            Complex institution building TA projects require\n            post-closing follow up to check on the sustainability of the\n            initiatives undertaken by the project and to assess the\n            medium- to long-term effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2004-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
