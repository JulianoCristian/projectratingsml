Republic of Colombia (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) for the above referenced Project, and 
to the letter, dated September 20, 2000, from the Borrower's Technical Vice 
Minister of Finance to the Bank, requesting specified changes to the Loan 
Agreement and that the proceeds of the Loan be reallocated as indicated to 
finance certain financial sector agencies included in the implementation plan of 
the Project.
The Bank agrees with such request, and proposes to amend the Loan 
Agreement as follows:

activities during a 
period of twelve months, referred to in Section 3.03 
of this Agreement, including the first 
one covering the period between July 1, 
1997 and June 30, 1998, each such Program to 
include: (i) the Bank

expenditures, both for services 
or for goods; and (iv) the objectives and

expenditures, including: (i) (A) each activity to be 
carried out under 
such Program, irrespective of whether the carrying out thereof will take  more 
than twelve months; and (B) the application to such activities of the provisions 
of 
Section 3.02 of this Agreement; (ii) the eligibility criteria for 
the selection of the said  activity and whether said criteria shall have been 
met; and (iii) the need of revising the 
types of indicators and targets 
referred to in paragraph (b) (i) of Section 3.01 of this 
Agreement and 
the specific monitoring and evaluation indicators and performance targets to 
be used for measuring and evaluating the carrying out of such activities.
(b)
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall 
prepare each year 
a proposed Annual Program, commencing with the one 
specifically mentioned in paragraph (q) 
of Section 1.02 of this Agreement, 
and furnish each proposed Program to the Bank in a timely 
manner so as to make 
possible: (i) the review of such Program during the next coming Annual 
Review; 
Page  2
(ii) the approval of the inclusion of the selected activities in the Project and 
in 
the relevant Borrower’s budget, and of the expenditures to be incurred in 
carrying out the 
Annual Program agreed between the Borrower and the Bank 
under the review in question; and 
(iii) the agreement with the Bank on the 
indicators and targets referred to in paragraph (a) 
(iii) above.
(c)
The Borrower shall carry out the corresponding Annual 
Program, as agreed 
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, and shall 
not modify, or permit to modify any 
such Program or the activities 
included in it, except for modifications thereto agreed from 
time to time 
between the Borrower and the Bank."
4.  In Schedule 1, the table in paragraph 1 is amended as set forth in the Annex 
to this letter.
5.  Schedule 2 is amended as follows:

and Companies Superintendencies,  and the Borrower's Fondo de Garantía de 
Instituciones Financieras - FOGAFIN, to increase 
their knowledge of 
state of the art financial instruments, supervisory approaches, and 
financial resolution mechanisms, and to support  more modern institutional 
models of 
supervision;" and
(c)  Parts C.2 (b) and D.3 of the Project are eliminated.
6.  Schedule 4 is amended as follows:

"$900,000".
