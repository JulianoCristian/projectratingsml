Government's efforts to foster more effective financial\n            intermediation of resources, as well as more efficient\n            operation of markets, as a key ingredient for sustained\n            economic growth.  Specific project objectives are to: (i)\n            develop the financial markets into a more efficient channel\n            for mobilizing domestic savings and financing investment;\n            (ii) improve the institutional capacities for financial\n            sector policy formulation and strengthen the regulatory and\n            supervisory framework in order to, inter alia, minimize the\n            risk of loss of confidence in the financial markets; (iii)\n            contribute to increase the supply of securities, by inter\n            alia facilitating the introduction of new financial\n            instruments; (iv) consolidate the implementation of the\n            social security reform; (v) contribute to deter corrupt or\n            fraudulent practices such as money laundering; and (vi)\n            contribute to more efficient operation of financial and\n            non-financial markets by promoting competition and deterring\n            anti-competitive practices in those markets.  The components\n            of the project are as follows: 1) developing the financial\n            markets into a more efficient intermediation channel; 2)\n            strengthening regulation and supervision capacity in the\n            financial sector; 3) increasing the supply of securities and\n            the availability of other financial instruments; 4)\n            consolidating the implementation of the new social security\n            system; 5) developing a system for control of corrupt and\n            fraudulent practices; 6) developing competition and\n            anti-trust policy capacity; and 7) project management and administration."}, "docdt": "1997-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
