Some lessons learned\n            included: (a) the influence of officials in key\n            institutions, even indirectly concerned with the project,\n            can be very strong and can have substantial effect on\n            implementation. The main cause of delays in implementation\n            was management indecisiveness arising from weaknesses in the\n            State administration and frequent changes of top officials\n            and their lack of understanding of the project requirements;\n            (b) the early establishment of a strong management\n            organization should be an inflexible condition for loan\n            disbursement; (c) greater emphasis should be placed on the\n            role of farmers and communities in sustaining investments;\n            they are generally very willing to take responsibility for\n            the investments on their holdings as well as the necessary\n            supporting services and infrastructure; and (d) timely local\n            funding is critical and a system that ensures automatic\n            transfer of funds from Federal and State budgets should be a\n            requirement for loan effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1995-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
