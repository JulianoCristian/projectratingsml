Similar to its predecessor, the\n            project will consist of a package of farm support services\n            and physical infrastructure designed to benefit some 430,000\n            smallholder farm families throughout the State.  Support\n            services will include extension advice, improved seeds, farm\n            input supply and crop protection measures.  Physical\n            infrastructure will include the construction of feeder roads\n            and small dams for watering cattle. The project will\n            continue and amend the assistance provided to erstwhile\n            Kaduna State in the new Kaduna and Katsina States with the\n            core activities: (a) intensified and unified extension\n            services, adapt research and contract seed production; (b)\n            small-scale irrigation deve (c) veterinary services; (d)\n            input supplies, including encouraging the private retailers;\n            (e) strengthening cooperative rural credit institut (f)\n            essential rual infrastructure; and (g) strengthening the\n            capacity state ministries of agriculture and natural\n            resources (MANR) for policy formulation, planning and\n            expenditure implementation."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
