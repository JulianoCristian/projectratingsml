I/ Ozone-Depleting-Pouenual (ODP) is a concept which has been developed to aggregate the impacts of all ozone depleting substances (ODS) on the ozone layer. Since not all ODS are equally damaging to the ozone
layer, their effects on the ozone layer must be weighted by the appropriate damage factor. For example, CFCs are ten times as damaging as 1,I.I-Trichloroethane (TCE), so TCE only receives a weight of 0.10.
2/ Incremental costs are defined as those costs of ODS phaseout which would not have been incurred in the absence of the Montreal Protocol. Estimates of incremental capital and operating costs are based ott Lhe
meEhodology developed by the Montreal Protocol and Global Envirotsnent Facility.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT PROJECT
FOR THE PHASEOUT OF OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985) and the Montreal Protocol
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987) (MP) are international environmental agreements
which call for the phaseout of substances that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. More than 100
countries representing over 95 percent of world consumption of these substances have ratified the
Montreal Protocol and Vienna Convention. The Montreal Protocol with its amendments and adjustments
now mandates the complete phaseout of production and consumption of a number of ozone depleting
substances (ODS) in developed and developing countries by January 1, 1996.
2.    All industrialized countries in the world have undertaken comprehensive national programs to
develop cost-effective strategies to phase out the use of these substances in the various end-user sectors.
The largest family of ODS is chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are widely used in various industrial
applications including: domestic, commercial and industrial refrigeration and air conditioning, flexible
and rigid insulation foam, and in numerous applications such as aerosol propellants and solvents, among
others.
3.    Slovenia is fully committed to the complete phaseout of the consumption of regulated substances
by 1996 as mandated by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. In July of 1992, Slovenia succeeded
to the ratification of the former Yugoslavia of the Montreal Protocol which initially ratified the Protocol
on December 26, 1990. In December of 1992, Slovenia ratified the London Amendments to the Montreal
Protocol, but it has yet to formally ratify the Copenhagen Amendments. Slovenia has not been designated
as an Article V country under the Montreal Protocol, and is therefore ineligible for financial assistance
from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MFMP). GEF resources
will therefore be required to finance the Project under the Reduction of the Ozone Layer Depletion
component.
4.    Slovenia has been actively planning its ODS phaseout strategy since 1992. A comprehensive
Country Program for the Phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances in Slovenia was undertaken, with Bank
support, and completed in June 1994. This study served as the basis for establishing the priorities for
the Slovenian Government, and for identifying key policy and regulatory measures which would be
required to support a cost effective phaseout, which would also minimize disruptions to the industrial
sectors which utilize ODS. The activities proposed for funding under this Project are among those
priorities identified in the Country Program.
ODS SECTOR BACKGROUND
5.    All ODS in Slovenia are imported from the European Union, mainly the United Kingdom,
Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Italy. In addition, approximately 38 percent of ODS used in
Slovenia were exported in final products in 1993, and thus the export market has effectively dictated the
phaseout of ODS in some enterprises in advance of national legislation. The decline in ODS consumption



2
from 1986-1992 was greatest in aerosols (62%) and foams (65%). In refrigeration, technology advances
have not been so rapid with a phaseout over the same period of 37 percent.
6.    In 1993, usage of regulated ODS was approximately 1,936 metric tons. Compared to 1990, total
annual ODS use fell by 35 percent, and was equivalent to 952.5 ozone-depleting-potential (ODP) in
weighted tons in 1993.  In terms of ozone-depleting-potential, 89 percent is accounted for by
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), 10 percent by 1,1, 1-Trichloroethane (TCE), and the remaining 1 percent
by Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Consequently, the focus of the project should be on phasing out
the use of CFCs. Aerosols and foams account for 42 percent and 37 percent of CFC use, while
refrigerants and solvents account for 17 percent and 4 percent, respectively. For TCE, solvents account
for 95 percent of consumption.
RATIONALE FOR GEF INVOLVEMENT AND PROJECT ELIGIBILITY
7.    Most countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU) are not
eligible for assistance from the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol
(MFMP). Nevertheless, the total production and consumption of ODS in the CEE and FSU countries
is equal to that of all the developing countries (including China, India, Brazil, and Thailand) which are
eligible for MFMP assistance, and therefore ODS phaseout projects in Central and Eastern Europe
represent an opportunity to achieve significant global environment benefits through the adoption of cost-
effective technological interventions.
8.     This Project has been developed and structured based on specific ODS phaseout requirements
in Slovenia (as outlined in the Country Program) and the general project eligibility criteria guidelines of
the Montreal Protocol and the GEF Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP). Funding for this
stratospheric ozone layer protection project is requested from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on
the basis that Slovenia:
(a) is eligible for GEF assistance;
(b) is not classified as a developing country according to the Montreal Protocol, is ineligible for
funding from the MFMP, and is eligible for funding from the Global Environment Facility;
(c) has completed the preparation of a Country Program; and
(d) has ratified the Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol.
9.     The Project consists of two components as follows: (i) an Institutional Strengthening Component;
and (ii) an Investment Component comprising six Sub-Projects. It is consistent with international efforts
in the field of ODS phaseout. The Sub-Projects are deemed to be effective and are essential interventions
in order to quickly and successfully phase out the use of the regulated substances. This project will be-
among the first comprehensive and planned ODS phaseout program to be implemented in Central and
Eastern Europe (the Czech Republic project is currently under implementation, and the Hungarian one
under preparation).

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
10.    The principal objective of the Project is to assist Slovenia in the phaseout of ODS consumption
in a cost effective manner as mandated by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments.
Specifically this Project will assist Slovenia to:
(a) support the phaseout of the consumption of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) through adoption
of new cost-effective CFC-free technologies; and
(b) through institutional strengthening improve the capability of the Ministry of Environment
and Physical Planning (MEPP) to manage and oversee the phaseout of ODS in Slovenia.
GEF support will provide an incentive for the early adoption of ODS phaseout activities and capture
additional environmental and economic benefits which would otherwise either be lost or delayed. By
focussing on the key sectors and enterprises, the project will phase out 345 tons of ODP per year or
roughly 36 percent of ODP weighted annual ODS consumption in Slovenia.
PROJECT ELIGIBILITY AND DETERMINATION OF SUB-PROJECT INCREMENTAL COSTS
11.    For all GEF-funded ozone phaseout projects, the specific eligibility criteria developed for
projects to be funded by the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (MFMP)
are used. The GEF Participants, which approved the funding of this Project, are also Parties to the
Montreal Protocol and most of GEF contributors are contributors to the MFMP. The application of the
project eligibility criteria assured a fair and consistent assessment of the nature of activities which could
be funded and of the maximum level of funding which could be allocated (i.e., the incremental costs of
ODS phaseout). Incremental costs, as defined by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, are the capital and
operating costs incurred by the Participating Enterprise which they would otherwise not have incurred
in the absence of the Montreal Protocol. The investment Sub-Projects proposed in this Project meet the
project eligibility criteria established by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, and were subject to the
technical review and approval of the Ozone Operations Resource Group (OORG) which reviews all Sub-
Projects financed by the GEF and the Montreal Protocol.
12.    The level of funding for each Sub-Project was determined on the basis of the incremental costs
at the Sub-Project level. The grant amount requested for each Sub-Project may be less than the
incremental costs of the Sub-Project for several reasons: (i) operating savings are projected to accrue to
the Participating Enterprise during Sub-Project implementation; (ii) the Participating Enterprise may be
less than 100% Slovenian owned, so the grant amount must be pro-rated to the percentage of local
ownership; (iii) the grant amount for any Participating Enterprise which exports a portion of its
production to non-GEF eligible countries must be reduced based on the percentage of exports'. Other
factors which must be considered in determining the Sub-Project incremental cost include, but are not
limited to, the level of technology upgrade achieved by the Sub-Project, the impact on production
capacity, and the cost of substitute materials. For all the Sub-Projects proposed as part of this Project,
counterpart contributions have been made by the Participating Enterprises in terms of time for the
I   The grant amount for Participating Enterprises which export to non-GEF eligible countries is calculated as
follows: (i) Participating Enterprises which export more than 70% of their production are ineligible for GEF support;
(ii) companies which export less than 10% of their production are eligible for 100% financing of incremental costs; and
(iii) companies which export between 10% and 70% of their production are eligible for financing of incremental costs
based on the following formula -- Grant Amount = Incremental Costs * (1.10 - Percentage of production which is
exported to non-GEF eligible countries).

preparation of the project documents and, in most cases, in the implementation of the Sub-Project, either
through management time or through direct investment. Incremental operating costs will not be funded
by the GEF for Slovenia, but instead will be borne by the Participating Enterprises.
13.    The Sub-Projects were selected on the basis of eligibility criteria from the list of potential Sub-
Projects which had been identified during the preparation of the Country Program. The Sub-Projects
were selected on the basis of their impact on ODS consumption, their potential for minimizing the impact
of ODS phaseout on the economy. The Participating Enterprises were selected on the basis of their
capacity to undertake the Sub-Projects, their technological leadership positions, or their special situation
within the context of ODS consumption (e.g., a sufficiently low level of production exports). From a
review of the financial situation of the participating enterprises and discussions with the Slovenian
authorities it is clear that some enterprises are experiencing what appears to be short-term financial
difficulty based on 1994 data, but the firms are about average by Slovenian standards and appear to have
acceptable medium-term prospects. On balance, the financial status of the selected project enterprises is
adequate to justify project participation.
14.    Additional counterpart contributions are expected during the implementation phase of the Project,
and these are estimated at $3.5 million for the six investment Sub-Projects of the Investment Component.
The proposed level of funding represents a conservative but fair estimate of the incremental costs which
will be incurred by the Participating Enterprises.
15.    It is therefore proposed that the Project cost of US$9.7 million be funded by the Global
Environment Trust Fund (GEF) in the amount of $6.2 million. Of this amount, $1.2 million (19%) will
be in the form of retroactive financing, beginning from August 1993 when project preparation was
initiated, since many of the Participating Enterprises already had to undertake substantial investments in
order to be able to comply with the terms of the Montreal Protocol by 1996 (see Schedule B and
Summary Table of Technical Report). Funds would be provided as a grant from the GEF to the
Government of Slovenia and channelled to the Participating Enterprises under the Investment Component
through the Slovenian EcoFund. The estimated costs are to be considered incremental capital costs net
of any potential savings. Proceeds of the grant will not be utilized for transfer payments, such as taxes
and duties.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND COSTS
16.    The project consists of (i) an Institutional Strengthening Component (Sub-Project 1); and (ii) an
Investment Component comprising six Sub-Projects (Sub-Projects 2-7). Below is a description of each
of these components. Comprehensive Sub-Project descriptions are provided in the Technical Report.
1. Institutional Strengthening Component
17.    Sub-Project 1 --  Project Implementation Unit for the Phaseout of Ozone Depleting
Substances. Together with the Chamber of Economy and Slovenian EcoFund (SEF), the MEPP will set
up an ODS Phaseout Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to be supported by a Technical Advisory Group
(TAG). The PIU was established in the SEF and will coordinate the implementation of the Project,
oversee procurement and disbursement for Sub-Projects 1-7 in compliance with World Bank guidelines,
and supervise project activities according to the requirements of the World Bank and the MEPP. As
necessary, the PIU will arrange for technical assistance and consultants to assist in project
implementation, and provide support to facilitate cooperation among government institutions and the
consumers of ODS. Finally, the PIU will be responsible for calling meetings of the TAG, which will
be responsible for assisting small users not covered under the Project, and advising the PIU and



5
Participating Enterprises concerning any changes in ODS Phaseout technologies and their implications
for Sub-Project implementation and training of staff at the Participating Enterprises. The TAG will not,
however, identify new investment Sub-Projects. Funding for this Sub-Project amounts to US$219,690
to cover salaries (i.e., for additional staff who are not civil service employees), office equipment, ODS
monitoring, and the cost of hiring international consultants for supervision and review during
implementation of the Sub-Projects.
II. Investment Component
18.    Sub-Project 2 -- Project for Conversion and Phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances at
LTH. LTH is the largest producer of commercial refrigeration appliances in Slovenia. The objectives
of the project are: (i) substitution of CFC refrigerant with HFC-134a and HFC blends; and (ii)
substitution of CFC-1 1 blowing agent with Cyclopentane. The project started in July 1992, and will be
finished by December 1996. The substitution of CFC will be realized as follows: (i) replacement of
CFCs as refrigerant by August 1996; and (ii) replacement of CFCs as blowing agent with Cyclopentane
by December 1996. In the interim, the enterprise has decided to substitute CFC with HCFC-141b. Costs
strictly associated with the conversion to HCFC are being borne by the enterprise; costs associated with
the conversion to cyclopentane will be financed by the GEF grant. The total incremental cost of the
refrigeration component is US$ 1,607,258, while the total incremental cost of the foams component is
US$ 2,424,766. The total incremental cost of the project is US$4,032,024, of which it is proposed that
US$ 1,496,230 is financed by the GEF grant. The result of the project will be the annual phaseout of
26.0 tons of ODP-weighted consumption of CFC-12 and CFC-502 in refrigeration, and 41.4 tons of
CFC- 11 in foam.
19.    Sub-Project 3 -- Servicing of Refrigerators and Freezers, and Substitution of CFC-12
Refrigerant in Heat Pumps with HFC134-a at Gorenje Servis. Gorenje Servis is the largest service
organization in Slovenia and has exclusive rights for servicing Gorenje appliances during the warranty
period. The service network of Gorenje Servis consists of 10 service stations with 29 qualified service
technicians. In 1993, there were 25,500 service repairs on refrigeration appliances. Service repairs of
Gorenje Servis represent about 30 percent of the Slovenian market. The objectives of the project are:
(i) servicing the refrigerating-freezing appliances and heat pumps which contain CFC-12 as refrigerant;
(ii) servicing the refrigerating-freezing appliances which contain HFC-134a as refrigerant and its
recovery; and (iii) substitution of CFC-12 with HFC-134a in the production of heat pumps. The total
incremental cost of the refrigeration component is US$ 342,487, while the total incremental cost of the
heat pumps component is US$ 124,282. The total incremental cost of the project is US$ 466,769, of
which it is proposed that US$ 125,460 is financed by the GEF grant. The result of the project will be
the annual phaseout of 10.2 tons of ODP-weighted consumption of CFC-12 in refrigeration, and 1.2 tons
of CFC-12 in heat pumps.
20.    Sub-Project 4 -- Conversion of Aerosol Production to CFC-Free Propellants at Krka
Kozmetika. Krka is a major producer of aerosols for cosmetic and technical applications in Slovenia.
The average number of aerosols produced from 1986 to 1990 was 6 million units per year, of which
about one third was perfume in glass bottles. The consumption of CFCs in 1992 was 123 tons,
representing 28.2 percent of the CFC consumption in the aerosol sector. The objective of the project is
to phase out the use of 79 tons (1993) of CFCs aerosol propellants and substitute them with Dimethyl
Ether (DME) in perfumes and colognes, and hydrocarbon aerosol propellants in all other products. The
project started in 1993, and will be finished in July 1996. Operational savings of US$ 393,140 will be
realized over the life of the project, and the incremental capital cost of the project is US$ 1,068,452.
The total incremental cost of the project is US$ 675,312, of which it is proposed that US$ 354,000 is
financed by the GEF grant. The result of the project will be the annual phaseout of 79.0 tons of ODP-
weighted consumption of CFC-1 1 and CFC-12.

21.    Sub-Project 5 -- Substitution for CFC Propellants in the Production of Pharmaceuticals at
Lek Chemical and Pharmaceutical Company. Lek Chemical and Pharmaceutical Company is one of
the largest aerosol manufacturers in Slovenia. It is the only one that manufactures drugs in aerosol form,
in addition to cosmetic aerosols. In 1990 Lek started to use propane-butane gas as a propellant for
cosmetic aerosols, and in 1993 the use of CFCs was excluded from the production of cosmetic aerosols.
The mixture of CFC-1 1 and CFC-12 in a ratio 1:1 is still used as propellant for pharmaceuticals. The
consumption of CFCs in 1992 was 157 tons, representing 36 percent of the CFC consumption in the
aerosol sector. The proposed program involves the substitution for CFCs with propane-butane. The
objective of the project is to phase out the use of 157 tons of CFCs aerosol propellants and substitute
them with hydrocarbon aerosol propellants in the production of pharmaceuticals. The project started in
the fourth quarter of 1994, and will be finished by mid-1996. The total incremental cost of the project
is US$ 2,184,980, of which it is proposed that US$ 1,992,600 is financed by the GEF grant. The result
of the project will be the annual phaseout of 157.0 tons of ODP-weighted consumption of CFC-1 1 and
CFC-12.
22.    Sub-Project 6 -- Elimination of CFC-11 in the Production of Light Building Panels at
Trimo. Trimo, with its amnual production capacity of 600,000 m2, is the Europe's largest manufacturer
of light building panels filled with mineral wool. Trimo panels are metal sandwich filled with mineral
wool and glued with a polyurethane (PU) foam. About 50 percent of its production is exported, mainly
to countries in the European Union (13%) and the former Soviet Union (37%). It consumed 22 tons of
CFC-1 1 in 1992 in the production of light building panels. The objective of the project is to permanently
eliminate the CFC- Il consumption in Trimo's production process by replacing the CFC-l 1 with CO2
based foaming agent for its polyurethane adhesives. The conversion must assure the equivalent physical
and mechanical properties and quality of Trimo sandwich panels. The scheduled completion time for
equipping the warehouse with a panel transportation and storage system is four months, and for
modifications and upgrades on the double belt line it is seven months. The total project duration is
scheduled at eleven months including the training, start-up, and trial production runs.  The total
incremental cost of the project is US$ 1,148,200 of which it is proposed that US$ 1,021,410 is financed
by the GEF grant. The result of the project will be the annual phaseout of 27.7 tons of ODP-weighted
consumption of CFC-1 1.
23.    Sub-Project 7 -- Substitution for CFCs with Aliphatic Hydrocarbons in Dry Cleaning at the
Labod Company. The Labod Company is the biggest dry-cleaning company in Slovenia. Leather
clothes (30 tons/year), and silk clothes and similar fine materials (25 tons/year) are cleaned by CFC
procedures. Labod uses 3.5 tons of CFC- 113 per year, thus representing about 72 percent of CFC use
in dry cleaning. Labod represents 8 percent of CFC use in the solvent sector. The objective of the
project is to phase out 3.5 tons of CFCs by replacing CFC procedures with aliphatic hydrocarbons.
Operational savings of US$ 38,577 will be realized over the life of the project, and the incremental
capital cost of the project is US$ 217,677. The total incremental cost of US$ 179,100 is proposed to be
financed by the GEF grant. The result of the project will be the annual phaseout of 2.8 tons of ODP-
weighted consumption of CFCs.
24.    The incremental cost of the Project has been determined to be US$9.7 million, which represents
about 27 percent of the national incremental costs which will be assumed by Slovenia economy in phasing
out ODS. Of this total $7.3 million (75%) is incremental capital costs, and $2.4 million (25%) is
incremental operating costs. The national incremental costs were estimated in the Country Program for
the phaseout of ozone-depleting-substances.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
25.    The Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning (MEPP), through the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU), will act as general program coordinator for the Project. The MEPP w,ill liaise with other
ministries on policies and industrial strategy issues, and, through its PIU, be responsible for day-to-day
management of project implementation. The PIU was established by the MEPP in the Slovenian EcoFund
in mid-1995, and the appointment of the PIU staff will be a condition of effectiveness. The Slovenian
EcoFund (SEF) will work with strong and continuous support from the Chamber of Economy (COE)
which was the lead organization in project preparation and design, and has the most extensive contacts
with the- Participating Enterprises. Moreover, since the PIU has been established in the SEF, the SEF
will not be responsible for disbursement to the PIU under Sub-Project 1. Instead, disbursement for this
Sub-Project will be made directly to an account to be opened by the SEF. No formal Financial Agent
will be selected for the Project.
26.    The Slovenian EcoFund (SEF) was selected to manage the local funds administration for the
Investment Component. The emphasis in selection of the SEF was based on its ability to disburse and
administrate project funds, as demonstrated by the fact that several of its staff formerly worked in the
commercial banking sector in Slovenia, and have worked on procurement and disbursement in previous
World Bank projects with the former Yugoslavia. The SEF is being supported by the World Bank-
financed Slovenia Environment Project, and thus its role as a PIU for the ODS Phaseout Project was seen
as an opportunity to strengthen the implementation and coordination of both projects, and to help develop
the Slovenian EcoFund's capabilities in financial management. To ensure smooth disbursement, early
involvement of the SEF in supervision will be required. The Slovenian EcoFund will assume the day-to-
day responsibilities related to procurement and disbursement, and it will assist through its staff in the PIU
in the supervision of implementation for Sub-Projects 2-7. The SEF will provide at least one staff person
with experience in procurement in World Bank projects.
27.    A Project Administration Agreement (subject to Bank review), which clearly spells out the
responsibilities of each organization, will be established between the COE, the SEF, and the MEPP.
Agreement on the Project Administration Agreement will be a condition for negotiations, and its signature
a condition for effectiveness. For those services which would normally be performed by a Financial
Agent, the SEF will be paid a fee of 3.00 percent on Sub-Projects 2-7. For each Sub-Project a Sub-Grant
Agreement between the SEF and each of the Participating Enterprises will be prepared.  Each
Participating Enterprise has prepared a Sub-Project Document which will form the basis of a Sub-Grant
Agreement between the SEF and the Participating Enterprise. The Sub-Grant Agreements will include
reporting provisions, annexes on disbursement, and provisions related to environmental protection and
worker safety. Signed Sub-Grant Agreements will be a condition of disbursement for each investment
Sub-Project, and preparation of a pro-forma draft Sub-Grant Agreement will be a condition of
negotiations.
28.    Standard Bank disbursement procedures will be followed, with established limits on initial deposit
and replenishment levels, statements of expenditures and Bank procurement review levels. The PIU will
review the progress of the Sub-Projects and make recommendations on disbursements to suppliers and
consultants. The Special Account will be opened by the SEF either in the Bank of Slovenia or in a
commercial bank. Though the Multilateral Fund procedures allow for complete retroactive financing of
ODS-phaseout expenditures incurred in a country after the Montreal Protocol comes into force, more
restrictive IBRD rules limiting retroactive financing have been applied to this project. Project expenditures
incurred after August 1993 are eligible for retroactive financing, provided the procurement procedures
outlined in Schedule B are followed. Retroactive financing shall be limited to no more than 40% of total
project expenditures financed by the GEF grant. It is expected that, by October 1995, the enterprises will
have incurred expenses worth $ 1.2 million, or about 19% of the total GEF grant financing, which will



8
be financed retroactively. For expenditures to be retroactively financed, the procurement process should
be consistent with Bank procedures, and all records should be available to the Bank for review.
29.    Monitoring and evaluation of the Project will require that the PIU prepare quarterly reports to
be submitted to the World Bank for the duration of project supervision. A standard format for these
quarterly supervision reports is 6eing developed by the GEF, and will be explained to and agreed upon
with the PIU. The quarterly reports will summarize issues related to procurement, disbursement, technical
aspects of project implementation, accounting and auditing information, enviromnental and safety issues,
and any changes in the legal and regulatory framework. Inputs will be provided by the SEF and the
Participating Enterprises. The quarterly reports will be reviewed by the World Bank task manager, and
discussed during supervision missions.2
30.    The SEF and COE have undergone basic training on World Bank procurement and disbursement
procedures and will be further assisted by the Bank to successfully launch the Project. A Project
Implementation Manual (PIM) has been provided, and includes the relevant Bank guidelines on
procurement, disbursements, use of consultants, financial reporting, auditing, sample bidding documents,
and other project-specific documents. In addition, detailed Project Implementation Plans were prepared
by each of the Participating Enterprises during Appraisal. Finally, a one week training course on project
implementation and management was held in Budapest in mid-January 1995, and was attended by staff
of the COE and the SEF.
PROJECT BENEFITS
31.    The project's major benefit will be to assist Slovenia to achieve its objective of completely
phasing out the use of ODS as early as is technically feasible. The project will help the Government
implement an accelerated ODS phaseout program by providing financing for priority Sub-Projects which
will result in the phase out of 345 tons of ODP annually (or about 36 percent of Slovenia's total ODP-
weighted annual consumption of ODS).
32.    The project consists of Sub-Projects which will contribute to maximizing the useful life of
equipment which currently rely on the availability of CFC for their continued use. This will contribute
to reducing the country's economic cost of phasing out the use of the regulated substances, and
minimizing the economic dislocation associated with ODS phaseout. In addition, the project will enable
firms with exports to adjust in a timely manner to non-ODS products as requested by importers from
industrialized countries. These companies export around 38 percent of their annual ODS consumption.
PROJECT RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
33.    Management structure and ownership of most of the companies which would be assisted under
this project could change in the future. Nevertheless, the risks associated with any future financial
problems of some companies would be mitigated through a review of the financial status of each
Participating Enterprise during supervision. The Participating Enterprises have good prospects for
increased profitability based on their position within their respective industrial sectors, and the fact that
they will be undertaking these necessary new investments for the phaseout of ODS technologies.
2   The first supervision mission is scheduled for October 1995, and 12 staff weeks per year have been allocated
for World Bank Supervision of the Project.



9
Implementation of the new technologies will also make any state enterprises more attractive candidates
for privatization.
34.    The risk associated with insufficient institutional capacity should be adequately offset by the
establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to assist
in the implementation of the Sub-Projects and Country Program for ODS Phaseout. The work of the PIU
and TAG will be essential to help industry make the transition to ODS substitutes instead of continued
use of ODS. Monitoring of compliance with ODS regulations will also be of paramount importance for
project success. Under the Institutional Strengthening Component, the MEPP will be responsible for
monitoring the compliance with ODS regulations.
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
35.    Stratospheric Ozone Layer protection has been accorded high priority by the Government of
Slovenia as an important global environmental issue. The requirements of the Montreal Protocol, which
enables the monitoring of ODS usage (and imports), were incorporated into national law in 1992. The
regulations, which include deadlines for ODS phaseout in each sector of consumption, bans on new
equipment which used controlled substances, obligatory reporting on the use of controlled substances, and
penalties for violating regulations, have been prepared and have yet to be adopted. Slovenian regulations
will adopt the ODS phaseout schedule of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments, and
will be consistent with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol on limitations on trade in the regulated
substances. The MEPP and the Ministry for Economic Relations and Development will be responsible
for its implementation.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
36.    Sub-Projects 2-7 were prepared on the basis of, and will be subject to, local environmental
regulations and the Bank's project environmental review procedures. The Sub-Projects consist of light
industrial projects which have been classified as category B on the basis of the Bank's project
environmental classification system (OD 4.01), and based on previous classification of similar projects.
37.    The MEPP has provided its environmental clearance of all the proposed activities to be
implemented under the Project. The Project provides for resources to retain the services of international
consultants for supervision of project implementation, including health and safety considerations, and
these will be addressed during the first supervision mission planned for September 1995. International
health and safety standards should be observed, with particular emphasis on the design and operation of
cyclopentane tanks. Adequate safeguards for worker health and safety will be a condition of disbursement
for any Sub-Project, and project supervision will include guidance to ensure that safety and environmental
conditions in the Participating Enterprises are consistent with international practices for the new
technologies which will be employed to phase out ODS.
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
38.    During negotiations the following assurances were obtained from Government:
(a) a part of the proceeds of the grant will be made available to SEF, under terms acceptable
to the Bank, including a financial agency fee of 3 % of the amount disbursed to finance Sub-
project 2-7 (para. 27);



10
(b) all measures necessary to ensure that each Participating Enterprise complies with the relevant
requirements for ODS phaseout activity will be taken (para. 36);
(c) PIU and SEF will maintain reporting and accounting practices acceptable to the Bank (para.
29 and 30).
39.    Conditions of effectiveness would be:
(a) the execution of the Project Administration Agreement between SEF, COE and MEPP (para
27);
(b) the appointment of the PIU staff acceptable to the Bank (para. 25).
40.    Conditions of disbursement would be:
(a) signing of a Sub-Grant Agreement between the SEF and the Participating Enterprise(s)
responsible for the corresponding Sub-Project (para. 27);
(b) Government's certification to the Bank that adequate environmental and safety precautions
are in place for any Sub-Project (para. 37).

TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT PROJECT
FOR THE PHASEOUT OF OZONE DEPLETING SUBSTANCES
PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
A. Procurement
1.     Procurement of goods, works, and services will be in accordance with relevant Bank Guidelines.
The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which was established by the Ministry for Environment and
Physical Planning (MEPP) within the Slovenian EcoFund (SEF) in mid-1995, will be responsible for
day-to-day management of project implementation. SEF will work with support from the Chamber of
Economy (COE) which was the lead organization in project preparation and design. The PIU will consist
of staff from SEF, COE and MEPP. The PIU will provide support to the enterprises participating in the
project and, by providing a link between them and the World Bank, will ensure that the project will be
carried out in a timely and efficient manner. SEF was selected to manage the funds administration for
the Investment Component of the project based on its ability to disburse and administrate project funds
and its familiarity with the World Bank procurement procedures. The SEF will be responsible for
ensuring that the procurement methods proposed by the Participating Enterprises are in accordance with
World Bank Guidelines (January 1995).
(a) Works
(i)      Contracts for civil works up to US$500,000 equivalent would be awarded on
the basis of national shopping (NS) procedures, where quotations would be
obtained from at least three qualified suppliers'.
(b) Goods
(i)      Contracts for goods with limited suppliers up to an aggregate of US$ 1.5 million
equivalent ($1.1 million financed by the Grant) would be awarded on the basis
of the Bank's limited international bidding (LIB) procedures2
(ii)     Contracts between US$50,000 and US$400,000 equivalent would be awarded on
the basis of the Bank's international shopping (IS) procedures where price
quotations would be obtained from at least three qualified suppliers from at least
two countries
(iii)    Contracts below US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of national
shopping (NS) procedures where quotations would be obtained from at least three
qualified suppliers
The use of National Shopping procedures for works is justified on the ground that: a) the project must be completed by a certain date for
the country to fulfill the Montreal Protocol mandate; and b) the country has a very strong construction industry which can perform at very competitive
prices.
2   This method of procurement is justified by the limited number of suppliers and the time constraints of the project.



SCHEDULE B                                            14
(iv)      Direct contracts (DC) would be awarded on the basis of negotiations with the
technology supplier. The Bank's prior approval for each case of direct
contracting would be necessary.
(c) Consultants
(i)       Consultant services for engineering studies, technical assistance, study tours and
training programs would be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants by World Bank" published by the World Bank in August
19813
2.      The following contracts and bid packages will be subject to the Bank's prior review:
(i)       LIB packages
(ii)      The first two NS contracts for works; the first two IS contracts for goods; and
all DC procurement
(iii)     Terms of References for all consulting services; short list, terms of reference,
letter of invitation and award decisions for consultant contract over US$100,000
equivalent for firms and US$50,000 equivalent for individuals.
3.      All other contracts for goods, works and consultant services which are financed through this
grant will be subject to ex-post review by the Bank in order to verify compliance with Bank procurement
guidelines. Information on procurement would be periodically provided to the World Bank task manager
by the PIU.
4.      Retroactive Financing. Project expenditures incurred after August 1993 are eligible for
retroactive financing, provided the above procurement was carried out in accordance with Bank
Guidelines (January 1995). Retroactive financing shall be limited to no more than 40% of total project
expenditures financed by the GEF grant. It is expected that, by October 1995, the enterprises will have
incurred expenses worth $ 1.2 million, or about 19% of the total GEF grant financing, which will be
financed retroactively. For expenditures to be retroactively financed, the procurement process should be
consistent with Bank procedures, and all records should be available to the Bank for review.
3    Short-term contracts for highly specialized assignments will be carried out by individual consultants; major assignments will be contracted
through short listing of consulting firms.

Components (Sub-Projects 2-7). Disbursement to the PIU under Sub-Project 1 will be made directly
through a direct account to be opened by the SEF. Standard Bank disbursement procedures will be
followed, with established limits on initial deposit and replenishment levels, statements of expenditures,
and Bank procurement review levels. Funds will be deposited in a Special Account which will be held
with either the Bank of Slovenia or a commercial bank. Disbursement procedures have been established
as follows:
(a) Between the World Bank, the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, and the
Slovenian EcoFund: The Trustee will deposit an initial amount up to US$800,000 to a Special
Account which the SEF will open in either the Bank of Slovenia or a comrnercial bank.
Requests for reimbursement will be based on Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts
with a value of up to US$500,000 for works, US$400,000 for goods, US$100,000 for consulting
firms' services, and US$50,000 for individual consultants' services. The minimum application
size for payments directly from the Loan Account or for issuance of Special Commitments is
20% of the Special Account Authorized Allocation. Terms, conditions, and schedule for
disbursement for Sub-Projects under the Investment Component must be included in the Sub-
Grant Agreements between the Slovenian EcoFund and each Participating Enterprise; and

Ozone Depleting Substances at LTH
REFRIGERATION AND FOAM SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
2.1    LTH is the largest producer of commercial refrigeration appliances in Slovenia. Approximately
45 percent of production is exported to Western Europe. Besides commercial equipment it produces also
domestic cooling-freezing appliances. The main product types are:
*Refrigerators and freezers exceeding 500 liters capacity
*Refrigerators and freezers up to 500 liters capacity (catering)
*Refrigerated counters
*Serveover cabinets, refrigerated multideck cabinets
*Heat exchangers
*Freezer Chests
2.2    In 1992, LTH used (i) 15.4 tons of CFC-12 as refrigerants, or 7.9 percent of the total CFC
consumption in refrigeration sector; (ii) 41.4 tons of CFC-11 as blowing agent for cast-in-place
production of heat insulating, or 9.6 percent of the total CFC consumption in foam sector; and (iii) 19.6
tons of CFC-12 for servicing purposes, representing about 10 percent of the total CFC consumption in
refrigeration sector. LTH consumption of CFCs represents about 7 percent of the total CFC consumption
in Slovenia.
Sub-Project Objective
2.3    The objectives of the Sub-Project are: (i) substitution of CFC refrigerant with HFC-134a and
HFC blends; and (ii) substitution of CFC-1 1 blowing agent with cyclopentane. Particular concern will
also be given to the design and operation of cyclopentane storage tanks in order to ensure that
international safety standards are met.
B. SUB-PROJECT EXECUTION
Time Schedule
2.4    The Sub-Project started in July 1992, and will be finished by December 1996.
2.5    The substitution of CFC will be realized as follows:
(i)    Replacement of CFCs as Refrigerant -- August 1996
(ii)    Replace of CFCs as Blowing Agent with Cyclopentane -- December 1996
Conversion from CFC to HCFC5 -- August 1993-August 1995
5   The conversion from CFC to Cyclopentane will take place over a 3-year period. In the interim, the enterprise has decided to substitute CFC-
11 with HCFC-141b. Costs strictly associated with the conversion to HCFC are being bome by the enterprise. Costs associated with the conversion
from CFC to cyclopentane will be financed by the GEF grant.

Sub-Project No. 3 - Servicing of Refrigerators and Freezers, and Substitution
of CFC-12 Refrigerant in Heat Pumps with IIFC134-a at Gorenje Servis
REFRIGERATION AND FOAM SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTiON
Background
3.1   In 1992, 950,000 domestic refrigerators and freezers using CFC-12 refrigerant, were in use in
Slovenia. Most of them have been produced by Gorenje, which is the largest producer of domestic
appliances in Slovenia.
3.2    Gorenje Servis is the largest service organization in Slovenia and has exclusive rights for
servicing Gorenje appliances during the warranty period.
3.3    The service network of Gorenje Servis consists of 10 service stations with 29 qualified service
technicians. In 1993 there were 25,500 service repairs on refrigeration appliances. Service repairs of
Gorenje Servis represent about 30 percent of the Slovenian market.
3.4   In the group of Gorenje Servis there is also a small amount of production and mounting of heat
pumps (960 pieces in 1992) using CFC-12.
3.5   In 1992, the consumption of CFC-12 in Gorenje Servis was 9.6 tons, or 31.3 percent of CFC
use for servicing purposes and production of heat pumps (i.e., about 5 percent of CFC consumption in
the refrigeration sector or 0.9 percent of the total CFC consumption in Slovenia).
Sub-Project Objectives
3.6   The objectives of the Sub-Project are: (i) servicing the refrigerating-freezing appliances and heat
pumps which contain CFC-12 as refrigerant; (ii) servicing the refrigerating-freezing appliances which

Sub-Project No. 4 - Conversion of Aerosol Production to CFC-Free Propellants
at Krka Kozmetika
AEROSOL SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
4. 1    Krka is a major producer of aerosols for cosmetic and technical applications in Slovenia. The
average number of aerosols produced from 1986 to 1990 was 6 million units per year, of which about
one third was perfume in glass bottles. The consumption of CFCs in 1992 was 123 tons, representing
28.2 percent of the CFC consumption in the aerosol sector, or 11.1 percent of total CFC consumption
in Slovenia.
Sub-Project Objectives
4.2     The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out the use of 79 tons (1993) of CFCs aerosol
propellants and substitute them with Dimethyl Ether (DME) in perfumes and colognes, and hydrocarbon
aerosol propellants in all other products.
B. SUB-PROJECT EXECUTION
4.3     The Sub-Project started in 1993, and will be finished in July 1996.
Sub-Project Duration: 3 years
Sub-Project Management
4.4     The Sub-Project will be carried out at Krka Kozmetika. The implementation will be overseen
by MEPP.
C. INCREMENTAL COSTS OF THE SUB-PROJECT6
4.5     The incremental investment cost of the phaseout of ODS                           US$1,068,452
The incremental operating savings of the phaseout of ODS                          US$ -393,140
Total incremental cost of the Sub-Project                                         US$ 675,312
6   The cost-effectiveness of this project is $8.55/kg-ODP which is higher than the subsectoral average of $2.55/kg-ODP. The higher costs are
because CFCs are being replaced by both hydrocarbons and DME. In addition, the estimates of equipment provided by vendors are "high due to strategic
and political considerations in the Balkans and Slovenia's proximity". However, the equipment will be competitively procured in accordance with the
guidelines provided in Schedule B and actual costs will be disbursed.

Sub-Project No. 5 - Substitution for CFC Propellants in the Production of Pharmaceuticals
at Lek Chemical and Pharmaceutical Company
AEROSOL SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
5.1    Lek Chemical and Pharmaceutical Company is one of the largest aerosol manufacturers in
Slovenia. It is the only one that manufactures drugs in aerosol form, in addition to cosmetic aerosols.
5.2    Over the period from 1986 to 1990, Lek produced over 2 million cans per year. In the later
years, the structure of cosmetic products has changed, more and more using modified formulations of the
products, due to the limited use of CFCs. In 1990 Lek started to use propane-butane gas as propellant,
and in 1993 the use of CFCs was excluded from the production of cosmetic aerosols.
5.3   The production of drugs in aerosol form during this period reached 1.25 million cans in 1986,
but fell to 935,000 cans in 1992 and 680,000 cans in 1993, respectively. The mixture of CFC-1 1 and
CFC-12 in a ratio 1:1 is used as propellant. The consumption of CFCs in 1992 was 157 tons,
representing 36 percent of the CFC consumption in the aerosol sector, or 14.2 percent of total CFC
consumption in Slovenia.
5.4   The process of propellant substitution in pharmaceutical products is a long term process, and is
limited to those propellants for which technical data are known concerning their influence on cancerous
and tumorous diseases, toxicity, skin irritation degree, and absorption characteristics. Lek has carried
out tests on various alternative formulations, but the final decision on which propellant (propane-butane
or Dimethyl Ether (DME)) to substitute for CFCs has taken place in the beginning of 1995. The
proposed program involves the substitution for CFCs with propane-butane.
Sub-Project Objectives
5.5   The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out the use of 157 tons of CFCs aerosol propellants
and substitute them with hydrocarbon aerosol propellants in the production of pharmaceuticals.
B. SUB-PROJECT EXECUTION
Time Schedule
5.6   The Sub-Project started in the fourth quarter of 1994, and will be finished by mid-1996.
Sub-Project Duration: 1.5 years
Sub-Project Management
5.7   The Sub-Project will be carried out at Lek. The implementation will be overseen by the MEPP.

Participating Enterprise Contribution                                            US$192,380
D. BENEFIT OF THE SUB-PROJECT
5.10   The result of the Sub-Project will be the annual phaseout of 157.0 tons of ODP-weighted
consumption of CFC-1 1 and CFC-12.
7   The cost-effectiveness of this project is $6.12/kg-ODP which is higher than the subsectoral average of $2.55/kg-ODP. The higher costs are
because of the costs associated with the maintenance of sterile and aseptic conditions in the pharmaceutical plant.

Sub-Project No. 6 - Elimination of CFC-11 in the Production of
Ught Building Panels at Trimo
FOAM SECrOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTIN
Background
6.1   Trimo, with its annual production capacity of 600,000 ni2, is the Europe's largest manufacturer
of light building panels filled with mineral wool. Trimo panels are metal sandwich filled with mineral
wool and glued with a polyurethane (PU) foam. About 50 percent of its production is exported, mainly
to countries in the European Union (13%) and the former Soviet Union (37%).
6.2   Trimo substantially reduced its CFC consumption over the past few years. However, it still
consumed 22 tons of CFC- 1 in 1992 in the production of light building panels. This represents 4.6
percent of total CFC consumption in the foam sector, or about 2 percent of total CFC consumption in
Slovenia.
Sub-Project Objectives
6.3   The objective of the Sub-Project is to permanently eliminate the CFC-11 consumption in Trimo's
production process by replacing the CFC-11 with CO2 based foaming agent for its polyurethane
adhesives. The conversion must assure the equivalent physical and mechanical properties, and the quality
of Trimo sandwich panels. To overcome the increase in the demoulding time, narrower processing
window, and longer PU post-curing time, the double belt production line will be extended to 25 meters,
and a setting warehouse with a panel transportation system will be provided to store the panels for 24
hours at monitored temperature (20"C). These two investments will complete the successful reduction (110
tons in 1986 versus 22 tons in 1992) and final elimination of the consumption of CFC-1 1 in Trimo's
production process.
B. SUB-PROJECT EXECUTION
6.4   The scheduled completion time for equipping the warehouse with the panel transportation and
storage system is four months, and for modifications and upgrades on the double belt line it is seven
months. The total Sub-Project duration is scheduled at eleven months including the training, start-up,
and trial production runs. The Sub-Project will start in the autumn of 1995 and be completed by
September 1996.
Sub-Project Duration 11 months
Sub-Project Management
6.5   The Sub-Project will be carried out at Trimo. The implementation will be overseen by the MEPP.

Sub-Project No. 7 - Substitution for CFCs with Aliphatic Hydrocarbons in Dry Cleaning
at the Labod Company
SOLVENT SECTOR
A. SUB-PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
7.1    The Labod Company is the biggest dry-cleaning company in Slovenia. Leather clothes (30
tons/year), and silk clothes and similar fine materials (25 tons/year) are cleaned by CFC procedures.
Labod uses 3.5 tons of CFC-1 13 per year, thus representing about 72 percent of CFC use in dry
cleaning.
7.2    Labod represents 8 percent of CFC use in the solvent sector, or 0.3 percent of total CFC
consumption in Slovenia.
Sub-Project Objectives
7.3    The objective of the Sub-Project is to phase out 3.5 tons of CFCs by replacing CFC
procedures with aliphatic hydrocarbons.
B. SUB-PROJECT ExECuTIoN
Time Schedule
7.4    The Sub-Project will be realized by December 1995.
Sub-Project Duration: 6 months
Sub-Project Management
7.5    The Sub-Project will be carried out at the Labod Company. The implementation will be
overseen by the MEPP.
C. INCREMENTAL COSTS OF THE SUB-PROJECT
7.6    The incremental investment cost of the phaseout of ODS                 US$217,677
The incremental operating savings of the phaseout of ODS               US$ -38,577
Total incremental cost of the Sub-Project                              US$179,100
Sub-Project Financing
7.7    The Sub-Project is proposed to be financed on a grant basis.
Proposed GEF Grant                                                     US$179,100
Participating Enterprise Contribution                                   US$    0

D. BENEFIT OF THE SUB-PROJECT
7.8    The result of the Sub-Project will be the annual phaseout of 2.8 tons of ODP-weighted
consumption of CFC-1 13. The new technology could also be used as a training or demonstration center
for other dry cleaning facilities which will need to phase out ODS.
