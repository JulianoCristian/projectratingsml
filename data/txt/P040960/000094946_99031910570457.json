The sharp\n            improvement in positioning the business enterprises, was due\n            to the successful project implementation. Both the\n            Bank's and the Borrower's performances were\n            satisfactory, with exemplary cooperation between the project\n            management entities and the participating enterprises.\n            Regardless of success, some key lessons are suggested as\n            follows: 1) careful planning requires early consideration,\n            the absence of which is perceived to be the reason for minor\n            failures, such as lack of funds resulting from poor\n            planning, or unnecessary procurement procedures. It is\n            suggested, the Project Implementation Units (PIUs) should\n            ensure that participating enterprises cover a feasible\n            implementation plan, to be studied well ahead of time.\n            Furthermore, the provision of detailed information on the\n            Bank's procurement guidelines and procedures should be\n            enhanced, thus local enterprises would acquire a broader\n            knowledge of the benefits stemming from international\n            competitive bidding."}, "docdt": "1999-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
