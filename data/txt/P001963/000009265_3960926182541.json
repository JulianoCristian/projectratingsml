The project is the first phase of a long-term\n            national program to support the development of SROs.  The\n            project finances equipment, vehicles and operating costs\n            associated with preparation/appraisal/execution of SROs and\n            improvement of extension services; training and technical\n            assistance; and investments such as bottomland improvements,\n            small irrigated perimeters, soil conservation, watershed\n            management and social forestry including village tree\n            nurseries and studies.  Beneficiary farmer groups would\n            contribute part of the investment costs, bear all operating\n            costs and accumulate savings to replace renewable assets\n            such as pumps.  The most important benefit of the project\n            would be the development of an institutional capability in\n            Niger to make sound investment decisions for SROs and manage\n            investment funds."}, "docdt": "1988-02-22T00:00:00Z"}
