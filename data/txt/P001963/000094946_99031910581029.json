        satisfactory. The key lessons to be learned are: 1) Targeted\n            poverty interventions of the self-employment type are an\n            effective instrument for transferring resources directly to\n            the poor. 2) Decentralized financial management at the\n            community level is central to successful implementation of\n            bottom-up approaches to development and for promoting a\n            culture of financial discipline in managing community funds.\n            3) Demonstrated ownership and empowerment are key to\n            effective participation of farmers in small rural\n            development operations. 4) Training in farm management\n            skills promotes financial sustainability, while simplified\n            operating procedures, legal protection and clarity with\n            respect to benefits of the established financial mechanisms\n            are central to establishing ownership and credibility of\n            such mechanisms. 5) Access of farmers to project and/or\n            extension staff is central to effective problem-solving at\n            the community levels. 6) Continuity of project\n            implementation staff and Bank staff ensures reliability and\n            better quality of services to the project. 7) Public\n            administration is generally less effective than a private\n            association of the beneficiaries. 8) It is risky to make\n            long-term investments in community-based agricultural\n            enterprises without resolving tradition-bound land tenure\n            constraints and disputes. 9) Operations designed to develop\n            local capacity and a participatory culture require long-term commitment."}, "docdt": "1999-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
