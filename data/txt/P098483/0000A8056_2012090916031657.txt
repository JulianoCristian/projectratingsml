                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Development objectives:

                         1. Based on data as of December 31, 2011, the project made satisfactory progress in the following projectdevelopment (outcome) indicators:
                         (i) Outpatient consultations (OPC) per person per year in target health facilities: From abaseline of 0.16 (estimated for 2008-09), the project has achieved its end of project target of


                                                                                                                                                                                                             Page 1 of 5
                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                               Report No: ISR6547



                         0.30, progressing from 0.26 for2010 to 0.31 for 2011. This has been achieved despite the fact that reporting was absent from South Kordofan State throughout 2011and from one
                         locality in Blue Nile State for the last quarter of 2011 (due to conflict in these areas). To compensate for theselosses, a fourth locality in Red Sea State was added in October 2011.
                         The OPC target for 2012 has been estimated at 0.33.
                         (ii) %of pregnant women who attended at least one ante-natal care consultation (ANC) in target areas: From a baseline of 48% (estimatedfor 2008-09), progress lagged early (leading

                         to a revision of the end of project target from 70% to 65% when the project wasrestructured). The project has substantially progressed towards this target, with 59% for 2011.
                         However, it is troubling that thefirst ANC rate for 2010 was also 59%, so while there has been progress, there has also been some stagnation. This may be due to thedifficulties noted
                         above, but there was also a sharp drop in first ANC in one locality in Kassala State (the State Project Officerexplained that the initial ANC data included all consultancies, and were
                         later corrected to include only the 1st consultancy). TheANC target for 2012 has been set at 65%.
                         (iii) % of deliveries assisted (AD) by skilled health staff, incl. village midwives (VMWs)in target areas: From a baseline of 19% (estimated for 2008-09), progress has been steadily
                         (and occasionally dramatically) upwardacross all target states and localities. The end of project target was revised downward (from 55% to 30%) at the time of projectrestructuring
                         based on global experience in increasing AD. That target has been achieved. The AD target for 2012 has been set at46%.
                         (iv) No. of primary health care workers trained, incl. VMWs: the revised end of project target of 1,000 PHC workers trainedhas been substantially exceeded; at the end of 2011, 1,717
                         workers had been trained.
                          (v) % of households possessing at least oneinsecticide treated bednet (ITN) in target areas: A follow-up survey has not been conducted, but the end of project target for
                         thedistribution of 179,000 ITNs was achieved during the initial project. Based on an estimate of the target population in the fourstates of 2.67 million and an average household size of
                         6, the end of project target of 42% of the targeted households was almostfully achieved.

                         2. Intermediate indicators: In addition to the distribution of ITNs and the construction/rehabilitation of primaryhealth care (PHC) facilities achieved under the initial project, the project
                         has submitted the World Health Organization (WHO)'sfinal report on the National Health Accounts and completed civil works for three out of four midwifery training schools; the
                         lastone to be completed (in Kassala State) achieved a completion rate of 85% by end June 2012. Finally, the per capita value of supportto targeted health facilities and VMWs was
                         calculated at US$0.41 per capita in CY 2010 and US$0.42 in CY 2011, against the end ofproject target of US$0.40.

                         3. As for Intermediate Outputs:
                         (i) Procurement/Goods: Ambulances and other vehicles, midwiferyconsumable & renewable kits, skill labs for the midwifery schools, and emergency obstetric equipment for rural
                         hospitals had beenpurchased and distributed. As for the two remaining processes: furniture for the midwifery training schools was purchased anddistributed; and the generators for
                         the target rural hospitals were purchased and installed. There are no pending procurementprocesses.
                         (ii) Works for the rehabilitation of target rural hospitals and construction of midwifery schools were completed andhanded-over in Blue Nile and South Kordofan States, as well as in
                         Red Sea State. The works in Kassala State achieved a completionrate of 85% by end June 2012.
                         (iii) Performance-based contract with VMWs: Total 516 VMWs signed contracts and received payment -of which 44% in Kassala State, 28% in R.Sea, 15% in B.Nile, and 13% in S.
                         Kordofan; the relatively current low proportion in B.Nileand S.Kordofan States is mainly due to the prevailing conflict in the states. Following the VMWs-related social assessment, a
                         VMWssurvey was conducted in two of the four target states (B.Nile and Kassala); the data collected were analyzed and discussed, and afinal report was submitted.
                         (iv) Performance-based contracts with Rural Hospitals (RHs): 7 out of the 9 RHs that initially signedthe contracts continue participating and have been paid.
                         (v) Maternal death review: On the basis of the official MaternalMortality Rates (Sudan Household Survey 2009), the proportion of maternal death which have been notified in the four
                         target statesis estimated at 79% in 2010 and 58% in 2011; the drop in 2011 is due to absence of data in South Kordofan State and one locality inBlue Nile State. The proportion of
                         reported maternal deaths that were investigated was 97% in 2010 and 95% in 2011. Out of thetotal maternal deaths reported, 31% were reported by the community in 2010, against

                         24% in 2011 (most of the maternal deaths arestill reported by hospitals).

                         4. Safeguards: The implementation of the medical waste management plan (MWMP) has been furtherconsolidated. Procurement of protective equipment for staff, and installation of
                         small incinerators, in the target RHs and PHCfacilities had been completed. Safeguards staff at state level have participated in supervision missions, thus verifying a properuse of the
                         protective equipment and incinerators and increasing awareness.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Project Results: Outreach activities and mobile cinema continue, aiming at increasing awareness among pregnant women and increasing antenatal care coverage. Between June
                         2011 and May 2012, the no. of people benefiting from these activities was estimated at 31,000. Although outreach activities are no longer possible in South Kordofan and Blue Nile
                         States (due to the conflict), they have been intensified in Kassala and Red Sea States (the latter includes Port Sudan peri-urban areas).
                         2. Performance-based agreements with Village Midwives and Rural Hospitals: Supervision/verification visits will continue, as well as efforts to ensure that the payments will be made
                         timely and in accordance with the terms of the signed agreement.
                         3. Maternal Death Review: data collected at state level will continue being analyzed; the project will further encourage the MDR committees and the involved health facilities/hospitals
                         to translate the main death investigation findings into practical corrective measures aiming at reducing maternal mortality.

                         4. Supervision & M&E: quarterly review meetings involving the project team at federal and state level continue, as well as field monitoring missions. Attention has been given to data
                         collected on a quarterly basis, which is analyzed and discussed with the project team.
                         5. Operational research: the VMWs survey report has been completed and handed-over to the national counterparts.
