An\n            additional financing and restructuring paper was submitted\n            and approved and the respective amendment to the Grant\n            Agreement was signed on November 16, 2009, extending the\n            project closing date to June 31, 2011. The project was\n            further extended to June 30, 2012 to allow for completion of\n            the remaining activities.
