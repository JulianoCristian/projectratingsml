                         Development objectives:

                         1. Based on data as of September 30, 2012, the project made satisfactory progress in the following project development (outcome) indicators:
                         (i) Outpatient consultations (OPC) per person per year in target health facilities: From a baseline of 0.16 (estimated for 2008-09), the project has achieved its end of project target of


                                                                                                                                                                                                             Page 1 of 5
                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                               Report No: ISR9023



                         0.30, progressing from 0.26 (2010) to 0.31 (2011) to 0.30 (September 2012). This has been achieved despite interrupted services (and data) since 2011 from South Kordofan State
                         and parts of Blue Nile State. To compensate for these losses, a fourth locality in Red Sea State was added in October 2011.
                         (ii) % of pregnant women who attended at least one ante-natal care consultation (ANC) in target areas: From a baseline of 48% (estimated for 2008-09), the project progressed
                         slowly, achieving 59% in both 2010 and 2011. During the project's restructuring, the end of project target was revised from 70% to 65%. As of September 2012, the project had

                         reached 69% due at least in part to large gains in two remote localities in Kassala State.
                         (iii) % of deliveries assisted (AD) by skilled health staff, incl. village midwives (VMWs) in target areas: From a baseline of 19% (estimated for 2008-09), steady (and sometimes
                         dramatic) progress has been made across all target states and almost all localities. Though the end of project target was revised downward (from 55% to 30%) at the time of project
                         restructuring (based on initial results and global experience in increasing AD), it appears that the project may achieve the original target. AD has improved from 23% (2010) to 42%
                         (2011) to 51% (September 2012).
                         (iv) No. of primary health care workers trained, incl. VMWs: the revised end of project target of 1,000 PHC workers trained has been substantially exceeded; as of September 2012,
                         2,240 workers had been trained.
                         (v) % of households possessing at least one insecticide treated bed net (ITN) in target areas: A follow-up survey has not been conducted, but the end of project target for the
                         distribution of 179,000 ITNs was achieved during the initial project. Based on an estimate of the target population in the four states of 2.67 million and an average household size of 6,
                         the end of project target of 42% of the targeted households was almost fully achieved.

                         2. Intermediate indicators: In addition to the distribution of ITNs and the construction/rehabilitation of primary health care (PHC) facilities achieved under the initial project, the project
                         has submitted the World Health Organization (WHO)'s final report on the National Health Accounts and completed civil works for all of the four midwifery training schools and the six
                         rural hospitals. Finally, the per capita value of support to targeted health facilities and VMWs was calculated at US$0.41 per capita in CY 2010 and US$0.42 in CY 2011, against the
                         end of project target of US$0.40. The 2012 amount will be calculated for the next ISR.

                         3. As for Intermediate Outputs:
                         (i) Procurement. Works for the rehabilitation of target rural hospitals and construction of midwifery schools have been completed and handed over. All planned goods have been
                         procured and distributed. The only pending procurement processes involve the additional financing (see below).
                         (ii) Performance-based contract with VMWs: Currently, 534 VMWs have signed contracts and are receiving incentive payments. An assessment of VMW performance was conducted
                         in Blue Nile and Kassala States, and a final report was submitted.
                         (iv) Performance-based contracts with Rural Hospitals (RHs): 7 out of the 9 RHs that initially signed the contracts continue participating and have been paid.
                         (v) Maternal death review: On the basis of the official Maternal Mortality Rates (Sudan Household Survey 2009), the proportion of maternal death which have been notified in the four
                         target states is estimated at 79% in 2010 and 58% in 2011; the drop in 2011 is due to absence of data in South Kordofan State and one locality in Blue Nile State. The proportion of
                         reported maternal deaths that were investigated was 97% in 2010 and 95% in 2011. Out of the total maternal deaths reported, 31% were reported by the community in 2010, against
                         24% in 2011 (most of the maternal deaths are still reported by hospitals). Results for 2012 will be presented in the next ISR.

                         4. Safeguards: In accordance with medical waste management plan (MWMP), small incinerators have been installed in the target RHs and PHC facilities, protective equipment for
                         staff has been procured, and training and awareness raising sessions have been completed. Follow-up activities have continued (particularly in Red Sea and Kassala States) since
                         June 2012 to enhance awareness of safeguards and monitor use of the components put in place. Segregation of medical waste has been evaluated with very different results by
                         state: 82% of facilities in Red Sea and Kassala States are following appropriate procedures, but 0% in Blue Nile State (mainly due to rotation of Safeguards focal points); insecurity in

                         South Kordofan State has prevented much of the safeguards intervention.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. Project Results: Although outreach activities are not possible in the conflict-affected areas of South Kordofan and Blue Nile States, they have been intensified in Kassala and Red
                         Sea States and have contributed substantially to increases in antenatal care and assisted delivery coverage. Between June 2011 and May 2012, the no. of people benefiting from
                         these activities was estimated at 31,000.
                         2. Performance-based agreements with Village Midwives and Rural Hospitals: Supervision/verification visits will continue, as well as efforts to ensure that timely payments are made
                         in accordance with the terms of the signed agreement. Revisions of the agreements (first signed in 2010) will be discussed prior to January 2013.
                         3. Maternal Death Review (MDR): Data collected at state level for the period 2009-2011 has been compiled, discussed, and published by the FMOH. The project will continue to
                         support the State MDR committees (and the health facilities/hospitals concerned) in their efforts to investigate the causes of these maternal deaths and to translate the findings into

                         practical corrective measures. To this end, TORs for a more detailed analysis of the MDR system and existing data have been prepared.
                         4. Supervision & M&E: Periodic supervision missions and field trips have been conducted with the participation of federal and state ministry personnel, project staff, the Monitoring
                         Agent, and the Bank team. Review meetings/workshops have emphasized discussion of fiduciary issues, outputs, and results by state and locality.
