Innovation Loan (LIL) to develop and test a participatory\n            methodology and operational mechanisms for promoting\n            sustainable management of production and natural systems to\n            be used in the Sierra Nevada region. There are three project\n            components. The first component 1) designs the methodologies\n            and operational mechanisms to be tested, improved, and\n            adapted; 2) designs and implements a communications strategy\n            to enhance awareness and generate support for conserving\n            biodiversity and sustainable development; 3) supports study\n            tours and visits, farmer exchanges, and workshops to promote\n            exchange of knowledge and experience; 4) funds key studies\n            and action-research to develop new information; and 5)\n            finances the project's monitoring, evaluation, and\n            learning system. The second component provides technical\n            support to agencies coordinating a sustainable development\n            plan; promotes a network of stakeholders; supports the\n            consultation process between indigenous organizations, the\n            parks unit, and peasants living inside the parks; and\n            implements a strategic plan for strengthening the Foundation\n            (the Strategic Development Plan for the Sierra Nevada de\n            Santa Marta). The third component is the core investment\n            component. It consists of three inter-related sub-components\n            implementing collaborative management plans; promoting a\n            stewardship approach for protected areas; and operating a\n            grant-giving fund."}, "docdt": "2000-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
