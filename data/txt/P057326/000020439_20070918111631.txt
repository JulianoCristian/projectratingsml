6. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)
6.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)


The Sierra Nevada Sustainable Development Project (hereafter referred to as "the Project") was
designed in 1999­2000. It clearly responded to: (i) the national development policies and
priorities, (ii) the conditions of the Sierra Nevada region, particularly its social problems and
some of its development priorities, and (iii) the World Bank's development strategy for Colombia.
The delicate social context and the poor experience of public interventions in the region
suggested the use of flexible mechanisms. Accordingly, a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL),
which was one of the lending options within the World Bank, was rightly selected for this project,
as explained below.


Sierra Nevada a National Priority. The Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta (hereafter referred to as
"Sierra Nevada"), is a region globally noted for its cultural and ecological richness for which it
has been declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.. It comprises about 12,600 square kilometers
of world-recognized biodiversity; four major indigenous peoples, the Kogi, Arhuaco, Kankuamo,
and Wiwa, contribute to its cultural diversity. However, it suffers widespread poverty, social
conflicts, environmental degradation, and episodes of violence. Most of its inhabitants are
farmers who came to the Sierra fleeing the violence in others parts of Colombia; poverty affects
the majority, around 80% at the time of project preparation (2000). Territories occupied by
indigenous peoples overlap with national parks and farmers in their buffer zones, thus creating a
volatile situation. State institutions and public investments were historically absent in the region.
The project emerged to respond to the goals of the 1998­2002 National Development Plan,
particularly to (i) build social capital to address the root causes of violence and enhance
sustainable development; and (ii) preserve priority areas in critical ecoregions, emphasizing the
full engagement of civil society and the private sector in nature conservation and sustainable
development. These aspects were captured in the design of the project.


Government­Civil Society Partnership. In the context of violence that constrained the presence
and legitimacy of state institutions in the Sierra Nevada, a government­civil society partnership
appeared to be a feasible alternative, following the success of the Magdalena Media Project
implemented on a similar arrangement. The Fundación Pro-Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta
(hereafter referred to as "the Foundation"), a nongovernmental organization dedicated to the
Sierra Nevada, emerged as a viable partner. The Foundation had been working in the region since
the 1980s, with an ongoing, tangible presence, notable legitimacy among the diverse social
actors, and a record of managing bilateral cooperation funding. The Foundation was not only a
good partner for deploying public support and investments in the region, but probably the only
actor with the legitimacy and capability to intervene and channel funds in the complex and
delicate social context of the Sierra Nevada. In essence, the project's design built on ongoing



                                                                                                   6

efforts by both the government and civil society to introduce a new development approach that
would simultaneously address poverty, violence, and sustainability.


The Project in the CAS. The project also responded to the World Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Colombia at that time, prioritizing sustainable development with a reduction
in poverty and improvement of social conditions in an environment of peace. In addition, poverty
reduction and sustainable development in rural areas were stressed as key issues. In essence,
peace and development were and continue to be major goals for the CAS and the Government of
Colombia.


The LIL Project (which entailed a funding of US$5 million) was conceived together with a
major GEF operation (which would represent an additional US$15 million). Both projects were
envisioned as a joint intervention to augment ecological conservation and sustainable
development in the Sierra Nevada. Although the project was rapidly approved by the World Bank
and the Republic of Colombia, the GEF operation had a long and troubled process of validation
and finally was not formalized due to lack of local consensus.


6.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)


The project was conceived, jointly with other projects, as a coordinated effort within a program
that the Foundation was executing at the time, whose overall Program Development Objective
was:


Stakeholders in the Sierra Nevada region are better informed and organized to implement jointly
agreed actions for conserving the biological and cultural diversity of the Sierra Nevada region
and using its natural resources in a sustainable manner.

In addition, the Project Development Objective was:

To develop and test, in at least three regions (within the Sierra Nevada), a participatory
methodology and operational mechanisms for promoting sustainable management of production
and natural systems which can then be used in other regions of the Sierra Nevada.

The key indicators proposed to assess achievement of these objectives were the following:


 ·    Number of sustainable development projects funded in pilot regions and percent
      successfully completed by the end of the project.
 ·    Number of requests for participation/support and project proposals received by the
      Foundation from organizations and communities outside the pilot regions.
 ·    Number and type of agreements reached among key stakeholders in 3 pilot regions per year
      and percent implemented.
 ·    Number of farm plans, including sustainable production systems, being implemented by
      farmers in each pilot region per year.




                                                                                                7

6.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification


The PDO was not revised.

6.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised
(briefly describe the "the primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO, as well
as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)


The main beneficiaries of the project were, above all, the indigenous peoples and the farmers
who inhabit the Sierra Nevada area, as well as their community and productive organizations. In
addition, the project aimed to benefit and collaborate with a variety of stakeholders engaged in
the conservation of the Sierra Nevada's ecosystems, in support of indigenous peoples and their
cultures, and/or in the advancement of sustainable community development. These stakeholders
included municipalities, the Parks Service, NGOs, public environmental agencies, and education
centers, among others. The Regional Environmental Forum, comprising departmental and
municipal governments, productive organizations, community organizations, and the indigenous
federation, was also included as a beneficiary. The Foundation was simultaneously the executing
agency and a beneficiary because it was meant to enhance its technical, institutional, and
operational capacities to continue supporting conservation and sustainable development
initiatives at the community level.

6.5 Original Components (as approved)


Component 1. Knowledge Generation and Dissemination. The objective was to design and
put into operation a program for generating and disseminating knowledge about sustainable
development "best practices." In addition, this component would support activities to aid the
implementation of the other two components, including: (a) designing methodologies and
operational mechanisms, such as a participatory strategy, modalities for collaborative
environmental protection, and actions to promote sustainable production systems; (b) deploying a
communication strategy to enhance awareness and promote responses for the conservation of
biodiversity and for sustainable development; (c) activities to promote exchange of knowledge
and experiences; (d) key studies and action research; and (e) the project's monitoring, evaluation,
and learning system.

Component 2. Participation, Organizational Strengthening, and Coordination. The
objective was to put into place and effectively operate a program for strengthening local and
regional organizations that support sustainable development in the region. Potential activities
would include: (i) training and legal support for indigenous and farmer organizations, in
accordance with their self-defined needs and priorities; (ii) technical and operational support to
regional entities; (iii) outreach efforts to involve community and grassroots groups; (iv) technical
support and training for critical stakeholders such as business-oriented farmers, indigenous and
local     organizations, and municipalities, to enable them to participate in collaborative



                                                                                                        8

management, reach and implement agreements, adopt sustainable production systems, and create
networks for sharing information and experience; (v) technical support to communities and local
organizations to help them prepare sustainable development project proposals and submit them
for funding; and (vi) designing and implementing a strategic plan for the Foundation's
institutional development.

Component 3. Collaborative Management and Subprojects. Collaborative management is a
participatory method to provide technical assistance and training for community organizations to
carry out sustainable development activities. This was the core investment component
comprising three interrelated subcomponents: (i) development and implementation of
collaborative management plans; (ii) promotion of a stewardship approach to management of
protected areas, and constitution of a network of conservation areas; and (iii) establishment and
initial operation of a nongovernmental fund managed by the Foundation which would provide
competitive grants to communities and partner agencies for projects related to conservation and
sustainable use of natural resources in the ecoregion. Under this component, the project would
support the testing in at least three pilot regions of the participatory methodology for bringing
together key stakeholders to develop collaborative management plans. The project would also
offer specific support for the implementation of the collaborative management plan for
overlapping territories of the Sierra Nevada Park and indigenous reserves.

6.6 Revised Components


Components were not revised during execution.

6.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)


Implementation Arrangements. The project experienced two relevant changes that affected its
implementation and schedule:

Change in Pilot Regions. To better target project activities, the Sierra Nevada ecoregion was
subdivided in seven regions by using a multifactor analysis that combined biodiversity, social
and economic factors. Three regions were initially selected as a pilot due to their environmental
importance and because the Foundation had experience working there. One of these pilot regions,
located in the southwest region of Sierra Nevada (within Cesar Department) had to be abandoned
due to serious waves of violence. Participatory diagnostic activities were carried out and a work
plan was prepared. However, the sudden resurgence of violence in this area forced the project to
withdraw. Instead, project activities moved to the northern region, which also offered conditions
for sustainable development activities and the advantage of well-organized communities willing
to participate. The project also continued operating in the other two pilot regions.

GEF Cancellation. A GEF operation, which was meant to complement the project and to be
carried out by the Foundation, was cancelled. The main reason was the Consejo Territorial de
Cabildos' (CTC's) opposition to indigenous peoples appearing only as project beneficiaries and


                                                                                                9

the Foundation as executing agency. This arrangement was interpreted as a no recognition of the
CTC's role as a regional authority. Moreover, the CTC insisted on incorporating into the GEF
grant the purchase of land to expand indigenous territories. The Ministry of Environment directly
discussed with the CTC several alternatives to address these issues but no agreement was
reached. This situation delayed project activities in Component 3 because 20% of the loan (US$1
million) was tied for use as counterpart funds of the GEF operation. Ultimately, this
disagreement forced the Bank to cancel the GEF project and caused a reduction in indigenous
participation in the LIL.


Extension. Once the GEF was cancelled the US$1 million were used to create a fund to finance
core investment activities in Component 3. To enable the project to use these resources in
sustainable development subprojects directly benefiting the communities, the Bank granted a
one-year extension of the closing date from December 15, 2005 to December 15, 2006.

7. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
7.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)


Overall, the project design was adequate for the context and development needs in the
Sierra Nevada region. The use of a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) was appropriate
because it allowed flexibility and learning dynamics in a region that previously had few formal
development interventions and thus needed to test operational alternatives.

The project design was based on a comprehensive and qualitative social assessment, which
clearly defined the complex and delicate social context in which the project would operate. This
assessment led to an accurate and useful proposal of operational modes and to a participatory
framework that positively benefited the entire implementation.

From a technical viewpoint, the project offered a wide and meaningful choice of activities and
potential investments and addressed two priority needs in the Sierra Nevada: (a) capacity
building, and (b) deployment of small-scale investments and related activities that linked
sustainable production with conservation of the natural resource base. To this end, the project
tested and developed specific methods adapted to the Sierra with the active participation of the
communities, despite the violent environment.

From an institutional perspective, the selection of the Foundation as the executing agency was
adequate because of its long-term work in the Sierra, notable legitimacy among stakeholders, and
its national and international reputation as a top environmental institution. The appointment of
the National Planning Department (DNP) as the agency responsible for overseeing the project
was also adequate because at the time this agency played a very important role in regional
development in the Sierra Nevada through its Plan Caribe Office. This office had the necessary
specialized staff at the national and local levels to carry out development activities in the region.


However, institutional design did not identify with sufficient detail the processing links between



                                                                                                   10

these two agencies, particularly regarding financial flows and reporting procedures. Moreover,
the Foundation's learning and adaptation capacity was overestimated. Meanwhile, the risks of the
political changes affecting institutional arrangements were not fully measured in project design.
Thus, the change of administration, which made it necessary to adjust the original institutional
arrangements, was a painful process, particularly for the Foundation, and ultimately affected
implementation.


On the other hand, the arrangements to link the Foundation with the final beneficiaries were
positive and offered an excellent learning opportunity regarding a civil society organization's
experience in developing a participatory approach to bring together community organizations.

7.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)


During implementation, the project suffered from external influences and unforeseen events:

Violence: Although violence has been a constant in the Sierra Nevada, there was a change in the
balance of power between competing forces following the change between administrations; illicit
crops and government activities against them intensified; forced displacement of the population
increased, adding to insecurity and disputes over lands. As a result, just after the first year of
implementation, the Foundation had to drop one of the pilot regions selected and concentrate
efforts in a non-pilot region. By adapting its strategy to the conflict pattern, the Foundation
succeeded in working in this violence context and finding alternatives when needed. This success
suggests that the choice of a civil society organization as executing agency was the right one.

Adjustments in institutional arrangements: Institutional arrangements were fully innovative:
one of the first experiences in Colombia of an NGO directly executing a public project, and the
Foundation managing a Bank project for the first time. Because of the learning nature of the
project, it was not possible to create all the management mechanisms up front, particularly those
regarding financial resources and reporting. Therefore, the learning curve was difficult and
costly, mainly for the Foundation. Additionally, after a change in administration, institutional
arrangements had to be adjusted: First, the Plan Caribe closed and the project was transferred to
the Environmental Policy Bureau (EPB) in DNP, a unit without local capacity in the region.
Second, the National Audit Agency (Contraloría Nacional) introduced additional supervision
procedures over the Foundation, increasing reporting costs and reducing flexibility; Third, further
restructuring of DNP severely reduced the EPB's staff, thus reducing its operational capability.
Fourth, the Foundation's account, which allowed it to directly manage the loan, was closed and
replaced by a special account managed by the government, slowing the flow of resources. It took
some time and constant Bank assistance to adjust the institutional structure to these new changes
and to recover a good pace of implementation. These difficulties were further aggravated by the
lengthy illness and subsequent death of the Foundation's director at the time, followed by a
period of weak leadership which slowed the Foundation's activities. However, over time, the
Foundation was able to acquire the institutional strength required to implement the project and



                                                                                                11

develop a new profile better suited to operational interventions in the region, which was key to
address two important administrative problems that delayed project operations: (i) the
Government request to return the exchange rate's differential gains, which were fully paid; and
(ii) the observations made by the Controller's Office. The exchange gains were fully paid,
although the Bank's expressed its concerns about it. To respond to the Controller's Office, a
thorough execution report was prepared jointly with an Action Plan to fulfill all its requirements.
With a joint collaborative effort from DNP and the Bank, the Foundation was able to carry out a
very intense operational phase in 2004­2006 to compensate for past delays.

Reduced participation of indigenous organizations and focus in the farming belt: The project
was designed to carry out several activities and investments with indigenous peoples and in
indigenous territories overlapping national parks. A number of activities were conducted for this
purpose, including an agreement between the Foundation and the CTC for financing a wide range
of capacity-building activities, which were successfully completed. However, some factors
limited the work with indigenous organizations as explained below.

First and foremost, there was a major change in indigenous leadership from traditional authorities
to an indigenous federation (the CTC) with a stronger political leadership that emerged at the
time of preparation and became stronger at implementation. This shift resulted in disagreements
on the major GEF operation and the role the CTC should play in the LIL Project.

Second, the CTC demanded support for two activities that the project did not have the capacity to
fulfill: (i) land acquisition to extend their territories to the original pre-Hispanic boundaries; and
(ii) further recognition and autonomy of indigenous leadership as territorial authorities.

As a result, despite intensive negotiations, from 2004 onward the project could not continue
working directly with indigenous communities without the CTC's permission, a request that was
fully respected. However, the project financed and supported activities that helped strengthen
indigenous organizations in the Sierra:

(i) Negotiations between the CTC and the government through officials in the Ministry of the
Environment and DNP which provided it with further authority and recognition, including
government-financed acquisition of several lands located in sacred sites;

(ii) The dissemination and promotion of indigenous culture in the Sierra and joint activities with
farmers organizations, which helped to build a common understanding;

(iii) Targeted interventions by the Foundation to support indigenous communities affected by
violence and illness.

As agreed with the CTC, the project did not finance any activity in indigenous territories and
proposed land expansions. This agreement was accepted by farmers' organizations, thus allowing
the project to continue without conflicts.

The shift from indigenous territories to the farming belt created a more comprehensive
vision of the Sierra Nevada. Because poor farmers constitute the major portion of the Sierra
Nevada's population and confront urgent needs and violence, their enhanced participation and
commitment to the project had a positive impact on the protection and conservation of the Sierra



                                                                                                   12

Nevada. This shift helped to establish a strong farmers' organization that is able to continue
activities and obtain additional support for their efforts, thus contributing to sustainability.

Despite these implementation events and disturbances, the Foundation, the DNP, and the World
Bank showed their willingness and drive to help the project progress and succeed.


7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization


Since the project was a learning and innovation loan, the M&E system was not prepared at the
time of project design. Instead it was to be established during the first year of operation. From the
onset, the Bank provided technical assistance through an international expert to help the
Foundation's design and implement the system. Several models were prepared and tested but
were not fully satisfactory to the Bank, which demanded further preparation. The first model, in
place during the first year, failed to comply with the participatory approach and reporting on the
complexity of a learning operation. An experienced consultancy firm was brought in to improve
the M&E System but the new model was too complex to be operational and required adjustments
to enable participation by beneficiaries. The final M&E system was fully designed in 2003­2004.
It contained indicators to assess participation and measure sustainability and community
institutional capacity, as well as modules for beneficiaries' participation and self-assessment.
This innovative M&E System was implemented throughout the second operational phase, when
more than 30 subprojects were implemented directly by the communities that actively
participated in the monitoring process. They learned to prepare work plans, follow fair
procurement rules, monitor activities, and scrutinize the use of financial resources. It should be
noted, however, that this M&E System required intense reporting in order to remain updated, and
it employed some indicators that were vulnerable to subjective criteria. The efforts to implement
the M&E system, together with the need to monitor the wise use of public funds, increased the
awareness and commitment of all project stakeholders (from the Foundation to community
beneficiaries). In conclusion, the process to deploy a M&E system generated valuable awareness
and capacities for an authentic participatory monitoring of project activities and funds at
subproject level.

The project established a parallel mechanism to document the learning process, including: (i)
qualitative and well-edited publications on experiences; (ii) a wide range of community spaces
and events for sharing information and lessons learned; and (iii) a professional media production,
including weekly radio programs, film documentaries, and an Internet site.

7.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)


The project complied with all World Bank safeguard policies. During its design, it triggered
the following safeguard policies: (i) environmental assessment, (ii) natural habitats, (iii) forestry,
(iv) cultural property, (v) indigenous peoples, and (vi) involuntary resettlement.


Environmental safeguards. The project comprised components to increase knowledge about the



                                                                                                   13

Sierra Nevada's natural resources and biodiversity. Its main activities promoted methods to make
sustainable use of natural resources, protect them, and avoid negative impacts.


Social safeguards. The loan agreement provided up front a special covenant to avoid involuntary
resettlement and a tracking system to prevent it; the community-based subprojects were an
alternative to restrictions on the use of natural resources. An IPDP was prepared and adapted
during implementation to respond to indigenous leadership priorities focusing on capacity
building in an initial phase and later limiting project activities in indigenous territories and
expansion areas, as the CTC requested. There were also provisions to take care of cultural assets
including public awareness campaigns and dissemination of traditional indigenous practices.


It should be noted that the Foundation has built its reputation for careful compliance with social
and environmental aspects, which gained it an international award by the Nature Conservancy.
The Colombian Government signed agreements to comply with the safeguard policies and was
supportive of compliance during implementation.


Fiduciary Compliance: The project complied with fiduciary regulations as shown by semi-annual
audit reports and the quarterly submission of Financial Management Report (FMR). The
Foundation complied with all recommendations resulting from the Bank's reviews of audits and
FMR. The ex-post procurement review carried out on June 2006 covering the period of June
2004 to May 2006, gave a positive report and rated the project as satisfactory.

7.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)


At completion, the project team conducted a solid analysis of the execution, its results and
impacts, and the main lessons learned. A Stakeholders' Workshop was successfully carried out,
with the participation of representatives from most of the organizations engaged throughout the
project. The outcomes of this analysis indicate that all project activities have been successfully
completed and are sustainable as explained below:


(i) Community organizations created and empowered during the project continue to operate
subprojects and have obtained additional resources for sustainable development activities.
(ii) The Foundation, which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, has overcome the usual
difficulties that are common to civil society organizations. The project was crucial in helping to
expand the Foundation's legitimacy in the Sierra Nevada and beyond, and it has gained a more
powerful operational capacity for successful implementation of community-based sustainable
development subprojects. At the time of closing it has obtained additional financial support from
USAID for over US$1 million to continue supporting community subprojects until 2008 and will
benefit 926 families. Negotiations to obtain additional support continue.

Under the new administration DNP will no longer participate in directly executing projects.



                                                                                               14

Therefore, it has decided to transfer its experience to the Ministry of Environment to support the
Sierra Nevada. Several alternatives already operating in Colombia have been identified for this
purpose: (i) Productive Alliances; (ii) Municipal Credits; (iii) Rural Microcredit; and (iv) Carbon
Capture Options. The establishment of a Regional Environmental Fund with contributions by the
Autonomous Environmental Corporations (CARs), which has been in the making for several
years, is a feasible alternative that has the endorsement of USAID-FUPAD. Institutional capacity
created under the project ensures that the Foundation will continue to play an important role in
the Sierra and that the farmers' association will consolidate and will have enough leverage to
obtain additional funding and government support.

8. Assessment of Outcomes
8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)


The Sierra Nevada is a region of unique yet fragile natural and cultural diversity. It suffers from
a long record of violence, waves of rural migration, and significant pressure on its natural
resources. Communities are either isolated or engaged in destructive production modes. The
Sierra Nevada needed public awareness and organizational strengthening to engage its main
stakeholders on an alternative development path. The region also needed mechanisms to foster
community-level sustainable development, linking conservation of natural resources with
sustainable production. The two main objectives of the project were intended to address these
issues, taking into account the delicate social and natural situation and the development
challenges of the Sierra Nevada.

The Program Objective, comprising the project and other activities being executed by the
Foundation in parallel, aimed at providing the Sierra Nevada's stakeholders with better
information, enhanced organizational capacities, improved harmony among themselves, and
improved operational skills to respond to organizational weaknesses and understanding of the
Sierra's situation. The Project Objective responded to the need to develop and validate
operational mechanisms to manage natural resources in a sustainable manner specifically
designed to protect the delicate social and environmental context of the Sierra.

Such objectives and the implementation achievements of the SNSDP remain fully relevant. In
fact, both the GOC and the Bank are following the project's sustainable development approach to
support conservation of other protected areas. The WB Colombian National Protected Areas
Trust Fund Project, which has adopted the project's methods and instruments, is an example. The
project's satisfactory outcomes have also contributed to the global knowledge about sustainable
development policies and actions with active stakeholders' participation, which can be used by
other countries.

8.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 4)




                                                                                                 15

The project achieved satisfactorily its two main objectives. Outcomes as registered in ISR.

Program Development Objective. After 6 years of the project, many of the environmental and
developmental stakeholders in the Sierra Nevada are much "better informed and organized," and
are "jointly implementing agreed actions to conserve the biological and cultural diversity of the
Sierra Nevada and to use its natural resources in a sustainable manner."

The project engaged key stakeholders in the Sierra comprising: the municipalities linked to the
Sierra in the three nearby departments of Cesar, Magdalena, and Guajira; national institutions
such as the National Park Unit, as well as local organizations such as the Banana and Coffee
Growers' Committee. The project promoted the integration of a farmers' association. Awareness
and collaboration were promoted through: (i) meetings with residents of 20 different
geographical areas to discuss the advantages and suitability of a sustainable development
approach; (ii) regional workshops and other meetings with indigenous organizations and
authorities; (iii) development of a communication strategy that encompassed support for a local-
based radio program, "La Lora Serrana," building new methodologies for collective knowledge
creation, and disseminating the project through different media tools; (iv) design and
implementation of a M&E system that provided different tools for self-evaluation by the
beneficiaries such as the index of organizational capacity; (v) preparation of a menu of options
for sustainable agriculture for the SNSM including an assessment of their financial
sustainability; and (vi) conducting study tours and visits to other organizations. The project also
helped to consolidate the Regional Environmental Forum to play an active role in engaging
stakeholders in environmental and sustainable initiatives.

The Foundation's approach to generate knowledge by first identifying the information needs of
potential beneficiaries, and combining different types of knowledge from residents, indigenous
peoples, and sustainable development experts ensured that this information was accepted and
legitimized by its main users. A survey given to 32 organizations during the participatory
evaluation confirmed the above. As shown in the following table, a significant proportion of
stakeholders considered their knowledge on different sustainable development topics to be
excellent, good, or fair; 53% of these stakeholders reported to hear the program radio.

           Percentage of Responses of Stakeholders' Knowledge Assessment
                                 on Sustainable Development
                                                          Excellent Good           Fair
 Knowledge of biological diversity                                93%
 Knowledge of the Sierra as an ancestral territory                             89%
 Knowledge of water and forest conservation                      100%
 Knowledge of sustainable production                                     83%
 Knowledge of project formulation                           10%                90%

To enhance the organization skills of grassroots and local organizations, the project conducted
100 institutional strengthening workshops for over 40 community organizations, in which
training tools were provided to enhance stakeholders' knowledge and skills on the following
topics: (i) leadership and organizational management; (ii) participation and democratic
institutions; (iii) network building; (iv) coexistence of multiple cultures and conflict resolution;



                                                                                                 16

(v) communication methods and tools; and (vi) sharing of experiences on sustainable
development. To evaluate the results of these efforts, the Foundation applied the Index of
Organizational Capacity (ICO) to three different types of organizations in two phases: August­
September 2005 and six months later in 2006; over 50% of these organizations reported
improvements in their capacity to organize. Of the 14 Community Action Boards and 2
Ecological Groups created, 8 reported a better score due to improvements in their
organizational, financial, and technical skills. It is important to note that the increase in
women's participation and liaison with second-level organization was reported as a factor
contributing to this improvement. The only organizations that did not improve their ICO were
those affected by public safety and relocation of members. Moreover, six of the nine productive
organizations showed improved scores as a result of having a well-defined strategy, resource
mobilization, and support from other organizations. Finally, all of the four educational
organizations interviewed in 2006 showed strong organizational capacity in community
extension, financial skills, and coexistence practices; they achieved over 80%, the maximum
score, in these items.

The Foundation itself gained institutional and operational skills to link the communities with
other actors in the Sierra Nevada and outside, filling a role that was lacking in the past. The
project generated an intercultural dialogue in the Sierra Nevada; farmers and indigenous peoples
now engage in exchanges and joint activities, and mutual respect prevails. This dynamic is
unprecedented in the Sierra Nevada.

Project Development Objective. The Foundation effectively developed and tested in situ
various participatory and operational mechanisms to intervene in the Sierra Nevada. These
mechanisms rightly focused on conservation and on the sustainable use of natural resources,
often linking conservation with the development of local communities. A participatory
methodology was used from the start; it was subsequently fine-tuned through project
implementation and it adapted well to the diverse conditions and needs of the Sierra Nevada and
the project activities. The two main mechanisms to protect natural areas at community level
were a menu of optional practices to address environmental hazards in three regions of the
Sierra Nevada (see example in Annex 4) and the establishment and/or consolidation of 23
"community environmental pacts" to comply with agreed environmental norms to protect
watersheds and forests in meaningful areas in the Sierra.

To assess the impacts of the first mechanism, the project evaluated 45 one-hectare agro-forestry
schemes in the northern zone with an average age per site of 30 months, which ensured the
validity of the sample. The evaluation showed that 82% of these schemes were rated as good or
very good in terms of yields, number of species, and land coverage. Furthermore, in 82% of the
schemes participants reported obtaining greater economic returns and improvements in 50% of
the family food intake. Similarly, 84% of the participants reported that these schemes were of
easy to replicate and did not require additional workdays; moreover, 62% of the producers have
increased the areas of these schemes from 0.25 to 2 hectares with their own resources.

The 23 community environmental pacts are aimed at protecting 4,318 hectares of primary forest
in 19 different micro-catchments. Despite the lack of enforcement mechanisms, an evaluation of



                                                                                              17

the performance of these pacts during 2001­2005 revealed that only a minority were infringed.
To correct this situation, the project with the pacts' participants produced a "pact model" that
could be replicated by the communities and introduced six requirements for the pacts to be
effective, including a component of incentives and self-enforced sanctions.

The 65 subprojects implemented and other community-led initiatives also contributed to the
better use of natural resources through a wide range of environmental practices and productive
alternatives, such as forest protection and demarcation, restoration of degraded farm and forest
areas, pilot agro-forestry practices, organic agriculture (including coffee certification), riverbank
recuperation and protection, territorial and environmental planning, farming practices to
improve production in saline lands, recuperation and enhancement of indigenous farming
systems, and community water supply and sanitation. The impacts of these initiatives were
assessed by the Sustainable Development Index (SDI), which is part of the M&E system. The
SDI measures the progress of an intervention toward the achievement of its goals, i.e., the
balance among the community's well-being, the preservation of cultural diversity, and the
vitality of the natural ecosystems. These three dimensions are approximated by 14 variables,
based on information obtained from the results of the subproject indicators. The SDI at
ecoregion level reported a value of 102.7 percent, which implies that the subprojects met and
exceeded their targets. Overall, the 14 variable indicators reached values between 80­140
percent. Two of the three regions in which these interventions were conducted also reported
similar values for these indicators: Northwest Region (106.5 percent) and North Region (109.7
percent). On the other hand, the Northeast Region scored only 77.3 percent because the value of
three variables did not meet their target, i.e., better sustainability, conservation, and recuperation
of ecosystems and environmental education.

These practices are now well experimented and documented. Therefore, we are ready for a
wide-scale application across the Sierra Nevada region, funding permitting. Overall, the
operational approach was resilient to prevailing violence and served to form a local leadership
that peacefully resisted this situation. This result exceeds technical and operational qualities.

8.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)



An efficiency assessment does not apply to the evaluation of this project. No economic or
financial analyses were conducted because they were not compulsory in a LIL operation
(Annexes 4 and 5 of the PAD were left blank). Accordingly, no economic baseline study was
conducted. In any case, it is worth observing that many of the sustainable production practices
implemented by the project clearly contributed to improved production per hectare and to higher
net farm incomes over the average in the ecoregion; this is confirmed by project assessments,
the Beneficiary Survey, and the Stakeholders' Workshop. Certified ecological production efforts
added value to production, increased and stabilized incomes, and raised self-confidence among
participating farmers. Agro-forestry and horticultural practices enhanced household food



                                                                                                    18

security; this was an excellent contribution because many communities in the Sierra Nevada are
isolated from roads and markets, making the external purchase of foods a labor and economic
burden on families. Section 8.5(a) provides further details.

8.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory


The project satisfactorily achieved its overriding objectives and most of its intended outcomes.
First and foremost, it increased the capacity of the Sierra Nevada's stakeholders to promote
sustainable development practices by generating and disseminating knowledge on how to
conserve and use the Sierra's biological and cultural diversity in a sustainable manner. Second,
the project has been very successful in designing and implementing a participatory methodology
and operational mechanisms for promoting sustainable management of production and natural
systems, as confirmed by the M&E indicators. Moreover, since these methodologies have been
tested and documented, they can be applied to other regions of the Sierra, other regions in
Colombia, and other countries elsewhere with needed adaptations.


The project's objectives and the approach were highly relevant to the socio-environmental
conditions and development challenges of the Sierra Nevada. The final assessment by the
Foundation and the government, and the fact that this approach will be replicated in other
conservation projects in other Latin American countries, confirm this relevance. The efficiency
of this progress is strong, as reflected in the economic benefits reaped by stakeholders from
applying these mechanisms.

8.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


Poverty reduction was not a principal goal of the project. However, many of the investments in
community projects contributed to poverty reduction. Although no systematic poverty assessment
or relevant poverty indicators were in place, many interventions significantly improved farm
production, food/nutrition supplies, and income sources among beneficiaries. In particular, a
number of project activities resulted in economic benefits at the household level, such as organic
coffee networks, dissemination of farming practices adapted to saline lands, introduction of
organic fertilization practices, and agro-forestry and horticultural systems that benefited food
security and nutrition. The participatory Beneficiaries' Assessment provides evidence of the
project's positive impact on poverty reduction, such as assisting households to diversify
production and food resources, integration in business networks (i.e., enhancement of agro-food
chains), reducing production costs, increasing net farm incomes, reducing market dependence
(markets are often distant and expensive for residents), and implementation of new income-
generating activities (see Annex 9 of the participatory Beneficiaries' Assessment).



                                                                                               19

Gender was not a relevant pillar in project design or implementation. Gender equality was
beyond the scope of the project, but the project promoted women's empowerment in different
ways, such as facilitating (and monitoring) the degree and quality of their participation,
supporting women's associations, and aiding women in home gardening techniques that
benefited women's roles in household nutrition. In the La Guajira sub-region, where women are
more prominent and articulated actors, the project had a more intense engagement with women
and a better impact on the status of women and on gender equality. Another unexpected result
was the recognition by male beneficiaries of women's contributions to productive activities and
their capacity as leaders. These results are reported in the beneficiaries' assessment.

Social development in the project had a major impact on strengthening community
organizations, both in their internal functioning and in delivering development initiatives. Inter-
community relations were significantly enhanced, helping to develop a common front to
peacefully face violence. Furthermore, the project stimulated intercultural dialogues between
indigenous peoples and farmers; several intercultural centers were built and intercultural
activities are now spontaneously occur as a result of project interventions, diminishing conflicts
by building mutual understanding. It is worth noting that the project (through its widespread
training, pilot initiatives, and community-led operations) nurtured the emergence of community
leaders, particularly in a region where social/community leadership was nonexistent or weak.
Consequently, the project generated, in subtle ways, a community leadership and enhanced the
social fabric in the Sierra. The new leadership contributed to locally balance power dynamics and
erode the dominance of military rulers (military, paramilitary, or guerrilla rebels).


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer term capacity and institutional development)


Institutional strengthening. The project promoted valuable institutional changes and
institutional strengthening, which were key aspects of the Program Objective and of Component
2. A summary of achievements follows (Sections 8.2 and 11 and Annexes 1 and 4 provide greater
details).

The Foundation, although it has a reduced staff and less financial flows than in the past, has
become a solid and mature partner for conservation purposes and community development goals
in the Sierra Nevada. It has become a respected mediator between internal and external
stakeholders, and has also developed operational mechanisms that will be very useful for
attracting conservation and development initiatives in the Sierra Nevada. The Foundation has
made a difficult, useful, and critical shift from being primarily a research and awareness-raising
organization to becoming an intermediary stakeholder with demonstrated operational capacity.

Grassroots organizations in the Sierra Nevada have been consolidated institutionally, including
their functioning, internal cohesion, and capacity to implement activities and manage funds.
Hundreds of community members have learned to craft community conservation agreements in
their forest areas and watersheds. New community leaders have emerged and consolidated
through the implementation of project activities. Some productive organizations have expanded



                                                                                                20

and reached higher levels of economic activity; Ecolsierra is one of the most successful ones.

Regional institutions have been more difficult to strengthen, particularly public agencies, partly
due to politicized dynamics and also due to a background of low interest among urban structures
in the socio-environmental conditions of the Sierra Nevada. However, some municipalities have
participated in agreements under the project and contributed to subprojects and educational
campaigns. The project also contributed to consolidate the Regional Environmental Forum,
making it an operational organization that brings together the main stakeholders in the Sierra.

The Central Government has enhanced its ability to work with nongovernmental organizations
to achieve common environmental and developmental goals, and has intensified efforts to
establish dialogue and reach consensus with indigenous leaders. These processes have led to
valuable institutional learning. Specific instruments created under the project can be used in the
future to establish similar civil society­government partnerships.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)


The project worked with farmers settled in the Sierra Nevada at a level beyond what was initially
envisaged. This dimension proved very useful and fruitful, turning farmers into conservationists
and questioning the widespread perception of migrating farmers as destroyers of natural
resources and insensitive to indigenous cultures. In fact, the project generated a rich intercultural
dynamic, beyond what was intended and might be expected. Indigenous peoples and farmers
became closer and more aware of their specific and mutual challenges. This is unprecedented in
the Sierra Nevada (and not frequent in indigenous lands in Latin America). The project staff
committed to this with strong effort and vision, taking risks but proving the relevance of their
socially inclusive approach to the Sierra Nevada: in essence, that both indigenous peoples and
farmers are equally critical in conservation and have major development needs. Moreover, the
emergence and consolidation of a stronger farmer leadership helped to create a common front
and peaceful resistance to violent groups in the Sierra.

8.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for LIL, details in annexes)


A Beneficiary Survey was conducted during the last meeting of representatives from all
grassroots organizations participating in the project (held in Santa Marta from June 6 to 10,
2006). The results of the survey show that the project has boosted enthusiasm and has raised
capacities of local people and organizations to learn about their environment; it revealed their
capacity to devote themselves to the protection and appreciation of the Sierra Nevada, to engage
in collaborative processes and alliances, and to explore alternative production systems that are
more environmentally and culturally sensitive. The main conclusions of the survey are as
follows: (i) beneficiaries had a positive perception of the project and are happy with the learning
and dynamics it generated; (ii) substantial learning and organizational strengthening are widely
reported across organizations and regions; (iii) the implementation of the project posed various
challenges to beneficiaries to directly execute subprojects; particularly regarding a number of



                                                                                                  21

complex procedures and some delays, but these did not discourage beneficiaries, who actually
learned from the challenges faced; and (iv) the project used a participatory approach and
achieved its objectives; beneficiaries reported empowerment and increased self-esteem.

A Stakeholders' Workshop was conducted during the last meeting of representatives from all
grassroots organizations participating in the project. It was held in Santa Marta from June 6 to 10,
2006, and began with the Beneficiary Survey, which provided elements for discussion. The
Stakeholders' Workshop represented a comprehensive, participatory assessment of the project's
implementation, results, impacts, and lessons learned. The workshop served to: (i) allow
beneficiaries to openly assess and judge project interventions; (ii) confirm that a participatory
approach was used throughout the project; (iii) compile the broad set of interventions conducted
throughout the project; (iv) substantiate the "lessons learned" process by examining and
validating some of the specific lessons; (v) identify problems encountered by beneficiaries; (vi)
collect recommendations from beneficiaries for future projects; and (vii) allow beneficiaries the
opportunity to share experiences, lessons learned, and ideas. This forum also served as an
opportunity to express commitment to the farmers' network and continue working together
toward common goals summarized in an agreement called the Bellavista Declaration, signed by
all community leaders attending the event.

9. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate


The Sierra Nevada continues to be a priority area for the Colombian Government because of its
biodiversity and cultural wealth. Moreover, it plays a key role in the Peace and Development
initiative. Therefore, additional funds and efforts are expected to flow toward the Sierra, in order
to support the initiatives developed under the project. However, various exogenous factors must
be taken into account to ensure the permanence of the development outcome:

    ·    The project has successfully worked in a context of violence and its participatory
         approach has proven especially resilient to the civil conflict. However, violence remains
         a threat to the initiatives conducted.

    ·    The Foundation is now a more experienced operational institution that has consolidated
         its legitimacy in the Sierra. It must now face the challenge of overcoming its temporary
         decline in personnel and funding to be able to replicate and expand the lessons learned.

    ·    With the indigenous federation's new leadership, there is now an opportunity to reach an
         agreement on participation in programs involving indigenous peoples. This agreement
         should be pursued so that the indigenous population can benefit from all the information,
         knowledge, and operational dynamics generated by the project.

    ·    An ongoing dissemination of sustainable development methodologies and a collaborative
         spirit among stakeholders in the region are necessary to address the challenges the people
         from the Sierra face and to consolidate the operational mechanisms developed under the
         project.


                                                                                                  22

10. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
10.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)


Rating: Satisfactory


The Bank had an overall satisfactory performance during the identification, preparation, and
appraisal of the project. It offered a flexible lending instrument (i.e., the LIL) that was well suited
to the complex project area and its development challenges, and was highly innovative in
introducing a new development approach while being fully consistent with the CAS. The Bank
allowed room for the project to explore from a wide range of technical choices and participation
methods. At design and appraisal, the Bank conducted a comprehensive and in-depth social
assessment that was the root of its success. The institutional analysis conducted to assess the
Foundation's capacity provided recommendations for consolidating specific capabilities and
preparing an institutional strengthening program to address weaknesses. Moreover, by selecting a
private sector agency to execute the project, the Bank also helped to generate and strengthen
experience in public­private partnerships. Although the risks identified were correctly assessed,
the fact that Colombia has a high level of institutional fragility should have been considered for a
more in-depth risk assessment.


(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory


Overall, supervision was satisfactory. The World Bank team, both in Washington D.C. and in the
Bank's office in Bogotá, was very supportive of the project, particularly in moments of crisis.
Supervision missions were conducted as required and provided not only timely advice but
technical support to resolve specific issues as well; international specialists were brought in to
help in the preparation of the M&E, advise on sustainable development and community
livelihoods, and help the Foundation to address its institutional challenges. The loan agreement
proposed an independent Mid-Term Review; accordingly, the process was commissioned
externally through a competitive process carried out by the Foundation. However, this evaluation
did not provide concrete recommendations to improve implementation. At the Bank's request the
consultant prepared an additional report to overcome these weaknesses; however, the results did
not achieve the quality expected. From the very beginning, the Bank was closely following the
preparation of the M&E system, but it was difficult to reach an agreement among the Foundation,
DNP, and the Bank on the model to be adopted. Thus, it took longer than expected to establish a
fully operational system agreeable to all parts. All applicable safeguard policies were respected
and monitored at all times. The relationship with the borrower, specifically DNP, was mostly
positive and productive, even when the frequent changes of interlocutors required extra effort to


                                                                                                    23

build mutual trust.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory


The Bank committed to an innovative and highly relevant project despite inherent risks. It
provided timely and adequate supervision and technical support. Moreover, in the moments of
crisis, the Bank continued to support the project and was truly instrumental for its continuation
and completion. Performance is thus satisfactory.

10.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.


On the whole, the performance of the Government was satisfactory. The Government maintained
its confidence in the LIL as a flexible and valuable financial instrument. It endorsed a civil
society partner as the executing agency to lead this development intervention in the Sierra
Nevada. Because of the innovative nature of this arrangement, the operational flow of resources
and reporting processing was not easy; in fact, it had to be adjusted to respond to additional
controls and monitoring established in the change in administrations. However, government
commitment was evident in the hiring of staff dedicated to the project and the additional
counterpart resources provided to facilitate project completion.

The Government's decision to select the National Planning Department (DNP) as the government
counterpart was intended in principle to avoid possible conflict of interest with the Minister of
Environment at the time; who was formerly linked to the Foundation. This decision was adequate
because at the time of project launch, DNP was implementing various regional development
programs, including Plan Caribe, which comprised the Sierra Nevada. However, when the new
administration closed this Plan and the Environmental Policy Bureau that replaced it lost most of
its staff consequently, its supervision capacity was seriously affected. Consequently, DNP could
not always provide adequate and timely supervision during implementation, particularly in the
project's final years. Nevertheless, overall DNP made substantial efforts to support the project
and, in fact, some of its personnel were often strongly dedicated to seeing the project advance,
taking on extra responsibilities, such as conducting field visits when problems arose and engaging
in discussions on politically controversial matters with indigenous representatives to ensure
project continuation.

Finally, it should be noted that DNP's role was also affected in the midst of implementation by a
strict inspection by Colombia's National Audit Agency (the Contraloría Nacional) which resulted
in additional control measures. This strict inspection disturbed project implementation and
created unnecessary and groundless suspicions among some project stakeholders. The agreement
to implement an Action Plan to address the Audit Agency's concerns positively resolved this
issue and in the end contributed to increased transparency in project execution.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance (i.e., the Foundation)

Rating: Satisfactory.

The Foundation's performance in project implementation was satisfactory. It remained at all
times dedicated and committed to the project and its beneficiaries: it assumed institutional risks
when needed, and was able to operate in a region beset by violence. The final phase of the project
(2004­2006) is very commendable for its high level of operational intensity and success,
particularly with regard to the implementation of several community-based subprojects. In this
period, 32 subprojects, selected on a competitive basis following a manual approved by the Bank,
were directly implemented by community organizations. Some of these subprojects were
continuations of previous efforts. The Foundation at all times used a participatory, horizontal, and
democratic approach in its interventions, which benefited project implementation and the
engagement of grassroots stakeholders. The Foundation succeeded in identifying and promoting
appropriate interventions and innovations for the Sierra Nevada. The Foundation built capacities
and self-confidence in many communities that live in conditions of isolation and marginalization.

To achieve this success the Foundation had to undertake an in-depth organizational and cultural
change to become a more operational and results-oriented institution. This process was slow and
painful and during the first two years it constrained implementation. The Bank provided support
throughout this process and worked with the Foundation on an organizational restructuring that
was discussed and agreed with by its entire staff. Nevertheless, it took some time for the
Foundation to fully adopt new managerial procedures and for all staff to follow new operational
standards. Moreover, the Foundation had to follow up on the strict accountability and reporting
procedures demanded by the Audit Unit. Management instability and some weak decision
making, particularly in 2003, undermined project execution and delayed work plans, particularly
the institutional strengthening program.

At the end, implementation proved to be a learning process that empowered the Foundation to
implement future projects financed by national or international public agencies and corroborated
its comparative advantage in implementing the project in a violence-ridden and socially-sensitive
region.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory


Both the Government (particularly DNP as counterpart) and the Foundation (as implementing
agency) had a satisfactory performance, not only because of their accomplishments, but also
because of the many efforts they devoted to make the project advance, solving emerging
problems and finding operational alternatives as needed. DNP and the Foundation were
committed to the genuine objectives of the project and to the need for channeling funds to benefit
the rural communities of the Sierra Nevada.

11. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)
Project Specific: The project fulfilled its goals in the three core learning areas proposed in
the PAD:


Core learning area 1. Identify, test, and deploy modes to promote biodiversity conservation and
natural resource management in a conflictive environment, in ways that brought stakeholders
together around common goals. The project achieved this purpose by developing and
implementing a participatory strategy that identified and brought Sierra communities to work
together. More specifically, the project supported effective and flexible mechanisms to provide
training, capacity building, and investment resources that serve to build common grounds for
different stakeholders, promote intercultural dialogue, and implement alternatives to improve
livelihoods and biodiversity conservation at local and regional levels.


Core learning area 2. Advance the management of protected areas and environmentally-
sensitive zones in ways that are consistent with social, cultural, and economic conditions. The
project developed organizational and technical alternatives to complement local knowledge and
address priority needs including: the many community-based ecological protection agreements
that were reached; support for food sufficiency and sustainable farming, with practices tested and
implemented; and comprehensive training activities that created synergies between the protection
of the Sierra Nevada's natural resource base and the livelihoods of its inhabitants.


Core learning area 3. Identification and promotion of sustainable production systems on
existing farms and in production areas in the Sierra Nevada. The project examined, tested, and
implemented numerous examples of sustainable production systems in the context of the Sierra
Nevada, from organic coffee to farm diversification, and from ecological soil management to
land recovery. These methods were jointly tested with the beneficiaries and became regular
practices in their activities. The fact that many farmers exceeded goals and continue to expand
activities with their own resources shows ownership and adopted capability.

Section 8 above and Annex 1 provide further analysis on the fulfillment of the core learning
areas.


General lessons: The project confirmed that in a violence-ridden and socially complex region,
civil society and nongovernmental organizations are adequate partners in effective interventions,
particularly where the presence of public institutions is weak. In fact, its engagement with the
public sector can precisely introduce the institutional dynamic and the spirit of collective decision
making necessary in this situation, in two ways: (i) enhancing government capacity to operate in
difficult conditions; and (ii) promoting community participation and social responsibility.

The project also provided more concrete and some unexpected lessons, as explained below:

  · Investment modalities. Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs) are valuable lending
      instruments for pioneer projects and for interventions in complex and delicate contexts;



                                                                                                  26

  their value added is particularly clear in the design of projects that face risky conditions.
  Flexibility during implementation is also important: for instance, in greater simplicity in
  monitoring and reporting, as well as              mechanisms for community financing
  (procurement/disbursement).

· Government­civil society partnerships. The flexibility of the Foundation as Project
  Executor and its recognition in the Sierra as a neutral independent actor helped to
  overcome the risks identified at preparation and encountered during implementation.
  However, the engagement of nonpublic partners in managing public funds and investments
  introduced some difficulties during implementation in the management of public funds and
  the establishment of control mechanisms. In this regard, the main lesson is that a
  government­civil society partnership requires a careful design of the institutional
  framework, ensuring that roles, disbursement flows, and reporting requirements, among
  other elements, are well defined and mutually agreed.

· Community Participation. The project introduced a participatory operational framework
  for rural development and ecological conservation in the Sierra Nevada. Interventions in
  the past were too small, fragmentary, or isolated, as well as paternalistic. The project gave
  grassroots organizations full responsibility for execution and use of funds. This approach
  proved to be a turning point for farmers' organizations which assumed total responsibility
  and demonstrated strict respect for "transparency" and "accountability," essential for the
  management of public funds. Field visits showed the capacity farmers have gained with
  training and capacity building provided by the project, as well as their pride in their
  organizational and development skills improvements. Formerly individualistic and
  disorganized farmers created a strong social network in which they learned to work
  together and presented peaceful opposition to violent actors, which ultimately was the key
  to the project's success.

· Public awareness. The project contributed to improve knowledge about the Sierra and was
  very successful in working with schools and various productive actors by raising awareness
  and commitment about conservation of the Sierra. Agreements with the Coffee Growers'
  Committee and the Banana Growers' Organization were very successful in the introduction
  of sustainable practices; organic coffee production has been thriving. However, the project
  was less successful in engaging local governments, partly due to difficulties in coordinating
  actions with the three departments and 16 municipalities throughout the Sierra and
  overcoming political differences that hinder the reaching of concrete agreements. On the
  positive side the project helped to consolidate the Regional Environment Forum as an
  organization that brings together regional actors to discuss conservation of the Sierra.

· Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). An M&E system in LIL operations is part of the
  learning process; although this approach is necessary to adapt to actions and processes that
  are only incorporated during implementation, this can keep the M&E system from being
  fully operational, as was the case in this project. At the same time, M&E systems should be
  as simple as possible and adaptable to a diverse range of users (e.g., coordinators, auditors,
  beneficiaries), especially when a project foresees community-based subprojects and other



                                                                                            27

      activities. Therefore, it is recommended that the Bank develop guidelines to support
      preparation of M&E Systems in community-driven projects, to make them both flexible
      and timely.

  · Civil Society Capacity Building. The project was able to take the risk of selecting the
      Foundation to execute the project and increase regional institutional capacity. The
      Foundation has evolved from an institution that formerly focused on conservation and
      socio-ecological research in the Sierra Nevada, into a fully operational organization that is
      able to channel investments and engage communities and other stakeholders in sustainable
      production and in grassroots conservation efforts. The Foundation has also contributed to
      the empowerment of indigenous organizations, although in the process this meant a shift
      from its former relationships with indigenous representatives. This has actually had a
      positive effect on the indigenous organizations, which have become more autonomous and
      self-confident. The Foundation has also played an unprecedented role in helping the
      farmers in the Sierra Nevada to become a self-sufficient, capable organization. Overall, the
      Foundation has assumed a new, vital role as a bridge between the Sierra Nevada and other
      national and international actors interested in its conservation.

      Social innovation. The participatory strategy linked to the project's capacity-building
      activities was critical to ensure social inclusion in interventions in the Sierra Nevada. It
      supported many farmers' groups in the Sierra, which were very weak in organizational
      terms and largely ignored by development agents. Participant farmers are now organized,
      are active in intercommunity events and in intercultural exchanges with indigenous
      peoples, and have gained leverage to attract public sector programs to further support them.
      An additional result of project implementation is that both indigenous peoples and farmers
      have better relationships and a collaborative spirit; they are also more aware of their
      specific and mutual challenges. This is unprecedented in the Sierra Nevada (and not
      frequent in indigenous lands in Latin America). In fact, both indigenous peoples and
      farmers are now equally committed to conservation and their participation is crucial for the
      sustainable development of the Sierra.

Annex 1. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The first project objective (the so-called Program Objective) was successfully achieved.
After the 6 years of project implementation, many of the environmental and developmental
stakeholders in the Sierra Nevada are much "better informed and organized" in the region, and are
"implementing jointly agreed actions to conserve the biological and cultural diversity of the Sierra
Nevada and to use its natural resources in a sustainable manner." The project engaged most of the
relevant stakeholders in the Sierra Nevada in awareness raising, collaborative actions, and
investment activities. These stakeholders included several community organizations, the
indigenous federation (CTC), various local committees (such as many Juntas de Acción
Comunal), women's associations, cooperatives, and producers' networks (e.g., Ecolsierra,
COOFRUMAG), various public agencies (such as the Parks Service and several municipalities),
and educational institutions. Their involvement comprised a wide range of activities, in particular:

    ·   Raising and sharing knowledge: e.g., over 160 community organizations received targeted
        training support, and various intercommunity and regional exchange events were
        organized;

    ·   Joint actions and agreements: e.g., 23 community agreements were established for
        ecological protection and sustainable natural resource management; and

    ·   Implementation of nature conservation and sustainable development activities: 65
        subprojects were financed (with a 95% successful completion rate), and 360 farms
        adopted at least 3 sustainable management and production systems, serving as
        demonstration sites.

The project engaged the stakeholders at three main organizational levels: (i) community and
grassroots organizations; (ii) cooperatives, agricultural enterprises, and intercommunity
federations; and (iii) municipal and regional bodies. Spaces for dialogue and cooperation across
the three organizational levels were also established and supported by the project: for example,
three ecoregional meetings were held between 2004 and 2006, and partial support was provided to
the Regional Environmental Council of the Sierra Nevada, which the project aimed to establish as
an integrated space for agreement and planning among key stakeholders in the Sierra Nevada. In
general, the project worked more intensively and successfully with the first and second
organizational levels, and showed weaknesses and mixed results when working with municipal
and regional entities, partly due to the micro-political dynamics usually occurring at that level.

The project succeeded in engaging and empowering community and grassroots organizations for
biological conservation and sustainable production purposes. Many farmers' groups in the Sierra
Nevada de Santa Marta National Park's buffer belt, which were very weak and largely ignored by
development agents, consolidated well and gained confidence. Farmers are now organized to
participate in intercommunity events and in intercultural exchanges with indigenous peoples.
Community organizations in the project's four regions are currently very capable of executing
their own project proposals, employing transparent means to manage public funds. Field visits



                                                                                                  30

showed their capabilities as well as their pride regarding their gains in organizational and
development skills.

The indigenous federation of the Sierra Nevada (CTC) participated at its own request in capacity
building in a broad sense, well suited to the first project objective. Although overall project
support to indigenous organizations and communities was much lower and more partial than
anticipated (due to various implementation problems, as explained in Section 7.2), the project had
a substantial impact on the organizational capacity of the CTC, which had been founded shortly
before the project began. In fact, the project supported the CTC's negotiations with the
government through the Ministry of Environment, through which it gained negotiating skills and
political strength. At present, the indigenous federation is a consolidated and legitimized body,
with capacity and experience in holding negotiations with government representatives. The
project and the Foundation's efforts contributed to this result.

The involvement of public agencies, such as municipalities, was lower than expected. The
Foundation had a weaker experience in working with them, and perhaps low confidence in their
vocation to development in the Sierra Nevada. Because some of the municipal and regional
governments in the region are frequently politicized, it is difficult to work with them. However,
there were successful experiences in working with municipalities on watershed protection and
solid waste collection. There was a positive partnership with the National Parks Unit to share
information and practices. The project also provided support and technical assistance to the
Regional Environment Council, an inter-departmental environmental council for the entire Sierra
Nevada comprising representatives of the three Sierra Nevada's department and their 16
municipalities, producer organizations, various NGOs, the CTC, and central government
representatives in the Sierra.

The Foundation evolved toward a more results-oriented institution, now serving as an
intermediary between communities in the Sierra Nevada and other national and international
stakeholders, a role no other organization has ever played in the past. The project also introduced
the Foundation to an operational dynamic, notably supporting community and development
subprojects. The Foundation had never implemented so many development projects, with so many
communities, under a systematic approach. Proof of the Foundation's operational learning and
capacities are the many training activities and programs presented, the 65 subprojects
implemented, the 23 community agreements reached, and the 360 pilot/demonstration farms
established. In addition, communities in the Sierra Nevada now recognize the Foundation as an
institution to which development initiatives and other related projects can be proposed: for
example, over 51 subproject requests were received in 2004 to compete for project funding.

The project stimulated the drafting and signing of "environmental pacts" at the community level,
in order to effectively protect areas of high natural value, particularly hilltops, prime forest,
watercourses, and micro-catchments. A total of 23 such pacts were established and signed, and
they remain effective at the end of the project. In addition, the degree of community involvement
in these pacts is high, which suggests that the project has succeeded in implementing this
conservation mechanism.

An unexpected but highly valuable effect of the project was to generate an intercultural dialogue


                                                                                                31

and attitude in the Sierra Nevada. The project helped farmers and indigenous peoples to engage in
dialogue, joint activities, and developing mutual knowledge and respect. Although this effort does
not cover all the regions in the Sierra, it has set up a model that is being replicated elsewhere. This
is an unusual phenomenon in the history of the Sierra Nevada and at the same time a positive
impact in line with the project's objectives.

The second objective was equally achieved and, in fact, its impacts prove remarkably
valuable.

In the first place, the project developed and executed a participatory strategy systematically
employed in its interventions; this strategy was improved and fine-tuned as the project evolved
and new challenges emerged. In addition, the project prepared and tested, with positive results,
various "operational mechanisms for promoting sustainable management of production and
natural systems," which are viable and clearly applicable in the social and environmental context
of the Sierra Nevada. These operational mechanisms represent an innovation in the Sierra Nevada
and therefore constitute a valuable platform to expand sustainable development.

These efforts were designed and tested during the first phase of implementation through
Foundation-led projects jointly executed with the communities; some techniques were abandoned
because they were either costly or not well adapted to the Sierra's cultural and economic
conditions. Between 2004 and 2006, once the resources initially committed to the GEF were
available, the project engaged in a very intense and equally successful operational phase. Various
operational mechanisms were implemented and tested in the different pilot areas of the Sierra
Nevada. These mechanisms comprised environmental agreements and community-led initiatives
selected under a competitive process and directly implemented by the communities; these proved
to be highly effective and viable. A wide range of environmental practices and productive
alternatives were experienced and adopted: forest protection and demarcation, restoration of
degraded farm and forest areas, pilot agro-forestry practices, organic agriculture (including coffee
and cacao certification), farm diversification, riverbank recuperation and protection, territorial and
environmental planning, local conservation of bird fauna, beekeeping, horticulture to improve
food security, farming practices to improve production on saline lands, recuperation and
enhancement of indigenous farming systems, sustainable collection of forest products, handcraft
initiatives, environmental and sustainable agricultural education, and community water supply
and sanitation. A total of 65 community-based subprojects, 23 environmental pacts, over 350
demonstration plots, and countless training and participatory initiatives indicate the volume and
tangible impact of the operational dynamism implemented in the communities of the Sierra
Nevada.

In essence, the project succeeded in preparing, experimenting with, and fine-tuning various
participatory and, most importantly, operational mechanisms to intervene in the Sierra Nevada.
These served to effectively engage inhabitants and communities in conservation of the natural
resource base and sustainable production means. These mechanisms are now well experimented
and documented and are ready for wide-scale application across the Sierra Nevada region as
funding flows in. It should be noted that such mechanisms were resilient to the pervasive violent
conditions that affect the Sierra Nevada; consequently, their importance exceeds their technical



                                                                                                   32

and operational qualities. The mechanisms are thus validated and could be useful elsewhere in
Colombia and in regions with similar development challenges and constraints.

The four key performance indicators to assess achievement of project objectives were all
reached positively, as indicated below:

 ·   The project funded a total of 65 community-based subprojects and other initiatives for
     sustainable development (the original target was 62). This is a substantial achievement,
     particularly in view of the delays experienced in the implementation of operational
     interventions. The majority (95%) of these subprojects have been successfully completed. A
     project management index, which was prepared as part of the M&E System and widely
     applied for the second operational phase, shows a 84% success rate for the 32 subprojects
     carried out in that phase.

 ·   In 2004, when a demand-driven mechanism was put in place to fund community subprojects
     to be selected on a competitive basis, the project received over 50 subproject proposals, 13
     of which came from organizations and communities outside the pilot regions (particularly
     from Zona Norte, Guajira, and Palmor).

 ·   The project promoted a variety of agreements among stakeholders. In 2001­2004, the
     project supported 7 agreements to carry out various awareness campaigns and
     environmental and developmental actions in the Sierra Nevada. The project engaged key
     stakeholders such as the National Parks Service Unit (Unidad Administrativa Especial de
     Parques Nacionales), and the Tayrona and Sierra Nevada Park Authorities, the CTC, one
     municipality (Pueblo Bello) ,and the renowned Ecolsierra network of sustainable coffee
     producers and exporters which was developed under the project. In addition, the project
     supported the Regional Environmental Council's operations as an integrated platform for
     planning and agreeing on conservation and sustainable development actions in the entire
     Sierra Nevada. All the agreements were successfully implemented and completed.
     Furthermore, the project fully supported the establishment of 23 community agreements for
     the protection of forest areas and watersheds, which represents an innovative and practical
     conservation mechanism for the Sierra Nevada; more than 6,000 hectares of forest were
     protected by this effort.

 ·   The project supported over 200 farmers in establishing sustainable production systems.
     Over 150 farmers adopted agro-forestry, silvo-pastoral, and/or horticultural practices, all of
     which included sustainable soil management practices such as hillside protection and land
     management practices that replace the slash-and-burn method. In addition, 81 coffee
     producers have engaged in sustainable production systems and have attained international
     certification. The project provided technical assistance on sustainable practices to over 500
     farms, 70% of which adopted 3 or more sustainable production practices. The farmers
     supported by the project became demonstration farmers for their communities; therefore,
     the degree of impact is even greater.

Annex 4. Outputs by Component


Component 1. Knowledge generation and dissemination of best practices

The project successfully conducted a wide range of activities to generate and disseminate
knowledge on the Sierra Nevada. Relevant outputs include:

    · The multifactor study carried out to define a coherent set of regions that comprise the
      Sierra Nevada, thus facilitating the project's and future interventions in the Sierra.

    · The Participation Strategy and Communication Strategy which were the basis of all project
      interventions.

    · A total of 11 participatory diagnostic surveys at selected sites in the Sierra (called
      "unidades funcionales de encuentro), conducted throughout the three project intervention
      areas: Northwest, Northeast, and Southwest. These entailed 142 events aimed at: (i)
      increasing awareness among communities and other stakeholders on various social and
      environmental issues in the Sierra Nevada; (ii) setting priorities for financing community-
      based subprojects; and (iii) the implementation of conservation and development initiatives
      at community level.

    · Preparation of several studies on sustainable production and conservation such as the
      analysis and recommendations on the Sierra Nevada's soils, protection of micro-
      catchments, and evaluation of subprojects' contributions to conservation.

    · The project organized 3 ecoregional meetings (October 2004, October 2005, and June
      2006) with the full participation of the 32 organizations engaged in the 2004­2006
      operational phase. These meetings represented intensive and wide-scale opportunities for
      sharing experiences and best practices and for consolidating farmers' organizations.

    · Most of the 65 subprojects financed included activities to test and disseminate best
      practices for sustainable production systems. In other words, the project's operational
      portfolio had the indirect benefit of raising and disseminating practical knowledge for
      sustainable development in the Sierra Nevada, including the areas of agro-forestry, organic
      coffee and cacao systems, soil and water management, and beekeeping.

    · Over 90% of organizations participating in the Beneficiary Survey indicated that the
      project helped to improve their knowledge and awareness of the Sierra Nevada's
      environment, especially its biodiversity, water, and natural resources management.

In addition, the project developed a solid communication strategy, which comprises:

    · Various publications, guidelines, and training manuals that disseminate lessons learned by
      the project and best practices for sustainable development. These materials are technically
      sound, well written, and user friendly. The project produced countless charts, maps,
      brochures, and other tools for educational, information, and public awareness purposes.
      Three very successful children's books about conservation have been published.

    · A weekly radio program entitled "La Lora Serrana" to raise awareness and disseminate




                                                                                              40

      information on various ecological, social, developmental, and sustainability initiatives in
      the Sierra Nevada. As of September 2006, the program had a total of 273 broadcasts.
      Although it does not cover the entire Sierra Nevada, due to logistical problems, its
      coverage is significant and many inhabitants freely participate and listen to it.

    · The project has produced a total of 21 videos and short documentary films that report
      successful initiatives for conservation and sustainable development in the Sierra Nevada.
      Some of the focus on specific communities has provided a useful tool to promote their
      activities and seek public and private funding.

The project supported project implementation activities and meetings of the Regional
Environmental Council. A total of 44 reports reflect the activities conducted. However, success is
mixed due to the political influence of some of its members.

The project compiled and disseminated lessons learned, mostly through user-friendly
publications and guidelines, as well as through radio and video materials. A book financed by the
Bank summarizes the six-year project implementation and lessons learned.

Component 2. Participation, organizational strengthening, and coordination for sustainable
development in the ecoregion

The project has increased the participation of communities and other stakeholders in
understanding, discussing, and responding to the Sierra Nevada's key environmental and
development     challenges.   Furthermore,    project   intervention    has   generated  wide-scale
organizational strengthening. In the Beneficiary Survey, half of the participating organizations
report that the project's main impact was on organizational strengthening and 70% of the
participating organizations report a highly positive benefit of the project on their organizational
capacities.

The project conducted 161 training modules targeted to community-based organizations (CBOs),
distributed as follows: 62 CBOs were trained in organizational matters; 38 CBOs were trained in
subproject formulation; 24 CBOs were trained in leadership and conflict management; 32 CBOs
received trained on territorial management; and 5 CBOs were trained in indigenous legislation
and intercultural dialogue. During the 2004­2006 operational phase, various community
organizations directly and successfully managed the funds for their subprojects.

The Foundation and the indigenous organizations of the Sierra Nevada conducted 105 meetings
between 1999 and 2005, which served to address issues and analyze various matters such as
Indigenous Peoples' Life Plans, their role as territorial authorities, etc. These meetings were duly
recorded by the Foundation and constitute a manual of negotiations with indigenous peoples. In
addition, an agreement was signed with the CTC to carry out an organizational strengthening
program and to develop institutional strategies.

The project provided technical assistance and ongoing monitoring and support to all beneficiaries
and organizations engaged in the 65 community-based subprojects.

The Foundation has significantly strengthened itself internally, particularly in terms of planning
and executing its operational portfolio at community level. The Foundation has become a solid



                                                                                                 41

intermediary between Sierra Nevada communities and external political, financial, and economic
actors. The progress achieved is demonstrated by an independent external institutional evaluation
of the Foundation which rated its operational capacity as 7.5 over 10 (evaluation conducted by
Red PRODEPAZ).

Component 3. Operational mechanisms for collaborative management and development of
sustainable production systems

The project successfully developed and executed an operational mechanism, comprising
technical and organizational activities, to support the conservation of the Sierra Nevada and
sustainable development practices at community level. This operational mechanism was used to
execute 7 broad intervention agreements during 2001­2004 and a total of 65 community-based
subprojects. Of the 65 subprojects, 99% were successfully completed. More communities
requested subprojects and widespread initiatives for financing and technical assistance were
available to meet the demand (this high demand indicates the interest in the Foundation and the
project across the region). At the end of the project, the Foundation received a grant from
USAID-FUPAD to continue funding these initiatives.

The operational dimension of the project also helped communities establish conservation
schemes in the form of 23 community environmental agreements. These include agreements for
the conservation of forest areas, the protection of water sources and watersheds, and collaborative
sustainable management of natural resources. At project completion, these agreements remain in
effect and are respected by their signatories.

Regarding the testing and implementation of sustainable production systems, the project helped
establish more than 359 demonstration farms that used at least 3 sustainable practices. In
addition, more than 233 demonstration farms are operating with integrated sustainable production
systems.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)

Background. A Beneficiary Survey was conducted during the last gathering of representatives
from all grassroots organizations participating in the project. It was held in Santa Marta from
June 6 to 10, 2006. A total of 61 beneficiaries participated in the survey, representing the 32 main
organizations participating in the project, particularly those in operational activities (i.e.,
subprojects). A set of structured questionnaires, with both targeted and open choices, were
followed, as indicated below:


  · Questionnaire 1: Basic information on the participants and their organization (7 questions).
  · Questionnaire 2: Results of the subproject or initiative carried out (10 questions)
  · Questionnaire 3: Assessment of activities with a focus on participation, knowledge,
    organizational strengthening, sustainable production, operational mechanisms, and
    collaborative environmental agreements (a total of 35 questions).
  · Questionnaire 4: Lessons learned (6 questions)
  · Questionnaire 5: Focal groups' analysis; for women, men, and youth (27 questions).
  · Questionnaire 6: Achievement of project objectives (7 questions)

Main results. There is an overall positive assessment by beneficiaries on the project's scope,
strategies, implementation, and results. Most beneficiary organizations indicate that the project
has had a positive impact in terms of organizational strength (70%); in fact, this was the most
reported result. Among the organizations engaged in the financial management of subprojects,
most reported a successful yet challenging process (80%), adding that their organization is now
well prepared to manage new initiatives and resources (93%). Beneficiaries also reported that the
project definitely helped them to adopt more sustainable production systems (81%). The most
challenging issues were: (i) preparing subproject proposals and documents for approval, (ii)
reaching agreements among community members, and (iii) time available to conduct project
activities, which was sometimes insufficient.

The Beneficiary Survey was well designed and comprehensive. It was adequately conducted and
the collected information was well analyzed. The results show that the project has created
enthusiasm and has raised capacities of local people and organizations to learn about their
environment, to devote themselves to the protection and appreciation of the Sierra Nevada, to
engage in collaborative processes and alliances, and to explore alternative production systems
that are more environmentally and culturally sensitive. The main conclusions of the survey are as
follows:

  (i)   beneficiaries had a positive perception of the project and are happy with the learning and
        dynamics generated;
  (ii)  substantial learning and organizational strengthening is widely reported across
        organizations and regions;
  (iii) project implementation posed a number of challenges to beneficiaries, particularly
        regarding various complex procedures, and experienced some delays, but these did not
        discourage beneficiaries, who learned from the challenges faced; and
  (iv) the project used a participatory approach and achieved its objectives.




                                                                                                 47

Annex 9. Stakeholders' Workshop Report and Results (if any)

A Stakeholders' Workshop was conducted during the last gathering of representatives from all
grassroots organizations participating in the project. It was held in Santa Marta from June 6 to 10
2006. It first served to conduct a Beneficiary Survey (see Annex 8), which provided substantial
elements for discussion. The Stakeholders' Workshop represented a participatory assessment of
project implementation, results, impacts, and lessons learned.


A total of 61 beneficiaries participated in the workshop, representing the 32 main organizations
participating in the project, particularly those in operational activities (i.e., those engaged in the
subprojects). An exhaustive report was later produced, containing both the analyzed results of the
Beneficiary Survey and the essence of the discussions held. The report has a large amount of
information which is well collected, displayed, and analyzed. It also contains various comments
and recommendations from beneficiaries.


The workshop served the following goals successfully:


    ·   to allow beneficiaries to openly assess and judge project interventions;

    ·   to confirm that a participatory approach was used throughout the project;

    ·   to compile the broad set of interventions conducted throughout the project;

    ·   to substantiate the "lessons learned" process, examining and validating some of the
        specific lessons learned;

    ·   to identify problems encountered by beneficiaries;

    ·   to gather recommendations from beneficiaries for future projects; and

    ·   to allow beneficiaries the opportunity to share experiences, lessons learned, and ideas.


In general, the Stakeholders' Workshop Report is in line with and complementary to the analysis
and conclusions reached during the ICR mission.

Annex 10. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower's ICR

Project objectives were relevant for the Sierra Nevada Ecoregion. Project design was, in general
terms, adequate and responded to national policies and development priorities. The project
indicators and the Beneficiaries' Survey show that beneficiaries have increased their knowledge
and awareness of the Sierra Nevada, that their organizations are strengthened, and that the
processes generated are useful to enhance ecological conservation in the region. At the same
time, the project consolidated a participatory operational model for community development and
conservation in the Sierra Nevada, which is equally applicable elsewhere in Colombia and in
other regions with similar contexts.

The institutional arrangements were not sufficiently defined during the design phase with regard
to the flow of funds and control mechanisms. Future projects should devote more attention to the
institutional arrangements in order to ease implementation. The Government considers
implementation through a nongovernmental organization as positive and effective overall.
However, it considers that it would have been better to engage another partner to be in charge of
the project's financial administration, so that the Foundation could have been devoted to its very
demanding technical and field responsibilities. The DNP was not the best suited government
agency to oversee the project, yet it took it as a challenge and extracted useful learning. The
Government considers that the support from the World Bank was positive and continuous.
Finally, the borrower confirms that the joint formulation of the project together with the GEF
operation had a negative impact on project implementation because it tied its implementation to
the other.

From an institutional viewpoint, the major lessons learned were: (i) the implementation of a
"learning and innovation" project provides flexibility but also presents challenges; and (ii)
"monitoring and evaluation" are critical in the implementation of development projects such as
this one.

It is recommended that the expected lessons learned be better defined, monitored, and
documented in order to optimize impact on future operations.

Borrower's Comments on the draft ICR

    · The PAD distinguishes between the project's objective and the program's (Foundation's)
         objective; DNP suggested that the ICR clearly distinguish the one from the other and not
         subordinate. An agreement was reached for the ICR to consider both objectives as overall
         "project objectives" because they were part of the same implementation efforts and
         largely complementary. In fact, both objectives were satisfactorily accomplished and
         mutually reinforced. Original objectives, as in the PAD, were introduced in the ICR.

    · The Borrower suggested further emphasizing the project's success in empowering
         communities and strengthening local organizations, including their actual ability to
         manage financial resources. This represents an innovative approach in Colombia. This
         result has been duly included and commented in the ICR (see Sections 8 and 11, and



                                                                                               49

  Annexes 1 and 4).

· The institutional design did not foresee all the roles and administrative arrangements
  needed, particularly with regard to the flow of funds. The ICR report examines how the
  initial institutional arrangements were affected by regulatory, institutional, and
  managerial changes in the administration. (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2).

The World Bank provided copies of all mission Aide-Memoirs, reports produced during
implementation, legal documents, and other internal materials.


The DNP and the Foundation provided a wide array of documentation that was produced
during project implementation or as part of the completion process. This included action plans,
operational manuals and guidelines, internal reports, covenants with collaborative organizations
and communities, contracts, publications, official letters, field reports, maps, PowerPoint
presentations, supervision notes, samples of communication outputs, the Foundation's assembly
reports, and numerous tables compiling information and results. Various reports and publications
of lessons learned were available at the time of the ICR and thus examined with interest. The
Foundation's website is being modernized and updated and contains useful information related to
the project.


The field notes of the ICR's author are compiled in two field books that remain with him, but are

Annex 13. Summary of the mission for the Implementation Completion Report

The World Bank (WB) aimed at an independent ICR, commissioning it to the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) through the WB/FAO Cooperation Programme. The entire ICR
was conducted by Josep A. Garí (staff at FAO's Investment Division), except for the financial
aspects.

The ICR field mission was conducted from September 3 to 19, 2006. From September 4 to 6,
2006, the mission held extensive working meetings in Bogotá with the National Planning
Department, the World Bank staff who oversaw the project, and government officials formerly
involved in it. The mission leader traveled to Santa Marta for about 10 days to hold meetings
with staff of the Foundation, to conduct field visits throughout the Sierra Nevada region, and to
review documentation at the project's office. The mission held also meetings with relevant
project stakeholders such as the Executive Director of the Ecolsierra network and the current
indigenous leader (cabildo) for the Kogui People.

Field visits were conducted in all three major areas of project intervention: La Guajira, the North
and the Northwest (the latter including visits to the subregions of "Estrella Hídrica de San
Lorenzo" and "Ciénaga Grande"). In the La Guajira region, field visits comprised Las Casitas,
Juan y Medio, Tomarrazón and Angostura. In the North, field visits were conducted to project
interventions in Vereda Palma Seca, Mingueo, and throughout the Quebrada Valencia area (the
entire Quebrada Valencia riverbank was visited on foot). In the Northwest, field visits were
conducted to Vereda Central Córdoba (where meetings were held with representatives from five
different project interventions in the San Lorenzo watershed) and Sevillano. Field visits covered
about 30% of project interventions (including 20 of the 65 subprojects executed).
Complementary meetings served to review an additional 10% of project interventions. Several
hundred project beneficiaries were encountered through field visits.

Debriefings were held with the Foundation and the project team in Santa Marta on September 15
and with the government counterpart in Bogotá on September 19. These were useful exercises
that served to clarify certain issues and to engage in a fruitful debate at project completion stage.

The mission leader wishes to acknowledge the support of the Foundation, the Government, and
the World Bank throughout the mission, noting their open, frank, and qualitative contribution to
the process of assessing the project's implementation and achievements. He expresses his
appreciation for the Foundation's collaboration during the ICR mission, particularly in
organizing field visits (including remote areas) and in demonstrating an honest willingness to
assess the project in detail (including problems encountered and failures experienced).
