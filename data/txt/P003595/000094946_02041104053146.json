         satisfactory, sustainability highly likely, and the\n            institutional development impacts substantial. The project\n            successfully demonstrated that a comprehensive development\n            of small watersheds, integrating crop and livestock, as a\n            means to rehabilitate infertile soils, can be widely\n            applied, even further refined if needed, on similar,\n            under-fertilized red soil areas. Lessons of success, namely\n            feature, the development, and application of comprehensive\n            technical standards; adequate training of both project staff\n            and farmers; selection of capable, and motivated\n            beneficiaries; and, a timely availability of counterpart\n            funding. Moreover, production diversification was a\n            contributing factor, particularly in minimizing risks of\n            weather-related crop-damage: diversifying orchard crops with\n            deciduous fruits, i.e., plum, pear, and peach, or citrus\n            varieties, as well as lychee, longan, and loquat, gave\n            positive results, following the careful site selection of\n            frost-susceptible crops. The need for diversification is\n            reinforced by the volatility of agricultural market prices;\n            however, production marketing, particularly of high-value\n            fruit output, requires strengthening of market information\n            systems, and assistance to growers in setting-up marketing\n            groups. While investments in agro-processing enterprises\n            (Government owned/operated) has been generally unsuccessful,\n            by contrast, private participation - as shown by the project\n            - provided the needed influx in management skills, and\n            working capital, which lead to profitable enterprises."}, "docdt": "2002-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
