 3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

 3.1 Original Objective:
 The objectiveof the project is to assist the Borrowerin restoring social and economic infrastructure
 critical to the lives of nomadic herders devastated by an unusually severe snowstorm in hard hit
 areas of Inner Mongolia in the winter of 2000/2001 and in enhancingand strengtheningthe disaster
 response capacity of the local government, and affected herders.
 This objective is in line with Bank policy for emergency recovery assistance, i.e. to restore assets
 andproduction levels in the disrupted economythrough the financingof investment and productive
 activities, rather than relief or consumption, and the focusing on areas of its comparative
 advantage.
 By targeting the project towards a very poor part of the societyin extremelyremote rural areas it is
 contributingto four of the five major themes of the 1997Bank's Country Assistance Strategy CAS
 for China (infrasmcture; human development including poverty alleviation; agriculture and rural
 development; and, environmental protection) and two out of the three major themes of the 2003
 CAS (addressing the needs of the poorer and disadvantaged people in lagging regions; and,
 facilitatingan environmentallysustainabledevelopmentprocess).
Finally, the project was responsive to the Borrower'sneed in a situation of a natural disaster that
 seriously dislocated the local economy and required a quick response. The objective of the project
was clear and realistic given the natural and institutional conditions. In line with best practice for
emergency operations,the project objectivewas ensuredby keeping the complexitylow.

3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectiveof the project remainedunchanged.

3.3 Original Components:
The livelihood of the herder families in the disaster areas of Inner Mongolia is almost always
entirely dependent on their livestock (sheep, goats, cattle, horses, and other livestock). With large
numbers of animals dying in the snow winter of 2000/2001, the livelihood of these families were
severely impacted. The ability to rebuild ths livelihood and protect it more efficiently fiom future
disaster depend largely on rehabilitation of animal housing and feeding. Therefore, the key
emphasis of the project was to assist herders in rebuilding damaged or destroyed sheds and
establishing a winter feed base. Technical specifications and training under the project were
designed to ensure a high standard of the investments and their use. In addition, a substantial
amount of infrastructure for social services such as schools and clinics had been damaged during
the snowstorm and the project was designed to assist in their rehabilitation. Finally, a component
on technical assistanceand project management was designedin order to contribute to an improved
management of the livestock and grasslandresources in the region, and to ensure effective project
management, including evaluation and monitoring. The total estimated project cost were
US $15.57 million, of which US $10.00 million (equivalent to SDR 8.05 million) or about 65
percent was from IDA. These funds were allocated to the followingcomponents:
(1) Restoration and Rehabilitation of Livestock Sheds (US $7.78 million - 49.9 percent of
total). This component was designed to rehabilitate about 4,000 livestock sheds damaged by the
snowstorm and to build more than 1,400 new sheds (of about 136 sqm each) with an improved
"greenhouse" where sheds had been fully destroyed. These investments were designed to respond
to one of the principal reasons for the high ruminant livestock losses during the snow disaster, and
eliminate losses from future snow storms, greatly reduce neonatal mortality, improve lambkid
growth rates, and enhance the fertility of breeding animals. For all beneficiaries investing into the




                                                  2

 reconstruction of sheds, technical training for the herders was made compulsory in order to
 improve the economically and environmentallysustainableuse of these investments.

 (2) Pasture Rehabilitation and Water Supply (US $6.63 million - 42.6 percent of total). The
 plan for this component includes the establishment of about 66,000 mu of rainfed artificial (i.e.
 sown) pasture and about 70,000 mu of irrigated fodder production (caokulun). In addition, the
 design includes the construction of about 1,000 silage pits and procurement of more than 1,000
 units of tractors and fodder processing equipment. Lastly, 91 wells including a pump and simple
 irrigation equipment were planned to ensure irrigation and to provide herder family and their
 livestock sufficient access to drinking water. The aim of this component was to provide herders
 with improved nutritional quality of winter forage, a secured source of good quality feed
 throughoutthe winter season,andto reduce damaging winter grazing.

 (3) Rehabilitation of Schools and Clinics (US$O.76 - 4.9 percent of total). The component
 included the rehabilitation of 42 schools and 29 health clinics, all of which are relatively simple
 constructionsand at the sumu/townshiplevel. The aim was to ensure the continuationof education
 and health services in the disasterarea.

 (4) Technical Assistance and Project Management (US $0.40 - 2.6 percent of total). The plan
 for this component included: (i) a Grassland Management Review technical assistance (TA) to re-
assess the prevailing risk mitigation measures for preventing future losses, and to develop the
framework for a more sustainable grassland management; (ii) a TA activity for Independent
Monitoring and Evaluation of the impact of the project based on four performance indicators
(measuring livestock performance, increased winter forage, beneficiary satisfaction, and
equitability of beneficiary selection); and (iii) Project Management with responsibilities given to
Project Leading Groups (PLGs) and Project Management Offices (PMOS) located in Animal
HusbandryBureaus(AHB).
The componentswere clearly linked to the objectives.Moreover,by targetingthe poorer part of the
affected herder population, the project ensured the objectives were achieved. The individual
components were well designed. One exception was a too high allocation for rainfed artificial
pasture, which did not fully take into account the risks of draughts in Inner Mongolia. However,
due to project implementationflexibility,this did not become a major issue.
The livestock part of the components were complementing each other, and with detailed and
practical standardsand complementarytraining for the efficient and therefore sustainableuse of the
investments. The project took into account lessons learned from previous Bank-financed
emergency recovery projects such as: (i) paying attention to project preparation and simplicity of
design: (ii) flexible procurement methods; (iii) disaster-resilientreconstruction standards: and (iv)
participation by beneficiaries. Lastly, the simple design of the project took into account the
capacity of the implementingagencies, the extremely difficult natural conditions, and the need for
an expedientimplementationrequired for an emergency recovery operation.

3.4 Revised Components:
The design of the project remained unchanged throughout the implementation period. However,
reallocations in the investment amounts of the various components occurred for various reasons.
First, because of strong demand, the animal shed component was increased relatively to the
artificial pasture component. Second, rehabilitation of damaged old sheds proved to be relatively
costly, and herders preferred building new sheds of higher quality to replace the old ones. The
project accommodatedthese demands. Third, artificial pasture proved to be difficult to establish,
especially in the very dry summer of 2001. Therefore, funds planned for artificial pasture were
reallocated to a new component for fenced pasture because of the considerable difficulties of


                                                  3

 establishingalfalfa in the harsh climatic conditions of Inner Mongolia. Fourth, the funds disbursed
 for the cuokulun sub-component were also reduced. Lastly, size of the schools and health clinics
 componentwas reduced substantiallybecause of implementation problems of this component (see
 Section4.2 below).


 Quality at Entry is rated satisfactorybecause the project's: (i) focused objectiveswere in line with
 3.5Quality ut Entry:

 Borrower'spriority, the Bank's CAS for China,and the Bank'spolicies for emergency operations;
 (ii) timely and quite accurate assessment of the disaster and the situation under which the project
 was implemented; (iii) strong emphasis on targeting of assistance to the poorer and most needy;
 (iv) realistic time schedule to meet the project objectives,which also included mitigation measures
 to strengthen the area's resilience to natural hazards; and (v) the project's design adequately
 addressing Bank's safeguard policies, in particular the issues of indigenous people and the
 environment.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcotnehchievement of objective:
The project's objectives and outcomes were substantially achieved. Critical social and economic
infrastructureof more than 8,900herder families (almost45,000 people) has been restored and the
disaster response capacity of the affected herders been improved substantially.Many more benefit
indirectlyfromthe rehabilitationof damaged schools and clinics.
One of the principal reasons for the heavy ruminant livestock losses from the winter 2000/2001
snow disaster was the poor quality and design of livestock sheds,which failed to provide livestock
with adequate shelter during the particularly severe weather conditions. The rehabilitated and
reconstructedsheds greatlyreduce risk of losses from future snow disasters. In addition, shedswith
the improved "greenhouse" design provide a warmer housing environment during the winter
season with advantages such as reduced neonatal mortality, increased lambkid growth rates and
improved fertility. Moreover, shed feeding can be better controlled providing improved nutrition.
Where livestockis housed and fed inside shedsduringthe winter season,winter grazing is reduced,
resulting in less grazing on dormant winter and early spring grasses and improved growth and
recovery of grass cover.
The project also greatly enhanced winter feed security by providing herders with alternative
sources of feed, mainly in the form of sown (artificial) pasture, a small grassland rehabilitation
activity, and the provision of forage handling equipment including small tractors, and forage
storage facilities. These investments provide a secured source of good quality feed throughout the
winter season.
The TA and trainingprovided under the project considerablystrengthenedthe achievementsof the
project outcomes. For many herders the training provided was the first formal technical training
they ever received. The training has contributedconsiderablyto a good quality of constructionand
to economicallyefficient and environmentallysustainableinvestments.The TA provided under the
project provided the opportunity to re-assess the prevailing risk mitigation measures to prevent
future losses, and to develop more sustainable grassland management. A considerable number of
officialsandherdersbenefited directed from the TA activity.
Experiences from Bank supervision missions as well as the household survey data of the
monitoring and evaluation activity indicates that the project largely targeted the poorer part of the
herder population which had suffered substantiallosses from the snow disaster. Beneficiaries were
highly appreciativeof the project. Livestock production and therefore livelihood of the beneficiary



                                                  4

 population was greatly improved through the project investments in terms of higher income level.
 Herders also enjoy greaterresilienceto futuredisasters.

 4.2 Outputs by components:
 (1) Restoration and Rehabilitationof Livestock Sheds (US $9.74 million - 61.6 percent). The
 component is rated satisfactory.A total of 2,600 damaged animal sheds were repaired and 2,651
 sheds with an average size of about 120 sqm. were reconstructed. While the number of sheds
 repaired is only 65 percent of the appraisal estimate, the number of restored (newly constructed)
 sheds is almosttwice the original estimate (185 percent). The quality of most constructionworks is
 overall high. While some unsatisfactoryrepairing of sheds was observed, new sheds often exceed
 the project standards adopted at project appraisal. In most cases the "greenhouse" shed design
 promoted by the project was implemented. One problem of shed reconstruction is that the size of
 the shed was sometimes standardized for all beneficiariesin a certainproject area, which was often
 bigger than the project standard specifications'. In these cases the beneficiary has received an
 investmentthat: (i) could be economicallynon-optimal; and (ii) might tempt the herders to increase
 the livestocknumberbeyond an ecologicallysustainablelevel.

 (2) Pasture Rehabilitation and Water Supply (US$5.41 million - 34.3 percent). The
 componentis rated satisfactory.About 25,500mu of artificialpasture (39 percent of appraisalplan)
 and 58,800 mu of caokulun (84 percent of appraisal plan) have been established. The reduced
 scope of these activities, in particular the rainfed fodder production, is a response to the severe
 weather conditions, especially in the first implementation season (2001). To some extent, this
 proved the relatively high risk of this activity in those parts of Inner Mongolia with frequent
 draughts during summer and strong frosts with low probability of snow coverage in the winter.
 While the management of most artificial pastures established remains a challenge, some plots of
 artificialpastures show good results due to seeds of very high quality, availabilityof water, and the
 technical knowledge of the beneficiaries, which was partly transferred under the project. The
 establishment of irrigated artificial pasture (caokulun) is considerably easier and all agronomic
 aspects (e.g. sowing, irrigating and timely harvest of pasture and forages) have been implemented
well in most cases. Sometimes in parallel with investments into artificial pasture, the project
 supported the building of silagepits for improved fodder storage (960 pits) and the procurementof
tractors and forageprocessing equipment(a total of about 1,950pieces). Theseinvestmentswere of
generally high quality and are well used, with many neighbors often sharing the equipment.
Training was mandatory to each beneficiary household benefiting from one of the activities under
this component (and under the shed reconstruction activity) and proved to be a considerable
success. At the beginning of the project's second construction season a new fencing activity was
added and replaced some of the investments planned for artificial pasture. The training activity
played a particularly crucial role in the activity to effectively use the fence for more sustainable
grassland management.

(3) Rehabilitation of Schools and Clinics (US $0.44 million - 2.8 percent). The schools and
clinics component is rated marginally satisfactory. A total of 23 schools and 19 clinics at
townshiplsumu level have been supported under the project. The local government highly valued
these investments given the status of such infrastructure, the damage done to it by the 2000l01
snowstorm, and their difficult fiscal situation. However, the total number of schools and health
clinics supported by the project, and the total investment value is substantially lower than at


1        The principle of shed size developed for the project was that a newly constructed shed would be
built only up to a size suitable for the livestock number the beneficiary household owned immediately prior
to the snow emergency. An eligible shed size is calculated by using multiplying the number of Livestock
Units (LU) owned by the beneficiary in 2001 by 0.7 m2,the agreed space requirement of a LU.

 appraisal.This failure to fully implement the project has various reasons. Some of them are factors
 external to the PMO and project design For instance, a government restructuringprogram has led
 to the merging of townshipshmus during the project implementationperiod. Another factor is the
 ongoingrelocation of herder familiesout of some sumusin XilinguoleLeague causedby the severe
 damage to their grassland resources. This lead to considerable uncertainties and shifts in priority
 for the rehabilitationof certain sumu-level schoolsand clinics.However, more importantthan these
 factors is the lack of attention given to this component by implementingagencies during the critical
 period and the failure to effectively coordinate within Government agencies responsible for the
 implementation.
 (4) TA and Project Management (US $0.21 million - 1.3 percent). The component is rated
 satisfactory. First, two rounds of quality technical assistance in grassland management were
 successfullyconductedby a team consisting of an international and a national consultant. Second,
 the project supportedan independentmonitoringand evaluation of the project impact. A consultant
 team undertook a field survey from December 2001 to January 2002 and December 2002 to
January 2003. It was based on (beneficiary and some non-beneficiary)household interviews based
on semi-structured questionnaires. The monitoring and evaluation work was of good quality; it
delivered measurement of project impact and usefil lessons learned. However, the methodological
problem of the short observation period needs to be taken into account when interpreting the
measurement of project impact. Finally, the management of the project is satisfactory.Please refer
to the discussionsof the borrower'sperformancein Section 7.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economicrate of return:
Since this was an emergency operation, no calculations of net present value or economic rate of
return was carried out. However, simplifiedcalculationsdemonstratethat the economic benefits for
the herders and the overall economic benefits of the project is highly positive. For example, these
calculations indicate that the internal financial rate of return of new shed construction would be
offset by a 15 percent increase in lambhd survival. Increase in neonatal survival in greenhouse
sheds has been reported to be well beyond this level; farmers report it to be more than 95 percent of
lambs born. In addition,beneficiariesreported other advantagesof the sheds such as the capacityto
feed animals inside on severe winter days and that an estimated 10percent to 30 percent less feed
is required to sustain animals comparedto conventionalsheds. Consequently,animals emerge from
winter in better condition(i.e. fatter) than with conventional sheds.
The establishmentof artificialpasture costing about RMB 200 per mu with flood irrigation would
be justified by only about one cubic meter of incremental dried alfalfa hay per mu and year
(opportunitycosts about RMB 50.). The yield can easily be more than two cubic meters per year.
The economic impact of the project is particularly positive because it supports investmentswithout
which the continued production by the beneficiaries would in many cases be severely reduced and
non-sustainable,if not impossible.
The investments in animal housing and winter fodder security have not only direct economic
benefits, but also indirect ones through the improvement of the environment by potentially
reducing the pressure on grazing lands in autumn thereby increasing carryover residual which in

investmentscontributedto making livestockproduction more sustainable.

The institutional impact of the project is positive. Given the emergency nature of the project, the
main focus was on rehabilitation of social and physical infrastructure rather than institutional
development.Nevertheless,the project had some institutionaldevelopmentimpact in certain areas.
The project substantially increased the capacity of the Government agencies involved in project
preparation and implementation in particular the AHBs at all levels. After overcoming initial
difficulties, the Bureau at all levels successfully adopted the various design aspects and
requirements of the project. Besides becoming familiar with the Bank's financial and procurement
methods, the AHB increased its capacity in a number of areas, including: (i) thorough targeting of
public services,in this caseto the poorer and most needy part of the herderpopulation;(ii) standard
definition, implementation, and efficient supervision of high-quality works and goods dispersed
over a large project area; and (iii) familiarization with computers and other modem office
equipment. The response capacity to any future disaster has been increased through the
implementationof this project.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementationand Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementingagency:
The very dry summer of 2001 -after a number of droughts in previous years -basicallyprevented
an effectiveimplementationof the artificialpasture component in the first implementationseason.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government'spolicies as well as its support to the project had an overall favorable affect on
project implementation and outcome. However, one factor affecting the project negatively was a
shortage in, and substantial delay of counterpart funds, causing greater financial pressure on
beneficiariesand the local economyin general (suppliers/contractors).


The performanceof the implementingagencies was overall satisfactory. The PMO in the AHB had
5.3Factorsgenerally subject to implementingagency control:

no previous experience with World Bank financed projects, but established a strong
implementationcapacity at all government levels. Someweaknesses in project management existed
with respect to the implementation of the schools and clinics component due to lack of effective
coordinationamongrelevant government agencies.

5.4Costsandjhancing:
The latest estimate of project cost is about US $15.8million, about 1.5 percent higher than the cost
estimate at project appraisal. This is due to an additional amount in US dollar terms available for
investmentresulting from an overall appreciationof SDR against the US dollar during the project
implementation period. Annex 2a presents a detailed project cost by component, project activity
and a comparison of actual/latest estimate versus appraisal estimate. (A small amount of SDR
savings(US $0.3 million) is a result of under spendingforrehabilitationof schoolsand clinics.)

Of the total expenditures,about US $10.3 million (SDR 7.8 million equivalent)or about 65 percent
was financed by IDA, about US $4.6million was provided by Governmentas counterpart fund and
about US $0.9 million was contributed by project beneficiaries in the form of labor. Annex 2c
provides a breakdown of project financingby component and source.

 6. Sustainability

 6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
 Project sustainability is highly likely. The project design paid considerable attention to high
 implementation standards, and these standardswere generally met. In the case of animal sheds, the
 construction quality often exceeded the standards. This will ensure the continued use of
 investments for many years to come. Some concerns exist with respect to the establishment of
 some artificialpastures.
 The economic benefits of the investments are estimated to be substantial given that in many cases
the activities implemented under the project are an essential condition for the recovery of
 subsistence and income of the beneficiary household. The training provided beneficiaries with
 substantial knowledge to use and maintain their investments. While the environmental
 sustainability in many of the grasslands areas is fragile, the project investments contribute to an
improvement of this sustainability by reducing the winter and spring grazing pressure on the
grasslands.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The individual household-based sub-projects go into regular operation once they are built. The
individual households own the constructions built and forage equipment purchased under the
project and they have rights over a minimum of 30 years for the use of the land where fodder
production has been established.These households have a strong incentiveto use and maintain the
investments. In addition, the Government will make arrangements to ensure the success of the
project. The completion of a computerized database of all beneficiary households will make their
work more efficient. The PMOShave been reintegrated into the AHBs at the end of the project
implementation and the follow-up work will be carried out by staff of the Financial Bureaus and
AHBs as part of their overall responsibilities.The Financial Bureaus, with the help of the AHBs,
will be responsible for the recovery of the loan proceeds to the beneficiaries. The AHBs intend to
provide additional training to beneficiaries, plans for a follow-up survey of project beneficiary
households (5-10 percent) to measure the impact some time in the future, and will use the project
managementexperiencesgained in futureactivities.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank

7.I Lending:
Bank's performance during project identification, preparation, and appraisal is rated satisfactory.
The Bank's input in terms of staffing, skill-mix and time allocation was adequate given the
structure of the project. The Bank was proactive in identifying the financial resources available
fiom other World Bank financedprojects and the Bank team provided adequate and timely support
to the Borrower. Appraisal was done quickly and thoroughly; adequate attention was paid to the
Bank's fiduciary and safeguard responsibility. The whole process from identification to appraisal
was rapid in accordance with the emergency nature of the project. Project design was in line with
overallBank and CAS objectives.




                                                 8

 7.2Supervision:
The Bank's performance in project supervision is rated satisfactory. Size and frequency of the
supervisionmissions as well as their staff composition were adequate given the size and nature of
the project, and staff continuity was maintained. The task team identified and addressed
implementationissuesin an active and constructivemanner,and follow-up actionwas successfulin
solving problems. Cooperation between Bank and Borrower was close and advice by the Bank
team highly valued by the implementingagencies.

 7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank responded in a timely manner to the
emergency recovery needs of the Borrower. Project design was in line with objectives; borrower
support was strong,and project appraisal and supervisionsound.

Borrower

 7.4 Preparation:
Government performance is rated satisfactory.The Government responded very quickly after the
project identification. In a short period of time, it prepared the project according to the agreed
framework and presented high quality information. The Government also worked with the herders
to start implementingproject activitiesin the first constructionperiod.

7.5 Government implementationperformance:
The Government implementation performance is rated satisfactory. While the availability and
delay of counterpart funds affected the project somewhat negatively, the Government did put in
place a strong project management team and provided this team with strong support for project
implementation.

7.6Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agencies is rated satisfactory. Despite some lack in
experience with internationally financed project, the PMO quickly established strong
implementation capacity. Strong commitment of key staff in the PMOS at all levels and the
training they received contributed to the success that the project was completed with satisfactory
qualityand within the set time-frame.

7.7 OverallBorrower performance:
The overall Borrower Performance is rated satisfactory. The Government and the implementing
agencieshave been committedto the project and were the key to the overall success of the project.

8. Lessons Learned
The project has demonstrated the feasibility and substantial benefits of fast-track Bank-financed
emergency rehabilitation projects even under extreme climatic and geographical conditions. The
project's approach can be utilized for similar emergency for the herder population of remote areas.
Important factorsof project performance were:
       Thorough proiect preparation and simplicity in design. Despite the time pressure during
       project preparation and appraisal, a lot of attention was paid to design details including
       breakdown of costs and procurement down to county level. Even more importantly, the
       scope of the project was well focused, and preparation avoided the inclusion of too many or
       too sophisticated components. The selection of the components centered around the life of
       the herder communities, i.e., the reconstruction of the basic services and support to their
       livelihood. This helped make the project relevant to them and increased their commitment




                                                 9

      and responsiveness. This emphasis on a sufficiently simple design paid off. The project
      objectivesand its originaldesignproved to be realisticand the project was implemented

 0    Quick response and strong management structure. In emergency reconstruction programs,
      early availabilityof funds or authorization,together with competentbusiness proceduresand
      record keeping are essential to address the disaster repairs in a timely manner. Dedicated
      high-level governmentmanagement and close interaction between Provincial,Prefectureand
      County-level management teams is essential to achieve success. However, more effort and
      attention from the regional Finance Bureau to project's timely disbursement would have
      contributedfurtherto project implementation.

 0    Formalizing targeting of beneficiaries. Assisting individual households in their recovery
      from an emergency situation requires considerable attention to a well thought-through
      targeting of the limited resources. First, this requires that the criteria for the selection of
      beneficiaries be measurable and simple enough to be applied given the time-pressure of an
      emergencyproject and limited capacity available. This aspect was achieved by the project.
      Second, it requires a beneficiary selectionprocess that is a priori defined and transparent.A
      clearer design and better institutionalization of such selection process during preparation
      would have avoided some delays and mistakes made duringthe early stagesof the project.
      Well-targeting training of project management and beneficiaries. Due to its emergency
      nature the project focuses on reconstructionof physical and social infrastructure. However,
      a crucial part of the success towards this aim was the training provided under the project.
      First, training of project management staff was essential to build the capacity for project
      implementation and, in hindsight, should have been provided even more intensely at the
      earliest stages of the project. Second,the trainingprovidedto beneficiaryhouseholds,though
      varying in quality, was very satisfactory.For the vast majority of the trainees this was the
      first time that they received technical training. It was well received, contributed to an
      improved construction and sustainability of the investments made, and opened the eyes of
      many herders beyond these investments to more comprehensive aspects of livestock and
      grassland management. The AHB is expected to build on this training, and the credibility
      they gainedthrough it, for transferringknowledge to the herderpopulation.
      Supervision and Monitoring. A strong emphasis on input and output monitoring, reporting,
      and supervision has contributed to a quality implementation of the project. The transfer of
      this management approaches will serve the implementing agencies well in many future
      activities.
      Challenges in worlung across line agencies. The lesson is to be careful in including tasks in
      an emergencyproject that involves continual coordinationbetween line agencies.While the
      other components were under the primary responsibility of the PMO staff located in the
      AHB and the FB, the rehabilitationof schoolsand clinics required stronginvolvementof the
      FB as well as the bureaus for educationandhealth on various levels.

9. Partner Comments

Borrowedimplementing agency:
We fully agree with the contents of the ICR, which have reflected the whole picture of the project.
A more systematic management scheme was developed under the great help from World Bank
Mission, although we had drafted the Project ImplementationPlan and Technical Appendixbefore
the commencement of the project. The successful integrated process of Project management,
procurement and financial aspect ensure the achievement expected during the project appraisal

time, even some of the project result have already exceed the expectation.The project-designated
beneficiaries have already been 8933, which far more than 4890 households during the appraisal
time under the strong support from Bank Mission. All the quantified tasks have been completedin
accordance with the constructionplan of the appraisal time. The great social impact has already
been seen since all the workshops and training conducted by International/LocalConsultant have
been welcomed and appreciatedby the project beneficiaries. All the accept beneficiaries are keen
to acceptingthe technical trainingprovidedunder the project. It has alreadybeen the demonstration
encouragingmore non-beneficiariesto invest into the livestock infrastructure. All the construction
components including sheds reconstructiodrehabilitation, restoration of the grassland, the fodder
security, etc. improved the feeding condition in the winter and spring time and increased the
security of the fodder by upgrading the utilization and efficiency of the forage. The problem of
lack of the water, fodder have almost solved by implementation of the project, which created a
great foundation for the further sustainable development of the livestock in the region. The
improvementof schoolingand sanitationconditionhelp many studentsto go back to the school and
clinical condition in many township clinics have been renovated to accommodate more patients.
General,the objectives of the project have alreadybeen reached.
Some lessons also have been learned during the project implementation: first of all, the
commitment from government was the key factor to contribute the project implementation;
secondly,the harmonization of domestic approval procedure and World Bank procedure need to be
coordinated to improve the efficiency of the management; thirdly, the procurement procedure
shouldbe simplifiedand increasethe flexibilityof approvalas the scatteringof the project sites.
A very good experiencelearned from World Bank management procedure is that all the procedure
has already been formalized and very matured especially strong emphasis of the coordination
between all the linkage of the project management procedure to keep the unity of the project
management system. All the strict procedure from selection of the beneficiaries to reimbursement
procedure establishedby World Bank enable the benefit going to the beneficiaries.

 local counter part fund from Regional level, 1/3 of the local counter counterpart fund from
prefecture level additional 1/3 from BannerKounty level. Part of the local counterpart fund of
Banner/CountyLevel was fromLabor contribution and input in kind. The fourproject components
were invested : (a) Restoration and Rehabilitation of Livestock Sheds; @) Pasture Rehabilitation
and drinking Water Supply;(c) Rehabilitation of Schools and Clinics; (d) TechnicalAssistance and
Project Management.
Project Management. The cooperation and coordination among different departmentshave been
strengthened to improve the project management, the following up monitoring the project
implementation, well-established organization of the Project Management team and start-to-end
reviewing and chechng of the constructionquality guaranteed the successfulimplementationof the
project.    A review to all beneficiaries selection process was conducted in accordance with the
comments from The World Bank Mission by PMOs in each level, the detail survey and interview
to the beneficiaries were done according to the ratio stipulated by the PIP to verify the actual
benefit of the project implementation. The PMOs staff in each level made a great effort to visit
many beneficiaries, especially the herders in very remote and scattered areas to conduct the
checking and acceptance to ensure the quality of the work and that the interest of beneficiarieshad
been realized.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation. Professor Mr. Li QingFeng from Inner Mongolia Agriculture
University was recruited as consultant to conduct the program of project monitoring and
evaluation. The Project Monitoring program focus on the impact assessment of different project
aspects included sheds rehabilitation and new construction,forage security in winter, the efficiency
of the project management and beneficiary selection. 168 project households and 44 non-
beneficiaries in 5 Leagues were selected and monitored by reviewing and chechng at random
during the two rounds of survey in the period from December 2001 to January 2002 and from
Septemberto December2002.
Selection of Benejiciaries. All the beneficiaries selected have been confirmed andjustified base on
the Beneficiary selection criteria set forth of Per Capita below RMB 2,500 per year, severe damage
during the snow disaster. The whole process of beneficiaries selection was open and transparent
after the publication,applicationsubmissionand decision taken by PMO in each level.
Selection of The Project Component. Generally, all the project construction component are
welcomed by the beneficiaries, the construction of sheds, forage production, fencing etc are the
vital infrastructureto the sustainabledevelopmentof livestockdevelopment in the region.
Urgency and Risk of the Project Activiw, The detailed investigation indicates that the forage
security and supply has already been the most urgent problem to be solved, even more severe than


                                                  21

 sheds component particularlyin west part of the project area, however, many beneficiaries gave up
 the componentbecause they thought the forage development has the high risk comparingwith the
 shed component.
 Technical Training. All the project beneficiaries have been trained on the knowledge of livestock
technology and rangeland management, which has played the significant role to the project
 implementation.The experiencegained showsthe PMO should pay more attention to the technical
training, for example,the lack of knowledge of agronomic and agriculturehas the negative impact
to their operation on the artificial pasture performance. We recommend the World Bank should
 strengthen the technical training and extension to the further projects, also the local government
and related department will have to take somemeasure to amend the shortage in this regard.
 Construction Standard of Sheds. The construction quality of rehabilitated sheds in some area was
not satisfied with the standard set forth for lower loan amount allocation and the existing facilities
used to be muddy structure, in this case, there is no way to build a higher standard shed unless the
sheds would be newly constructed,however, the limited amount of the loan was also not enoughto
cover the cost of higher standard sheds. On the other hand, the constructionstandardof some sheds
in other site is much higher than the established standard, which will cause over-heavy burden of
the beneficiaries.
Project Management. The basic computer operation capacity of PMOs staff need to be addressed
for most of the PMO staff not able to use the computer to process the huge data and records (like
use the Microsoft Word and Excel). We recommend that PMOs in each level should organize the
computer training program to build up a better foundation for the future project, meanwhile, not
enough supporting staff in some PMOs caused the delay of the submission of the data, report and
request materials.
Time of Reviewing. It was not fully certain the growing condition of the artificial pasture and
rehabilitated grassland for the reason of late commencement of project implementation and the
characteristic of the plant and forage (for example the artificial pasture and fencing component),
the following supervisionand surveywill be conductedin next growingseason.
Project Achievement and Project Impact Assessment. It was estimated that 4343 beneficiaries
were identified during the project appraisal period, however, the total number of the project
household beneficiariesare 8425 after the selectionprocess accordingto the beneficiaries selection
criteria agreed by The World Bank. More people benefited from the project implementation,
including 5251 household doing shed rehabilitation and reconstruction, 177 household doing
fencing component, 250 households doing artificial pasture, 864 household constructing
Caokulun., 960 household constructing the silo-pit, 638 household procuring the processing
equipment and 285 household drilling well. the component of sheds, rehabilitation of pasture and
fencing, the forage security establishment greatly improve the feeding condition, increase the
availability of the winter forage security and nutrition of the fodder, which could release the heavy
pressure of lack of winter fodderand provide warranty for the livestockdevelopmentin the region.
Rehabilitation of School and Clinics: there have been 23 schools, 19 clinics been rehabilitated
under the emergency program in HuLunBeiEr League, XingAn League and XiLinGuoLe League.
The schooling condition and clinical services have been improved in the project area. No primary
students were dropped out fromthe schoolbefore the disastercausedby the snowstorm.
TechnicaEImpact. The cold and snow day in the project area led lot of livestockdied for the reason
of lack of winter fodder and warm sheds within 90-120 days low temperature, the promotion of
MARRegional Standardof GreenhouseStyleShedConstructionCode(DB5/T5-9l),Construction
Code of Caokulun (DB15IT33-92) and Technical Code of Silage (DB15E534-92) etc. have
significantpositive impactto the livestockpractice in the project area.

 Technique of Greenhouse Shed Feeding: the temperature in the greenhouse shed is much warmer,
which create a better condition for flock growing and breeding. The test proved that the
temperaturein the shed is normally from 5-18OC, it could reduce the lose of fatness 1.5kgper head
of sheet,the lambing survivalrate will be above 90%, the death rate of the lamb can be within 2%,
of course, the ventilation and feeding practice need to be address base on the site finding and
lessons gained.
Fencing and Technique of Caokulun: Implementation of fencing could release the heavy burden to
over-grazedrangeland and provide a time and period for the grassland restoration. It was approve
to be a cheaper and wide-adopted investment in these area. About 30-100% of the hay production
are expected, which could be stored as fodder security in the winter time. The fencing component
are welcomed and appreciated by the herders in HuLunBeiEr League and XiLinGuoLe League.
The caokulun combining five sub-component of water irrigation, hay or forage, forest belt for
protection, motor pump, feed will increase the production of the fodder 5-10 times. However, the
effect of the caokulun was discounted for some lower standardmaterial used by somebeneficiaries
during the project implementation.
Silage: the silage not only provides a effective sources of forage, but improve the nutrition and
utilizationrate.
Environmental Impact Assessment. The project focuson the four constructioncomponent of shed,
artificial pasture, caokulun, and Silage, which will dramatically have positive impact to
environment. The shed provide a better condition for flock shed feeding and growing even under
the severe situationof wind, Snow and lower temperature;the artificial pasture, fencing, caokulun
will increase the storage and security of the hay and forage to reduce the density of the winter
nature grazing. It not only improves the income of the herder's household, but also creates the
room and space for the grasslandrestoration.
Social Impact Assessment. The project was welcomed by all the herders and a great positive
impact has been seen and more and more herders were eager to join to the implementation of the
project. The following social impact were summarizedbase on the survey and investigationin the
field. (1) the implementation of the project relieved the over-heavy pressure to the poor herders
livelihood and help them to restore even improve their livestockproduction, (2) the implementation
improved the capacity of the herders to resist any further disaster which has been one of the main
objective of the project, (3) the project stimulated herders' motivation to transformtheir traditional
livestock practice to modem and constructive operation, for instance many non-beneficiarieshave
already begun to implementation their infrastructure to improve the efficiency of the livestock
business demonstrated by the project result, some of them have already been completed and put
into operation; a lot of new sheds, fencing and silage-pit etc. have been built up in the project
scattering area; (4) the training program under the project was especially appreciated by all the
beneficiaries, as all the project beneficiaries identified have to participate the training before any
physical work implemented, even they are loohng forward to learning more knowledge out of the
project scope; (5) the project acceleratedthe speed of transformingthe traditional livestock, which
heavy rely on the nature grassland to the high-efficient, sustainable livestock development. The
well-established fodder security system will build up the solid foundation for the sound livestock
development.
Experience and Lesson Gained. Providing Good Experience to Borrow for the Future Similar
Program. The World Bank enforce the strict and well-organized procedure in the project
management, the broad coordination and cooperation form a framework to ensure the unity of the
project management,which ensured the whole process nm smoothly from beneficiaries selectionto
Disbursementprocess, the interest of the beneficiarieshave been guaranteed.




                                                  23

 Lesson Gained from The Project. (1) the government should provide their commitment at early

 of the domestic approval procedure and World Bank regulation will improve the work efficiency;
 stage of the project, which is the key factor of the successful implementation; (2)the combination
 (3) it is necessary to simplify the procurement procedure according actual condition of scattered
 location and constructionsite.
 ThePerformance Assessment
 WorldBank Performance. A more sound management optionwas provide and updated under great
help from The World Bank although the preliminary scheme was developed by IMARPMO, the
three division of project management, Procurement and disbursement have been fully cooperated
and linked under The bank's help. The World Bank's instruction transverse instructions
consistentlyguide the project implementationprocessbefore-and-after, the Aide-memoir agreedby
two parties have been developed after every site visit and review mission. The financial help
encouraged the more input of fund from local side and labor contribution. The loan amount not
only provided the fund for the livestock infrastructure construction, but trained lot of Project
Management Staff, established the mechanism of livestock operation, improved the working
efficiencyof local team, all these afford made a great contributionto the successfulimplementation
of the project. The World Bank strong support any reallocation of the project component and
project fund, which has been proved to be in high risk or unreasonable, for example, the cutting
down the component of artificial pasture and reallocate the fund to fencing. The in-time
reallocation guaranteed the successful of the project implementation and utilization of the project
fund.
Performance of Borrower: It was a worthwhile trying to introduce the World Bank Loan to
conduct the disasterrecovery program and the project brought great social-economicbenefits to the
region. It should be more importantthat IMAR has learned advancedmanagementexperiencefrom
the project,trained a lot of high-quality managementstaff in PMOs of each level. The more we did,
the better performance we had, which also was accepted by the World Bank Mission. The early
mobilization of the project management staff and establishment of the PMOs before the formal
agreement signed, successful training program under help from the World Bank built a solid
foundation for the successful performance during the project implementation; The site-by-site
review and supervision conducted by PMOs in each level according to the requirement of the
World Bank to gain the first-hand information of project progress, PMOs made a great afford to
amend any errors or discovered shortage of the works; MAR provided enough local counter part
fund for the project, any data collection of monitoring, procurement documentation and quarterly
report were provided to the World Bank in time.
Any problematic issues discovered during the reviewing have been explained and clarified, the
necessary steps have been taken to amend any questionablematter and conductedthe followingup
survey and monitoring.
