project\n            are to help increase production of goods and services that\n            generate foreign exchange revenues and enhance the\n            efficiency of the productive and financial sectors.\n            Increased production and allocative efficiency would be\n            achieved by timely provision of term financing to enable the\n            private sector to take advantage of the liberalized trade\n            regime. Increased efficiency of the financial sector would\n            be achieved through the development by the Central Bank of\n            Uruguay of norms to regulate and supervise medium and\n            long-term credit operations and through the project's\n            technical assistance that would address some of the\n            regulatory constraints to credit access in Uruguay. The\n            operation has two components: (a) a line of credit to\n            finance private investment, associated permanent working\n            capital and leasing operations -- excluding purchase of land\n            and housing -- of viable enterprises that have revenues\n            predominantly in US dollars; and (b) a technical assistance\n            component to finance studies aimed at improving regulations\n            on the use of movable assets as collateral, computerization\n            of the cattle registry; and the securitization of mortgage loans."}, "docdt": "1993-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
