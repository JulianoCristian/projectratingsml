Thus, the\n            Evaluation Summary rating of satisfactory for outcome of\n            both projects is confirmed, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and the Borrower is rated satisfactory rather than\n            highly satisfactory. The rating of sustainability as likely\n            for both projects is also confirmed, and that for\n            institutional development impact is raised from substantial\n            to high. The experience of coal sector restructuring in\n            Russia points to a few important lessons of general\n            applicability in the case of complex and politically\n            contentious reform programs with a high social impact:\n            government commitment and political will are indispensable.\n            External financing in support of coal restructuring in\n            Russia provided a powerful incentive to stay the course, but\n            the decisive factor in securing success was the fundamental\n            commitment of the Government. Effective stakeholder\n            participation can greatly enhance robustness of the\n            achievements and lessen the implementation and information\n            burdens of the Government and the Bank. A strengthened\n            safety net helps greatly in gaining acceptance of enterprise\n            closures among workers and their communities, even in\n            difficult and polarized situations. Adequate attention and\n            funding should be devoted up front to the environmental\n            aspects of enterprise closures (especially in the case of\n            mines) to minimize the problem of large residual liabilities\n            that may hold up the liquidation of enterprises that have\n            already ceased operations. Finally, implementation schedules\n            should be realistic and flexible, while disbursements should\n            be tailored to concrete progress in agreed reforms. The Coal\n            SECAL II was under implementation for four years instead of\n            the originally planned two years, with most of the progress\n            recorded in the last two years. Moreover, the 1999\n            restructuring of the loan's original floating tranches\n            into smaller, more manageable tranches was instrumental in\n            facilitating implementation of the agreed restructuring actions."}, "docdt": "2003-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
