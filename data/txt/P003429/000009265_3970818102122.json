It is aimed at improving production technologies\n            for foodcrops, cash crops, livestock and fisheries;\n            strengthening resource management capabilities in\n            agriculture and related fields; and developing a model\n            county extension station to be replicated nationwide.\n            Principal features of the project will be construction and\n            renovation of laboratories, offices, farm buildings and\n            staff housing; scientific and farm equipment needed for\n            research and experimentation; library equipment, books and\n            materials.  The project will also include local and overseas\n            training in the agricultural sciences and library science;\n            and technical assistance (about 96 man months) applied to\n            review of center research programs, program formulation for\n            extension stations, and future project preparation."}, "docdt": "1984-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
