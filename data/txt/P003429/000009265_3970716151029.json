The project will also include local and overseas\n            training in the agricultural sciences and library science;\n            and technical assistance (about 96 man months) applied to\n            review of center research programs, program formulation for\n            extension stations, and future project preparation."}, "docdt": "1984-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
