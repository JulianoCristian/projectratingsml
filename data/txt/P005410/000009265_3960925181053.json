The main\n            objectives projects in Morocco were to improve agricultural\n            production by financing on-farm investments of small and\n            medium fames, improving access of small farmers to\n            agricultural production and strengthening the status of\n            Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) as a financial\n            and developmental institution. This was to be done by: (i)\n            emphasizing institutional credit penetration in rural,\n            particularly rain fed, are; (ii) introducing a new system of\n            appraisal of credit needs; and (iii) emphasizing the role of\n            CNCA as an institution which would accommodate expanding\n            demand for credit. The two projects both have had a positive\n            impact on CNCA's operations and have helped to\n            strengthen the institution. At the same time, two lessons\n            from these projects, which are perhaps self-evident, but\n            which the Bank tends to lose sight of at appraisal time,\n            are: a) the long-term nature of institution building and the\n            need to have specific, realistic goals and detailed,\n            realistic action plans for accomplishing these goals; and b)\n            the use of covenants to ensure specific financial ratios\n            should be based on sound accounting practices: in more\n            general terms, the use of covenants on financial ratios\n            cannot substitute for ensuring that an institution is\n            financially self-sufficient."}, "docdt": "1992-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
