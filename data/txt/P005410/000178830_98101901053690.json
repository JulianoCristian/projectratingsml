"The Fifth Agricultural Credit Project\n            aims to: (i) contribute to growth of agricultural\n            production; (ii) improve the standard of living of about\n            580,000 farm families; and (iii) create about 78,600\n            man-years of rural employment. The project will support the\n            achievement of these objectives through: (a) increasing\n            private investments in agriculture; (b) improving access by\n            small farmers to institutional credit; (c) promoting\n            mobilization of domestic savings; and (d) strengthening\n            CNCA's management efficiency and financial situation.\n            The project will finance farm investments through CNCA\n            during the period September 1983 to August 1986, including:\n            (a) investments by small farmers; (b) investments by\n            Agrarian Reform Cooperatives; (c) investments by medium and\n            large farmers; and (d) agro-industry investments. The\n            project will also include improvement of CNCA's\n            physical infrastructure, management information systems and\n            loan monitoring and evaluation, and define a banking\n            strategy and a staff training program."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
