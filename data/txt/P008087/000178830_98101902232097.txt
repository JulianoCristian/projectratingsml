INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
SECOND LOAN TO THE TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO DEVELOPMENT
FINANCE COMPANY LIMITED WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Trinidad and Tobago Development Finance Company Limited (TTDFC),
with the guarantee of Trinidad and Tobago, for the equivalent of $5.0 million
to finance the foreign exchange cost of TTMFC's operations over a period of about
two years. Amortization would conform substantially to the aggregate of
the amortization schedules applicable to the subloans and investments
financed by the proposed loan. The interest rate on the proposed loan would
be 8% per annum.
PART I. THE ECONCMY
Introduction
2.        The Bank's latest economic report entitled "Economic Position
and Prospects of Trinidad and Tobago" (435a-TR), based on the findings
of an economic mission which visited the country in October/November
1973, was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 8, 1974.
A Country Data summary is attached as Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
3.        Petroleum production and refining play  a dominant role in the
econorror of Trinidad and Tobago. In 1972, these activities accounted for
about one-fifth of GNP, two-thirds of merchandise exports, and close to
one-fourth of the central government's revenues. As a result of recent
favorable developments in the petroleum sector, the country's economic
prospects have changed dramatically. An important new oilfield off the
east coast came into production at the beginning of 1972, and the output
of domestic crude oil from all sources is now projected to reach 80 million
barrels a year in 1976, as against 47 million barrels in 1971.  In addition,
substantial natural gas resources have been found in the same general
area, and some production has already started. These developments have
coincided with a fourfold increase in world petroleuma prices since early 1973.
4.        This turn of events must be viewed, however, within the context of
other economic developments during the la te sixties and early seventies in
Trinidad and Tobago. Petroleum production declined from 65 million barrels
in 1967 to 47 million in 1971 because of the depletion of reserves from
traditicnal producing areas. This decline coincided with weaknesses in
agriculture and tourism, and was only partially offset by the continuing
growth of manufacturing industry which was stimulated by the establishment of
the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) in 1968. During the decade
of the 1960s, Trinidad and Tobago's CG)P rose at an annual average rate of 4%,



- 2 -
or about 2% per capita, but real GDP growth amounted to only 2.5% in 1972
and may have been negative in 1973. The balance of payments deteriorated
sharply during 1972 and 1973. Prior to 1972, a widening deficit on the
trade account had been compensated by increasing direct private investment,
and the reserve position had remained sound. With the completion of a
number of major projects in the petroleum sector, however, direct private
investment declined in 1973. There was also evidence of a short-term capital
flight prompted by fears of devaluation. As a result, the reserves of the
banking system fell from $41 million in November 1972 to $27 mnillion in
Nove-nber 1973, equivalent to only two weeks' imports. This development was
even more serious when placed in the context of substantial government borrowing
on the Eurodollar market.
5.        In the face of sluggish economic growth, inflationary pressures have built
up since 1972 -- a development which should be viewed against the background
of stable prices which Triznidad and Tobago has traditionally enjoyed.  In
1972, retail prices rose by 9.3% and in 1973 by a further 15%. Three factors
can be identified as the principal cause of this unprecedented rise in
prices: first, the effects of accelerating world inflation were particularly
acute in the case of Trinidad and Tobago where merchandise imports amount to
almost 40% of GDP; second, agricultural production was hit by a severe drought,
and the supply of local foodstuffs was much less than normal; third, mounting
fiscal deficits caused the government to increase its borrowing from the
banking system, particularly from the Central Bark.
6.        The slow growth in output, the shortcomings of the educational
system, and a steady emigration of skilled personnel have combined to create
a problem of persistent unemployment. Despite the low growth rate of the
labor force, the economy has failed to generate sufficient new employment
opportunities, as the increase in employment between 1965 and 1971 was only
1 .2% per annum. Unemploymernt now stands at 14% of the labor force, and the
link between poverty and unemployment gives rise to social tensions.
Continuing umemployment is all the more striking in a country with such a relatively
high per capita GNP as Trinidad and Tobago ($1009 in 1972), and a resolution
of this problem must rank as one of the most pressing current issues.
7.        The public sector in Trinidad and Tobago expanded considerably during
the 1960s, and overall public expenditures increased from 21% of GDP to 28%
over the period 1960-71 . The disturbances of 1970 increased the government's
concern for the unemployment problem, and both investment and current expendi-
tures were stepped up, with narticular emphasis on social services. The twin
pressures of declining oil production (resulting in low government oil revenues)
and increasing public expenditures caused the fiscal situation to deteriorate
in 1970. Except for the introduction of an unemployment levy, no important
new revenue measures have been introduced in recent years. There have been
mounting fiscal deficits since 1970, resulting in heavy external and domestic
borrowing by the public sector.



- 3 -
8.        This year, faced with thie precipitous rise in petroleum prices,
the government introduced radical changes in petroleum taxation in its
budget. As a result, the government exDects that current revenues will
rise to about TT$900 million -- nearly double the level of 1973. It envisages
an overall surplus on both current and capital accounts of TT$210 million
in 1974 after meeting all amortization obligations due on the public debt.
The government's projections may prove conservative, however, and current
receipts might rise to as much as TT$1.1 billion in 197T and to TT$2.2 billion
in 1978.
9.        Despite the higher revenues from petroleum, the 1974 budget expendi-
tures have been expanded only modestly, in keeping with the government's view
that high oil prices are only a temporary phenomenon. At this stage at least,
the government has avoided establishlng high levels of expenditure wlich
could not be sustained in subsequent years should oil prices decline. Instead,
the full amount of the 1974 surplus has been credited to a number of
"Special Funds" to finance future investments which the government considers
basic to the strategy of its forthcoming Fourth Five-Year Development Plan
(1974-78). The plan is likely to emphasize the use of local
petroleum and gas resources for the country's industrial development. Plans
have been announced to establish an aluminum smelter complex, a second ammonia
plant and a second cement plant. Discussions are also underway regarding
the feasibility of an iron pelletizing plant, a third major refinery,
and facilities to liquify natural gas for export to the US market. The
moderate increase in 1974 in current expenditures is being directed towards
assisting the lower income groups by improving social benefits. Efforts are
being   made to control inflation by using subsidies to underpin the prices
of basic iterm of consumption, such as rice, wheat, and gasoline.
10.       Price subsidies should assist in bringing the rate of inflation
down. The tradition of price stability is deeply ingrained, and neither
the business community nor savers and consumers show signs of an "inflationary
psychology." There are good prospects that agriculture will recover from
the drought of 1973 and that the supply of both locally produced and imported
foodstuffs will increase sufficiently to ease the pressure on prices. The
improved foreign exchange situation will enable the government to institute
a liberal import policy and thereby ease the aggregate supply. Finally,
because of the strengthened fiscal situation, the government will not need
to continue inflationary borrowing. The resolution of the government to fight
inflation, backed by ample financial resources, gives reason to assume that,
after 1974, inflation may be reduced to no more than the general world level.
11.       The precise impact of the increased petroleum revenues on Trinidad
and Tobago's employment situation is more difficult to predict, especially
since the Fourth Development Plan is not yet finalized. In general, the
increased revenues should present to the government an excellent opportunity
to tackle this and a number of other basic economic and social problems which
have become acute in the recent past. Only a comprehensive strategy can over-
come such problems as faltering economic growth and high unemployment, and



- 4 -
foreign exchange requirements should no longer be a constraint. However,
to implement a comprehens-ve development scheme, the absorptive capacity
of the administration will be a limiting factor, and serious lack of
experienced manpower is likely to continue particularly at the middle levels.
Thus, efforts to improve administrative capabilities, particularly in the
areas of project planning and administration, will have a great bearing on
the rate of economic growth and social progress. Wth the aid of high
petroleum revenues, GNP should be capable of increasing at an
annual rate of 8% in real terms over the period of the Fourth Development
Plan.
External Assistance and Creditworthiness
12.       Due to sluggish public sector investment during most of the 1960s,
the flow of external capital to Trinidad and Tobago's public sector
has been relatively modest, amounting to $110 million in 1965-72.
As against this, the inflow of net private investment capital in the
same period totaled $420 million, most of it in 1970-72 when new petroleum
production facilities were established. Official loan commitments were
accelerated over the period 1967-73; a summary of these commitments is
given below (in millions of US$):

13.        Trinidad and Tobago's public investment requirements in the
medium term are expected to be substantial considering the need for
economic diversification. There are good prospects that these requirements
will be met largely from domestic resources as long as petroleum prices
remain high. In addition, the government should also be able, during the
coming two or three years, to build up its reserve position from the low
1973 levels, to liquidate its short-term debts including sums borrowed
on the Eurodollar market at high rates of interest, and to respond favorably
to requests for assistance from its CARICOM 1/ partners which are facing
serious difficulty in coping with high import bills. Finally, the
government has undertaken to lend funds to the IDB and the Bank in an
effort to contribute to the lending resources of both institutions.
The specific arrangements agreed between the Bank and the Trinidad and
Tobago government are set out in paragraph 17.
14.        Trinidad and Tobago has ample creditworthiness for borrowing
on conventional terms. The external public debt of the country is very low
by international standards; at the end of 1972, it equaled 11% of GDP with
a debt service ratio of 3%, and this is expected to fall to 9% and 2.4%,
respectively, by 1979. The Bank's present share in the total amount
outstanding and disbursed is 24%, while its share in the debt service is
28%. These shares may increase somewhat in the next few years as Trinidad
and Tobago repays many medium and short term debt obligations which have
been contracted at high interest rates. At the same time, the country
should begin to receive interest and principal repayments on the loans
and investments it now intends to make with a portion of its petroleum
revenues.
15.        Trinidad and Tobago is now at a critical period in its development.
During this transition period, external aid agencies may be particularly
helpful in assisting the government, specifically in the fields of policy
planning and institutional improvement. This will require new relationships
to be worked out between Trinidad and Tobago and present and potential aid
agencies, including the Bank Group.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
16.        The Bank made its first loan to Trinidad and Tobago in FY1962,
a loan of $21.4. million, guaranteed by the United Kingdom, for electric power.
Since then, Bank lending has totaled $69.3 million for nine projects,
including a recent telecommunications project for which an $18 million loan
was signed on June 2h, 1974. Other projects supported by Bank loans include
two in agriculture, two in education, and one each in highways, power,
and family planning and a development finance company operation. A summary
statement of Bank loans to Trinidad and Tobago and notes regarding the progress
of projects in execution as St August 31, 197h are attached as Annex II.
1/ CARICOO (Caribbean Community including the Common Market) was formed in
1973 by Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago over and
above the CARIFTA organizatian; as of July 26, 197L, the other
CARIFTA partners had joined CARICOM.



- 6 -
17.        uJntil the recent change in the petroleum situation, Bank lending
in Trinidad and Tobago was designed to contribute to the transfer of external
resources, to improve the country's infrastructure, to increase its output
and employment, and to contribute to institutional development. Assuming that
oil prices will not drop significantly from present levels and that the volume
of Trinidad and Tobago's oil exports will rise as now expected, Trinidad and
Tobago will have considerable resources at its disposal to finance development
and it will also have increasing access to international capital markets.
In these circumstances, a shift of emphasis in the Bank's operations in Triridad
and Tobago is needed. Discussions between the Bank and the government have
led to an understanding that, for the next several years, Trinidad and Tobago
will continue to borrow relatively modest amounts from the Bank and will
offset these new loans by lending corresponding amounts to the Bank. The
Bank loans will assist in implementing carefully selected projects, mainly
to improve the country's institutions, so as to remove the technical,
managerial, and administrative bottlenecks which from now on will be the major
constraint on economic growth. I am planning to circulate to the Executive
Directors shortly the papers relating to a first offset transaction, whereby
the government will lend to the Bank $15 million, an amount equal to the expected
total of the loans (including the loan now before you) which we plan to make
in Trinidad and Tobago by December 31, 1975. The loan from the government will
be at an interest rate of 8% and will have a term of 15 years, subject to a
prepayment provision in the event that the country's external assets fall
below the equivalent of 4 months' imports. To the extent that the lending
planned for Trinidad and Tobago does not materialize, the proposed borrowing
by the Bank will be repaid.
t8.        Within this framework, the Bank expects to lend to Trinidad and
Tobago for rural development, education, family planning, development finance,
and transportation. In the agricultural sector, the Bank in April 1973 made
a loan for rehabilitating Trinidad and Tobago's sugar industry (Ln. 888-TR).
We now expect to encourage development of the small-holder sector through
two loans for rural development/land settlement projects designed to continue
the program initiated under the Crown Lands project (Ln. h86-TR). Both
projects would promote agricultural diversification and improve production of
livestock and crops, together with social services. The first such project,
to be located in Tobago and the northeastern and southwestern parts of
Trinidad, has been appraised recently.   It would help revitalize the tradi-
tional tree crop subsector which has considerable unutilized physical and
economic potential. The Bank loan would support the government's efforts
to strengthen the institutions servicing agriculture, particularly their
credit and extension facilities.
19.        In order to diversify its eccnomic base, Trinidad is promoting
industrial production for increased domestic consumption and exports. The
government is encouraging the development of manufacturing industries
through various incentives, and financing is being provided by the Industrial
Development Corporation (IDC) and the Trinidad and Tobago Development Finance
Company (TTDFC). The first Bank loan to assist industrial diversificatici-i
was made to TTDFC in 1972 and, in addition to the loan before you, we envisage
a further project within two or three years' time.



- 7 -
20.        In the social sector, a third education project would continue
to assist the government in implementing its "Plan for Educational Development
(1968-83)" to improve the educational system's relevance and efficiency.
The Bank loan would assist the government in its efforts to improve its
planning and project execution capacity in the sector. Similarly, a second
population project would continue the Bank's support of the government's
population planning efforts and provide a new impetus for them.
21.       In infrastructure, the country's transportation system has not kept
pace with the requirements of a growing economy; as a reLult, production
and distribution costs are higher than they need to be. With regard to
highways, there is need for technical assistance to help in developing the
local contracting industry, in improving the operations of the Highway
Department of the Ministry of Works, and in strengthening highway maintenance
in the country. These requirements would be met in a secomd highway
project. A project for improvement of Port-of-Spain's port was first
appraised by the Bank in 1965; until recently, however, there had been no
agreement between the government and the Bank on the scope and financial
plan of it. A revised project, providing for berths, quays, sheds, and
equipment, has now been presented by the government to the Bank for considera-
tie. The project would also aim at substantiall,y improving the technical and
finaacial management of the port operations.
22.       The implementation of the projects listed above would be an integral
part of the government's overall development efforts, as set out in the draft
Fourth Development Plan (1974-78). It would also be in close harmony with
IDB's and CMDA's program of activities in Trinidad and Tobago. IDB is
cooperating closely with the Bank especially in connection with its agricultural
development projects. CIDA is financing, or will finance, various studies
which may serve as the basis for Bank projects. In addition, CIDA and the United
Kingdom government (CDN) are providing experts and fellowships needed in
conjunction with the Bank's second education project (Ln. 862-TR).
23.       So far there have been no operations of the International Finance
Corporation in Trinidad and Tobago,which became a member of IFC in 1971.
However, IFC is now considering a possible investment in a plant to manufacture
furfural and acetic acid
PART III. TTDFC AND THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
24.       Manufacturing industry (excluding petroleum and sugar-related
activities), which accounts for about one-eighth of GDP, has been one of
the leading growth sectors in Trinidad and Tobago; it grew at 8% a year
in real terms in the 1960s. Trinidad and Tobago has developed a broad
array of manufacturing activities, largely based on import substitution
of consumer goods. However, there has been no discernible reduction in
the import dependence of many industries, and the manufacture of components
and intermediate products for industry has not been a source of growth.
Exports of manufactured goods, although growing rapidly in the 1960s -- parti-
cularly to CARIFTA member countries as a result of trade liberalization --
still represent a fairly modest proportion of both manufactured output and total
exports (10% for both). On the other hand, the industrial sector has played
an important role in generating employment. Manufacturing employment grew
faster than total employment, increasing its share from 16% to 18% in the
second half of the 1960s.



-8-
25.        Incentives, in the form of quantitative restrictions on imports,
import concessions on capital goods and raw materials, and tax holidays, have
provided the major impetus for the growth of industry in Trinidad and Tobago.
However, this system and the limited size of the domestic market have created
in many cases high-cost industries composed of firms of less than optimal
aise, importing unprotected inputs and receiving quota protection on their
output. Trinidad and Tobago's induwtrial promotion policy is, to a large
extent, determined by its membership in CARICOM. Both CARIPTA and CARIOOM
have provided the basis for intra-regional trade, but there is still little
effective provision for coordinatimn of industrial policies and planning of
new investment on a regional level. Within the context of its economic study
of the Caribbean area, the Bank is examining CARIOOM industrial promotion
policies and will discuss its findings with the individual governments
concerned.
26.       The prospects for further growth in manufacturing in Trinidad and
Tobago are mixed. Exports of manufactured goods may not grow as rapidly
as in the past, since industrial production of similar goods will be developed
in other CARICOM-member countries, and higher wage increases in Trinidad
and Tobago may adversely affect the country's international competitive
position. On the other hand, as far as the domestic market is concerned,
the large increase in incomes resulting from the increase in the country's
oil revenues will enable the expansion of output for domestic consumption, and
the increased volume may allow increases in efficiency of products already being
produced. Nevertheless, because of the limitations of import substitution even on a
regional basis, the promotion of exports outside the region will require
increasing attention.
27.       Eight commercial banks, operating a network of 85 branches, are
the major source of external finance for the manufacturing sector. In
mid-1973, about one-fifth of these bankst portfolio, or TT$100 million,
was lent to industry. Commercial bank lending, now at rates varying
between 9.5%, the prime rate, and 13% per annum, usually takes the form
of overdraft lines, the bulk of which are used to finance seasonal working
capital. However, an estimated fifth of the credit to industry is in term
loans, with an average life of three years. An additional estimated fifth
is in overdrafts permanently outstanding and is apparently used to finance
the borrowers' needs for term loans. All in all, the banking system does
not provide an adequate source of medium and long term loans for industry, and
companies rely excessively on the roll-over of short-term loans to finance their
fixed asset requirements. The securities market is still insignificant in
industrial financing. Development of the market requires comprehensive
action, now being studied by the government, which would include measures
(such as disclosure requirements and broker operations) designed to develop
public confidence and incentives to increase the availability of securities
offered for sale.



-9-
28.        To dovelop the industrial sector, the government in 1958 established
the Tndustrial Development Corporation (IDC) and in 1970 assisted in estab-
lishing TTDFC. IDC is responsible for the promotim of new industrial projects,
the administratica of fiscal azd other incentives to eligLble industries, and
the provision of financial and technical assistance to mell busineso enter-
prises (loam below TT$50,0o0). Frau the inception of its S.all Business
Division in Kay 1970 through Octobor 1973, IDC authorised 3147 small bttiness
loan  totaling aboutT$3.l1million at subsidised interest rates ranging frm
6 to 8% per annum and with maturities from 14 to 8 years and grace periods of
up to five years.  An to its wider feuctions of industrial promotion and
administratimn of fiscal incentives, IDC haB not made sufficient progress in
sasuring the ecmosic efficiney of projects; thia is an area in which TTDFC
can also make a ontribution (paragraph 34). TTDFC, established in 1970 as
a limited company under the Coapanios' Act, is the only institution in Trinidad
and Tobago *hich offers long-term industrial finance through loans above
TT$5O,00O. It is also the only lending institution which invests its funds
on the basis of thorough project appraisal rather than solely on the basis
of an entrepreneur's reputation and collateral security. TTDFC could also
play a role in the development of the securities market (paragraph 27) by
selling securities out of its own portfolio. It would, however, still be a
few years before TTDFC's equity portfolio had sufficiently seasoned to allow
public sales.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Second Development Finance Company
Project, Trinidad and Tobago" (No. 372a-TR, dated August 19, 1974) is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the
loan and of the project are summarized in Annex III.   The project was
appraised in November 1973. Negotiations for the proposed loan took place
in I*shington during the week of July 29, 1974.   The Trinidad and Tobago delegation
consisted of representatives of the government and TTIFC, led by Messrs.
V. Dean-Maharaj, Controller of the Ministry of Finance, and M. de Souza,
Chairman of TTDFPC.
30.       Background (TTDFU) - The Bank played an active role in TTDFC?s
formation.   TMFC's "Statement on Investment and Operational Policies"
and "Statement of Loan Policy" are similar to the policy statements of
other development finance companies associated with the Bank. TTDFC has
as its objectives to assist in establishing and expanding productive
enterprises through financing and technical assistance, to develop the capital
market and to enhance ownership and control of enterprises by Trinidad and
Tbbago nationals. It is authorized to lend to a wide range of businesses,
but is concentrating on the financing of medium size industrial, tourism,
and agricultural enterprises. In May 1972, the Bank made a loan of USS2.0
million to TIDFC (Ln. No. 819-TR) to assist it in establishing itself as an
effective, long term finance institution with the ability to appraise projects
and to extend technical assistance to its clients; this objective has now

31.             is Caatal Structure and Financing Operations - 7TDFC g
subscribed share capital, about TT$1.2 million in total, is held largely by
the government (94%), with 14 private shareholders (banks, insurance, petroleum,
manuacturing, and construction firms) holding the remainder. The small parti-
cipation by the private sector reflects its unfamiliarity with TTDFC and also
TTDFC's low profitability. About half of the subecribed capital remains uncalled
and TTDFC expects to call it later in 1974. In addition to its share capital,
TTDFC has obtained between 1970 and 1973 TT$5 million in subordinated loans from
the government with a 40-year term, including 10 years of grace, and 4% annual
interest payable starting the sixth year. The Bank loan of US$2 million in
1972 provided the necessary foreign exchange in support of TTDFC's lending
operations.
32.       Originally, TTDFC had difficulty in finding borrowers due to uncer-
tainty in the private sector and competition from cmmercial banks. However,
starting in late 1972 lending grew rapidly, and the projections made during the
appraisal of the first loan have been exceeded. Only TT$1.6 million in domestic
currency resources were available for commitment by March 1974. Despite its
short history, TTDFC has already become an important source of toru funds for
industry. Its portfolio of TT*7 million in tern loans by the and of 1973 was
equivalent to one-fourth of all commercial banks' tern loans outstanding to
industry. Furthemore, over half of TTDFC's loan commitments were to new and
usophisticated entreprenuars who would have had difficulty in raiaing financing
from other sources and who particularly benefitted from TTDFC's technical
assistance. The average size of TTDFC loans was TT$226,O00 and 75% of TTDPC
loans were made to companies with assets below TT$1 million; as much as 60%
of the amount lent by TTDFC was to help finance new ventures. TTDFC's borrowers
benefitted from loan terms designed to match their cash generation; in contrast
to the conmmrcial banks' usual three-year terms, the bulk of TTDFC'a loan con-
aitaents have boon for 8-10-year torms. With the expected increase in
Trinidad and Tobago's oil revenues, TMDFC can play an increasingly
important role as a source of term finance.
33.       TTDFC. 'aManagement and OPeratinx Procedures - TTDFC's Board is com-
posed of eight directors, seven of whom, including four representatives of the
private sector, are appointed by the government and one by the Central Bank.
The Board is ohairedby a widely respected and experienced businessman. In
addition to the General Manager, TTDFC has five staff members who are being
helped with appraisal work by an expatriate adviser.
34.       The quality of TTDFC's appraisal work is generally good.  The economic
aspect of TTDFC's appraisal, however, needs to be strengthened. TTDFC has now
agreed to calculate the econmic rate of return on its projects. Such data will
enable the company to (a) ensure that its lending is limited to economically
justifiable projects, (b) determine the best avenues for future TTDFC project
identification and promotion, and (c) build up valuable expertise in the economics
of particular sectors which would put it in a position to contribute to the govern-
ment's industrial promotion policy. In view of the country's serious unemployment
problem, TTDFC intends to use consultants to identify whether there are technology
choices in its projects and, if practicable, to influence sponsors to choose more
labor-intensive processes.



- 11 -
35.         Although TlDFC's follow up of problem borrowers has been intensive,
its supervision of borrowers without serious problems needs strengthening;
to this end, TTDFC is introducing a more effective follow-up system.
TTDFC's procurement and disbursement procedures are satisfactory.
36.         Quality of ITDFC's Portfolio and its Financial Performance - As a
whole, TTDFC has invested in a sound loan and equity portfolio. Although three-
fourths of TTDFC's loan portfolio, amounting to TT$6.6 million by the end of
1973, was stil in the grace period, its evaluation by the Bank staff was
possible because almost all of the projects involved had operated sufficiently
long to permit a judgment of their prospects. The review showed that all
but four of the 26 loanB had good prospects of repayment; since TTDFC's security
on the remaining four loans was good, no loss is expected on account of them.
Of the eight equity investments in its portfolio, amounting to TT$1 .0 million
by the end of 1973, TTDFC in 1973 wrote off TT$35,000 on one investment.
In 1972, TTDFC made two short-term export credits of TT$O.6 million in total;
TTDFC may become more active in the field of export financing if the government's
plans for an export credit insurance scheme materialize.
37.         In April 1972, TTDFC reduced its lending rate from 9.5% to 8.5% to
enable it to compete with commercial banks which were then enjoying a period of
exceptionally high liquidity and were actively searching for lending opportu-
nities. By November 1973, TTDFC reinstated its 9.5% minimum lending rate
because of a liquidity squeeze and a resultant rise in commercial banks' rates.
TTDFC has now agreed to a 10% minimum relending rate for the proposed Bank loan
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 2.08 (c))1/. Taking into account the average
costs of funds to TTDFC, the 2% spread on the Bank loan would be adequate
to allow TTMFC to improve its profitability which would, however, remain modest.
Although inflation is now running higher than the 1973 rate of 15%, Trinidad
and Tobago is expected to reduce the rate during 1975-79 to 8% per annum. If
this estimate materializes, a 10% relending rate would be appropriate for
TMDFC in that it would result in a positive interest cost to the final borrower
and would be in line with the cost of alternative credit in Trinidad and Tobago.
The lending rate would be reviewed by TTDFC, the government, and the Bank
in the light of inflationary trends and the interest rate level in Trinidad
and Tobago one year after signing of the loan, or when 50% of the loan amount
has been committed, whichever is earlier. If at that time agreement could not
be reached on the interest rate to be applied to the uncommitted balance of
the loan, no further withdrawals could be made of that balance.
38.         Despite the fact that TTDPC had only minimal financial expenses
through 1973, its return on equity has been very low, about 2-3% in 1972 and
1973 (profits of TT$60,000 after provision for losses of TT$77,000). This
reflects the company's low level of operations, resulting in administrative
costs equivalent to 6% of average total assets in 1972 and 4% in 1973.
39.         Projected TMFC Operations and Resources Required -  Over the
period 1974-78, TTDFC's annual loan commitments are expected to grow at about
14% annually to reach TT$7.8 million in 1978, and its equity investments at about
15% annually to reach TT$1 .1 million in 1978. This would result in a more than
tripling of TTDFC's assets; however, although administrative expenses as a
1/ TMDFC intends to charge the same interest rate on its other loans as it does
on Bank-finaced subloans.



- 12 -
percentage of average total assets would decline from 4% in 1973 to 2% in 1978,
the latter figure is still somewhat high, reflecting the small size of TTDFC's
operations and the extent of its technical assistance to unsophisticated borrowers.
TTDWFC's profits in 1978 would still be low, representing a 4% return on
equity. TTDFC does not expect to declare any dividends through 1978 and its
reserves and provisions may increase from 3% by the end of 1973 to 7%
by the end of 1978. The debt service coverage, with profits and loan
collections covering the debt service payments by a minimum of 1.5 times
during the period, would be adequate. The debt/equity (and quasi equity)
ratio would rise from 0.9 in 1974 to 2.2 in 1978, remaining within the 3:1
agreed limit.
40.       Based on its projected level of loan and equity commitments through
mid-1976, TTDFC would have a resource need of TT$17.8 million of which
TT$1 0.0 million would be for foreign exchange and the remaining TT$7.8 million
for domestic currency. The latter would be obtained from (a) internal
cash generation including loan collections (Tr$2.3 million), (b) calling the
remainder of the subscribed capital (TT$2.1 million), (c) use of uncommitted
local currency funds (TT$1 .6 million), and (d) raising additional local
resources (TT$1 .8 million). TTDFC and the government have requested a Bank loan
to provide the TT$10.0 million in foreign exchange (US$5.0 million).
41.       Terms of the Proposed Bank Loan -   The proposed Bank loan of
$5 million would be on terms and conditions usual for Bank loans to development
finance companies, including the standard commitment charge. It would help
finance TTDFC's lending to productive enterprises covering (a) CIF cost of
imported goods purchased "off-the-shelf" from domestic distributors, and
(b) 35% of the cost of civil works (equivalent to the estimated foreign
exchange component). The terminal date for submission of subprojects under
the loan would be June 30, 1976. As under the first Bank loan, the government
would assume the foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan, the proceeds of
which would be relent by TMDFt. In view of the improvement in TDFT1's appraisal
process, the free limit would be increased from $100,000, as agreed under the
first Bank loan, to $150,000, subject to an aggregate amount of $1.75 million;
about two-thirds of the loan amount would thus require prior approval by the
Bank. Since the first Bank loan was committed earlier than expected, TTDFC
requires foreign exchange before the proposed loan could be signed. I, therefore,
recommend that the Bank reimburse out of the proposed loan disbursements
up to US$800,000 equivalent for 13 sub-projects in the period starting
March 31, 1974 through the signing date (draft Loan Agreement, Section 2.02 (d)).
To encourage the build-up of an equity base for increased leverage in future
years, the debt/equity ratio limit would remain at 3:f, the same as under
the first Bank loan.
42.       Justification for Bank Loan - At the present stage of Trinidad and
Tobago's development, the additional petroleum revenues will allow an attack
to be launched on the country's recent twin problems of stagnating economic
growth and continuing high unemployment. The incremental petroleum revenues
should be used to diversify Trinidad's economic base.   The government, jointly with



- 13 -
expatriate firms, is already planning to establish oil and gas processing
industries.  These industries, however, will be capital intensive, with
relatively limited employment prospects. In contrast, the prospective
operations of TTDF will largely develop manufacturing industries using
generally more labor intensive production methods. Continuing Bank assistance
to TTDFC would thus be directed simultaneously to both the diversification
and employment objectives. The Bank would assist the company in improving
its project appraisal procedures in order to strengthen TTDFC as an
independent investment institution. TTDFC is likely to play an increasingly
iiportant role in advising the government on its policies to promote
industrial development. In this context, continued Bank participation in
building up TTDFC appears most beneficial to Trinidad and Tobago.
PART V. LEG3AL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Trinidad and
Tobago Development Finance Company Limited, the draft Guarantee Agreement
between Trinidad and Tobago and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI. RECOMMENDATION
45.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION:
Loan 497-TR - Highways; US$8.6 million Loan of June 12, 1967; Closing Date:
September 30, 1975
The first construction stage of the four-lane expressway-comprising
all earthworks and structures but paving only of the northbound lanes - was
completed in 1972, and the northbound lanes opened to traffic. However,
there has been some slight deterioration of the asphaltic wearing course and it
may be required to apply a sealcoat as protection against further deterior-
ation. A contract for the second construction stage - paving of the south-
bound lanes - was awarded in September 1973, and completion is scheduled for
early 1975. Total project costs are now estimated at about $21 million,
representing a cost overrun of about $4 million compared to the appraisal
estimates (to a significant extent a reflection of price escalation due to
delayed construction). However, benefits deriving from the project have
also increased considerably (due to higher traffic than projected and the
effect bf price inflation of the benefits), and the economic return on the
expressway construction has not decreased in relation to the appraisal
estimate (11% on vehicle operating costs savings, 13.5% if time savings are
included and 15% if time savings and accident reduction savings are
included5,
Loan 564-TR - Education; US$9.4 million Loan of October 16, 1968; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975
There was an initial delay of about seven months due to difficulties
in the selection of architectural consultants, and further delays in construction
resulting from labor and site problems and adverse weather conditions. Project
implementation is 18 months behind schedule, but now progressing satisfactorily
and, with the possible exception of a school in Tobago, completion is expected
by early 1975. Twenty-one project schools had been completed and occupied at the
beginning of school year 1974-75; educational objectives are being fulfilled.
Project cost overruns are estimated at about 10% of the total (mainly due to
increasing construction costs); these cost overruns will be met by the government.
Loan 862-TR - Second Education; US$9.3 million Loan of October 25, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The Loan Agreement became effective on February 15, 1973, and project
implementation is, except for initial delays in the technical assistance
component, progressing satisfactorily. Consultant architects have been
engaged, design studies are being carried out, and sites are being acquired.
Cbnstruction will start by December 1 974. Some of the technical assistance

experts provided by CIDA and ODM for the San Fernando Technical Institute
and the National Training Board have assumed their duties.
Loan 743-TR - Population; US$3.0 million Loan of May 28, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
On both the construction and the technical assistance side, the
project is now progressing adequately. However, because of the initial
delays, the project is far behind schedule. One of the main reasons for
the delay has been the difficulty in obtaining suitable sites. The
construction of the health center at Toco has now been completed. Contracts
for four other health units have been awarded and work on all units is
scheduled to be completed during the first half of 1975. The Nurses Training
School, Maternity Hospital, and Family Planning Institute are scheduled for
completion by mid 1977. On the technical assistance side, the evaluation
advisor, who arrived towards the end of 1972, has completed his assignment.
A local counterpart has been trained and has taken over the evaluation work.
The management firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. was contracted by the
government in November 1973 to carry out the management and manpower utilization
studies. The fact-finding, analysis, and presentation of broad recommendations
arising from these studies was substantially completed by March 1974 and the
preparation of the final recommendations and the implementation program by
April. Advisors for family life education and nursing are now expected to
start work shortly. Mainly as a result of delays, construction costs have
risen rapidly (35% in 1973 alone), and total costs of the project, originally
estimated at $4.5 million, are now projected at $8 million. On the positive
side, the number of new acceptors under the family planning program has
increased substantially from 1972 to 1973.
Loan 819-TR - Development Finance Company; US$2.0 million Loan of May 15, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31. 1975
Information on this loan is given in the main text of this report.
Loan 888-TR - Caroni SuRar; US$12.0 million Loan of April 18, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
Progress on the mechanization of the company's field operations
and rehabilitation of the company's plant is proceeding as envisaged, but
delays were initially experienced in contracting the consultants required
to carry out: (a) a hydrological/irrigation survey of North Caroni, (b) a
study of all aspects of Caroni operations, including field and factory
operations, cost control and management procedures, and (c) a study of the
possibilities and implications of subdividing the hilly company-owned lands
in the South for occupation by small-scale cane farmers. The company has
suffered badly from a series of mishaps, including exceptionally heavy rains
in 1972, the worst drought in 50 years in 1973, and acute labor troubles
in 1974. Whereas normal production is around 200,000 tons of sugar a year,
the 1973 crop was only 170,000 tons and the 1974 crop in the order of
165,000 tons. The financial impact, however, has been completely offset
by the much higher sugar prices.
Loan 1015-TR - Telecommunications; US$18.0 million Loan of June 24, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This loan became effective on August 22, 1974.
