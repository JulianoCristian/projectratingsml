The more traditional activities of\n            an export credit agency such as guarantees without finance\n            and credit insurance were not addressed because at the time\n            of appraisal they were not requested by the banking or\n            exporting community. As activity increased at the Investment\n            Guarantee Agency (IGA), it was realized that the more\n            traditional activities of an export credit agency needed to\n            be included in order to provide a comprehensive service to\n            the exporting and banking community. The project was\n            restructured to provide IGA with the authority to use World\n            Bank funds under the project to support these additional\n            facilities. At the same time, it was realized that if IGA\n            was to be effective as an export credit agency, have\n            permanent status, and have the same impact on exports as its\n            counterparts in nearby countries such as the Czech Republic,\n            Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia it would need to have\n            equity capital that was adequate in accordance with accepted\n            prudential standards within the industry. Accordingly, the\n            initiative was commenced by IGA and the government to create\n            new law for IGA by government legislation and to transfer\n            the donor and project funds under the Emergency Industrial\n            Restart Project and this project, onto the balance sheet of\n            IGA. The impact of the project during the implementation\n            period would have been greater had IGA been authorized to\n            use World Bank funds to support these traditional facilities\n            from the time of effectiveness, and project funds had been\n            transferred to IGA as equity progressively as funds were\n            drawn down from the Bank."}, "docdt": "2005-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
