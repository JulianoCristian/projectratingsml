Its sustainability is\n            likely, and the institutional development impact is\n            substantial. Lessons drawn from the project indicate that,\n            in light of the time involved for a concessioning process to\n            be completed, restructuring railways - without long-term\n            investments - can still produce considerable interim,\n            economic benefits, as shown by the successful results of the\n            Malawi Railways, namely, reductions in operating costs,\n            easing the government's financial support, with\n            improved accountability by the newly incorporated railways,\n            and lake service companies. Despite these benefits,\n            improvements in the operational performance were slow, and\n            the targeted international traffic did not materialize,\n            apparently due to the parastatal framework which hinders\n            staff motivation, and commitment. Privatization thus,\n            appears essential to operate financial, self-sustaining\n            entities, but the need for surplus staff to retire/retrench,\n            regardless of its high political, and social cost, remain\n            paramount. The concessioning experience elsewhere, suggests\n            that investments by parastatals, are rarely valued by\n            potential bidders, thus investments should be technically,\n            and financially evaluated, and if possible, prior to\n            concessioning, long-lived investments be avoided."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
