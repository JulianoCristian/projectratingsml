is to contribute to\n            Malawi's economic growth through: revitalizing the much\n            shorter, less expensive, but poorly-operated Nacala rail\n            route and increasing its share of Malawi's overseas\n            traffic, thus, reducing the landed cost of exports/imports\n            and enhancing Malawi's competitive advantage; and\n            restructuring, commercialization and eventual privatization\n            of Railways and Lake Services, enabling them to operate more\n            efficiently and without depending on government subsidies,\n            thus, reducing the drain on the national economy. The\n            project comprises four components: 1) a restructuring\n            component to be implemented by Malawi Railways (MR) includes\n            the setting up of new railway and lake services companies to\n            be called the Malawi Railways (1994) Limited (MR(M)) and the\n            Malawi Lake Services Limited (MLS) respectively,\n            transferring of assets and staff to the new companies, and\n            gradual downsizing and final closure of the existing MR; 2)\n            revitalization component, to be implemented by MR (M),\n            includes commercialization of rail operations, eventual\n            privatization of MR (M), extension of the services of the\n            marketing and transit facilitation experts to Caminhos de\n            Ferro de Mocambique (North) (CFM(N)) (N) to improve\n            performance of the whole Nacala rail route, and setting up\n            of institutional mechanisms for effective coordination with\n            CFM (N); 3) Lake Services component to be implemented by MLS\n            includes commercialization of its operations and eventual\n            privatization of MLS's core activities; and 4)\n            Transport Policy component includes developing a transport\n            policy that would provide a framework for efficient\n            operations with particular emphasis on restructuring and\n            privatization of transport parastatals, and enhancing\n            institutional capacity for analyzing the performance of the\n            transport sector and providing adequate response."}, "docdt": "1995-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
