The environmental assessment (EA)\n            evaluated impacts as follows : air emissions and noise\n            pollution; forest degradation; loss of aquatic species; loss\n            of biodiversity; community disruption; water pollution and\n            soil erosion; salinization, water logging and\n            desertification; house renting and services for enterprises;\n            use of fertilizers and pesticides; use of hormones and\n            chemicals in meat and animal products.
