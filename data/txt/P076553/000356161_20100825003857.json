risk to development outcome was high,\n            the Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: preparing a project with\n            simple and non-complex design to suit the absorptive\n            capacity of the borrower and implementing and beneficiary\n            agencies in critical. In particular, in politically complex\n            environments such as Ukraine, apparent synergies across\n            sectors and agencies may well convert into significant\n            implementation problems. Choosing carefully the key agency\n            for project implementation and learning from lessons of\n            experience is important. Apex structures for credit lines\n            where decision-taking is slow due to over-formalized\n            processes are not appropriate. Ukraine's learning\n            experience with Bank projects is gradual and enough time\n            needs to be built into any project. Bank team's\n            persistent efforts may simply be overwhelmed by country\n            circumstances, in which case the way out of a difficult\n            situation usually requires offering an alternative which is\n            acceptable to the country authorities and helps resolve the\n            problem efficiently. Reprogramming a cancelled loan amount\n            to a related similar project is one such alternative which\n            can be practical in agreeing with a potentially reluctant\n            borrower on eventual closure of problem projects."}, "docdt": "2010-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
