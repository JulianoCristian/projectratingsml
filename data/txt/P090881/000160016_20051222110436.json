Building on\n            four preceding PRSCs, PRSC5 is the first to support\n            Uganda's third Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP)\n            approved by Cabinet in November 2004. The PRSC supported\n            program continues to be at the center o f the Bank's\n            support for Uganda as spelled out in the new Uganda Joint\n            Assistance Strategy (UJAS) developed jointly with partners.\n            The PRSCs support four o f the five pillars o f the Poverty\n            Eradication Action Plan: Economic Management; Enhance\n            Production, Competitiveness and Incomes; good governance;\n            and human development.  PRSCS supports the economic and\n            institutional environment for the sustained implementation\n            of PEAP reforms so as to reach the poverty reduction, human\n            development, and growth targets laid out in that strategy.\n            It underpins the Government's objectives by providing\n            external resources necessary for the execution of the\n            Government budget, and by providing knowledge and technical\n            advice on the implementation of Uganda's poverty\n            reduction reforms."}, "docdt": "2005-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
