limited achievement of\n            the project's main objectives. These lessons can be\n            drawn: The project design should be adhered to to avoid the\n            confusion that arises when project and non-project\n            activities are planned and implemented differently.\n            Technically unprepared components will lead to\n            implementation difficulties, cost overruns, and delays. For\n            components dependent upon the local communities for\n            operations and maintenance, implementing agencies and the\n            World Bank must ensure that decisions are discussed with and\n            agreed upon by local stakeholders. Conditions set for\n            project effectiveness should be indispensable to the\n            project's implementation so as not to waste time. A\n            review of expected cash flows of would-be veterinarian\n            borrowers and of potential lending by commercial banks would\n            have revealed up front that there was no basis for a credit\n            component catering to private veterinarians. The frequency\n            and skills mix of supervision missions should match project\n            complexity. Quality supervision with components requiring\n            specialized technical skills can only be assured through a\n            team effort, and depends largely upon the task\n            manager's experience. Recurrent expenditures need to be\n            closely monitored. Using activities adopted by farmers as\n            part of their normal practice helps sustain project components."}, "docdt": "1999-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
