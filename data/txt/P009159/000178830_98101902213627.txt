INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
INDUSTRIJA MASINA I TRAKTORA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed loan
to Industrija Masina i Traktora (IMT), with the guarantee of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for the equivalent of US$18.5 million to help
finance a project for the expansion of a tractor and farm implement factory.
The loan would have a term of 14 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at 7-1/4% per annum. The Government of the Socialist Republic of
Serbia, which would provide a prior guarantee required under Yugoslav law,
would receive a guarantee fee of 1-3/4% per annum on the outstanding amount of
the Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to the borrower to 9% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Yugoslavia in October/November
1972, and its report entitled "The Economic Development of Yugoslavia" dated
November 26, 1973, (R74-1) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
January 2, 1974. An updating mission visited Yugoslavia in October 1973.
Its report is under preparation. Basic data on the economy of Yugoslavia
are given in Annex I.
3.        Yugoslavia has experienced rapid economic growth and rising living
standards during the last decade, with total GDP at constant prices having in-
creased at about 5-1/2 percent per year and per capita GDP at over 4-1/2
percent a year. Economic growth has proceeded in an environment of major
institutional and organizational changes, characterized by the decentraliza-
tion of economic management, the creation of a market economy and the opening
up of the economy to international trade, with the objective of increasing
economic efficiency and improving the allocation of resources.
4.        The population growth rate averaged 1.0 percent per year during the
last decade; the rate in the less-developed Republics was 1.6 percent compared
to 0.7 percent in the developed Republics. There is little open unemployment.
There is, however, some evidence of growing regional and occupational imbal-
ance in labor demand and supply. This results from the low mobility between
labor surplus less-developed regions and labor-scarce developed regions, and
a discrepancy between the skills needed in a fast-changing economy and those
supplied by the present education system.



-2-
5.        Economic growth in the less-developed regions has been as rapid as
that of the more developed, but the per capita income in the former regions
has increased more slowly because of faster population growth. Consequently,
regional inequalities have widened. Yugoslavia has had an active regional
development policy for more than two decades. The policy aims at reducing
regional inequality by achieving a growth rate above the national average in
the less-developed regions, financed by a transfer of resources mainly through
the Fund for the Accelerated Development of Underdeveloped Regions. In ad-
dition, Federal budgetary grants are provided to the less-developed regions
for current expenditure for social purposes such as health and education.
Recent Developments
6.        Economic development during 1968-1971 was characterized by a rela-
tively rapid increase in exports and production (averaging 12 and 7 percent
per year in real terms, respectively), the emergence of serious inflationary
pressures and substantial balance of payments deficits (averaging $220 million).
In 1970 the Government adopted measures to counter the rising inflationary
pressures and improve the external payments position. These measures aimed
at restricting monetary expansion, limiting public expenditures, strengthening
price controls, imposing financial discipline on enterprises and developing an
incomes policy. In addition, it adopted a policy of frequent exchange rate ad-
justments in order to neutralize the effect of inflationary pressures on the
balance of payments. After a period of unchanged rates, following a major
devaluation in 1965, the dinar was devalued by 16.6 percent in January 1971.
In the course of the international currency realignment in December 19713
Yugoslavia devalued again by 18.8 percent against gold and by 11.8 percent
against the dollar.   Following the more recent devaluation of the dollar,
Yugoslavia adjusted the gold parity of the dinar to maintain its parity with
the dollar until mid-July 1973. Since then the dinar has been floating vis-
a-vis the US dollar along with other European currencies.
7.        Largely as a result of the policy measures undertaken since 1970,
export growth picked up, import growth declined, and the investment boom
slowed down. In 1972 and 1973, exports of goods and services increased by an
average of 24 percent while imports grew only at an average rate of about 15
percent. Workers' remittances increased by 36 percent per year to $890 mil-
lion in 1972 and an estimated $1.2 billion in 1973. Consequently, the current
account showed a surplus of about $420 million in 1972 compared to a deficit
of about $320 million in 1971. In 1973, a current account surplus is again
anticipated, although not as large as in 1972. Foreign exchange reserves,
which were equivalent to about one month's imports in 1970 and 1971, have
increased to the equivalent of nearly six months' merchandise imports at
present.
8.        While the restrictive measures, which have now been rescinded or
relaxed, were successful in improving the external payments position and the
financial situation of enterprises, there has been no slowdown in the rate of
inflation. Prices continue to rise at 15-20 percent a year. The 1970 policy
measures have also reduced economic growth. Real GDP increased by 4.4 percent
in 1972 and an estimated 6 percent in 1973 as against 8.8 percent in 1971.



-3-
Prospects
9.        With the relaxation of the restrictive measures, real GDP is expec-
ted to grow at about 6 percent in 1974 and, barring unfavorable external de-
velopments, further satisfactory growth may be expected beyond 1974. However,
a favorable balance of payments situation is not assured. For 1974 a current
account surplus is not envisaged; export and import growth may be expected to
return to pre-1972 levels. The growth of workers' remittances can no longer
be counted on as a major additional revenue source, because the Government has
instituted a policy to stop the growth of the external labor force.
10.       The direct impact of the oil price situation on the Yugoslav economy
is likely to be limited. The government encourages the use of domestic energy
sources and 77 percent (in caloric terms) of Yugoslavia's energy needs are met
therefrom. Domestically-mined coal is the main fuel. Most thermal electricity
plants are coal fired. Hydro-generation provides more than half of the coun-
try's electricity; only one-third of hydro-generation potential has been de-
veloped. Oil is used mostly to produce gasoline and diesel fuel. Yugoslavia
imports about 40 percent of its crude oil consumption from the USSR and the
remainder from Middle Eastern countries. It maintains friendly relations with
nearby oil producers and its import supplies are not expected to be endangered.
However, the price increases are expected to raise the country's import bill
by about S320 million or about 6 percent of 1974 imports. Emerging shortages
of electricity are due more to delays in plant construction and a recent drought
(reducing hydro-power output) than to fuel shortages. The indirect consequences
of the energy crisis are far from clear. Since most factories and thermal power
plants are fueled by coal and the price of coal can be influenced by the govern-
ment, the country's international competitive position should improve. On the
other hand, exports and opportunities for Yugoslavs to find employment abroad
may diminish if economic activity in Western Europe slows down.
11.       The 1971-1975 Social Development Plan, adopted in June 1972, aims
at an overall growth rate of 7.5 percent per year with agricultural production
growing at an average rate of 3.2 percent and industrial production at an aver-
age rate of 8 percent per year. Exports are projected to grow at about 11-13
percent per year and imports at about 9-11 percent annually. The Plan stresses
the importance of achieving domestic stabilization, improving resource allocation
and increasing productive efficiency to attain these targets. Domestic savings
rates are expected to be maintained at the present level of around 23 percent
of GDP, and would finance about 80 percent of gross investment. The bulk of
the projected external resource gap would be covered largely from workers'
remittances from abroad. Present indications are that the Plan targets of a
GDP growth rate of 7.5 percent and an inflation rate of 6.5 percent per annum
are unlikely to be achieved. With both exports and imports running at higher
than Plan projected rates and the current account in surplus in 1973, the
balance of payments targets appear feasible.
12.       The prospects for continued economic growth in the medium-term are
good. The endowment of natural and human resources, together with the prag-
matic and dynamic approach to the solution of economic problems, the readi-
ness to consider and undertake necessary institutional changes, and the



-4-
strong commitment to an open, market-oriented economy, give grounds for a
favorable assessment of future prospects.
External Assistance
13.       Gross capital inflows have more than tripled during the last five
years, reaching US$1,250 million in 1973. Most of these funds are medium-term
commercial credits, reflecting the limited assistance from governments, and
the liberalization of foreign trade and borrowing regulations following the
1965 Economic Reform. The inflow of bilateral and commercial credits has
been largely from the United States, Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland,
Italy and the United Kingdom. IBRD loans have been the main source of long-
term capital since 1968. Yugoslavia has, so far, not been able to place pub-
lic bond issues on the world capital markets. However, three private place-
ments (medium-term) totalling US$115 million were made in 1972 in the U.S.,
and other possibilities for raising long-term funds are being explored.
14.       The dependence of Yugoslav industrial production on imported equip-
ment and raw materials continues to create a strong link between the growth
rate of GDP and import demand. With a foreign exchange earnings growth rate
of about 11 percent a year, the 1974-79 growth rate of GDP, compatible with a
manageable current account deficit, would be about 7.5 percent. This forecast
is based on the latest information on the possible impact of the fuel price
increases on the Yugoslav economy. It implies an import elasticity between
1974 and 1979 of 1.5 (compared to 1.9 during the 1966-69 period and results
in an average net foreign exchange financing requirement of around $370 mil-
lion a year between 1974 and 1979, mainly in convertible currencies. Allow-
ing for further borrowings on present average terms (7 years, 6 percent in-
terest), this needed net inflow implies a much higher level for the gross
inflow, rising to $2.6 billion in 1979 from its 1972 level of about $1.1
billion.
15.       Already agreed bilateral loans in convertible currencies (mostly
from the United States, Italy, France, Federal Republic of Germany and Japan)
should result in a gross inflow of about $180 million per annum in the medium-
term. The Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to provide in addition de-
velopment credits equal to $260 million on concessionary terms. The gross
inflow from multilateral sources, mostly the World Bank, should increase from
a level of about $49 million in 1973 to about $155 million in 1979. Official
sc,!rces of convertible currencies would then provide around 22 percent of the
gross inflow. In late 1972 Yugoslavia negotiated a long-term credit of $540
million equivalent with the Soviet Union for financing imports of investment
goods during 1973-75. The agreement foresees a continuation of financing in-
vestment goods imports of $450 million after 1975. These credits are expected
to be used mainly to finance projects in the coal, oil, electric power, ferrous
and non-ferrous metal industries. The debt service burden of these credits
will be fairly low due to the soft terms they carry. There have been diffi-
culties in utilizing the credit because of the lack of suitable technology and
design of Soviet manufactured products.



-5-
16.       The Government has tried to encourage private foreign investment
through special legislation enacted in 1967, and by November 1973, 80 joint
venture agreements had been signed between local and foreign enterprises,
involving a total investment of about US$120 million. The conditions for
foreign partners in joint ventures with Yugoslav enterprises have recently
been further improved in an effort to encourage a more rapid flow of foreign
investment.
17.       Private credits needed to fill the gap will have to increase from
the 1973 level of about $900 million to approximately $2.2 billion in 1979.
So far little difficulty has been experienced in obtaining the amounts of
financial and suppliers' credits needed, but the terms have become harder.
External Debt Management
18.       The pattern of capital inflow since the mid-1960's has led to a
deterioration in the maturity structure of external debt. The Government,
aware of the dangers of unregulated growth of external debt, has embarked
on an active debt management policy. Since mid-1971, all foreign credits
have to be registered with the National Bank to ensure that contracted
credits remain within the ceilings determined by the Federal Government and
the National Bank, and that the terms of borrowing are appropriate to the
transaction and to the general economic situation. In April 1972, a new
system for regulating external borrowing was adopted. It operates by in-
fluencing the cost of external borrowing through varying dinar deposit re-
quirements according to the terms and purpose of the credit. Moreover, the
National Bank has been given authority to veto any credit arrangement. The
Government has also embarked on a stabilization program that includes re-
scheduling or refinancing existing debts and obtaining longer term credits.
The United States agreed to reschedule US$58.5 million of debt payments
falling due in 1971 and 1972, and Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany,
France, Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed to extend financial cred-
its to relieve the debt burden (see para. 15).
19.       Total external public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding as
of December 31, 1972 was US$1,730 million. In addition, there was US$1,820
million non-guaranteed external debt outstanding on that date. Total debt
service payments in 1973 are estimated to amount to about US$1,270 million,
mostly in convertible currencies. This represented 19 percent of the country's
foreign exchange earnings. The percentage increases to 25 percent if the debts
and earnings in non-convertible currencies are excluded. The debt service
ratio is expected to remain at about the 1973 level during the next five years.
Taking into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and the new measures
for improved external debt management, the prospective growth of production
and exports and the expected foreign exchange earnings from tourism and
workers' remittances, Yugoslavia is creditworthy for substantial Bank lending.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
20.       The Bank has made 24 loans to Yugoslavia totalling about US$765
million equivalent.   The proposed loan would be the third of three direct
loans for industry in Yugoslavia (the recently approved loan for the Kikinda
Iron Foundry Project being the first and the proposed loan for FOB, being pre-
sented to the Executive Directors at the same time as this loan, the second).
Of the previous loans for industry (four loans totalling US$46.9 million)
three were channelled through the Yugoslav Investment Bank and one through
the Yugoslav Government. In general, Bank lending has been concentrated in
infrastructure projects such as transportation (five highway loans totalling
US$150 million, three railway loans totalling US$155 million, and one gas pipe-
line loan of $59.4 million), power (three loans totalling US$135 million),
telecommunications (US$40 million) and three multipurpose projects (totalling
Us$103 million). Loans have also been made for tourism (two loans totalling
US$30 million) and for an agricultural industries project (US$31 million).
IFC has made seven investments totalling about US$70 million in Yugoslavia.
Its most recent operation, a loan (with some equity conversion rights) of
US$10 million to the Zelezarna Jesenice/ARMCO joint venture for manufacturing
special steel, was approved by the Executive Directors on January 29, 1974.
21.       There have been delays in the execution of several projects, partic-
ularly the Railway Modernization Program of FY 65 (Loan 395-YU), the Belgrade-
Bar Railway Project of FY 68 (Loan 531-YU) and the Babin Kuk Tourism Project
of FY 71 (Loan 782-YU). The main reason for the delays lies in the decentral-
ization of political and economic management in Yugoslavia. The problems have
been exacerbated by financial and technical difficulties, cost overruns and the
shortage of domestic financing. The Bank has increased its efforts to deal
with these problems, especially by providing assistance to review the situation
of the railways and by increasing the number of supervision and other missions.
The situation is improving. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IFC investments as at December 31, 1973 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects.
22.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are:    (a) to ac-
celerate development in the less-developed regions of the country; (b) to pro-
mote agricultural development, particularly in the private sector, by providing
basic infrastructure and credit for the financing of farm development, equip-
ment and processing facilities; (c) to promote structural reforms in major
sectors of the economy through improved coordination, the strengthening of
institutions and technical assistance; and (d) to provide Yugoslavia with
long-term external capital and-thus help reduce the country's dependence on
short-term external borrowings. These objectives are basically the same as
those which guided lending in previous years, but efforts to give special
support to the less-developed regions and the small farmers in the private
sector are being strengthened, and a continuing high level of technical as-
sistance will be provided in appropriate cases.



- 7 -
23.       To achieve these objectives, loans for further support of railway
modernization, expansion of the port facilities of Bar, river regulation,
urban pollution control, roads and highways, power generation and transmis-
sion and an oil pipeline are envisaged during the next two years. Also
planned for this period are an agricultural credit project to promote the
development of private sector farms, as well as social sector agriculture,
and an industrial line of credit to assist small- and medium-size industrial
enterprises. IFC is currently investigating several new investment opportun-
ities to encourage joint ventures which will provide technical, management
and marketing expertise as well as long-term capital.
24.       In addition, the Bank's technical assistance has included reviews
of the power, tourism and transportation sectors. Other current Bank activ-
ities include EDI assistance for a project appraisal training institution,
including training some of its teachers; assistance with a study of the
Yugoslav capital market, which should help improve resource mobilization and
allocation; and help in establishing a training program for auditors in
Yugoslavia's Social Accounting Service, which audits all enterprises and gov-
ernment activities, including several Bank-financed projects.
25.       Bank commitments to Yugoslavia have averaged close to US$100 mil-
lion annually in the last three years. Although this represents only a rela-
tively small proportion of the country's need for external finance, it is
equivalent to almost one third of the annual long-term official capital in-
flow in convertible currencies. Assuming that the level of Bank lending rises
during the next five years, the outstanding debt to the Bank could rise from
12 percent of Yugoslavia's total external debt in 1972, to 19 percent by 1978.
Service on Bank loans as a proportion of total debt service would increase
from 4 percent to 7 percent during the same period.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN YUGOSLAVIA
26.       The main objective of Yugoslavia's development strategy during the
past two decades has been the transformation of a predominantly primary pro-
ducing economy into a highly industrialized economy. Rapid industrialization,
modernization and integration of the economy with the world market have been
emphasized. Industrial development policy has included both import substitu-
tion and export promotion, with the emphasis varying by sub-sectors and their
stage of development. In the first postwar decade priority was given to in-
vestments in heavy industries and power generation. In the late 1950's the
strategy changed to the stimulation of manufacturing industries. Since the
dependence of the economy on imports, particularly raw materials and invest-
ment goods, has increased significantly, the current Five-Year Social Develop-
ment Plan (1971-1975) projects growth of industrial output at 8 percent per
annum and emphasizes the need to accelerate the development of domestic
resource-based industries, both for export and use in domestic production.
For example, the production of steel and steel products is expected to grow
at around 15 percent per year and by 1975 should provide 70 percent of the
estimated domestic demand.



- 8 -
27.       Industry has played a key role in Yugoslavia's economic growth.
It accounts for about one-third of GDP, one-half of economic investments
and 39 percent of social sector employment. Industrial output rose at about
9 percent annually in real terms over the last decade; industrial exports
grew at about 14 percent annually and accounted for 85 percent of total mer-
chandise exports in 1972. Yugoslavia has become more competitive, particularly
in western markets, as a result of its diversified production and export struc-
ture, and persistent efforts to increase efficiency. A number of cooperative
and joint venture agreements with foreign partners have been concluded.
28.       Despite a long period of rapid growth, the development of the in-
dustrial sector has suffered from a number of problems including deficiencies
in the countrywide coordination of investment planning, lack of mobility of
both labor and capital, distortions in the allocation of resources, and in-
creasing dependence on raw materials and investment goods imports. Growing
foreign debt service payments of industrial enterprises, due to heavy short-
and medium-term borrowing on relatively hard terms over the last five years,
have increased the need for long-term external finance.
29.       The Bank's lending to industry is directed at supporting the Gov-
ernment in its efforts to improve the allocation of resources, reduce import
dependence and strengthen export capacity. It will also help improve the
structure and terms of the industrial sector's external borrowing. The pro-
posed project is in line with these objectives.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       Following an industrial identification mission in April 1971, the
Government, in May 1972, submitted eight industrial projects to the Bank for
financing. Among them was a proposal to expand the production capacities of
IMT and FOB - two members of Udruzena Metalska Industrija, an association of
metal working enterprises in Belgrade. After a project preparation mission
in December 1972, IMT and FOB were processed as separate projects. A special
mission to study the future market for tractors and farm implements visited
Yugoslavia in June 1973 and the project was appraised in August 1973. Nego-
tiations were held during December 1973 in Washington. The Yugoslav delega-
tion was led by Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assistant Federal Secretary for Finance,
and included representatives of the Federal Government, the Government of
the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Beogradska Banka, and IMT (the Borrower).
Annex III contains a loan and project summary.
The Yugoslav Tractor Industry
31.       There are six manufacturers of tractors and/or motorcultivators in
Yugoslavia. In recent years total output, though increasing, has not kept
pace with domestic demand and the Government allowed imports to increase
from 5,460 units in 1970 to 12,760 units in 1972 to fill the gap.



-9-
32.       The demand for agricultural machinery is expected to continue to
grow.  In July 1973, the Fedetal Government and the governments of the Re-
publics and Autonomous Provinces adopted an Agreement on the Development
of Agriculture (the "Green Plan"). The Agreement calls for improved produc-
tivity through, inter alia, increased mechanization. Current levels of mech-
anization, measured in horsepower per hectare (hp/ha), are 0.36 in the private
agricultural sector and 0.86 in the social sector. Developed agricultural
systems have levels ranging from 1.6 to 3.2 for intensive production methods
(comparable to Yugoslavia's private sector) and 0.91 to 1.3 for extensive
methods (comparable to Yugoslavia's social sector). Meeting the productivity
targets of the Agreement will require levels of approximately 1 hp/ha in the
social sector and 2 hp/ha in the private sector.
33.       Achieving these levels of mechanization will require expanding the
tractor fleet of the private sector from its 1972 level of about 95,400 units
to 400,000 units and upgrading the social sector fleet of 25,000 units by
using more sophisticated, higher horsepower units. To meet these target
levels of mechanization by 1990 about 34,000 tractors per year will be
needed to satisfy new and replacement demand.
The Borrower
34.       IMT is the largest manufacturer of tractors and farm implements in
Yugoslavia and is the only one making tractors of its own design using prim-
arily domestic raw materials and components. It is the fiftieth largest en-
terprise in Yugoslavia and the largest member of UMI. IMT operates a tractor
and implements factory in Belgrade, a motorcultivator factory in Knjazevac,
and a service and repair center in Dobanovci.
35.       Hitherto IMT has concentrated on meeting the pent-up domestic
demand for tractors. It has earned a 76 percent market share by offering
technically-sound, competitively-priced tractors and implements through a
nationwide sales and service network. There is firm evidence that IMT
tractors can be competitive in export markets. Prices (excluding duties and
taxes) for IMT's largest selling tractor (35 hp model) are about 30% below
comparable tractors from West European suppliers. Furthermore, the enter-
prise was recently awarded an IDA financed contract from Pakistan for 2000
tractors.
36.       Tractors, tractor accessories and implements are produced at the
Belgrade plant, which was founded in 1947 to produce pipes, tubes and bolts.
It began manufacturing tractors under license from Massey Ferguson in 1955.
Three separate expansion programs in 1961, 1968 and 1972 have raised produc-
tion capacity to the current level of 15,000 tractors per year. In 1968 IMT
introduced tractors of its own design and dropped the Massey Ferguson license.
It now manufactures four tractor models ranging from 35 to 85 horsepower and
matching implements and accessories. Between 1953 and 1970, IMT operated a
pattern shop and foundry located adjacent to its facilities in Belgrade. The
pattern shop and foundry became a separate company, Fabrica Odlivaka Beograd
(FOB) in 1970, but the close technical and supply relationship has been main-
tained.



- 10 -
37.       IMT's organization follows the general Yugoslav concept of decen-
tralized economic decision-making and workers' self-management of social
property. The policy-making body for the enterprise is a workers' council
which is elected by all employees. The workers' council appoints the general
manager and the deputy general manager who select the management team. IMT's
management is well trained and experienced and supported by sufficient quali-

Project Description
38.       The project is described in detail in the report entitled "The
Appraisal of the IMT Tractor Factory Expansion Project", No. 288a-YU and dated
January 28, 1974, which is being distributed separately. It comprises the
expansion of existing and the construction of new facilities at DMT Belgrade
and it would be Phase I of a two-phase expansion (Phase II, tentatively sched-
uled for 1978-79, would provide additional storage, office and general service
buildings and would be financed by IMT). It would allow the enterprise to
increase annual production from 15,000 to 35,000 tractors, and triple the
current output of farm implements and tractor accessories and thus continue
to meet the major portion of Yugoslavia's expanding tractor demand. The
project would also permit the introduction of two new tractors in the IMT
product range (one in the 20-25 hp class, one in the over-100 hp class).
39.       The project includes the following:
(a)  construction of a new tractor parts machine shop,
(b)  construction of a new tractor assembly plant including a
new transfer line, conveyors and paint shops,
(c)  construction of new offices, cafeteria and locker rooms,
(d)  conversion of the existing tractor production and assembly
plant into the main implement production and assembly areas,
and tool and repair shops,
(e)  construction of additional storage space,
(f)  building of access roads within the factory area,
(g)  installation of electronic data processing equipment for
production planning and inventory control,
(h)  installation of additional laboratory equipment, and
(i)  construction and equipping of a compressor station.
40.       In addition to expanding the physical plant, the project would
improve the material flow by setting up special storage areas, reorganizing
assembly lines and strengthening the materials handling system.



41.       IMT's production process is relatively clean with no adverse effects
on the environment. One minor exception is the effluent water from the sur-
face protection, paint and hardening facilities which would be neutralized
before discharging into the Belgrade water treatment plant.
42.       As a result of the project, net revenues are expected to increase
from Din. 1,285 million in 1973 to Din. 3,419 million in 1977 (in current
prices). Net income is projected to go up from Din. 79 million in 1973 to
Din. 231 million in 1977 (also current prices) and decline thereafter because
relatively higher cost increases than price increases have been assumed.
Project Execution
43.       IMT's staff is well qualified to carry out the project.    It has
successfully completed three projects expanding tractor production capacity
in the past. An Expansion Department with about 25 staff members has been
created to execute the project under the direction of an experienced engineer.
To provide assistance with international procurement, IMT has contracted an
experienced local firm.
44.       Civil construction started in mid-1973.    Erection of new and reloca-
tion of existing equipment, which would start in mid 1974 and be completed
by late 1975, is not expected to interfere significantly with production in
existing plants.
Project Costs and Financing
45.       The total cost of the project, excluding interest during construc-
tion of US$7.9 million, would be US$79.7 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$22.9 million (about 29% of the project cost). The cost es-
timates include physical contingency allowances for civil construction and
equipment (about 10% for hard currency contracts and 2-3% for local and clear-
ing account contracts) and price increases (about 6% p.a. for foreign equip-
ment costs and from 10% to 6% p.a. for local equipment, construction and
erection costs).
46.       The proposed Bank loan of US$18.5 million would finance the 75%
of imported equipment and spares required for the project which are to be
procured through international competitive bidding (or about 25% of total
project costs excluding interest during construction and duties and taxes).
The remaining financing required (i.e. US$69.1 million) would be provided
by two loans from Beogradska Banka (53% of total), internal cash generation
(24%) and credits from local suppliers and clearing account countries.    Should
additional financing in domestic or foreign currencies be required at any time,
IMT would finance it with credits from Beogradska Banka; an agreement between
IMT and Beogradska Banka to this end has been concluded. In addition to the
interest on the Bank loan of 7-1/4% per annum, a guarantee fee of 1-3/4% per



- 12 -
annum would be paid to the Socialist Republic of Serbia 1/. Thus the effective
cost of the Bank loan to IMT would be 9% per annum.
47.       Debt service coverage would remain adequate throughout project im-
plementation. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.4:1
in 1972 and is projected not to fall below 2.3:1 throughout project imple-
mentation and level off at about 3.0:1 thereafter. In order to maintain its
sound financial position, IMT has agreed that, until the completion of Phase
II, it would not, without the Bank's concurrence, undertake additional capi-
tal investments in excess of Din. 50 million or equivalent in any year other
than for the project or Phase II, nor would it incur or guarantee any new
debts in excess of Din. 50 million other than for the project. IMT also
agreed not to make cash outlays, other than for normal operations, if the
current ratio were to fall below 1.3:1 in any year after such outlays.
48.       A substantial amount of the increased demand for tractors after
1976 would depend on the availability of credit for private farmers. IMT
intends to make credit available for hire purchase through its dealers and
has agreed to draw-up and submit to the Bank by mid-1975 an implementation
plan for this purpose. Also, under the Agreement for the Development of
Agriculture, the Republics and Autonomous Provinces will adopt policies to
increase credit in both the social and private sectors.
Procurement
49.       The equipment and spares to be financed by the proposed loan would
be divided into 76 packages which would all be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Bids from domestic
suppliers would be given a preference of 15% or the actual customs duties,
whichever is less.
Disbursements
50.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against the actual foreign exchange
cost (c.i.f. Yugoslav border or port of entry) or local ex-factory price of
equipment and spare parts for the project. Disbursements would take place
over two years from the second quarter of 1974 to the end of 1975. A sched-
ule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex III.
Audit
51.       I1lT's accounts would be audited by the Social Accounting Service
(SAS), an autonomous governmental agency responsible for financial inspection
of Yugoslav economic enterprises. It audits several bank financed projects.
SAS started a training program in January 1974 under which its staff will be

obtain a guarantee from the Republics or Autonomous Province concerned,
in this case Serbia. The guarantee fee would, according to Yugoslav
regulations, accrue to the Socialist Republic of Serbia.

trained by Coopers and Lybrand of the U.K. in auditing methods consistent
with internationally-accepted requirements. It is likely to be some time
before it will be possible to fully realize the objectives of the program.
Meanwhile, IMT has agreed to invite the SAS, in collaboration with Coopers
and Lybrand to undertake the audit of its accounts as part of SAS's on-the-
job training of its staff.
Benefits
52.       The financial rate of return would be about 21%.   It is highly
sensitive to changes in operating costs and sales revenues. However, even
under foreseeable adverse conditions it is unlikely to drop below 10%. The
most likely economic rate of return would be 16% and it is unlikely to drop
below 8%.
53.       The project would directly generate about 1,445 new jobs and bring
the total IMT Belgrade labor force to 4,350. It would indirectly generate
additional employment in the raw material and parts supply and tractor serv-
ice industries.
54.       The expansion of IMT would benefit the Yugoslav economy by making
domestically-produced, technically-proven tractors available at reasonable
prices. In particular, small private farmers would be able to mechanize and
increase productivity, thereby helping to ensure that the "Green Plan" goals
of increased agricultural growth rates and improved living standards for
farmers are achieved. Foreign exchange earnings and savings would be sub-
stantial. In 1977, the first full year of expanded production, they would
amount to US$32.6 million - considerably in excess of the foreign exchange
component of project costs (US$22.9 million).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft loan agreement between the Bank and Industrija Masina I
Traktora, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Ar-
ticle III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for
loans for industrial projects.
56.       1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       It has not been possible in these reports to take full account of
the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However, available
information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECIJTION -/
Loan 395 Railway Modernization Program: US$70.0 million Loan of December 11
1964.
The loan was fully disbursed on October 31, 1972, after the Closing
Date had been postponed from December 31, 1969. However, completion of the
project has been delayed to 1975, due to financial planning and technical
difficulties. After 1966 the Yugoslav Railways suffered a continuous dete-
rioration of their financial position and liquidity for a number of related
reasons. Project cost estimates increased nearly threefold between 1963 and
1971 because of inflation, devaluation of the dinar, revaluation of some
European currencies and as a consequence of additional work following more
detailed feasibility studies, Payments for railway freight services were
held back by the lack of liquidity in the whole economy. The five Railway
Transport Enterprises which, under the Yugoslav system, are expected to oper-
ate on a commercial basis, were restricted by Government regulations in their
ability to respond to changed market conditions. Furthermore, the responsi-
bility of the Federal Government to meet railway deficits has been transferred
to the Republican Governments, which only now are in a position to assume it.
In order to be able to make proposals for dealing not only with the
difficulties with the Bank project, but also with the difficulties facing the
Yugoslav railways as a whole, it was agreed with the Government in 1971 that
the Bank would undertake a thorough review of the railways' problems. Follow-
ing this review, which was carried out with the assistance of a consulting
team, the Bank discussed its findings with the Federal and Regional Governments
and the Railways. The response of the Governments and the Railways was very
favorable and they agreed to take concerted action to improve the railways'
situation. In view of this, the Bank agreed to consider making a further
loan in fiscal year 1973 or 1974 to assist completion of the 1964 modernization
program, provided that certain conditions could be met. These are the clari-
fication of government responsibility for the railways and an overall plan of
action both for the Yugoslav railways as a whole and for each Railway Enterprise
(including clear marketing and related operational and financial objectives),
a revised tariff policy, investment and disinvestment proposals, and proposals
for dealing with labor redundancy problems and for improvement in management.
The Governments and the railways have taken and are taking measures to meet
these conditions, and a mission visited Yugoslavia in November/December 1972
to assist in the preparation of new action plans. Revised investment and
financing plans required substantial re-appraisal of the project in May/June
1973 and a follow up mission in December 1973. The final size of the proposed

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution,

project is just now being determined, as Republics clarify the availability
of local resources and local agreements are being worked out to clarify the
respective responsibilities of the Governments and Railways, and a recommenda-
tion to the Executive Directors regarding a new Bank loan is expected to be
made later this spring. This new financial assistance would be concentrated
on the completion of the 1964 modernization program of main lines.
Any further delay in carrying out a minimal modernization program
could further jeopardize the competitive position of the railways in relation
to road traffic and would extend the period in which the economy would not
benefit fully from the large investments in the Modernization Program made
with Bank assistance since 1964.
Loan 531 Belgrade-Bar Railway: US$50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Execution of this project was delayed by more than one year due to
geological difficulties and inefficiency of the contractor responsible for
the civil engineering work at the Kos Tunnel. The contract has now been placed
with another more efficient contractor already working for the project. The
delays have made it necessary to reschedule track-laying which is now expected
to be completed in 1975. The line is expected to become operative at the end
of 1975. The closing date has been postponed from December 31, 1973, to
December 31, 1975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
has increased from $225.5 million to $292.0 million. This has resulted in
additional financing being required; arrangements for this to be covered by
Yugoslav sources are under consideration.
Loan 608  Third Highway:   US$30.0 million Loan of June 5, 1969;
Closing Date: August 31, 1974.
Construction works under the loan have been substantially completed,
except for the access road in Zagreb, which is expected to require several
additional months. The Closing Date of the Loan was postponed from December
31, 1972 to December 31, 1973. A second postponement to August 31, 1974, has
been agreed. In view of increases in costs, the disbursement percentage has
been reduced from the original 42 percent to 27 percent, in order to continue
disbursements until the completion of these works. Disbursements are proceed-
ing on schedule.
Loan 654 Industrial Projects - 1970: US$18.5 million Loan of January 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974.
All three sub-projects under the loan are making satisfactory pro-
gress after experiencing delays of up to 18 months due to slow deliveries of
local and imported goods. The Closing Date was postponed from June 30 to
December 31, 1973, to allow payments of 10 percent retention money under
already concluded contracts of Crvena Zastava and Sisak, and a second time
on December 289 1973 by seven months to July 31, 1974, to allow disbursements
of final guarantee payments.

Loan 657  Telecommunications:   US$40.0 million Loan of Februar  20, 1970;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1975.
Delays in civil works have occurred which will delay completion of
the project until late 1975. With the exception of the earth satellite
station, only preliminary works have been completed. A cost overrun for
orders already placed amounting to US$5.1 million, is expected due to cur-
rency revaluations. Following a revision of the disbursement schedule, dis-
bursements are now in line with the revised projections.
Loan 678 Fourth Highway: US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
After an initial delay of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica sections because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily. The completion of the proj-
ect, however, is likelv to be delayed substantially beyond the present Closing
Date: the extent of this delay will be determined in the Spring of 1974.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over the appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. The Federal Government
submitted a revised cost estimate of construction work in January 1973 and on
the basis of this estimate the disbursement percentage has been revised from
43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973. Disbursement is proceeding in line
with the revised projection. A supervision mission is scheduled for April 1974.
Loan 751  Fifth Highway: US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions for
effectiveness of the loan, construction work is now making satisfactory prog-
ress on all sections. A 10 percent increase in the appraisal cost estimate is
expected, and the disbursement percentage will be revised when more accurate
revised cost estimates are available. Disbursement under the loan is about
one year behind the appraisal estimate. A supervision mission is scheduled
for April 1974.
Loan 752 Bernardin Tourism: US$10.0 million of Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1976.
After the loss of more than one year owing to delays in making the
loan effective and in appointing consultants, the implementation of the proj-
ect experienced a further delay of one and a half months. As a result, dis-
bursements are behind schedule. Preliminary estimates indicate that the
project, if it were to be implemented as originally envisaged (2,500 beds)
would cost approximately US$34 million instead of US$24 million.    This in-
crease is mainly due to rapid inflation, but also to realignment in exchange
rates. As only a small amount of additional financing appears to be forth-
coming, the project might have to be reduced to some 1,500 to 2,000 beds by
eliminating the most expensive structures with the lowest returns. Such
reduction will result in a less favorable economic rate of return. But it is
expected that the project would still be viable.

Loan 777 Ibar Multipurpose Water: US$45.0 million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31,1976.
The start of project work was delayed for one year. However, the
responsible agency, the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise, is now well established and
good progress is being made in constructing the project. It should be pos-
sible to complete most of the project by the end of 1976 (i.e., one year
later than originally planned). Disbursements are proceeding in line with
the revised schedule.
Loan 782 Babin Kuk Tourism: US$20.0 million Loan of July 21. 1971;
Closing Date: July 31, 1976.
There have been delays in the implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective and in mobilizing consultants. Because
of these, disbursements are behind schedule. Although these problems have
now been largely resolved, the project is almost two years behind schedule.
This period has been one of rapid inflation in Yugoslavia and project costs
are now estimated to have increased by 75 percent over the estimate at the
time of appraisal. Unless additional finance can be found the project will
have to be reduced in scale. This is most likely to affect the economic
rate of return adversely, but preliminary calculations indicate that a reduced
project would still be viable. The consultants are now performing fairly well
and construction of the project is due to start in the third quarter of 1974.
Loan 836 Power Transmission: US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
After some delays in preparing tender documents, bidding procedures
are now under way. Following the supervision mission in October, procurement
appears to be moving better. Although no disbursements have been made so far,
the Bank has agreed with proposals to award contracts, representing about 50
percent of the Loan amount.
Loan 894 Agricultural Industries (Macedonia): US$31 million Loan of May 25. 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
A supervision mission in September 1973 found that there was strong
credit demand, with most credit applications for major subprojects expected to
be received by early 1974. Stopanska Banka has already granted several sub-
loans and disbursements are expected to begin shortly on schedule. A super-
vision mission visited the project area in mid-January 1974.

Procurement:         Equipment and spares financed by the proposed loan would
be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Bids offering goods
whose manufacturing cost includes a value added in
Yugoslavia equal to at least 20% of the ex-factory bid
price of such goods would, for purposes of bid comparison
only, be given a preference of 15% or the actual customs
duties whichever is less.
Rate of Return:     The most probable economic and financial rates of return
are estimated at about 16 percent and 21 percent respec-
