(a)\n            construction of a new tractor parts machine shop and a new\n            tractor assembly plant, (b) conversion of the existing\n            tractor production and assembly plant into the main\n            implement production and assembly areas, (c) construction of\n            storage facilities for raw materials, parts and supplies,\n            (d) installation of electronic data processing equipment for\n            production planning, inventory control and accounting, (e)\n            construction of new offices, cafeteria, locker rooms, (f)\n            additional laboratory equipment, and (g) construction and\n            equipping of a compressor station. The new and reorganized\n            facilities would allow IMT to expand tractor production from\n            15,000 units per year to 35,000 units per year (including\n            two new tractor types) and triple the current output of\n            tractor accessories and agricultural implements."}, "docdt": "1974-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
