The project\n            will finance Albanian Guarantee Agency (AGA), which will\n            issue guarantees to entities that finance productive\n            activities in Albania. The project consists of three\n            components. 1) Albania will contribute US$0.7 million as\n            issued and paid-in capital for AGA. 2) Start-up costs\n            (US$0.25 million) of the Albania Guarantee Agency will cover\n            AGA's initial start-up costs for capital expenditures\n            and administrative expenses in its first year. 3) Political\n            Risks Guarantee Facility (US$20 million), managed by AGA,\n            will mitigate the perceived risks that are preventing the\n            private sector from having access to commercial financing\n            for productive transactions or from risking their own funds\n            to re-enter the market. As guarantees are issued, the funds\n            will be placed in escrow with an agent bank outside Albania\n            under liability until the guarantee runs off. The agent bank\n            will also issue the beneficiary of the AGA an irrevocable\n            standby letter of credit to ensure security."}, "docdt": "1998-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
