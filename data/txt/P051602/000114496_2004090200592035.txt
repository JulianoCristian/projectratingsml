We also refer to your letter dated September 19, 2002 and December 12, 2002 requesting

We are pleased to inform you that the Association hereby agrees to your request.   
 
Accordingly, the Development Credit Agreement is hereby amended as follows: 
 
1. 
The word “and” between “goods” and “services” is replaced with “,” in Paragraph

2. 
The words “and incremental operating costs” are added between “services” and 
“required” in Paragraph 1(c) of Part D of the Schedule 4 to the Development Credit 
Agreement. 
 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by countersigning both copies of this
