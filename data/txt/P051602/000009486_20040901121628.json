The lesson learned was the following:  An\n            agency was established by legislation and a staff of six\n            persons was employed to implement the project. As it\n            eventuated, activity was not adequate to keep the staff\n            fully and actively employed except in the set up period of\n            training and the initial marketing. The Project Appraisal\n            Document envisaged that the agency would be able to continue\n            in existence after the project closed as a guarantee agency\n            and provide support for cross border trade including export\n            credit insurance. The project description in Part B of\n            Schedule 2 envisaged the continuation of the project in the\n            form of a guarantee agency unsupported by the World Bank but\n            only after the project had closed at the end of January\n            2003. The form of insurance or guarantees envisaged by Part\n            B, such as export credit insurance, are related but more\n            complex functions than providing political risk only\n            guarantees. In retrospect, the objectives of the Project\n            would have been better achieved by allowing the agency\n            during the project implementation period to use the project\n            funds on other related activities such as export credit\n            insurance, subject to similar controls and restrictions as\n            applied in the use of political risk insurance."}, "docdt": "2004-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
