                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The overarching objective of the operation is to strengthen the banking sector, which is a critical pre-condition for sustainable economic recovery and private sector-led
                         growth.

                          The proposed loan supports a comprehensive program of measures to strengthen thebanking sector, with a view to mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis
                         and increasing the resilience of the sector to possible future shocks. The FSDPL would also support the Government#s goals of maintaining a stable macroeconomic
                         framework, including sustainable budget deficit and debt levels. The specific reforms proposed to strengthen the banking sector are in the followingareas: (i)
                         maintaining market confidence; (ii) strengthening bank liquidity framework; (iii) assessing and addressing banking sector vulnerabilities; (iv) enhancing regulatory
                         framework for banking sector; and (v) problem bank restructuring.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project achieved moderately satisfactory results against the targets, as key financial sector related risks were importantly mitigated, though apparently public deposits were not
                         fully removed from Prva Bank, non-performing loans (NPLs) were reduced and lending increased, though not to the expected levels owing to affects from the on-going Eurozone
                         crisis.
