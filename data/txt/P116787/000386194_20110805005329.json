strengthen the banking sector, which is a\n            critical pre-condition for sustainable economic recovery and\n            balanced private sector-led growth. This document describes\n            the first in the series of FSDPLs to Montenegro in support\n            of a comprehensive banking sector reform program. The main\n            areas of reform are: (i) maintaining market confidence; (ii)\n            strengthening the bank liquidity framework; (iii) assessing\n            and addressing banking sector vulnerabilities; (iv)\n            enhancing the regulatory framework; and (v) problem bank\n            restructuring. The program supported by the operation would\n            be implemented primarily by the Ministry of Finance (MoF)\n            and the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG). The operation is\n            in the amount of \u008059.1 million (US$85 million equivalent).\n            The second FSDPL is planned for early FY13 and would be in\n            the amount of US$20 million equivalent."}, "docdt": "2011-07-22T00:00:00Z"}
