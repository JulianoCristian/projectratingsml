F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overarching objective of the operation is to strengthen the banking sector, which is a critical
pre-condition for sustainable economic recovery and balanced private sector-led growth.

Two operations were envisioned to support a comprehensive program of measures to strengthen
the banking sector, with a view to mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis and
increasing the resilience of the sector to possible future shocks. The specific reforms proposed to
strengthen the banking sector were in the following areas: (i) maintaining market confidence; (ii)


                                                   2
strengthening the bank liquidity framework; (iii) assessing and addressing banking sector
vulnerabilities; (iv) enhancing the regulatory framework; and (v) problem bank restructuring.
These reforms are an integral part of Montenegro's EU accession strategy insofar as they aim to
bring the supervisory and regulatory framework for the banking sector closer to EU practices.

  It should be noted that the envisaged second operation of the programmatic FSDPL laid out in
the Program Document was changed into a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) with some different
policy areas and expected targets (Section 1.6). The first PFSDPL was converted into a single
operation after it was decided to change the second operation to a guarantee so as to leverage or
increase the World Bank's financing available to the Government of Montenegro through a PBG
operation.

OPCS has advised the team to prepare separate ICRs for the first FSDPL and PBG. This ICR
assesses the key expected results and outcomes at the end of the program, as illustrated in the
Program Document of the first operation. Since specific targets for the first operation were not
provided given the original programmatic design, we are obliged to assess results based on the
program end targets, which were also supported by the PBG (instead of the envisioned second
operation).

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
       1.1 Context at Appraisal
   Montenegro was hit hard by the global financial crisis beginning in late 2008 onwards. The First
   Programmatic Financial Sector Development Policy Loan (FPFSDPL) launched the financial
   sector reform program in 2010 through preparation of the Development Policy Loan (DPL)
   series1. In addition, the FPFSDPL builds on an earlier operation which supported the
   development of Montenegro’s financial and enterprise sector.

   The Montenegrin financial system is composed almost entirely of the banking sector, with assets
   accounting for about 89 percent of GDP. The banking sector is dominated by foreign banks. The
   sector consists of eleven banks, five of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of (non-Greek)
   Eurozone banks and together occupy about 72 percent of the market share at end-2012.
   Montenegro has no state banks and none of the banks are subsidiaries of a Greek parent bank.
   However, two of the five foreign banks (Hypo and NLB Montenegrobank) have been intervened
   by their home governments and their restructuring plans are currently being discussed with the
   European Commission.

   The five EU banks have traditionally accounted for about 72 percent of total banking sector
   assets. However, since the beginning of the global financial crisis in 2008, the share of the
   domestic banks, as measured by asset size, has decreased from 16 to 10% at end-2012, as Prva
   banka (or Prva Bank) (formerly the second largest bank in the system) has been aggressively
   downsized as part of its restructuring program. Prva, now the sixth largest bank by asset size, is
   no longer considered to be a systemically important bank.
   Liquidity buffers have been rebuilt since the massive withdrawal of deposits undermined the
   banking system's liquidity in late 2008. Between September 2008 and 2011, the banking sector
   lost more than 19 percent of its total deposits. Since then, system wide liquidity has improved to
   its current level of 40 percent; however, Prva banka continues to be the least liquid bank within
   the system reporting liquid assets to short term liabilities at 11.0 percent (compared to 40 percent
   system wide) and liquid assets to total assets of 8.6 percent (compared to 24 percent system
   wide).

   As the real estate and credit bubble burst, domestic credit flow and liquidity suddenly stopped
   and the Montenegrin economy went into recession in 2009. Growth plummeted, from almost 7
   percent in 2008 to -5.7 percent in 2009, one of the sharpest growth declines among European and
   Central Asian economies. External demand (in particular for aluminum and steel) dropped, while
   liquidity problems in the financial and corporate sectors escalated. Total employment declined
   by almost 7 percent from the second half of 2009 to end-2010, despite a gradual moderation of
   wages and shortened working hours. The absolute poverty rate doubled to close to 7 percent in
   2010.

     This ICR assesses the results based on the end of program targets included in the Program Document of the
   FPFSDPL, as no separate end-results were defined for each operation. It should be noted however that the envisaged
   second operation of the programmatic FSDPL, as laid out in the Program Document of the first operation, was
   changed into a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG). See Sections 1.6.

In response, the Government implemented emergency financial, fiscal and social measures to
stem the impact on the economy while continuing EU-accession related structural reforms. An
announcement of a bank deposit guarantee in October 2008 stopped the run on deposits. The
Central Bank responded with a menu of measures aimed at easing the liquidity crisis while
strengthening inspection and supervision. On the fiscal front, the Government implemented cuts
in nominal wages and increased spending on active labor market programs targeting the youth
and new job entrants. It also began preparing the ground for a significant further tightening of
the budget in the considerably changed external environment.

With a sharp drop in economic activity, domestic demand and imports, a significant external
adjustment took place from 2009 onwards. Montenegrin exports (in particular for aluminum and
steel) declined by double digits, which coupled with domestic problems in the financial and
corporate sectors, led to an abrupt economic slowdown. A double-digit fall of manufacturing,
construction and transport in 2009 was only partially compensated by growth in energy
production and agriculture, leading to an estimated economic decline of around 5.7 percent in
2009. The massive drop in production in the heavily indebted and overstaffed Aluminum
Company (KAP) alone, the country’s largest exporter and industrial producer, accounted for
about 1¼ percent decline in GDP.

The economic downturn reduced previous gains made in living standards. Total employment
declined by almost seven percent from the second half of 2009 to end-2010, despite of the
moderation of wages and shortened working hours. The number of unemployed between
December 2008 and 2010 rose by 13.2 percent. A recent poverty analysis confirmed that the
poverty rate increased to 6.8 percent in 2009, after having declined from 11.3 percent in 2006 to
below five percent in 2008. Almost a quarter of employees were affected by deteriorating labor
market conditions during the crisis, including 10 percent that experienced wage arrears and
another 10 percent that suffered salary reductions. About 30 percent of crisis-impacted
households increased labor supply, either by having a non-working member seek work or having
working members seek additional work.

Owing to an abrupt decline in capital inflows and a large fall in external and domestic demand,
significant external adjustment took place. The current account deficit was reduced by half
between 2008 and 2010 as imports contracted. However, it remained high at about 23 percent of
GDP in 2010, as exports and tourism hardly recovered. During 2006–2010, net FDI financed on
average about 63 percent of the current account deficit, excluding one-off inflows from the
recapitalization and partial privatization of Montenegro’s power utility in 2009. Access to capital
was retained through foreign banks’ increased financial support to their Montenegrin
subsidiaries, which contributed to a rise in external debt to 94 percent of GDP in 2009.

The rapid expansion of the Montenegrin banking system came to a halt in late 2008 due to the
impact of the global financial crisis on the overheated domestic economy. The system’s rapid
growth was driven by the entry of foreign banks, along with increased domestic demand coming
in particular from the real estate sector6. Total assets of the banking system increased by more
than 100 percent on average in 2006 and 2007, growing from 67 percent of GDP to 111 percent
of GDP. Asset growth slowed substantially since 2008 due to the impact of the global financial
crisis, with assets growing by only 11 percent in 2008 (owing to credit controls applied by the



                                                8
CBCG and the impact of the crisis), and then contracting by 8.6 percent in 2009, and a further
2.7 percent in 2010.

A massive withdrawal of deposits severely undermined the liquidity of the system in late 2008,
although the situation has improved since then. The system’s liquid assets to short term liabilities
ratio declined from 32 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in 2008. Since then, system wide liquidity
has markedly improved to 40.1 percent at end-2012. The liquidity situation was helped by large
cash inflows into the banking system as a result of partial privatization of electricity production
and distribution, and by substantial capital injections from the foreign parents of Montenegrin
banks.

The credit crunch reached its peak in 2009 with a 14.3 percent decline in credit year on year, due
to banks’ rising asset quality problems and a decline in demand for loans from a corporate sector
affected by the weakening economy. The availability of parent bank credit declined and
Montenegro’s banks were forced to adjust their liquidity risk exposures. Borrowings from parent
banks as a share of total liabilities dropped from 25.1 percent (26.9 percent of GDP) in 2008 to
17.5 percent (15.2 percent of GDP) in 2011. Consequently, the system’s loan-to-deposit ratio
decreased from 155 percent in April 2009 to 104 percent by September 2011. Further, as banks
have focused on cleaning up their balance sheets in 2010 and 2011, credit continued to decline
through end-2012.

As the crisis began to unfold in 2008, NPLs increased rapidly reaching a peak of 25 percent of
loans during the second quarter of 2011. Thereafter, they declined to 15.5 percent by end-March
2012 as two leading banks began to transfer large amounts of NPLs to their sister companies.
However, by end- 2012 banks’ overall NPLs increased again to 17.6 percent. The bulk of NPLs
are centered in the trade, tourism, and construction. NPL ratios within the banks vary greatly
ranging from 2.5 percent to a high of 36 percent.

Between September 2008 and 2011, the banking sector lost more than 17 percent of its total
deposits. As a consequence of rapidly increasing NPLs, nine out of 11 banks had to be
recapitalized by their shareholders, as bank profitability turned strongly negative (ROE at -6.9
percent) at the same time, reaching its nadir of -27.3 percent ROE in September 2010 before
improving to -18.3 percent in 2012.

Parent banks supported their Montenegrin subsidiaries with necessary liquidity support and
substantial capital injections. This helped partially offset declining domestic deposits and capital
erosion. Importantly, the parent banks provided about EUR230 million in new capital from end-
2008 to March 2011. The bank liquidity situation was also helped by large cash inflows from
partial privatization of electricity production and distribution.

   1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
   approved):
The overarching objective of the first PFSDPL operation is to strengthen the banking sector,
which is a critical pre-condition for sustainable economic recovery and balanced private sector-
led growth.




                                                 9
Two operations were envisioned to support a comprehensive program of measures to strengthen
the banking sector, with a view to mitigating the impact of the global financial crisis and
increasing the resilience of the sector to possible future shocks. The specific reforms proposed to
strengthen the banking sector were in the following areas: (i) maintaining market confidence; (ii)
strengthening the bank liquidity framework; (iii) assessing and addressing banking sector
vulnerabilities; (iv) enhancing the regulatory framework; and (v) problem bank restructuring.
These reforms are an integral part of Montenegro’s EU accession strategy insofar as they aim to
bring the supervisory and regulatory framework for the banking sector closer to EU practices.

The program indicators, as shown in the Policy Matrix of the Program Document (PD) of the
first operation, included:

       Annual deposit growth (%)
       Annual credit growth (%)
       Enhanced ability of the central bank to provide emergency liquidity assistance
       Liquidity in the banking sector measured as ratio of liquid assets to liabilities
       Quality of banks loan portfolio – NPL ratio (%)
       Capitalization of banks based on CAR minimum requirement (%)
       Effectiveness of supervision of banking system consistent with Basel Core Principles
       Strengthening legal authority of CBCG for resolution of problem banks according to international
        and EU good practices
       Status of implementation of Supervisory Action Plan (SAP) and withdrawal of central
        government deposits from Prva Banka

It should be noted that the envisaged second operation of the programmatic FSDPL laid out in
the Program Document was changed into a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) with some different
policy areas and expected targets (Section 1.6). The first PFSDPL was converted into a single
operation after it was decided to change the second operation to a guarantee so as to leverage or
increase the World Bank’s financing available to the Government of Montenegro through a PBG
operation.

OPCS has advised the team to prepare separate ICRs for the first FSDPL and PBG. This ICR
assesses the key expected results and outcomes at the end of the program, as illustrated in the
Program Document of the first operation. Since specific targets for the first operation were not
provided given the original programmatic design, we are obliged to assess results based on the
program end targets, which were also supported by the PBG (instead of the envisioned second
operation).

   1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
   and reasons/justification:
None.

   1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):
The objective of the first PFSDPL operation is to support the authorities’ reform program for
strengthening the banking sector. Since the beginning of the global financial crisis in the autumn


                                                  10
of 2008, the authorities worked diligently to formulate and deliver a coherent policy response
aimed at restoring long-term macroeconomic and financial sector stability, and encouraging a
sustainable economic recovery.

In the fiscal area, to respond to the crisis and contain the widening fiscal deficit, the Government
undertook politically difficult expenditure cuts to consolidate Government and expenditure
growth, including by privatizing selected state assets and concessions. In the financial sector, the
authorities gave priority to restoring depositor confidence and stepping up the supervisory effort,
including restructuring of problem banks.

In parallel, the authorities pursued a longer term effort towards strengthening the entire
regulatory framework for the banking sector in order to bring it in line with international
practices and EU directives, and thus make the sector and regulatory bodies better prepared for
possible future shocks. These reforms are consistent with the Economic and Fiscal Program for
the three-year period that the Government was obliged to prepare as part of the EU accession,
starting from 2007. The need for a stronger regulatory and institutional framework for the
banking sector was also highlighted by the European Commission (EC).

The negative impact of the crisis on Montenegro’s economy provides a strong rationale for the
first PFSDPL operation, which was designed to provide a coherent policy response to systemic
risks in banking sector. It also lays the foundation for healthy future growth by advancing the
regulatory reform agenda in financial sector. The operation supports strengthening the banking
sector and increasing its resilience to future shocks, by undertaking reforms in the following five
key areas:

The policy areas included into the Program Document of the first PFSDPL were the following:

Maintaining market confidence. The banking sector went into an abrupt tail-spin beginning in
late 2008 owing to the global financial crisis, which sharply impacted parent bank funding and
undermined depositors’ confidence, thus negatively affecting local banks’ liquidity (as most
banks were funded from abroad). The ensuing economic slowdown in Montenegro yielded a
dramatic rise in non-performing loans (NPLs), which caused banks to report negative earnings
and to effectively stop lending. The policy measures adopted through the first PFSDPL
encouraged depositors to return funds to Montenegrin banks over time, and similarly, to begin to
lend again.

Strengthening the liquidity framework. Bank liquidity was sharply eroded owing to the
parallel withdraw of deposits by citizens and the effects of the global financial crisis on parent
bank access to international capital markets. The CBCG did not have a functioning Lender of
Last Resort (LoLR) facility in place to provide liquidity support to solvent banks facing liquidity
pressures. The first PFSDPL policy measures adopted addressed this weakness, providing the
CBCG with a key liquidity tool to utilize in the event needed. Moreover, in time banks’ liquidity
improved; in part owing to depositors’ returning funds, changing the reserve requirements and
inadvertently, through their cessation of lending.




                                                11
Assessing and addressing banking sector vulnerabilities. As the project was being prepared it
became apparent that the CBCG did not have a means to quickly grasp solvency, regulatory and
potential other threats affecting its designated systemically important banks. To mitigate these
risks, the project team agreed with the CBCG to develop Supervisory Action Plans (SAPs) based
upon on-site examinations at those banks deemed to be of special concern. This enabled the
supervisor to better understand the risk profile of designated banks, its ability to improve the
quality of its loan book and oversee the bank’s recapitalization against a more full understanding
of bank specific risks.

Enhancing the regulatory framework. In a bid to align the CBCG’s regulatory framework to
emerging EU guidance on strengthening bank supervisory powers, the CBCG’s enforcement
authorities were expanded to take pre-emptive measures and strengthen its bank resolution legal
framework in a number of critical areas.

Restructuring of problem banks. This set of supervisory measures was directed to a single
domestically owned bank. As the on-site examination prepared ahead of the SAP determined the
bank’s solvency was threatened, the CBCG ordered the bank to reduce its size; as a part of which
the Ministry of Finance (MoF) began to remove public deposits held on account at the bank.

   1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

The original policy areas included into the PD of the first PFSDPL were not revised, but the
envisioned second operation was converted to a guarantee. The guarantee operation had the same
objective but somewhat different policy areas for the reasons explained in Section 1.6.

   1.6 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation
   arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations):
The envisaged second operation of the PFSDPL laid out in the first PFSDPL Program Document
was changed into a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) owing largely to two separate but related sets
of challenges. Firstly, the Eurozone crisis exacted a tremendous economic and social cost on
Montenegro, as well laid out in the Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee (FSPBG; P130157)
Program Document. The prolongation and depth of the crisis in the Montenegrin banking system
obliged two small sets of changes to the second operation, as briefly described in the next
section. Secondly, given the steep economic decline Montenegro experienced, its fiscal condition
sharply worsened in 2011, which required additional financing. The FSPBG operation, designed
in lieu of the second programmatic DPL instead, became a Euro 60 million PBG which enabled
Montenegro to leverage its borrowing considerably through a World Bank guarantee provided a
private lender.

The financial sector reform program remained largely intact through the PBG, though two policy
areas were not carried forward in the PBG for the reasons outlined below:

The first policy area “maintaining market confidence” was not carried forward as bank
depositors began to return their monies to banks in late-2011, indicating that public confidence in



                                                12
   the financial system had begun to improve. The envisaged Deposit Protection Fund (DPF)
   regulatory changes were included in the second operation.

   The second policy area supporting “strengthening liquidity framework” was not deemed
   necessary as banks’ liquidity improved beginning in late-2011 owing to the return of deposits
   and parent bank recapitalization, obviating the need for additional liquidity enhancement
   measures. Additionally, the CBCG’s LoLR policy adopted was deemed by the team as
   sufficiently robust as to not require further changes: instead, the PBG operation introduced
   measures to strengthen systemic risk monitoring and the crisis preparedness framework.

   Each of the indicative triggers from the first PFSDPL for the second DPL operation (re-cast as
   the FSPBG) are featured in Annex 2 of the FSPBG Program Document (see Section 2.1). The
   rationale for the above changes were discussed extensively with the Country Director and RVP,
   and of course the FY12 PBG approved by the Board.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
       2.1 Program Performance:
   The project was initiated as a programmatic financial sector DPL consisting of two operations.
   For the reasons explained in Section 1.6, the second DPL operation was changed into a Financial
   Sector Policy Based Guarantee (FSPBG; P130157) and its policy actions were substantially
   carried forward. This table presents the policy actions and their status under both operations.

       2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
Adequacy of government's commitment, stakeholder involvement, and/or participatory
processes: The design of the Government’s reform program and this operation benefited
from consultations with relevant stakeholders. The authorities have pro-actively
communicated with the public on the objectives of the DPL financial sector reform program.
The MoF and the CBCG representatives made frequent appearances on TV and in printed
media, regularly issued press releases (published on MoF and CBCG websites in both
Montenegrin and English) and organized roundtables to explain the measures taken by the
authorities to boost market confidence and restore healthy financial intermediation.

The changes in legislation were extensively discussed with industry stakeholders, and went
through an extensive inter-ministerial harmonization process before their submission for the
Parliament’s consideration. The Bank team has also consulted widely with stakeholders,
including banking sector representatives, academic and representatives of other key
development partners, including the IMF and the EC Delegation.

Soundness of the background analysis supporting the operation(s), lessons learned
incorporated, and the rationale for the Bank’s intervention: The project team had
unprecedented access to the authorities and banking records alike throughout the protracted
project preparation period. As such, the detailed sectoral analysis featured in Annex 2 of the
Program Document demonstrates the depth of understanding the challenges the financial
sector faced, as agreed with the authorities. As well, the Bank and the IMF jointly reviewed
and provided technical assistance to the authorities on the legal amendments to the draft Law
on Banks and the Bank Bankruptcy and Liquidation Law. The IMF has taken the lead on
reviewing the draft law on the Central Bank, while the Bank has played the same role for the
Deposit Protection Law.

The first PFSDPL incorporated lessons from Bank’s experience in 2008-2009 crises, as well
as in previous economic and financial crises. A recent comprehensive review of the Bank’s
responses to financial crises underscored the following lessons:

      Early response. The key lesson from the Bank’s responses to previous crises is the
       importance of an early response. In this case, the Bank fielded an identification mission
       within a few weeks from receiving the request for budget support, even though the Country
       Partnership Strategy (CPS) did not foresee a need for a DPL instrument at that time.

      Need for focus. During crises, it is crucial that operations focus on selected key areas for good
       outcomes. The proposed operation incorporates this lesson by focusing on a main challenge
       recognized by the Government, namely, addressing vulnerabilities in the banking sector and
       making the banking sector more resilient to cope with possible future shocks.

      Government ownership. The proposed reforms need to support the authorities’ priorities and
       an extensive dialogue is essential to develop ownership of the technically complex, politicall
       y sensitive reforms in the banking sector. This operation was prepared in direct collaboration
       with the top leadership of the MoF and the CBCG.




                                               15
      Communication strategy. Through a carefully planned and implemented communication
       strategy by the Government and the Bank undertaken in support of this operation, public
       understandings of key financial stability measures adopted were substantially improved. The
       staff of the World Bank Field Office in Podgorica played a critical role in this regard by
       ensuring consistent and timely communication with key stakeholders. The Bank also kept
       civil society and the general public informed of its position on critical issues through
       interviews to national media and press releases.

      Coordination among development partners. Coordination proved critical as such a
       coordinated approach yields better understood results. This operation incorporates this lesson
       by working closely with the IMF, EC, and EBRD.

The negative impact of the crisis on Montenegro’s economy provided a strong rationale for
the operation, designed to provide a coherent policy response to systemic risks in banking
sector. It also laid the foundation for more healthy future growth by advancing the regulatory
reform agenda in financial sector.

Assessment of the operation’s design: The Law on Central Bank of Montenegro was
amended (Official Gazette 40/10 and 46/10) to further align the CBCG legislative framework
with sound European Union practices, including, inter alia, expanded powers and
instruments for the CBCG’s function as lender of last resort.

Relevance of the risks identified at appraisal and effectiveness of mitigation measures:
The first PFSDPL was a high-risk operation, developed in the depths of the Eurozone
sovereign debt crises, wherein external uncertainties were protracted and heightened. Key
risks were identified in four major areas: (i) economic risks; (ii) financial instability; (iii)
governance) and (iv) implementation related risks. Having identified these sets of risks
through the prolonged preparation phase, the team was able to mitigate against worse
outcomes owing to the deep commitment of the authorities to avoid the potential threat of
financial instability in Montenegro.

Given that the politically sensitive and technically complex financial sector reforms
undertaken could be stalled, or subject to backtracking following the mid-2011 approval of
the first PFSDPL, the team designed a uniquely robust set of the prior actions (i.e., enactment
of new legislation as opposed to submission to the Parliament, implementation of supervision
action plans by banks as opposed to approval of SAPs by the CBCG, recapitalization of Prva
Banka) which would prove difficult to reverse.

Furthermore, the financial sector reforms supported under this operation were largely
continued and deepened under the second operation, converted from a DPL to a PBG.
Finally, Article IV of the Loan Agreement included (as a remedy of last resort) a clause
allowing the Bank to accelerate repayment in the event the agreed Program goes off track
after disbursement.
       2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
At the Government level, the MoF was responsible for the overall implementation of the
operation and for the reporting process; their efforts were closely aligned with the CBCG,


                                              16
     who drafted the key regulations and in close collaboration with the MoF undertook the
     needed supervisory and reforms steps.

     Design: There were nine indicators to monitor the outcomes, for which targets were
     established for each indicator to capture the results achieved. The baselines and outcome
     indicators were objective and cumulatively formed a clear result chain demonstrating both
     the regulator’s and financial sector’s performance. Having said that, PDO Indicator No. 7
     proved less helpful to assess the regulator’s performance given the internal and external
     environment.

     Implementation: The M&E and implementation arrangements were continuous throughout
     the preparation phase and contributed to the implementation of key reforms and the
     achievement of development objectives.
     
     Utilization: Given that the program was designed in the middle of the global financial sector
     crisis as a programmatic operation over a period of two years, systematic efforts were made
     with the authorities to define mostly quantitative indicators to facilitate monitoring.

            2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
     The Government of Montenegro remains committed to completing the substantial financial
     sector reform program implemented through the first PFSDPL operation. And whilst
     considerable progress has been made, the key follow-on reforms were tackled in the
     subsequent PBG operation. The Bank continues its high-level policy dialogue with key
     implementing institutions, namely the CBCG and MoF.
3.      Assessment of Outcomes
            3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation:
     Relevance of Objectives

     The objectives of the first PFSDPL are consistent with key priorities and expected outcomes
     supported under the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The FY11-FY14 CPS for
     Montenegro, endorsed by the Board in January 2011, envisages a series of two programmatic
     financial sector DPLs. The second operation, delivered in FY12 substantially as first
     envisaged, was converted from a programmatic DPL into a PBG to enable Montenegro to
     better meet its 2012 fiscal shortfall needs (Section 1.6). These two operations constitute over
     half of the CPS lending envelope and fall under the first of the two main CPS priority areas,
     namely ―support EU accession through strengthening institutions and competitiveness. The
     CPS clearly states that one of the key outcomes of the CPS is expected to be a stronger
     banking system governed by a modern regulatory framework and central institutions, which
     is more resilient to future shocks.

     The authorities gave priority to restoring depositor confidence and strengthening their
     supervisory and regulatory framework for the banking sector in order to bring it in line with
     international practices and EU directives, and thus make the sector better prepared for
     possible future shocks. These reforms are consistent with the Economic and Fiscal Program


                                                 17
for the three-year period that the Government was obliged to prepare as part of the EU
accession, starting from 2007. The need for a stronger regulatory and institutional framework
for the banking sector was also highlighted by the EC in its 2010 opinion on Montenegro’s
Application for Membership of the EU.

Relevance of Design and Implementation

The set of financial sector related reforms undertaken through the first PFSDPL and follow-
on PBG proved highly relevant to the authorities’ efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in the
financial sector, and are in line with the Government of Montenegro’s aspirations to join the
EU. Given the complexities of the reform measures adopted through both operations to
mitigate key financial sector vulnerabilities at a time of tremendous uncertainty within
Europe, the PDO remained relevant to the achievement of the outcomes.

Since the beginning of the crisis in the second half of 2008, the authorities have formulated
and delivered on a broadly coherent policy response aimed at restoring long-term
macroeconomic and financial sector stability, and encouraging a sustainable economic
recovery. The policy areas of the first DPL supported the mitigation of risk, which was
considerably heightened in the Eurozone during the project preparation phrase. Subsequent
adjustments to the PBG prior actions were rather few, and reflected the dynamic state of the
sector’s performance. In the fiscal area, to respond to the crisis and contain the widening
fiscal deficit, the Government undertook politically difficult expenditure cuts to expenditures,
including by privatizing selected state assets and concessions.

       3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
This ICR assesses the key expected results and outcomes at the end of the program, as shown
in the Program Document of the first operation, since there were no separate targets for each
operation and since they were in the end converted into single operations. As explained in
Section 2.1, most of the actions of the envisioned second operation were completed through
the PBG and thus they contributed to achieving the program targets although technically
PBG was a separate operation. Accordingly, the PBG will be assessed through a separate
ICR.

The key expected results and outcomes at the end of the program were to: (i) increased
confidence in the banking sector; (ii) enhanced ability of the CBCG to provide emergency
liquidity assistance; (iii) effective supervision of the banking system consistent with Basel
Core Principles; (iv) strengthened legal authority of the CBCG for resolution of problem
banks according to international and EU good practices; and (v) Prva Banka no longer poses
a systemic and fiscal risk. In sum, all the Prior Actions precedent to Board approval were
approved, and moreover, substantially all of the expected key outcomes were achieved
against the backdrop of unprecedented financial uncertainties arising from the Eurozone and
sharply declining economic growth in Montenegro.

Moreover, through this operation the authorities enacted a set of key legal and prudential
reforms, as laid out below, essential to the restoration of the depositors’ confidence, the sine



                                            18
qua non of financial stability, resulting in a sharp increase in deposits and to a lesser degree,
lending.

The first PFSDPL strengthened the banking sector, a critical pre-condition for sustainable
economic recovery and balanced private sector-led growth to a substantial extent, as
demonstrated by the achievement of virtually all of the expected outcomes, as summarized
below.

        1. Maintaining Market Confidence. Increase confidence in the banking sector is
reflected in the stabilization of bank deposits and the resumption of lending.

              Increased confidence in the banking sector leading to (targeted) positive
               annual growth in bank deposits in 2011 and 2012 of 1.5 percent and 9 percent,
               respectively, to gradually reach the pre-crisis (September 2008) level of
               deposits. The total decline in deposits from September 2008 to March 2011
               reached -23.3 percent).
              The decline of new lending has slowed, but it has not reached the targeted
               positive growth owing to the prolonged Eurozone financial crises and subdued
               Montenegro economic growth, which negatively impacted loan demand. The
               year-on year credit growth went from -8% in 2010 and 2011 to -5% in 2012 as
               healthier mid and small size banks have begun growing their loan books with
               new lending concentrated in consumer lending and SMEs as banks try to
               diversify their loan portfolios away from large enterprises.
        2. Strengthening the Liquidity Framework. through enhancing the ability of the
central bank to provide emergency liquidity assistance and critically, enabling banks to
maintain adequate liquidity during a period of prolonged stress.
              Between September 2008 and 2011, the banking sector lost almost 20 percent
               of its total deposits. The liquidity framework was strengthened and adequate
               liquidity maintained through passage of the Emergency Liquidity Assistance
               (ELA) reforms and banks’ improved liquidity position evidenced through the
               CBCG’s financial reporting. The system's liquid assets to due liabilities ratio
               went from a low 1.58 at the end of 2011 to 1.83 by the end of 2012.
       3. Assessing and Addressing Banking Sector Vulnerabilities through adoption of
new, more proactive prudential measures supported by the operation to improve the quality
of banks’ loan books and their capitalization levels.
              The quality of banks loan books varied considerably owing to their respective
               risk appetites and implementation of loan underwriting standards. Banks’
               overall NPLs rose to 21.0% at end-2010 before declining to 15.5% at end-
               2011 owing to the off-loading of NPLs by two leading banks. After which
               NPLs began to rise again to 17.6% at end-2012 with the prolonged economic
               slump of Montenegro, above the target of less than 8%.
              Banks’ overall capitalization remained above the targeted 12%, at 15% from



                                             19
               2008 until end-2012, when the overall ratio fell to 14.7%, during which time
               most banks were recapitalized by their parent groups.
        4. Enhancing the Regulatory Framework for the Banking Sector through
strengthening the CBCG’s legal authority to resolve problem banks in accord with EU good
practice, a key deterrent or consequence was established, though the BCP was not undertaken
as part of the envisaged FSAP.
              The CBCG’s legal authority to resolve problem banks was markedly enhanced
               through passage of the amendments featured in the prior actions, by inter alia,
               (i) clarifying the CBCG’s powers for remedial action; (ii) strengthening the
               interim administration process for problem banks; and (iii) providing the
               CBCG with improved instruments for resolution of problem and insolvent
               banks in a timely and least cost manner (100% achieved)..
              While a number of key regulatory reforms were adopted (see Section 2.2) an
               independent Basel Core Principles (BCP) assessment was not undertaken as
               envisaged to determine benchmark nearly 30 banking supervision and
               regulation principles to internationally accepted norms. Thus, with no source
               for a benchmarking, this narrowly defined outcome was not achieved.
      5. Restructuring of Problem Banks through the implementation of the Supervisory
Action Plan (SAP) at Prva Bank and the concurrent gradual withdrawal of central
government deposits, Prva Bank no longer poses a systemic risk. This is a material positive
outcome from the operation.
              The Ministry of Finance removed substantially all (eligible) deposits from
               Prva Bank by end-June 2012, with only about 1.5 million euro (or about 5%)
               remaining on account. Subsequently such deposits increased slightly by end-
               2012 and thereafter were reduced to about 900,000 euro (about 3%) by end-
               April 2013 (the target was 0%). Moreover, Prva Bank’s size was reduced as
               part of its mandated restructuring, rendering the bank no longer systemically
               important.
       3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance,
       achievement of PDOs):
Rating: Satisfactory

The first PFSDPL was a high-risk complex operation, developed in the midst of the
Eurozone sovereign debt crises. The project substantially delivered on the PDO,
strengthening the banking sector (through prudential and related means). The results
achieved were highly relevant, as owing to the close collaboration between the authorities
and project team throughout the preparation phase, Montenegro was successfully able to
avoid financial instability. This key outcome could not have been assured as the project was
prepared during a period of substantial external uncertainties.

The relevance of the first PFSDPL was high for both the CPS and government strategies and
the achievement of the objectives was substantial, as it strengthened the capacity of the


                                           20
supervisory authority to react in the event of a worse scenario and improved the resilience of
the financial systems. The overall outcome is rated as satisfactory.
       3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

There were no measured poverty impacts specifically related to this operation. Nevertheless,
the reforms proposed under this operation are expected to have overall positive poverty and
social impact. The deteriorating conditions in the economy, manifested in the banking sector
instability and the near collapse of the aluminum industry, are very likely to have adverse
effects on growth, employment, and poverty.

This operation would help mitigate the negative effects of the crisis on poverty as it aims to:
(i) increase the capacity of the financial authorities to anticipate and address risks in the
banking sector, thus avoiding a systemic crisis that could be very costly to depositors; (ii)
enhance the capacity of the financial authorities to deal with troubled banks and thus help
preserve taxpayers’ money; and (iii) facilitate the resumption in credit activities as economic
growth returns.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development):

The CBCG adopted a proactive posture with the onset of the Eurozone crisis, having
recognized the potential implications. In a bid to tackle one of the most pernicious effects of
the crisis, the CBCG has taken the initiative to develop a comprehensive, integrated approach
to NPL reduction, which is complex, resource intensive and time consuming. Loosely based
on the 1991 London Rules, the approach is designed to create an incentive based, voluntary
framework to support real (operational as well as financial) restructuring to return distressed
borrowers to financial health. However, it is not envisioned to come into full force before
2014.
As well, the CBCG continued to systematically work on harmonizing its bank regulatory
framework with relevant EU Directives and practices. This broad aim is crystallized through
the far-reaching set of Indicative Triggers agreed, which have been nearly all realized,
including the 2013 introduction of IFRS financial reporting and accounting standards.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

In 2012, the newly established Financial Stability Council (FSC) adopted a comprehensive
new confidential national crisis management framework. This framework develops crisis
contingency plans at the level of each of the three financial sector supervisors (CBCG, SEC
and FSA), the MoF and the Embedded in the framework is the PFSDPL prior action of a lex
specialis (or the draft Financial Stability Law) to replace the emergency anti-crisis Law on
Measures for Protection of the Banking System which expired at end-2009. The FSC
considered the enactment of a permanent law to replace the expired emergency anti-crisis
law, but felt that given the existing state of the banking sector, enacting a permanent law
could wrongly be interpreted by some to signal a lack of confidence in the system.


                                            21
   Instead, they opted to prepare a lex specialis -- but not submit it to Parliament until such time
   as they declared a financial crisis. If enacted, the lex specialis would grant the authorities
   additional powers to intervene in the financial system by providing liquidity and capital
   support. As a further positive impact from the FPFSDPL operation and follow on PBG, the
   CBCG has recently requested World Bank assistance to enhance their crisis management
   capacity through conducting a crisis simulation exercise in the second semester of 2013,
   which may yield more understandings of the efficacy of this arrangement.
          3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
          Workshops (optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):
   Not applicable.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Substantial

   Overall macroeconomic risks remain substantial given Montenegro’s high external
   vulnerability owing to the prolonged eurozone economic slump and regional environment in
   which the country operates. Slower than expected growth in Southeast Europe and the EU in
   2012 and year to date 2013 may dampen Montenegro’s recovery, which would further strain
   the fiscal stance.

   Slower recovery would affect the corporate sector performance and consequently the
   financial sector. Montenegro’s heavy reliance on tourism revenues and exports to Europe
   makes it vulnerable to prolonged deterioration in regional stability or slowdown of growth in
   the EU.

   Furthermore, the country’s euroization, high level of external debt and large debt service
   requirements over the medium term render the Montenegrin financial sector vulnerable to a
   slowdown in capital inflows and call for a continued prudent fiscal policy. Finally, given the
   size of the country, even a small shock may have a sizeable impact on the economy.

   Finally, thought there is no IMF program in Montenegro, the implementation of the ongoing
   acquis communitaire chapter negotiations with the EU will serve as a policy anchor in
   regards key economic, legal and financial reforms, similar to that of EU countries. The
   Government’s structural reform program that aims to increase competitiveness, will
   contribute to improved investor confidence in the medium-term.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation
   and outcome issues)
          5.1 Bank Performance
   (a)       Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through
   lending phase):

   Rating: Satisfactory




                                                22
The comprehensive design of this operation, developed over nearly two years, reflects a
robust, well thought out set of prior actions and key expected outcomes. The project design
benefited from frequent new guidance disseminated from the global financial crisis, e.g.,
from the’s new focus on macro-prudential oversight, defining a global liquidity standard and
identification of key attributes of a bank resolution regime, new EBA reporting standards and
capital requirements, EU draft Directives circulated for comment, etc.

It is noted that while a number of the Indicators chosen were of a high level (deposit growth,
credit growth, liquidity, capitalization, etc.) each represents a key dimension of public and
investor confidence in the financial sector. As such, this set of indicators served as a
reasonable proxy for continuing financial stability, essential to the ability of the banking
sector to fulfil its intermediation role. Considering both the large body of knowledge
promulgated in the midst of the crisis and the banking sector’s sharply deteriorating financial
performance during the project preparation phase, the quality at entry of the Bank is assessed
as Satisfactory.

(b)          Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank devised an effective approach to work with counterparts in the development of the
financial sector reform program. The Bank cooperated effectively with the Ministry of
Finance, which was the coordinator of activities on the Borrower’s side and maintained very
close cooperation with the CBCG.

The Bank assisted through a number of challenging reforms with persistence and delivering
high level support in all policy areas. By all indications, the counterparts in the Government
of Montenegro were very satisfied with the technical support and systematic approach to
reforms provided by the Bank Team.

Moreover, the task team monitored the country’s overall economic performance and the
timely adoption and effective implementation of the agreed program conditions. They also
validated the Borrower’s monitoring and evaluation findings on the progress and results of
program implementation. Further, the task team regulatory consulted and coordinated with
the IMF in carrying out its supervision work. Therefore, the quality of supervision has been
assessed as Highly Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance is rated Satisfactory since the Bank performance in both Ensuring
Quality at Entry and in Quality of Supervision were rated Satisfactory.
          5.2 Borrower Performance
      X     Check here if the Government and the Implementation Agency is the same or indistinguishable




                                                  23
   (a) Government Performance:

   Rating: Satisfactory

   The Government developed the institutional and regulatory framework to improve financial
   sector stability, strengthen the regulatory and supervisory regimes and public sector funds
   management. A significant number of major regulations and law amendments were
   introduced as a result of this operation. Cooperation with the Bank by the MoF and CBCG
   was very strong, with often difficult discussions as to specific reform measures. The
   authorities completed all PFSDPL prior actions, readily shared information with the Bank
   team and continue to implement reforms in a very difficult regional and domestic
   environment.

   The Government showed strong commitment to the consultation process, i.e., through
   consultation with stakeholders on important legislative amendments and regulatory reforms
   alike.
   The EU accession agenda and the unfolding Eurozone crisis together played a critical role in
   driving the pace of the reforms. In implementing agreed upon measures, the professionalism
   and dedication of the Government Team and CBCG counterparts proved to be determinant
   factors.

   (b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

   Rating: Satisfactory

   The performance of the Government and implementing agency, the CBCG, was deemed
   satisfactory as all the prior actions and key outcome indicators have been achieved on a
   timely basis.
6. Lessons Learned
   It is important to maintain sufficient flexibility, particularly in the case of programmatic
   policy development loans, to adapt and respond to client needs and economic realities in the
   country. As the external environment was rather negative during the preparation phase,
   adding a strong sense of urgency to the need to adopt financial sector related reforms, the
   team worked hard to build sufficient ownership of the many policy and regulatory changes.
   The conversion of the second DPL to a PBG, which significantly leveraged the Bank’s
   lending, was a direct result of the Montenegrin 2012 financing gap, as the prior actions were
   not significantly different.

   As well, the regular coordination with other partners combined with providing necessary
   technical assistance on a timely basis positively impacted outcomes achieved. Cooperation
   among international agencies (i.e. World Bank Group, IMF, KfW, EBRD) and with the EU,
   proved essential given that extensive technical assistance was being provided and needed to
   be coordinated and aligned with the country’s priorities and strategic goals.



                                              24
   This cooperation was underscored by the central role played by the Government of
   Montenegro through the Ministry of Finance and CBCG. Further, the reforms in the financial
   sector in which the Bank had a comparative advantage, were designed in cooperation with the
   IMF. The financial sector reforms have been also indirectly aided by investments in
   undercapitalized banks by the EBRD and the IFC.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
   (a) Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

   The CBCG's comments, as appended in Annex 4 are well considered and accepted; the single
   specfic concern as to the ICR regarded the statement in Section 1.4, which was removed.

   (b)     Cofinanciers:

   None.

   (c) Other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society):

   None.
