MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC RPUBIC OF   M CAR
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR INPRVMENT ROECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Health Sector
Improvement Project to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for 8DR 22.9
million (USS 31.0 million equivalent) la submitted for approval.   The
*        proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and
would help implement the government's policies and strategy in the health
sector and help refine the sector policy framework. The proposed project
would support the implementatlon of the national Health Sector Program (HOP),
element of which are also being supported by the UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO,
EDF, France, Germany and Switaerland.

2.   Health condition in Madagascar are very poor with high infant, child
and maternal mortality and morbidity. Comunicable tropical disease remain
a major source of untreated illness and preventable deaths. The Ministry of
Health (MMo) is the country's main provider of health care and operates a
network of about 2.200 health facilities dSrectly accessible to 65 percent of
the population and serving over 80 percent of the population through outreach
and community-based health programs. Over the past two decades its ability
to provide health care, including medical treatment, has been constrained by
inadequate budgetary resources. Coverage of care provided by KOe that
operate about 320 Xiilth facilities and by private providers is limited and
mostly benefits segments of the urban population with an ability to pay for
services. PopultiAo dynamlcs are characterised by fertility, birth and
death rates that are average by African standards and that reult in an
annual population growth rate approaching 3 percent.  Access to family
planning (VP) services is limiteds less than 3 percent of the women of
reproductive age use modern methods of contraception. Survey data point to
a large unmet demand for VP services In urban areas and to complications
arising from pregnancy terminations as a leading cause of maternal mortality
and morbidity.
3.   The government's bhea.b policy focusses on rehabilitating the basic
functions of its public health system. Policy and specific programming
proposals for 1992-96 are contained in the HSP prepared by the Mo! with
inputs from several donors, includlng IDA. The USP and the related public
expenditure program for health have been appraised by IDA and accepted by the
donor community. They constitute an appropriate package of priority health
activities that deserves donor support.
4.   The government's population policies are contained in a National
Population Law (NPL) promulgated in January 1991.  Its adoption by the
government and the National Assembly constitutes a major breakthrough
reversing former pro-natalist official policies. Major new features includes
(a) markedly lower national fertility targets to be attained by voluntary
means; (b) the right of couples to decide the timing and number of their
children and to have access to VP information and services; and (c) the
mandate given to the Mo! to dellver VP servlces. Abortions, except to save
the mother's life, remain illegal ln Madagascar.

Rationale for IDA Inolvement
S.   Madagascar hau reached the point in its structural adjustment process
where increasing attention needs to be focussed on improving the social
sector policy framework and implementation capacity to improve living
conditions and alleviate poverty. Under the Public Sector Adjustment Credit
No. 1941-NA  of 1988 the government prepared a  mcprehens se ha lth  sector
policy statement, which was developed into the g8P which defines the core
public health activities needed to attain the policy objectives.   The
proposed project would help the government implement the ReP by
rehabilitating the public health system to address the basic health needs of
the population efficiently. It would also support studies to define the next
phase  and to  develop  institutional mechanisms  for  fostering  private
sector/NG0 response as well as community and beneficiary participation in
efforts to meet the national helth objectives.  IDA involvement in the
implementation of the health sector strategy would ensure timely application
of the reforms and contribute to effective donor coordination.
The Health Sector Proaram
6.   The principal features of the ESP are: (a) delivery of comprehensive
communicable disease program  to control malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy,
sexually  transmitted diseases  (including  AIDS), and  the  plague,  and
establishment of a communicable di eae monitoring system; (b) introduction
and upgrading of FP services in at least 500 of MoH's clinics offering
primary health care (PUC); (c) improved delivery of PHC services, including
reasonable access to essential drugs in all the Hof's outpatient facilities;
and a strengthening of the capacity of intermediato and tertiary level
facilities to provide referral services for PHC care; and (d) the first phase
of a long term institutional development program toes (i) progressively
restructure and strengthen the KoHo's health delivery ystem, increase Its
efficiency and invite greater popular participation and (ii) strengthen the
MoB's policy formulation and sector programmig, monitoring and evaluation
capacity. The H8P with an estimated cost of about US$100 million over 1992-
96 does not cover the rehabilitation of the public hospital syetem or
preservLce paramedical training which are the other major components of the
public expenditure program for health. These needs will be studled and
implementation proposals prepared under the 5SP.
7.   Prospects for timely implementation of NSP have been enhanced by the
following measurees (i) presentation to the donor community in September 1990
of the HSP containing detailed proposals for rehabilitating Mo's service
delivery and institutional capacities; (ii) reorganisation in February 1991
of the central staff of Hof to addrees weaknesses flagged during the project
preparation process; and (iii) successful implementation during 1989-91 of
the emergency malaria control program under the Zeoncaic          et and
Social Action Project (BMWA1) (Credit No. 1967-MAG of 1988).
Project Obiectlves and Dpscrioton
s.   The proposed project ha  been designed to provide, within agreed
parameters, flexible support towards implementation of the ESP over the five
year period 1992-96. It will contribut to achieving national objectives of:
(a) reducing mortality and morbidity; (b) moderating fertility leveles
(c) improving the effLcieney and sustainability of public expenditures for
health, the sector policy framework and Lnstitutional coordination
mechanisms. By accolerating the integration of famlly planning services into
the basic aotivitioe of the publi health system, it would also contribute
significantly to implementation of the NPL adopted ln 1991. The desLgn of
the propose4 project calls for the X*o to prepare and IDA to review the
annual work progrms (see para. 10 below). The proceeds of the proposed
credit will be primarily directed to the malaria and plague control, disease

monitoring, family planning and institutional development programs (US$22.2
million equivalent); the balance of the proposed IDA credit would be used to
complement the financing of the other HSP components for which other donors
are providing inputs and assisting in coordinating.
Program and Proiect Cost
9.   The total cost of the HSP, net of duties and taxes, is estimated at
about US$100 million equivalent, with foreign costs of US$84 million and
local costs of US$16 million.  The proposed credit would support a project
with an estimated total cost of US$42.5 million equwivalent and with a foreign
exchange component of US$34.6 million (81 percent). A breakdown of costs, a
financing plan for the project and a summary of the use of IDA funds are
shown  in  Schedule  A.    Amounts  and  methods  of  procurmnt  and  of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule S.  A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in Madagascar are given in Schedules C and D. A Staff Appraieal
Report, No. 9417-MAG dated May 7, 1991 is being distributed separately.
Aareements Reached
10.  The Government has sent IDA a letter setting forth its objectLves,
policies and strategy in the health sector. This letter will serve as the
basis for reviewing the annual work programs and evaluatlng project
implementation. It has also been agreed that MoH woulds (a) by September 30
of each year, prepare an annual work program for implementing the HSP,
convene a donors meeting to review the work program and to firm up its
financing plan, and submit the fLnalized work program for IDA's review
together with revised lists of goods and services to be financed by the IDA
credit; (b) submit by September 30 of each year, a public expenditure program
for health for IDA's review; (c) submit acceptable proposals for iatroducLng
user charges on drugs as a condition for disbursing against an iaLtial stock
of essential drugs to be offered for sale through the X*H1 (d) undertake and
discuss with IDA the findings and reccamendatLons of a mid-term review of the
ISP and the project implementation before June 30, 1994, including an
assessment as to whether the strategies being followed are producing the
expected results, a proposal for the government's pharmaceutical policy and
a proposal for the development of the non-public sector activitLes in the
health sector.
Environmental ZmMact
11   The proposed project will have a positive impact on the human
environment.   It will involve the use of pesticLdes, mainly DDT for
controlling malaria transmision and deltametrine for controlling the plague.
No negative environmental impact from the use of pesticides is foreseen as
the amounts are small compared to pesticide usage in agriculture and the
areas to be treated are limited. DDT would be used as a resldual indoor
insecticide and carefully controlled to minimize any possible environmental
contamination; it does not constitute a health risk to humans. Deltametrine
belongs to a class of pesticides that do not present an environmental risk.
The project also provides for continuous training on safe application
techniques and surveillance of pesticide  use and manipulation.   The
guldelines for the selection and use of pesticldes in publlc health programs
in Bank flnanced projects have been followed in the preparation of the
project.
BMfLit
12.  The project will provlde  direct bonefits to  a  large  part of
Madagascar's population by reducing preventable deaths and illness episodes



4
and by offering women the full range of safe motherhood activities. The VP
component will also contribute towards the government's objectives of
reducing fertility levels, thereby reducing population preGsures on the land,
the environment and budgetary resources for flnancing soclal servLces. The
Lnstltutlonal reforms of the MoH are expected to lead to signifLcant
effllceney galns ln service dellvery and in the impact of public
expenditures. Studles would help prepare further adjustment of the health
sector policy framework a A contribute to the design of measures to improve
the sustainabillty of public expenditures for health and facilitate a better
definLtLon and coordinatLon of the roles and activities of the public and
prLvate sectors.
Risks
13.  Project impl emntation faces two major risks.  First, the demands of
deliverlng throughout Madagascar the entLre package of prlorlty activlties
spelled out in the HSP could strain the institutlonal capacity of Koff. This
rlsk is addressed through the reorganizatLon of MNo  central staff and the
appointment of senlor staff wlth recent field experLence to managerLal
positions, the deslgn of the lnstitutional development component includLng
the ratlonalizatlon of training programs and the mobilizatlon of technical
and adminLstratLve specialists. The preparation of annual work programs
allows for instltutional capacity considerations to be built into the
operational programs. Second, given the large number of donors involved in
the HSP there is a risk of delays in the commitment of external resources.
The creation and approprlate staffing of the Projects MonLtoring Unit, the
aid coordination mechanisms supported under the project, especLally the
agreements calling for the timely preparation of annual work programs and
their revlew at a donors meeting, and the access to IDA funds to complement
financiLg provlded by other donors serve to minimize this risk.
RecommendatLon
14. 1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply wlth the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
