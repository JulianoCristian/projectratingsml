Project\n            will expand the water supply service in the Borno State\n            capital, Maiduguri, to include some 74,000 people who are\n            presently not served by BSWB and to meet the demand of the\n            projected population of 543,000 by 1992. The project will\n            improve the quality of service and assist in strengthening\n            BSWB both financially and institutionally, through the\n            provision of technical assistance.  The project includes:\n            (a) a plant for the treatment of raw water from the Alau dam\n            and reservoir; (b) pumping and storage facilities; (c)\n            transmission mains and an improved distribution system.  It\n            further consists of; (d) headquarters buildings and\n            workshops; (e) generators, drilling rigs and vehicles; (f)\n            technical assistance; and (g) studies of sanitation in\n            Maiduguri and tariffs for the State.  A special account will\n            be established with part of the proceeds of the loan.  The\n            amounts advanced into this account will be used to\n            prefinance reimbursable local costs and small foreign expenditures."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
