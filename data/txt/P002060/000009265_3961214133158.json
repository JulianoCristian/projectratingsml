Nigeria. The main objectives of the project were: (a) to\n            provide adequate and reliable supplies of safe water to\n            Maiduguri from the Lake Alau dam and reservoir; (b) to\n            strengthen the Borno State Water Board by providing\n            technical assistance and training to enable it to undertake\n            the orderly future development and expansion of the\n            state's water supply program, and its efficient\n            operation, and to help it towards financial viability; and\n            (c) to provide the basis for effective sanitation in\n            Maiduguri through studies to be undertaken during project\n            implementation. Bank's performance was not\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (i) although provision\n            of safe and reliable drinking water to Maiduguri's\n            population is an important undertaking, the question whether\n            this was the right way to go about it must be asked at\n            project completion; (ii) the need for the institution to be\n            able to develop a realistic policy for connection of\n            consumers to the system, and a charging policy, in order to\n            enhance revenue, serve the maximum number of people, and\n            maintain affordability; and (iii) macro-economic conditions\n            can deteriorate rapidly through earlier unforseen\n            circumstances, jeopardizing the sustainability of a project."}, "docdt": "1996-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
