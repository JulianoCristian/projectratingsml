development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Lessons learned include: high level\n            commitment, both by the Bank and Government, is instrumental\n            in increasing effectiveness and speed of preparing emergency\n            operations. The design of the project, which rightly focused\n            on responding to the Government's short-term priority\n            and to the urgent needs of the beneficiaries, was a key\n            factor in the project's successful implementation.\n            There were substantial governance-related risks associated\n            with the procurement of a large amount of fertilizers.\n            Involving a competent third party, namely the CRC (Joint\n            Government-Donor Food Crises Committee), in the procurement\n            process and getting beneficiaries involved in critical steps\n            of the project cycle helped safeguard transparency and\n            ensured accountability. The project was used as an\n            opportunity to move forward the longstanding agenda for\n            developing safety nets in a country which definitely needs a\n            comprehensive and long-term response to recurrent food\n            crises and chronic food insecurity. Availability of\n            analytical work on risks and safety net schemes in Niger\n            facilitated the design and preparation of the operation."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
