Country and Sector Background 
 
Niger is a very poor country that faces many ha
rdships and struggles with significant levels 
of poverty and household food insecurity.
1
 
A Sahelian landlocked count
ry, Niger is confronted 
by a harsh climate, with nearly 90 percent of 
the territory receiving less than 350 mm rainfall 
annually, resulting in recurrent natural disasters 
and high exposure to climate change. With a per 
capita Gross National Income (
GNI) of US$260 and an estimate
d 62 percent of the population 
living below the poverty line, Niger is one of th
e lowest-ranked countries
 on the United Nations’ 
Human Development index. The incidence of pove
rty has remained constant since the early 
1990s, with approximately 85 percen
t of the population living on 
less than US$2 per day and 65 
percent living on less 
than US$1 per day.  
 
Low agricultural productivity
 and uncontrolled population 
growth make the country 
seasonally and chronically food insecure. Only
 10 percent of Niger’s territory, or 120,000 km
2
, 
benefits from rain-fed agriculture
. Agriculture in the rest of the 
country must be irrigated, though 
many farmers cannot afford to do so properly, leav
ing the country highly vulnerable to natural 
disasters (particularly drought).
 As a result, Niger remains 
highly dependent on subsistence 
crops, livestock systems and rain-fed agriculture, such as millet, sorghum, cowpeas, yams, 
manioc, and rice, which are cultivated along th
e Niger River and in lo
w-lying areas bordering 
Nigeria.  Meanwhile, in a context of declining 
rainfall and cyclical droughts, unsustainable land 
management practices abound, with communities ove
rexploiting natural resources in order to 
maintain or increase their level of production to
 feed a rapidly growing population (at a rate of 
3.3 percent a year). The result is soil depletion, 
loss of fertility, lower yields, and environmental 
degradation, which has progressively led to an
 environment-poverty nexus
 that contributes to 
increasing food insecurity and poverty.

Objectives 
 
The objective of the grant is to 
support the government efforts to
 mitigate the impact of food 
price crisis through: (a) increase of rice pr
oduction with procurement and distribution of 
fertilizers to rice producers at affordable pri
ces ; and (b) providing t
echnical assistance to 
enhance the capacity of the F
ood Crisis Prevention and Mana
gement Framework’s (FCPMF) 
coordination unit and executing agencies, for the 
management of the project and for improved 
monitoring of the country’s food security.

Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
The Bank’s strategy for this emergency support to
 Niger is aligned with the Government’s 
strategic approach and takes pl
ace in the context of the coor
dinated and joint donor framework. 
The response focuses on measures to address the 
short and medium to long term implication of 
the global food crisis for Niger, which is full
y consistent with the 
Bank’s Global Food Crisis 
Response Program (GFRP).  
The objectives of the GFRP are to: (i) redu
ce the negative impact of high and volatile food 
prices on the lives of the poor in a timely wa
y, (ii) support governments in the design of 
sustainable policies that mitigate the adverse imp
acts of high and more volatile food prices on 
poverty while minimizing the creation of long-term
 market distortions, 
and (iii) support broad-
based growth in productivity and market participa
tion in agriculture to ensure an adequate and 
sustainable food supply response. Intervention
s need to be rapid,
 include the poor and 
disadvantaged, and contribute to achievi
ng sustainable longer-run food security. 
2
 
The GFRP encompasses support for interventions
 in the following areas: (i) food price policy 
and market stabilization, (ii) 
social protection actions to ensu
re food access and minimize the 
nutritional impact of the crisis on the poor a
nd vulnerable, (i
ii) enhancing domestic food 
production and marketing response, and (iv) 
implementation support, communications and 
monitoring and evaluation. 
 
This support to Niger will focus primarily on in
creasing domestic production of rice at a 
critical time through faci
litating producer’s access 
to fertilizers, strengthen the country’s for 
prevention and management of 
food crisis. In parallel, th
e Bank’s strategy for supporting 
agriculture and rural development in Niger 
includes longer-term i
nvestments in rural 
infrastructure, including irriga
tion and rural roads, financed 
through regular Bank mechanisms 
(IDA credits and grants), and also includes 
two new investment operations in FY09 to 
complement these efforts, including an Agro-p
astoral Export Promotion 
and Irrigation Operation 
(PRODEX) and the second phase of th
e Community Action Program (CAP 2).

Description 
 
The project will have two components: 
 
Component I: Procurement of Fertilizers (US$6.5 million)
: The component will support costs 
associated with the urgent pr
ocurement of 4,000 metric tons 
of fertilizers (urea and di-
ammonium phosphates) to be used on 10,000 ha of
 irrigated rice in the 
current cropping season 
starting in July 2008 and ending in December 2008. If delivery is delayed due to any reasonable 
reason, use of fertilizers may be reported for th
e upcoming counter-season starting in February 
2009 and ending in June 2009.  Fertilizer will be
 procured by the Ministry of Agriculture 
Development’s Inputs Procurement Division (
Centre d’Approvisionnement,
 CA) using agreed 
upon procedures under the National Food Crisis
 Prevention and Management Framework 
(FCPMF) in July and August 2008. 
Fertilizer will be de
livered to rice produc
ers at affordable 
price using CA’s current subsidy policy (a 30 to 
40 percent subsidy for fertilizer). The grant will 
support incremental operating costs of CA a
nd CCA (the Food Crisis Coordination Unit) 
associated with the procurement and the distribution of fertilizers. 
Component II: Support to the National F
ood Crisis Prevention and Management 
Framework (US$0.5 million)
: This component will (a) contribute to strengthening the CCA, as 
the permanent secretariat for the FCPMF, to manage the grant and monitor and evaluate the grant 
funded activities. Those activ
ities include the monito
ring of targeting elig
ible beneficiaries of 
fertilizers procured and distributed under the 
grant, and adequate information disclosure 
regarding the distribution process. The project 
will also support technical assistance under this 
component to CCA, CA and the Office 
of National Food Security Stocks (
Office des Produits 
Vivriers du Niger, OPVN
) and The national Irriga
tion Development Office (
Office National des 
Aménagements Hydroagricoles
, ONAHA); (b) ensure adequate
 monitoring of food security, 
including accurately 
and timely reporting on 
food prices across the 
country and along  the 
borders with Nigeria; (c) support management 
of grain storage and ea
rly identification of 
population and areas at risk of 
starvation; (d) support the design
 of safety net programs to 
permanently tackle food insecurity affecting 20 pe
rcent of the population in Niger; and (e) ensure 
close advisory services to cooperatives and ri
ce farmers during the two successive irrigation 
campaigns covered by the project. This would in
clude providing basic instructions on proper use 
of fertilizers, as well as ade
quate quantities of application.

Implementation 
 
The project will be implemented using th
e existing FCPMF institutional set-up, which 
includes the joint Government-Donor Committee (
Comité Restreint de Concertation Etat-
Donateurs
, CRC) and the CCA which it oversees. As part
 of the FCPMF, three facilities have 
been created: The Donor Basket Fund (
Fonds Commun des Donateurs
, FCD) which receives 
Page  4
donors financial contribution; the Food Security F
und (FSA), which is fed by the FCD and direct 
contributions from bi-laterals 
and whose purpose is limited to
 buying and distributing food 
during crises; and the National Food Security 
Stocks (SNS) which re
ceives in-kind donations 
and may also be replenished with funds from 
the FSA. The CCA is responsible for managing 
FCD and FSA while OPVN manages the SNS. 
 
The grant will be entirely disbursed to th
e FCD. The CCA will be the managing body. CCA 
will contract out to CA for the procurement 
of fertilizer. Capacity-building activities under 
Component 2 will require a longer imple
mentation period than Component 1.

From an environmental and so
cial safeguard point of view
, the Niger Emergency Food 
Security Support Project is a Category B project. 
 That is, the environmental and social impacts 
of the project, for the most part
, are expected to be minimal, si
te-specific and manageable to an 
accepted level. Two safeguard policies are trigge
red: The Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 
4.01) and the Pest Management 
Policy (OP 4.09).  The latter is 
triggered based on project’s 
objectives to boost agricultural pr
oduction and productivity through 
purchase of large quantities 
of fertilizers to be distributed to farming communities. 
9.
 
The existing Environmental and Social Ma
nagement Framework (ESMF) and the Pest 
Management Plan (PMP) prepared for the Sec
ond Irrigation Promotion Project (PIP2) will be 
adapted to the project and will be reviewed 
and approved by ASPEN and disclosed in-country 
and at Bank Infoshop, in accordance with Bank and National policies by the project, within six 
months of grant effectiveness.  However, in
tensive supervision will
 be provided commencing 
with the first supervision after sign
ing to ensure the safe use of fer
tilizers and support to farmers.   
10.
 
 The ESMF covers the guidelines and procedur
es for environmental and social screening, 
designed to help avoid, minimize or mitigat
e impacts resulting from unbalanced use of 
agrochemicals, such as eutrophication in ir
rigation canals and downstream waterways, and 
irrigation- specific impacts, su
ch as water logging, salinizati
on, and water-bor
ne or related

By supporting the proposed pr
oject, the Bank does not intend to prejudice th
e final determination of the parties' claims on the
 
disputed areas
 
Page  5
diseases.  The ESMF also discusses instituti
onal arrangements for implementing and monitoring 
safeguard measures, along with 
any capacity strengthening and 
awareness raising measures 
deemed necessary for relevant stakeholder grou
ps. The ESMF is considered both as a planning 
tool and as a way to maximize the positive effects of this operation.
