education and training sector reform and\n            will assist the Government in carrying out reform activities\n            during this phase. The objectives of the reform program are\n            to make the provision of education more consistent with the\n            country's medium-term development needs, more\n            equitable, and more cost effective. The loan will support\n            these objectives by financing a core set of high-priority\n            investments. These include: (i) rehabilitation of primary\n            and secondary schools; (ii) construction of school canteens;\n            (iii) construction of new upper basic education schools;\n            (iv) distribution of educational materials and reading\n            books; and (v) technical assistance to improve the quality\n            of programs and the efficiency of educational management.\n            The loan will also finance the development of sector\n            specific vocational training centers in collaboration with\n            industry associations."}, "docdt": "1989-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
