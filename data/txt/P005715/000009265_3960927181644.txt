1.       The following memorandum and recommendatlotn04  proposed loan to the
Republic of Tunisia for US$95.0 million equivalent i  submitted. for approval.
The proposed loan would provide investment finance for th8 èducctipis and
training reform program prepared by the Government with Bank assistance, and
help the authorities implement pollcy changes iutitàti lu88.  The loan
would have a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, at `theîstandard
variable interest rate.
2.       Backaround.  The Tunisian Government l8 contiagü'i i`t` ecnnomie
adjustment program with a new e*phasl , on reform in thle hmn  ,roe8utcos,'
sector. A major concern for the -gvovrnment la the cont$nutng di- l.evai 0f
unemployment (over 14 percent in 19U8') despite significant 4e`*e`8'tie
price of labor relative to capital in the last five yearae  iThe ,comic
adjustment progrnm la likely to increase unempleyment in t1e soett term' »'s I
reduces the size of the public sector.  In the medium an4 long-ter,  *   "',
demand for labor ahould increase as grovth accelerates, and the lEpact\of\$at
and prêsent family planning efforts ahould moderate tlhe supply of labê* &' e`        ''
same time as enhanced education and training setvices laprove the pr, dî. bf
the labor force and it9 responsiveness to changing'demand condition..
3.       Tuaisia has undertaken a massive effort since 1956 to develop its
humma resources, paylng special attention to family velfare, education, and:'
training.  As a renult, from the'early 19609 to 1985, Infant mortality vas
more than halved from almost 160 to 60 per thousand, life expectancy at birth
rose from 48 to 62 years, and adult literacy rates increased from 15 percent
to 62 percent.  An active fam$ly planning policy, long supported by the Bank,
led to a decline in birth rates of 27 percent between 1965 and 1985. '
Mortality also declined by 45 percent, and population growth is still about
2.5 percent a year.  The young age structure of the population, together with
the increasing entry of vomen into paid vork, caused the labor force to grov
at 2.8 percent a year in the mid-1980s.
4.       The education and training system is called upon to play a major role
in responding to the challenge of a rapidly, changing economy. The
Government*s export driven growth strategy places a prealum on the
avallability of a highly skilled and vell educated labor force.  At the oame
timee tatense vorld market competition - in particular the development of a
very active £BC market - and rapid technological change require the best
possible use of human potential. Iu order to be internationally competitive
in the next century, Tunisia needs a labor force vith much higher levelas of
mastery of math, science and language skillî than la presently the case.
There la an urgent need to step up investments in education ad training to
enhance the broad cognitive and problem solving skills and personal qualities
that make vorkers trainable and more productive.  The Goverament la cmmitted
to a major improvement of the education and training system, at the same time
as it reinforces lts family planning services.
5.       Despite remar' ble quantitative achievements in primary education
(99 percent of the 6 year olds are enrolled in grade 1), there are st1li



-2 -
serious shortcomings. Only 1 ln 3 chlldren goes beyond grade 6, 1 ln 5 goes
beyond grade 9, and 1 in 20 progresses to higher education. -The internal
eff$ciency of the education system is seriously impeded by a lack of
facllities in the lover gtades of secondary education, and by the relatively
poor quality of education programs. Repetition rates are high (between 20 and
30 percent), and a sizeable number of children who drop out during primary
education vill lapse back to llliteracy. The Minlstry of Education (MEN) has
offered varlous vocational education programs, but ln practice these do not
prepare students for specific jobs. The type of labor force necessary for
Tunisia's expott development strategy requires the teaching of problem-
solving akills up to a level that cannot be attained in six years. A key
prerequisite for broadenlng individual employment options and improving labor
force productivity is access to an expanded and reinforced cycle of basic
schooling (grades 1 through 9), whether it is folloved by further formal
education, formal and non-formal vocational training, or direct entry to the
labor force.
6.       In upper secondary schools (grades 10-13) there la a need to revamp
course offerings, update programs and enaure complementarity between technical
education offered by KEN and the vocational training programs run by the
Vocational Training and Labor Office (OCM ). The OFPE vocational training
systenm e hampered by weak labor market linkages and is not geared up to the
production of highly skilled labor that the economy requires. Shortages of
ekilled and technical maupover, particularly technicians, may inhibit the
Government'a effort to restructure the Tunisian economy and blunt the export
drive. The skill distribution of the work force i characterized by a
remarkably  'v share of higher-level professionals and even fewer mid-level
technicians. Production line technicians and senior technicians represent
only 3 percent of the total number of people employed la all branches of the
economy. Moreover, there le an urgent need to develop or adapt progrmam on
the basis of up-to-date labor market signale. Greater employer involvement in
program definition, skill certification, and management and financing of
training institutions is alo highly desireable.
7.       Policy measures and Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government
has decided to engage ln far-reaching reforma of the education and trainin8
system.  This refomn program has been prepared vith Bank assistance and in
collaboration with local, regional and national administrations, and extensive
consultations vith teachers and parent teacher associations have taken place.
These reforme will be introduced ln two phases. The firet phase of the
reforma, which will be supported by the proposed loan, i designed to rake the
education and training system more consistent vith the country's medium-term
development needs, more equitable and more coat-effective. It vould do this
through three major policy changes: (i) allocation of a larger share of
resources to a self-contained basic education cycle of sound quality (grades
1-9); (ii) improvement in the quality and relevance of secondary education
(grades 10-13), while better controlling accesa to it; and (iii) promotion of
pre-service and ln-service training in collaboration vith companies ln the
productive sectors, and mobilization of additional resources for training.
The content and timing of the specific reform measures, prepared jointly with
the Bank over the past year and reviewed at appraisal, are detailed in a
supplemental letter. The second phase of the reforma would introduce measures
related to hi8her education access and financing. This second phase le nov
being prepared for extensive political consultations, also in collaboration
with the Bank. In parallel wvth the proposed sector loan, the Goverument and
the Bank are also discussing a set of inscitutional and policy reforme aiming
at liberalizing labor markets and improving labor mobility. The Bank



-3-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~3
involvement in the education/training sector has been instrumental in
developing the reforme being introduced Izn Tunisia.  Conut~ued Bank support in
necessary to complete the design of the reform program and implement it over a
sequence of several years. These major structural changes in the human
resources pollcy framework vill complement, by significant shifts in
efficiency of human capital investment, the overall country strategy which is
to maximize efficiency of Institutions and investments sad fuel the process of
economic growth throu8h liberalization.
8.       Proiect DescriDtiQn.  The agreed reform program generates the need
for major investments in education and trainin8 infrastructure, teaching
materials, and related software. The Bank has reviewed the proposed
investment program il detail and agrees with its main parameters a14 vith the
design, costing and phasing of all its major elements. The proposéd project
consista of two parts. The firet part, with the Ministry of Education, would
cover 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the agreed investment
program for the five years covered by the proposed loan (1990-1994). This
would cover the following investments: (i) rehabilitation of some 1,600
primary and 330 secondary achools; (il) construction and equipment of 800
echool canteens; (iii) construction and equipment of some 130 nev upper basic
education achools (grades 7, 8 and 9); (iv) distribution ot books and
educational materials on the basis of pedagogical improvement plans; and
(v) technical assistance for improving the quality of education and the
effi-elency of education management. The second part, with the Office of
Vocational Training and Labor (OFPE), vould provide civil works, equipment and
technical assistance, for the development of sector specific vocational
training centers in collaboration with industry associations and based on a
sub-project approach.
9.       Cost and Financin.  The total cost of the project with
contingencies, net of taxes and duties, i estimated at US$183.0 million
equivalent with a foreigu exchange cost of $95.0 million. The Bank loan of
US$95.0 million would cover about 52 percent of total project coste and
100 percent of the foreigu exchange cost. Local conte in the amout of
US$88.0 million would be financed from the investment budget. Retroactive
financing of up to US$4 million (4 percent of the loan amouat) would be
allowed to cover eligible expenditures lncurred after January 1, 1989. A
breakdown of project costs and the financlng plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amouats and methode of procurement and the diabursement achedule ate shown lu
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the statue of Bank Group
operations in Tunisia are given in Schedules C and D respectively.  The staff
appraisal report No. 7696-TUN, dated April 6, 1989, la being distributed
separately.
10.      Aareed Actions.  During negotiations, the Goverument provided
assurances that: (a) the policy measures, sumarized in para. 7 and detailed
in a supplemental letter containing a matrix of specific targets and actions,
would be implemented vithin the time frame specified and every year the
Government and the Bank vould jointly monitor the progress achieved in the
reform program, and the proposed investment and recurrent budgets for the next
year, including the level of non-salary expenditures; (b) Om  would prepare
sub-projects related to the development of sector-specific training centers in
accordance with agreed criteria and provide the Bank with detailed appraisal
reports for approval of each individual sub-project; (c) MEU would distribute
books and educational materiala on the basis of pedagogical improvement plans
prepared by individual schools, using agreed criteria; (d) no later than
December 1990, a preventive maintenance plan for all ME! achools, desigued



-4, 
vith tho assistance of experts, vould be ready for implementation and
thereafter all MN*'s achools vould bè maintained adequately; (e) no later than
December 31, 1993 an evaluation study vould be completed to assess the
quantitative and the qualitative impact of the proposed refor program as wei.a.
as its organisation and finances; and (f) tvo Project Coordinators (one each
for MEN and O0MF) vould be maintained for tt. duration of the project under
ierms of reforence acceptable to the Bank.
11.      Benefita.  The education reform progrua supported by the proposed
loan is expected to yield very significant development benefits for the
country.  The reform program vould restructure education and training in
Tunisia so that a auch larger number of children vould benefit from a solid
foundation ot education and training helping prepare them for active careers
in a faut- cbanaing economy. It vould reorient the system izi favor of basic
education und vould improve the quality and efficiency of educational inputs.
At the saDe time, collaborative training vith industry associations vould be
promoted. Thlis vould make training programa more jot-related and vould make
young people more employable. Quantitative benefits include an increase in
the number of students enrolled in upper basic education of 123,000 *ver the
1992-1996 Plan and 152,000 over the 1997-2001 Plan and a decrease in the
number of dropouts, in grade 1 through 9 of 104,000 and 124,000 respectively.
A portion of the additional coste neceseazy to finance the expansion at the
level ot grades 7, 8 and 9 vould be offset by a decrease in the number of
atudents in primary education due to improved effticiency rates. The total HEu
recurrent budget is projected to grov at an average yearly rate of 3.2 percent
ia real terma aud ite s"are of total Govermaent budget vould remain -t its
eurrent level of about 2S percent.
12.       Jiàa.  The refora program also entails soue risks.  The first risk
is that some teachers way reslst the introduction of nev educational methode
and in particular the utilisation of diagnostic testing and remedial
instruction. Th< improevments ln pre- and In-service training for teachers
should go a long vay to ensure acceptance of the nov methode. The second risk
is that mexpected pressures on the goverment budget may reduce the scope for
sustaining the mteady increame in investment allocations the sector program
calls for amd vhieh Pariament bas already expresuly approved. This could
810wv tow the itplementation of the reforma, although the proposed loan
financing safeguarda the met critlcal softvare expmenditures aimed at building
varitus quality iUprovemmnts into the achool systea. Finally, the Government
may face opPosition to the next phase of the refora process, complementary to
these basic education reforma, involving limitations on free accesa to the
upper levels of the uducation and training syste. Hovever, the Tunisian
public is increasingly avare of the trade-offa iin this area amd Goverument i8
adamant that the refor prcgram vill progroes steadily on track, as has indeed
been the case vith all past reform comitments made by Tunisia vithin the
adjustuent proceas.
13.      Recomendti    1 au satisfied that the proposed loan vould comply
vith the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
