          Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Excellency,
     We refer to the Loan Agreement, dated June 30, 1989, in
respect of the above-referenced project, entered into by and between
the Republic of Tunisia (the Borrower) and the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.
      Pursuant to your request dated February 6, 1991, the purpose
of this letter is to amend the provisions of Part C, paragraph 1 of
schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement to read as set forth hereinbelow.
          "Civil works and furniture may be procured under
          contracts awarded on the basis of competitive bidding,
          advertised locally, in accordance with the Borrower's
          applicable procedures, provided however, that: (i) no
          preference shall be granted for the purposes of bid
          comparison to any group of bidders; (ii) all bidders
          shall be treated equally in terms of the requirements of
          furnishing bid and performance securities; and (iii)
          bids shall be opened in public. Civil works contracts
          not exceeding $20,000 per contract and up to an
          aggregate amount not exceeding $8,000,000 may be
          procured under contracts awarded on the basis of
          comparison of price quotations solicited from at least
          three contractors eligible under Guidelines, in
          accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank."
     Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by
