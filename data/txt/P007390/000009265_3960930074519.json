strategy requires measures that will provide a stable\n            economic environment to increase domestic savings, and a\n            price incentive system which will maximize private sector\n            investment in export-oriented and efficient\n            import-substitution activities. Maintaining sound monetary,\n            exchange rate and fiscal policies under a stabilization\n            program will be fundamental to the success of adjustment\n            policies required for long-term growth. The major elements\n            of such a program will include: (a) a continuing reduction\n            of the public sector deficit; (b) a reduction in inflation\n            to international levels; (c) full liberalization of domestic\n            interest rates; and (d) a freely floating exchange rate\n            regime. The principal areas of the medium-term adjustment\n            policy agenda include: (a) further reform of public\n            enterprises; (b) rationalization of the price incentive\n            framework; (c) measures to reduce poverty through social\n            sectors reform; and (d) prudent management of the\n            country's natural resources and environment."}, "docdt": "1991-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
