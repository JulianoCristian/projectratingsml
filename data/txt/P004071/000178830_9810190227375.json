consisting of an embankment, a concrete sluice and a\n            navigation lock; (b) construction of a sea dike; (c)\n            construction of 16 pumping stations to serve the land to be\n            reclaimed and developed; (d) construction of main and\n            secondary canals; (e) reclamation of tidal land through land\n            leveling and construction of canals, drains and farm roads;\n            (f) land development comprising land consolidation of\n            existing paddy, conversion of upland to irrigated paddy,\n            development of upland for irrigation, and tertiary canals\n            and drains on existing paddy; (g) construction in the\n            project area of the office buildings, warehouses, access\n            roads and a temporary pier required for the construction of\n            the estuary dam; and (h) provision of the services of\n            consultants to assist in project implementation and in\n            preparation of feasibility studies for future development\n            stages on the Yong San Gang Basin."}, "docdt": "1977-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
