and efficient national system of tax\n            administration. The project will create the infrastructure\n            needed to collect and process intended tax revenues at\n            reasonable cost and speed from an expanding tax base. The\n            specific objectives of the project are: 1) to modernize tax\n            administration in two regions (Nizhny Novgorod and\n            Volgograd) with about 110 local offices through\n            reorganization of structures and procedures, automation and\n            staff training; and 2) to assist in the institutional\n            development of tax administration by building the capacity\n            of the State Tax Services, preparing for nationwide\n            implementation of tax administration reforms, and providing\n            product management support. To achieve these objectives the\n            project will finance: expert services (both Russian and\n            international); staff training; acquisition of hardware and\n            software; and minor improvements of offices to accommodate computerization."}, "docdt": "1995-02-15T00:00:00Z"}
