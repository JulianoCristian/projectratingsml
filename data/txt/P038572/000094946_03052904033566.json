concurs with the\n            Implementation Completion Report's assessment of\n            satisfactory project outcome, substantial institutional\n            development impacts, and satisfactory performances both by\n            the Bank, and the Borrower; however, downgrades\n            sustainability from highly likely, to likely only. Lessons\n            demonstrate that ownership can be engendered at local\n            levels, suggesting institutional reforms, particularly in\n            regionally diversified countries, are more successful if\n            implemented through regional pilots, with the judicious\n            support of higher levels of Government. However, such\n            judicious practice best succeeds if integrated,\n            comprehensive, and complementary reforms are manageable with\n            the complexity, and risks of reform itself. In addition, it\n            is important to appropriately manage change, specifically\n            regarding the introduction of large-scale computerization,\n            and associated software development, prior to substantial\n            hardware investments; and in particular, careful attention\n            should be given in adapting the Bank procurement procedures\n            to the relatively unpredictable, but critical process of\n            customized software development."}, "docdt": "2003-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
