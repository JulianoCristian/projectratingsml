The project was successful in achieving its\n            physical objectives, but less so in achieving its\n            institutional goals. The project fell short of achieving two\n            of its objectives: (i) enforcement of axle-load regulations,\n            which was ineffective as controls were carried out only\n            sporadically, and (ii) appropriately funding highway\n            expenditures, which was not periodically reviewed to ensure\n            compliance with sound economic policies and criteria. The\n            main lessons drawn from the project are: 1) the importance\n            of predicting financial difficulties due to macro-economic\n            instability, high inflation and poor sector performance.\n            Project designers should assess financial risks to the same\n            degree as any other project risk and take them into account\n            in defining project scope and implementation schedules; 2)\n            the importance of avoiding an excessive number of studies\n            and/or overwhelming technical assistance, taking into\n            consideration government commitment to reform, absorptive\n            capacity of the executing agency, as well as the limited\n            capacity and resources of the Bank to effectively supervise\n            the technical assistance components; such aspects should be\n            considered explicitly up front; 3) the importance of\n            continuity, both of government and Bank staff in charge of\n            the project; in this particular case, their absence bears a\n            share of the responsibility for the difficulties experienced\n            by the project; 4) the importance of relating the frequency\n            of supervision missions to the difficulties developed by the\n            project, rather than to a predetermined standard; and 5)\n            axle-load control: on strong pavements and good road\n            condition, enforcement of axle load regulations using\n            obsolete technology (static and manually-operated weighing\n            stations) may not be an appropriate policy."}, "docdt": "1996-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
