Management Project -\n            Sao Paulo seeks to assist the Roads Department in Sao Paulo\n            State (DER-SP) in the implementation of selected components\n            of its 1987-1990 expenditure program and, through supporting\n            institutional reforms, aims to help improve the efficiency\n            of administration to achieve more effective management of\n            the State transport system.  To that end, the proposed\n            project comprises:  (i) civil works for the rehabilitation\n            and periodic maintenance of State highways and associated\n            consultant services for engineering design and construction\n            supervision; (ii) equipment rehabilitation; (iii) a training\n            program; and (iv) technical assistance for studies related\n            to State transport policy, planning and operations, and\n            highway management and research. Quantifiable project\n            benefits will accrue to the economy at large, through\n            vehicle operating costs savings.  In addition, intensified\n            staff training and other institutional measures supported by\n            the technical assistance are expected to improve the overall\n            efficiency of the management and operations of the State\n            transport sector and, in particular, the highway subsector."}, "docdt": "1987-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
