To that end, the proposed\n            project comprises:  (i) civil works for the rehabilitation\n            and periodic maintenance of State highways and associated\n            consultant services for engineering design and construction\n            supervision; (ii) equipment rehabilitation; (iii) a training\n            program; and (iv) technical assistance for studies related\n            to State transport policy, planning and operations, and\n            highway management and research. Quantifiable project\n            benefits will accrue to the economy at large, through\n            vehicle operating costs savings.
