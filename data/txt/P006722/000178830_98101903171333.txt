REPORT AND RECO14EaNDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE (EXCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO INTERCONExION ELECTRICA S. A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPJBLIC OF COLOnBIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$52.3 million
to Interconexion mlectrica, S.A. (ISA) for the Chivor Hlydroelectric
Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Bank has contributed to the financing of power development
in Colombia for twenty years, concentrating on the systems serving the
cities of Bogota, Cali, Medellin and Manizales. Thirteen loans with an
aggregate initial principal amount of about US$216 million have been
made to these four systems, which presently produce some two-thirds of
all the electric power generated in the country. A study completed in
1964 showed that interconnecting these regional systems to create a
national system would result in significant economies by permitting
the deferral of some investments and the more rapid utilization of
others. ISA was created in September 1967 as a vehicle for this
interconnection and for developing and operating major new generating
plants required by the interconnected system. ISA's first project was
a network of transmission lines and substations which is presently
under construction with the assistance of Bank financing under Loan
575-CO. ISA and the Government have now requested Bank financing for
the proposed Chivor Hydroelectric Project, ISA)s first venture in the
field of power generation.
3.        A Bank mission appraised the proposed loan during August-
September 1969, and negotiations were held in Tlashington during March
16 - 19, 1970. ISA was represented by the General Manager, Dr.
Piedrahita, by the Administrative Sub-1Manager, Mr. Calder6n, and by
officials of its principal shareholders: Mr. Borrero (Empresa de Energia
El6ctrica de Bogot&), Mr, Aristizabal (Empresas PIublicas de Medellin),
Mr. Zuleta (Instituto Colombiano de Energ{a El6ctrica) and Mr. Mazuera
(Corporacion Aut6noma Regional del Cauca). The Colombian Government
was represented by Mr. Barrera of the National Planning Department.

4.       The proposed loan, which would be the forty-second made to
Colombia, would increase the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to
US$709.1 million (net of cancellations), of which US$485.7 million is now
held by the Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for high-
ways in Colombia. The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and
IDA credits to Colombia as of April 30, 1970:

In addition to the loans listed above, the Executive Directors approved
on May 12, 1970, a loan of US$6.5 million to the Republic of Colombia
for the Second Education Project and a loan of US$32 million to the
Republic of Colombia for the Sixth Highway Project.
5.      The status of disbursements on loans is described in paragraph 5
of my Report and Recommendation on the loan for the Second Education
Project (P-799), dated April 30, 1970.
6.      IFC has made 34 investments and underwriting commitments in
seventeen enterprises in Colombia totalling US$17.9 million (net of
cancellations).
PART II " DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.      Borrower:                   Interconexi6n Electrica S.A.
Guarantor:                  Republic of Colombia.
Shareholders and            Empresa de Energia mlectrica de

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.      A detailed description of the Project-is given in the attached
report, entitled "Interconexi,on Eaectrica S.A.; Chivor Hydroelectric
Project - Colombia" (FPU-31a).
9.      At the end of 1968, the total installed generating capacity in
Colombia was 1,940 )tOJ, including 250 14W in privately owned plants.
In the last 12 years, energy demand has increased at an average annual
rate of 11 percent, which is expected to be maintained, if not exceeded,
in the next decade. To correct a tendency towards fragmented, small-
scale development, powxer plants are now being grouped in six zones,
wjhich-will eventually be interconnected by high voltage transmission
lines.  This is expected to permit the realization of economies of
scale through the construction of larger plants. The keystone for this
development will be the system of the proposed Borrower and executing
agency, Interconexi6n Electrica S.A. (ISA).
10.     These developments have been accompanied by substantial im-
provements in power tariff policy. In December 1968 the Government
instituted the Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos to
regulate public utility tariffs so as to permit reasonable returns on
revalued assets and the orderly financing of expansion. Rates have
been regulated at adequate levels in the larger companies; and it is
hoped that rates will in due course become more remunerative for the
smaller companies as a result of the work of the Junta.
11.     ISA, a stock company, was established in 1967. Its principal
shareholders are the major power companies of Colombia, namely Empresa
de Energia El6ctrica de Bogota, Empresas PNblicas de Medell:tn, Corpo-
racion Aut6noma Regional del Cauca and Instituto Colombiano de Energia
Electrica. ISA's purposes are to interconnect the electric systems of
its shareholders and to construct, own and operate major new generation
plants required by the interconnected system. The Bank and joint
lenders participated in the financing of ISA's first project consisting
of a network of transmission lines and substations presently under
construction and expected to be completed by mid-1971 (Loan 575-CO).
12.     By mid-1975, ISA's interconnected system will need a major
addition to generating capacity in order to meet the rapidly growing
demand. The evaluation of several alternative generation programs
by ISA and its consultants, and by the Colombian National Planning
Department, indicates that the construction of the Chivor Hydroelectric
Project would be the most suitable and economical means to meet this
need. The Bank concurs in this judgment. The Project would be located
about 120 km northeast of Bogota, It would have an ultimate capacity of
about 1,000 MW. The proposed loan would help finance the first stage,
of 500 NW which is to be started in 1970 and come into commercial
operation in mid-1975. The annual generation of the plant in an average



hydraulic year would be 3,477 GTqh. The Project wou14 include a dam on
the Bata River, a pressure tunnel and penstock, a powerhouse on the
Lengupa River, and a 230 KV transmission line, 130 km long, to link
the Chivor plant with the interconnection network.
13.       The total construction cost of the Project is estimated at
US$114.2 million, excluding interest during construction, with a
foreign exchange component of about US$65.7 million. The proposed
Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange cost of the civil works
contracts, minor equipment orders, engineering and interest and other
charges on the loan amounting to US$9.4 million. ISA will arrange
bilateral financing for the foreign exchange costs of the major
equipment orders; it is expected to have no difficulty in obtaining
this financing on suitable terms in time to carry out the Project as
scheduled. The local currency cost of the Project, and the interest
charges during construction on the bilateral credits, would be financed
by the four sponsors in proportion to their agreed participation in
the output of Chivor.  The financial plan of each principal shareholder
indicates that this financing is feasable. Two shareholders depend in
part on Government financial support; satisfactory assurances have been
received that the necessary Government funds will be provided. Earnings
of ISA are estimated to cover interest on its debt about twice; in
addi-tion there is subs-tantial cover provided by the earning power of the
shareholder guarantors.
14.       All contracts and orders financed by the Bank would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. Prequalification of
contractors for the main civil works contract has been completed, and
bidding is presently underway. At the request of the Government, domestic
manufacturers of equipment, which are expected to compete for minor
auxiliary and miscellaneous equipment orders financed by the Bank loan,
would be granted a margin of preference equal to the existing customs
duties, or 15 percent of the CIF price of such equipment, whichever is
lower. The minor equipment orders which may be awqarded locally under
this preference could total up to about US$850,000 equivalent, of which
about US$600,000 equivalent would be the foreign component.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Interconexion
Ilectrica S.A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
Colombia and the Bank, the draft Shareholders' Agreement between the
Bank and the four major Shareholders of the proposed Borrower, as
well as the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
xcecutive Directors separately.



-6-
16.     The draft Loan Agreement contains covenants generally used for
power projects. Section 5.13 repeats the rate of return requirement on
power generating assets in Loan 575-CO. Section 5.11 provides for a
revision of ISA's statutes to take into account the recommendations
arising from a study of accounting and pricing methods. Modification
of these statutes without prior approval of the Bank, and failure of
the Shareholders to comply with the provisions of the statutes, are
specified in Section 6.02 as additional events of default.
17.     The draft Guarantee Agreement is similar to previous guarantee
agreements with the Republic of Colombia. Under the draft Shareholders'
Agreement the principal Shareholders would agree to guarantee the Bank
loan (Section 2.01), to provide the financing of the local costs of the
Project (Section 3.01), to perform-their financial obligations under
ISA's statutes (Sections 5.01 and 5.02) and to assist ISA in obtaining
external financing for the major equipment and its installation
(Section 5.04).
PART V - THE ECONO0IY
18.     A summary of recent economic developments and a favorable
conclusion regarding Colombia's creditworthiness for additional external
borrowing was contained in paragraphs 15 - 20 of my Report and
Recommendation on the Loan for the Second Education Project (P-799),
dated April 30, 1970.
PART VI - CONPLIAICE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREa1ENT
19.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECC'I=ENDATION
20. -   I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
