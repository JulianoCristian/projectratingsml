The proposed project will provide special\n            container handling facilities and equipment, replace some\n            deteriorated general cargo equipment, modernize grain\n            handling facilities, and rehabilitate lighterage facilities\n            and the petroleum jetty. The project will also repave\n            sections of berths, and provide for a review of additional\n            rehabilitation requirements, technical assistance and\n            training, and consultancy services."}, "docdt": "1984-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
