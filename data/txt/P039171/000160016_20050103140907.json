Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project: Among the sectoral-related lessons were these: The\n            unique microclimatic situation should be taken into account\n            during the implementation stage in future projects for seed\n            variety development and testing activities.  Considering\n            that about 60 percent of agriculture in Yemen is under\n            rainfed conditions, follow-on projects should place more\n            emphasis on rainfed agriculture. The use of farmers'\n            cooperatives in the production and dissemination of local\n            varieties proved to be fruitful under this project. The use\n            of farmers' cooperatives in project implementation and\n            the training of extension staff have made positive changes\n            for poor rural households and beneficiaries; this concept\n            should be broadened and replicated in other sectors and also\n            at the national level. Further success of the Vegetable Seed\n            Company can be enhanced by developing an aggressive\n            market-oriented program. Implementation -related lessons\n            highlighted the simple and straight forward design, the\n            focused approach on a limited number of activities, the\n            recognition of the importance of farmer empowerment, the\n            need to apprise Borrowers of the relevance and significance\n            of procurement and disbursement procedures in avoiding\n            implementation delays, setting the legal framework before\n            project implementation, the need to put in place a simpler\n            institutional set-up, the need to align project and\n            government policy, and to closely monitor quality control\n            and the implementation of the cooperatives mandates."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
