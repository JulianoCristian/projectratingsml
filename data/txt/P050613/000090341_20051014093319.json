When targeted to the\n            underprivileged, scholarships help to keep students in\n            school. Non- formal education can increase preschool\n            enrollment. Large investments in teacher training should be\n            based on clear strategies. Project implementers, even of\n            conventional projects, should focus on outcomes.
