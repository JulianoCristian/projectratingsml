and a study of the problems and prospects of\n            rural electrification.  It also includes training components\n            for both beneficiaries.  The project aims to raise\n            agricultural production, reduce the use of oil products in\n            farming, and improve the quality of life on the land.  In\n            addition, the project also aims to assist the Federal\n            Government in formulating policies for the development and\n            financing of rural electrification.  About 148,000 rural\n            properties and 49,000 village consumers would be connected\n            by CEMIG and COPEL."}, "docdt": "1983-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
