F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The Grant for the TechnicalAssistance Facility (TAF), funded by the MDTF-National Sudan,
aims at supporting the Government of National Unity and state governments to strengthen
their professional and technical capacities for formulation of policies, programs, and projects
derived from the JAM Framework for Sustained Peace, Development, and Poverty
Eradication.

The Grant supports preparation and supervision of studies which could lead to projects
primarily in the areas of health, education, infrastructure, agriculture/rural development, and
community-driven reconstruction and development. It also supports preparation of sector
policies, strategies and plans and the preparation of feasibility studies and detailed
engineering for investment projects.

Finally the Grant will finance training aimed at capacity building in federal and state
ministries,and in government agencies.

H. Restructnring (if any)

1.      There were three (3) amendments made to the agreement: (i) extension of the closing
date from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 to allow implementation of a wider range
of activities that can be financed from the G:r:ant; (ii) extension of the closing date from
December 31,2008 to September 30, 2009 to enable the completion of the Environment Study
which was regarded as crucial capacity building project, completion of phase two of the Health
Training Program and implementation of urgent technical assistance needs of the States; and (iii),
extension of the closing date from September 30, 2009 to January 31, 2010 to enable the
completion of the National Transport Master Plan which was delayed 1 due to reasons beyond
the control of the government and completion of the fInal training under the Health Planning
& Management Capacity Building Program. It is important to note that an extension of the
closing date was anticipated in the Project Proposal Document if there were "a sustained demand for
technical assistance"2.TAF did not receive any additional funds from the MDTF-NS, although the
GoNU increased its original contribution from USS670,000 to USS723,000.




1 The start up of the study was delayed because the designated team leader became ill and his replacement was not
appointed until three months after the study was due to start. As such, the work experienced a number of unexpected delays
also not within the control of the consultant such as delays in obtaining visas for the international personnel in the consultant
team, delays in the receipt of data from the client (Ministry of Transport, Roads and Bridges), difficulties and delays in
getting the Oovernment of Southern Sudan (0055) involved in consultations with the North on the study, as well as the
withdrawal of the consultant's senior partner which meant an additional staff change.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and De,sign

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.       Sudan is the largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa by land area. Despite considerable land
degradation and desertification, it is still rich in terms of natural resources and has the potential for
substantial growth. Sudan has, however, been affected severely by conflicts for five of the six decades
since independence in 1956. In 1993 the Government became ineligible to borrow from the Bank
because. of its inability to co-finance ongoing Bank projects and the deteriorating economic situation in
Sudan (caused to a large extent by the civil war in the South) which was not conducive to a sustained
development program. In 1993 the Bank closed its offices in Sudan during a period when average
GDP growth was about 3.8 percent per annum.3 After the discovery and exploitation of oil Sudan's
rate of growth doubled, nevertheless the Government remained in arrears to the Bank.

3.      In December 2003, after a cease fIre in the South and negotiations for a Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA) started in earnest, the World Bank and UN were asked to coordinate a Joint
Assessment Mission (JAM) to determine the resource needs of Sudan over a six-year Interim Period
and to develop with Sudan's authorities a framework for reconstruction and development. The JAM
produced a "Framework for Sustained Peace, Development and Poverty Eradication/' with strong
government ownership, including clear commitments and monitoring indicators'. The implementation
of the JAM framework was to be supported by government resources and assistance from the
development partners.

4.       The many decades of civil conflict officially ended when the CPA was signed on January 9,
2005.    As part of the Wealth Sharing Protocol in the Wealth Sharing Agreement of the CPA, two
Multi~Donor Trust Funds (MDTFs) to fmance reconstruction and rehabilitation programs were
established under the administration of the World Bank. One MDTF (MDTF-NS) would be for the
Government of National Unity (GoNU) focused on war-affected areas including the three areas of
Blue Nile, Abyei and Nuba Mountains, and the other (MDTF-SS) for the Government of Southern
Sudan (GoSS).

5.      The core rationale for the MDTFs was as a facility that could rapidly provide fmancial
resources from pooled donor contributions for the most urgent development programs and projects to
reconstruct and rehabilitate conflict affected areas, leading to the generation of increased employment,
incomes and reductions in poverty.

6.      The World Bank was requested to manage the two trust funds and to do this two Technical
Secretariats were established, one in Khartoum to manage the MDTF-NS and the other to manage the
MDTF-SS in Juba. At the Oslo Conference in April 2004 donors pledged about $500 million to the
two trust funds and both MDTFs became effective on August 24, 2005. The MDTFs in Northern and
Southern Sudan were at first managed by two separate Interim Oversight Committees which later each
became permanent Oversight Committees.

7.       It was in this· context that the TAF was designed and appraised in October, 2005 to provide
immediate technical support to central and state government ministries as well as public corporations
to prepare credible and weU,,"designed development programs and projects, based on comprehensive
sector analysis, for financing from domestjc·and external sources such as the MDTP-NS. There was
no comparable source of funding available at the time to quickly strengthen the capacity of
government institutions to formulate development programs and projects. 4 The TAP was the first
project to be submitted to the Interim Oversight Committee of the MDTF-NS and mainly financed by
the MDTF-NS and was the first to become effective.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.      There was one development objective, namely to support the Government of National Unity,
state governments· and public corporations to strengthen their professional and technical capacities for
formulation of policies, programs, and projects derived from the JAM Framework for Sustained Peace,
Development and Poverty Eradication.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.       There were no amendments to the project's development objective, key indicators or
justification

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.      The beneficiaries were in three broad groups, namely (a) federal and state government
ministries; (b) government corporations; and (c) staff of federal and state governments.

11.       The expected benefit for aU these groups was financial support for improving their
institutional capacity through domestic and international training to more effectively formulate policies,
programs, and projects and their ability to fund specific studies that could lead to improved sector
policies, strategies and plans, as well as feasibility studies for investments.

1.5 Origimd Components (as approv~d)

12.    There were three components approved in the Project Proposal Document and stated in the
Grant Agreement, namely:

     (a) Capacity Building: Technical and advisory assistance to central government line ministries
         and corporations, and state ministries for identification, preparation and supervision of projects


4The establishment ofTAF was in line with the World Bank's Country Economic Memorandum of2003 which
had stated, inter aHa, that one of the priority tasks ahead was to raise the effectiveness of public expenditures by
"A systematic process should be established for screening development projects and formulating an annual
Public Investment Program, including guidelines and establishing priorities for bringing new projects into the
development budget for funding." (Sudan: Stabilization and Reconstruction Country Economic Memorandum,
op cit, page x)
                                                              3

          primarily in the a:reas of health,. education, infrastructure,. agriculture/rural development, and
          cortununity.;cJriven reconstruction and development.

          -The most important element was the devel()pment of an efficient unit in the Ministry of
          Finance and National EconornY for providing support for the national planning of
          development programs and projects.                 .

          - The second was domestic and external training to transfer to government staff the skills
          necessary to formulate, design, prepare, and implement development programs and .projects.

      (b) Sector StUdies: Preparation of sector policies, strategies and plans.

      (c)· Feasibility Studies: Preparation of feasibility studies and detailed engineering for investment
          proj~cts.

1.6 Revised Components

13.       There were no changes in the project components.

1.7 Other significant changes

14.     There were no significant changes in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements,
or schedules, or funding allocations. There were three (3) amendments made to the agreement: (i)
extension of the closing date from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 to allow implementation
of a wider range of activities that can be financed from the Grant; (ii) extension of the closing date
from December 31,2008 to September 30, 2009 to enable the completion of the Environment Study
which was regarded as crucial capacity building project, completion of phase two of the Health
Training Program and implementation of urgent technical assistance needs of the States; and (iii)
extension of the closing date from September 30,2009 to January 31, 2010 to enable the completion of
the National Transport Master Plan which was delayed'due to reasons beyond the control of the
government and completion of the final training under the Health Planning & Management Capacity
Building Program. As noted, an extension of the closing date was anticipated in the Project Proposal
Document if there were "a sustained demand for technical assistance". TAF did not receive any
additional funds from the MDTF-NS, although the GoNU increased its original contribution from
US$670,OOO toUS$723,OOO.

15.      While the project outcome is rated moderately successful this belies the overall achievements
of the project in a very difficult environment, including achievements that were only possible due to
the adjustments to timing to correct for an originally unrealistic implementation schedule. Thus, while
the changes made during implementation is a strike against "success" if the project is evaluated against
the original design, the change itself is critical to substantive success as 'the new timeline was more
realistic to the opera~g environment than the original timeline. Similarly, the succession of TTLs is a



S This start up of the National Transport Master Plan study was delayed because the designated team leader became ill and
his replacement was not appointed until three months after the study was due to start. As such, the work experienced a
number of unexpected delays also not within the control of the consultant such as delays in obtaining visas for the
iilternational personnel in the consultant team, delays in the receipt of data from the client (Ministry of Transport, Roads and
Bridges), difficulties and delays in getting the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) involved in consultations with the
North on the stQdy, as well as the withdrawal of the consultant's senior partner which meant an additional staff change.

 negative mark in evaluating the continuity of the project in form, yet in substance it provided the
 chance to move from the CMU managing the project to a sector unit with the proper technical support
 to do so.

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outeomes

 1.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

 16.      The context at project entry was also one in which, perhaps more so than in other post conflict
 states, capacity was particularly weak, few if any donor programs had been on-going, including none
 by the Bank - which had been out of the country since 1993 - and an economic embargo by the US
 imposed as follow-up to a military strike against the regime. These conditions were important at entry
 but also had an enduring effect on the initial years of implementation and thereafter. The ICR team
 reviewed the history of the project and would like t<? share the following: a) as the first project
 conceived and proposed jointly by donors and the Government of Sudan in this phase ofre-
 engagement, it carried with it the·optimism of the moment and momentum to deliver some impacts
 quickly - thus the two-year time line for a project that was conceived to be multi-sectoral; b) the
 decision to have the Country Manager as the ITL for the project was a reflection of the dearth of
 sector staff located in the field office and· somewhat familiar with the local realities; and, c) the very
 slow technical start-up in the project largely due to the lack of fiduciary staff located in or assigned to
 Khartoum. These are not unfamiliar challenges in re..engagements in post-conflict contexts but were
 significantly deeper in Sudan given the long isolation, knowledge gaps and continuing embargo.

  17.      The Technical Secretariat for the MDTF-NS undertook considerable consultation with the
  Ministry of Finance and National Economy (MOFNE) which had strongly embraced the concept of a
  TAF as an institution that would fmance sector and policy analysis, including feasibility studies for
  specific projects. On the other hand the TAF was seen by some in the Ministry as a sequel to the
  Project Preparation Unit (pPU) that had been financed in part by the Bank before it withdrew from
  operations in.Sudan in 1993. That unit was in the Ministry of Planning and National Economy which
. at the time functioned separately from the MOFNE but was absorbed into the MOFNE in 1994. An
  important difference between the TAF· and the PPU was that TAF focused on facilitating technical
  assistance that would lead to capacity building in the public sector to make it more capable of
  designing sector development strategies and projects. On the other hand the PPU was focused on the
  preparation of development projects for the relevant ministries. The different merits of these two
  approaches have yet to be settled with GoNU.

 18.     Soon after completion of preliminary discussions about the proposed TAF with the MOFNE
 the ministry identified the future TAF Coordinator who in turn identified future staff. TAF's design
 and appraisal were prepared in close collaboration with the designated future Coordinator and the
 MOFNE as a whole.

 19.     The design and appraisal of the TAF took account of the lessons learned from previous
technical assistance projects financed by the World Bank. These lessons were summarized in the
Project Proposal Document (PPD) for TAF and are listed below with comments (in italics) on how
these lessons were taken into account ·of:

 (a) The more unsettled a country's institutional environment, the greater the need for a flexible,
     process-oriented design.

        The GONU was in a process of adjustment to its new role ofafter the CPA and in that context
        TAF 's flexible and process-oriented design proved to be successful
(b) A flexible process requires strong project management that will stick to well defined core
    objectives for the technical assistance          .

         There .was never any wavering from the core objectives .and this was achieved as. a result of
         the strong leadershipfrO.m the Under~Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and National
         Economy who chaired thiTAFSteering Committee.

(c) There is no substitute for ownership of the technical assistance program on the borrower's side
    and in-depth country knowledge apdcareful supervision of the program on the Bank's side

        All studies were managed by technical committees formed by. the concernedfederal ministries;
        Bank supervision was frequent and based on detailed knowledge of the sector issues and the
        country

(d) When g\lvernment commitm~mt is backed up by the support ofa high level project advocate. the
    likelihood of the project's su~sS .increases markedly

        The Under-Secretary of the Ministry ofFinance and National Economy, who chaired the TAF
        Steering Committee, was a strong and effective. advocate for the project from the start of
        consultations on the TAF's design and during its implementation.

(e) Continuity and cohesiveness of the Bank's country team and the borrower's project management
    team enhance learning and mutual trust, increasing prospects for the project's success.

         There was substantial continuity on the side of the Bank and TAF during four years of
         implef!)entation which established considerable learning and mutual trust despite
       . disfliteements at timesw;th supervision missions on substantive issues such as terms of
         reference for studies, procurement imdjinancial management

(t)   Technical support should be chosen on the basis that results will enhance the capacity of sector
      programs to achieve growth and poverty reduction

        The TAF Steering Committee establishedjirm criteriafor the selection of technical assistance
        programs which were reviewed by theMDTF-NS Technical Secretariat

(g) Units such as the TAF can hav~ a broad impact on improving the capacity of government
    ministries to improve their planning and implementation capacity.

        The TAF has contributed significantly to the capacity of government central ministries to
        improve their planning and capacity

20.      There was no quality at entry review of the TAF. The review team considered this a
fundamental misstep for several reasons aside from following basic good practice in due diligence. A
quality at entry review would have provided the team with a platform to surface the severe limitations
in the implementation environment, to have relevant stakeholders informed, and therefore manage
expectations and, importantly, assure project design responded with flexibility and adequate resources
to those risks. That this was not done for this project - the very fIrst one in the re-engagement and one
expected to produce proposals for subsequent projects - was a critical lapse. This weakness in
approach however lends a lesson for the design of future capacity building projects in post-conflict and
fragile situations.

21.     The T AF Grant became effective three months after approval by the Interim Oversight
Committee (IOC). There was considerable interest in the Grant because it was the first externally
funded project provided by a multilateral organization (Le. the MDTF) to support the Government for
about 12 years.

22.      There were three broad areas of activity consistent with TAF's development objectives,
namely (a) capacity building which encompassed institution building and training; (0) sector studies;
and (c) feasibility studies. During implementation the studies were dealt with together as "studies and
programs" because of their common characteristics and management

23.     Given the change in implementation time-line (from two years to five years), the end-goal of
the TAF producing project proposals became impossible to achieve without compromising
foundational goals of producing sound planning and strategic studies and capacity l:m.ilding through
new skills development in ministries. The long delay complicated matters in linking the studies with
investments and still remains a challenge for potential follow-on tasks.

Capacity building

24.     Institution Building. In line with its main objective TAP established an organization with a
set of detailed procedures and standards that, with sound management, would give it the· capacity to
channel technical support to all government institutions to assist them to develop public sector projects
and programs and ultimately support the MOFNE's national planning objectives.

25.      Training. The important training objective was started very soon after the TAF IJec:ru:r!e
effective and the first procurement training for federal ministries was held in Khartoum in May, 2006.
Numerous and varied training events foHowed focused on various aspects of capacity                  in
government ministries and public corporations in Northern Sudan, as wen as a few in Southern Sudan,
and they continued throughout the project's implementation period. A few government staff received
training outside Sudan. These training programs were predominantly in international institutions
within Sub-Saharan Africa.



26.     Technical Assistance. The TAF followed the Implementation Plan outlined. in Auncx I
Project Proposal Document. Core features of the plan were the appointment of a Steering Committee
in the MOFNE, choice by this Committee of projects to be financed, and referral of projects costing
more than $50,000 to the MDTF Technical Secretariat for endorsement before implementation.

27.      At TAF's inception it was decided to establish technical committees to manage the
implementation of each technical assistance proposal approved by the Steering Committee          both
sector studies and feasibility studies. The technical committees were established in sector ministries
responsible for the proposals. Committee membership was reviewed and endorsed by the Under
Secretary of the MOFNE

28.    This arrangement clearly responded to one of the lessons from previous technical assistance
programs, namely that there is no substitute for ownership of the technical assistance programs on
borrower's side.
                                                     7

    •   It took about.four (4) lllonths, however, before the Under·Secretary of the MOFNE agreed that
        the Ministries, and not the TAF, should be the legal clients for the technical assiStance
        financed by the Grant and therefore be responsible for signing contracts with the consultants
        undertaking the work...· The sector. ministries also wanted to be responsible for the
        implementation of the contracts.
    •   The technical committees. in the sector ministri~s became completely responsible for the
        implementation, from design tofmal.evaluation of the results; of any proposals they made that
        were approved by the Steering Cothmittee.
    •   Members of technical committees were approved by the Chair of the Steering Committee and,
        if not staff of the Government, they were paid for their contributions.6
    •   The technical committees were staffed with competent sector experts, including a TAF staff
        member who advised the committee on procurement matters.

29.    The well implemented technical committee structure, led by the relevant government ministry,
was one of the reasons for TAF's success in delivering high quality technical assistance.

Other ImplemenUltion Issues

30.      While the areas mentioned above were the broad elements ofTAF's implementation program,
there were a number· of factors that had an influence on its implementation. These are discussed
briefly below.

31.     The TAF Coordinator was changed at the start of the project. The designated Coordinator
for TAF, who had been closely involved with project preparation, was re·assigned within the Ministry
shortly before the TAF was approved by the IOC. A replacement was appointed quickly but there
was a learning period for the. new Cootdinator as well as some adjustments to staff in the TAF
Coordinating Unit (TCD) during the early phases ofTAF's existence.

32.     An Advisor on TAF administration was appointed soon after project effectiveness. As stated
in the Project Proposal Document, 1 the MDTF-NS Technical Secretariat would appoint an
administrative advisor (external consUltant) to support the Coordinator and would advise on TAF's
establishment and operating procedures at the beginning of the project.

    •   The advisor .assisted with the initial organization of the TAF office and prepared draft job
        descriptions for TAF staff, established procedures for the identification, review and approval
        oftechnical assistance projects in accordance with the Project Proposal Document.
    •   The advisor was engaged by the TAF office who .resigned after less than a year of service.
        The replacement, however, was not made since the government preferred a high level
        international technical advisor who would be tasked with reviewing technical assi~ce
        proposals. The Bank did not concur with the government's request to hire an international
        technical advisor since such action was not fully consistent with the TAF' s objectives to
        transform the TAF office into "an effective institution within the Ministry of F4tance and
        National Economy that can channel technical support to all government institutions to assist
        them develop public sector projects and programs". The Bank advised the government that it




6 If members of technical committees were Government staff they were usually paid an honorarium by the
Government.
7 Project Proposal Document for a Technical Assistance Facility, op cit, paragraph 9, page 16.
        was in their best interest to use staff from within the Ministry, staff from other ministries, or
        hire local consultants for this purpose.

33.     At the .,~tart there were weaknesses in staffing of the TAF Coordination Unit (TCU). The
Project Proposal Document provided for TAF to be headed by a Coordinator with seven staff in the
TCU. Although staff was supposed to have been selected competitively, those chosen were not as
experienced as required considering the tasks they needed to perform.

    •   TAF's Coordinator made Ii number of efforts to address this issue from the beginning and
        often requested more qualified staff from the Under~Secretary,           improvements and change
        were slow.
    @   Despite the staffmg limitations, the Coordinator           TCU staff acted quite quickly after
        project effectiveness to micit technical assistance proposalS from central government
        ministries. Projects were then assessed and ranked by the TCU and submitted to the Steering
        Committee for review         decision.
    @   Staff constraints also limited TAF's ability in earlier years to illicit       technical assistance
        proposals from       states. This changed later when consultants were retained to assist but by
        then financial resources and time became the            constraints.
    e   As TAF staff             knowledge and experience TAF lost some key staff to the MOFNE
        because it was           that they     accumulated              knowledge           project design,
        project management          general administration       were therefore in demand. This staff
        movement turned out to be a                     capacity            process with the IvIOFNE.



34.     Institution Building. During most supervision missions there was a joint assessment of the
progress of TAF as an institution       the results matrix as the             for assessing progress.
Conclusions from these assessments were       to reach agreements on furure.remedies to issues and to
agree on next steps for TAF.

35.       Training. Participants at aU training programs held in Sudan were asked to complete an
evaluation sheet after the completion of each training event. TAF also retained a consultant to review
its training program up to May, 2009. When more funds became available through the re-allocation of
funds from other activities financed by the Grant additional local training events were held. Overall
the training activities were evaluated as satisfactory. A summary and assessment of TAP's training
activities are provided in Annex 2,

36.      Studies and Programs. The            system for TAF was               TAP's use of technical
committees for the management of technical assistance contracts. The technical committees provided
TAF          a way of continuously monitoring a.nd evaluating of the           of sector ministries of
designing, procuring, contracting, implementing and reviewing fmsI reports for consulting services for
specific tasKS.            implementation of studies     programs the technical committees reviewed
progress reports provided by the consultants and addressed any issues that needed attention.

37.     In addition the results matrix was        as a monitormg me:ch,ru:l1sm            most           Bank's
supervision missions.

38.     TAF Quarterly .Reports. TAF provided quarterly                       ",,,,tnnjr,,,,"   from the start but
the reports were not       submitted in a timely manner.                                           TAP focused
more on process related tasKs and the           produced                                          were not fuBy
                                                         9

satisfactory because it did not include the required project financial information. Towards the end of
TAF's implementation period, the quarterly reports improved and detailed fmancial statements were
included. However, the last quarterly report received from TAF lacked substantive information such
as conclusions from the completed studies and programs nor comments on their impact for sector and
investment policy.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.       There were no safeguard issues assOciated with this project

40.     Procurement Capacity. Advising technical committees established for the various studies on
the procurement of consultants to undertake studies was an important role for TAF staff. The Project
Proposal Document had concluded, however, that the capacity for implementing Bank procurement
procedures did not exist in the Government at the time and hence technical assistance would· be
required. 8       .


      •    When TAF became effective there was no procurement specialist in the Bank's country office
           in Khartoum
      •    To support the TCU on the crucial and detailed quality and cost based selection (QCBS)
           process for most of the studies the MDTF-NS Technical Secretariat provided an experienced
           international procurement consultant who started his fIrSt mission to Khartoum a few days
           after the TAF Grant became effective continued until March, 2006 when a senior procurement
           specialist was appointed to the Bank's office in Khartoum. During the consultant's assignment
          .to TAF he provided direct personal assistance on procurement issues to the TCU staff.
      •    This substantial and focused support became even more important when the TAF procurement
           specialist became seriously ill.
      •    Considerable training including attendance at procurement workshops was also used to
           improve TAF staff procurement capacity during the early years of implementation. The first
           procurement workshop which T AF arranged for the Government conducted by World Bank
           staff was held from May 14-16, 2006 and all TCU staff with procurement responsibilities
           attended. Nevertheless the TCU staff still needed regular support from the Bank's supervision
           missions and by EMail on a range of procurement issues. Weak knowledge and
           understanding of procurement procedures was a chronic problem for T AF and required
           frequent Bank support until a national procurement consultant was eventually appointed to the
           TCU in mid 2007 that provided much needed competence and experience on all procurement
           matters.
      •    Although the Advisor on TAF . administration had prepared the outlines of a procurement
           section for TAP's operational manual (which was endorsed by the above-mentioned
           international procurement specialist) TAF did not produce an acceptable operational manual.
           On the other hand TAP's work on procurement was based almost exclusively on the Bank's
           Guidelines/or the Selection and Employment o/Consultants by World Bank Borrowers which
           was the de facto procurement manual for TAF's small staff.
      •    While there were many procurement delays, there were no cases of mis-procurement.

41.     FmancW Management. From the start this was a major problem for TAP. In 2006 there
was a dearth of qualified English and Arabic speaking financial managers in Sudan and virtually none
of them had experience with World Bank finanCial management procedures in projects.



8 Project Proposal Document for   a Technical Assistance Facility, op cit, paragraph 20, page 9.
                                                   10



    •   A series of Sudanese fmancial managers were appointed but they faced difficulties because
        they were either unable to master the Bank's financial management standards, had no access to
        standard electronic accounting programs, were confronted with uncertainties about US dollar
        denominated transactions, had inadequate command of English, .or they were enticed to leave
        TAP for more remunerative assignments.
    •   During almost all of the first year of TAP's implementation there was no Bank financial
        management specialist in Khartoum to provide advice on financial management which
        negatively affected the availability and timeliness of Bank advice to the project on FM issues.
        Regrettably, after an FM specialist was appointed there was little improvement in the situation.
    •   During the last 24 months before the closing date Ii new Bank FM specialist had been assigned
        to Khartoum who provided more direct support, two competent TAF fmandai controllers were
        appointed sequentially. Even though getting acquainted with the Bank's FM system was a
        challenge for them at that late stage of project implementation TAP's financial control
        improved. Towards project closure, fmandal management had improved substantially, funds
        flow was expedited, complete records were maintained and timely as wen as acceptable
        financial reports were generated.
    •   Despite the fmancial management weaknesses noted during TAP's implementation, at no time
        were audits qualified. This result can be partially attributed to the substantial support received
        from the MA and the fiduci~ control resulting from the MA's pre screening of withdrawal
        applications and recommending them for payment. The MA also prepared an operational
        manual for fmancial management which was used by TAF staff.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.      The new Directorate of Planning, Studies and Policy in the MOFNE (after ministry
restructuring) will provide intellectual support for national planning and the design of development
programs and projects. It is proposing to embrace TAP's institutional mandate in the new directorate.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

43.     With its emphasis on capacity building to provide support for strengthening the professional
and technical capacity of the MOFNE and in sectoral and line agencies in the central and state
governments, as well as in government corporations, TAP's objectives, design and implementation
remain relevant to Sudan's future development program and a major potential contribution to the
Bank's assistance program when it starts again.

44.      TAP's relevance became clear when, as a result of a major reorganization with the MOFNE,
its functions were incorporated within the structure of the new Directorate of Planning. Policies and
Studies. TAF has also been the source of a considerable amount of relevant training for staff in the
central and state governments, and generated seven highly relevant studies and programs which are
already stimulating foHow-up actions.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Intermediate Outcomes/Objectives
                                                            11


45.      TAF's project development objectives and the results chain to achieve them were framed in
the project's results matrix (see Table 1). Tmsassessment of achievements of TAF's development
objectives focuses on the intermediate outcomes (objectives) in the results matrix because the final
strategic outcomes were not anticipated lJ.ntil 2011. At the end of this section ~ number of tentative
evaluations are made about the achievement of TAF' sfin81' strategic outcomes.

Institution Building

46.    Establishment of TAF as an effective institution in the MOFNE that can channel technical
support to all government institutions to assift them to develop public sector projects and programs.
The development of TAF as an institution to achieve the intermediate and final strategic outcomes was
slow but it eventually proved to be a durable and effective structure. TAF' s core institutional
characteristic is that it facilitates and supports all levels of government to prepare studies and programs
that are expected to become contributions to the formulation of national and state plans for physical
and human capital development that will ultimately generate economic growth and poverty reduction.

47.     The institutional objectives were successfully achieved by the time the project closed. On the
other hand, TAF management and staff were inexperienced with World Bank procurement guidelines
                                                   12

at the start.and as a resuh progress on the procurement of consultants to undertake various studies and
programs was slow. At project closure, however, TAF showed that as an institution with competent
management and staff, it could make a powerful contribution to sound national planning and the
efficient choice of investment projects.

Training

48.    Improve the analytical capacity olstaff in central and state government and public
corporations through training.

    (a) Domestic training. Tmining programs were developed but their implementation was
        constrained for most of TAF's implementation period by the budget limit imposed in the
        original Agreement. Nevertheless, during five years up to the closing date TAF arranged 25
        training workshops within Sudan on a range of topics which included project design,
        formulation of feasibility studies, procurement management, financial management, micro
        fmance, and monitoring and evaluation (see Annex 2 for the topics for the courses, the venues
        and the attendance). The Project Proposal Document (Annex 3) suggested five domestic
        training workshops during TAF's first year. On avemge there were five each year with a
        bunching of a much larger number towards TAF's closing date when it was apparent that some
        unallocated financial resources were available for additional workshops. A total of 862
        students attended the 25 workshops. The participants' mtio of males/females showed the male
        participants were double the female participants, which is close to the mtio of the sexes in the
        civil services. Annex 2 provides more information, on the training workshops and Annex 5
        provides a summary of the benefits derived from these training activities.

    (b) International training. The Project Proposal Document suggested that ten government staff
         should participate in international training each year. By the time TAF closed only 21 fedeml
         and state government staff had been sent to international training mainly in the areas of project
        design and evaluation and procurement procedures and management. This was mainly due to
        the difficulties in identifying qualified candidates for international !mining. However the
        training program regarding the building of the health planning and management capacities of
        the states was highly successful about 70 percent .were women who took part of this program.
        It strengthened the capacity of the federal Ministry of Health and the Public Health Institute to
        provide their own training activities because they will be able to use this program's !mining of·
        trainers program and the public health !mining templates used by the University of
        Washington in the USA. In addition a strong professional relationship has been developed
        between the federal Ministry of Health and the University of Washington for launching future
        joint capacity building activities; There is great confidence, therefore, that this program has
        established a sustainable model for scaling up the public health management training capacity
        in the state and federal ministries of health. A draft report on the outcome of the program is
        being considered by the Ministry of Health and follow up training is being planned.

   (c) Sensitizing Workshops in the States. There were 9 of these workshops held in state capitals
       aimed at providing information to the states on the opportunities for state governments to
       obtain fmancial support for technical assistance from TAF. Annex 2 provides information on
       the proposals received as a result of these workshops.

Studies and Programs .

49.   Improved capacity of central and state ministries to formulate, design, prepare, and
implement development programs and projects. TAF fmanced eight substantial studies which
                                                       13

addressed sector policies, strategies and plans, as well as the preparation of feasibility studies. The
sector and feasibility studies which were approved, together with their costs, were as follows:

    (a) Sector Studies

    •    Review of the Structure oftheSudati Gezira Board ($113,752)
    •    Study of the Sustainable Development of Semi-Mechanized Rainfed Farming ($685,583)
    •    Formulation of a Master Plan for the Sudan Transport Sector ($1,496,100)
    •    Building the Health Planning and Management Capacities of the States ($696,339)
    •    Public-Private Sector Dialogue (PPSD) Forum ($105,264)

    (b) FeasibUityStudies

    •    Improving Agricultural Support Services in Traditional Rainfed Farming Areas ($129,800)
    •    Rehabilitation and Development pfFaculties of Basic Education ($94,875)
    •    Capacity Building in Environmental Management ($184,266)

50.    All studies and programs, except for the Public-Private Sector Dialogue (PPSD) which was
suspended dUring in November, 2009, were completed successfully. The activities under thePPSD
were suspended because of difficulties faCed by MOFNE (responsible for the implementation of the
program) in replacing the PPSD coordinator who had been terminated due to weak performance.9

5L       The completion of the studies and programs was substantially delayed. The main reasons are
listed in Box 1 below.

52.     The eompleted eonsultant studies, while eonsiderably delayed were highly valued by the
sedor ministries and ministerial teehnieal eommittees. Interviews by the ICR mission with the
chairs of the technical committees, or their deleg~tes, confirmed their satisfaction with the outcome of
the seven completed studies.

53.     Plans were completed or are being made for follow up activities to make the most use of the
study results. For example a project on Agricultural Support Services in Traditional Rainfed Farming-
Areas was used to prepare a project to be fmanced by the MDTF-NS to improve agricultural extension
services in some of the poorest farming and pastoral areas in Sudan.

54.     At the time of preparing this ICR, plans were already in place for a follow-up workshop on the
study of Sustainable Development of Semi-Mechanized Rainfed Farming on May 12, 2010: The
objective of the workshop is to translate the conclusions and recommendations of the study into
changes in Government policy.


Final Strategie Outeomes

55.    The TAP was originally planned in two phases of which the first was $5.0 million over two
years. Because of the extensions needed to complete the frrst phase, the second phase was not started




9 Funds reallocated from this program were used for increased training activity towards the end of TAF' s
implementation period.
                                                            14

  and hence there has been little opportunity to fully address the final strategic outcomes for anticipated
  in 2011.

    56.      Nevertheless, as indicated above, substantial progress has been made and there is also
    confidence that the fmal strategic outcomes in the results matrix will be achieved even though TAF
    has been closed - particularly with the objectives in the newly formed Directorate Planning, Studies
    and Policy in the MOFNE. However, poverty reduction, which is the ultimate strategic outcome for
    all development programs, is the result of a broad combination of policies and investments. An
    institution such as TAF, .regardless of how successful it is, can only provide one contribution to
. . poverty reduction at the national level.

                         Box 1: Summary of Causes for Delays in Completing TAF Studies
                                              (in broad order of importance)
       Procurement
            •   Difficulties in accessing dg Market and UN Development Business before World Bank staffhad
                direct access to WQrld Bank's Lotus Notes system from Khartoum. The Khartoum office did not
                have access to the World Bank network, including SAP and the Project Portal, until about
                October,2006.
            •   Disagreements on the most appropriate terms of reference for studies
            •   Inadequate or incompleteRequests for Proposals (RFPs)
            •   Dispatch of incorrect RFP to shortlist which meant formally withdrawing RFP and the dispatch
                of revised RFP                                                           "
           •    Inappropriate negotiations by Ministries on consultant payment rates for a QCBS contract
           •    Resolution of a complaint by one of the bidders against the result of an evaluation of proposals
                for a large contract - which had no merit
       . . .•   Preparation of a: justification for a sole source procurement for a large contract after an already
                lengthy but inconclusive QCBS procurement process

       Implementation
           •    Final consultant report was not responsive to the terms of reference
           •    Change of consultant team leaders for two of the largest contracts after contract signature which
                delayed the start of contract implementation
           •    Changes in consultant team members during contract implementation which caused delayed
                contract completion
           •    Withdrawal of sub-consultants during contract implementation which caused delayed contract
                completion
           .•   The termination date for the largest contract was not extended leading to the need for the
                contracting parties to seek approval for a sole source contract for the balance of the work.



 3.3 Efficiency

 57.     The Project Proposal Document did not "estimate an ERR for TAF and no ERR has been
 estimated in this ICR. While an ERR would be impossible to estimate in the conventional way a few
 observations can be made on the anticipated benefits and costs of the project.

 58.        Three significant and sustainable benefits from TAF can be anticipated,nam~ly:

       •   Mainstreaming ofTAF as an institution into the Directorate of Planning, Studies and Policy.in
           the MOFNE which will strengthen future national resulting in significant benefits from the
           national point of view
                                                    15


      •   The studies will, if implemented or followed up by policy change and investments, be capable
          of generating substantial benefits to growth, human development and poverty reduction.
      •   The training program through 25 workshops and 21 external training opportunities should
          have' a substantial current and lasting impact on the quality of staff work in connection with
          development programs.

59.       On the cost side there are positive and negative outcomes.

      •   On the positive side TAF has been quite efficient in the use of its administrative funds which
          absorbed only about 15.6 percent of expenditures which included the substantial ~xpenditures
          on short term consultants on the technical committees for the various studies. This is a major
          achievement for a project that was implemented over a tedious 5 years and with a modest total
          project expenditure of only $5.77 million.

      •   On the negative side'a substantial cost to TAF has been the long period of implementation to
          achieve the outcomes. In an environment in which making progress on development projects
          is urgent any delays in receiving the results of technical assistance is a substantial cost and
          reduces the "present value" of the studies.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.    The TAF remains highly relevant to development planning in Sudan since there is an urgent
need to have an institution which will, support national planning, efforts with well designed
development programs and projects.

61.      At the close of the project seven sound studies and programs had been completed which will
deliver substantial benefits over a long period over time. TAF's efficacy is therefore rated as
satisfactory. TAF generated considerable and sustainable institutional as well as substantive benefits
because of the high quality Qf the studies and training.                                             '

62.       TAF's overall outcome is rated as.moderately satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63.      All studies and programs, if implemented and sustained will have a positive impact on poverty
reduction because of the anticipated impact on growth, employment and income generation. Given that
studies (e.g. for health and transport sectors) have not yet been translated, into investment activities or
programs real impacts on citizens cannot be ascertained at this time. However, the capacity building
assistance for local training which was targeted to public employees has had positive impacts. For
example, a large proportion of training program participants were women (about 70 percent), and
review/consultation indicate that they were satisfied with program content and its usefulness (see
Annex 5 on training for mote details).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
                                                    16

 64.      Institutional development, which would improve the government's capacity to undertake
 effective national planning, was the primary objective of this project. In fact, this function has been
 institutionalized within the newly created Directorate of Planning, Studies and Policy in the MOFNE.

 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

 65.     There were no unintended consequences

 3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

 66.     This isa core ICRand hence there was no survey of beneficiaries or stakeholder workshop,
 but there were assessments of the training activities and also a series of interviews with the chairs of
 the technical committees for all studies. These assessments and interviews are summarized in Annex 5.

 4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 67.      It is difficult to assess the risk to development outcome for TAF (in other words the
 sustainability of an institution of T AF as an inStitution). On the other hand there are indications that
 activities similar to those of TAF could be sustained by the recently established Directorate. of
 Planning, Studies and Policy in the MOFNE. Assuming the TAF concept is mainstreamed within the
 Government, as appears to be the intention of the MOFNE, then the risk of activities similar to those
 TAF has undertaken in the past not being sustained· in the future is rated moderately satisfactory. It is.
 important to note that the present political and institutional context introduces particular uncertainties
 which are difficult to assess 01' accurately predict at this time.

 5. Assessment of )Jank and Borrower Performance

 5.1 Bank Performance

 (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 68.     The Bank, which undertook the appraisal of TAF for the MDTF-NS Technical Secretariat,
 provided a satisfactory intellectual and institutional basis of the project with a clear vision for its
 intermediate and final strategic outcomes. The time frame for TAF's implementation (only two years
 from the date of approval) was clearly much too optimistic given the circumstances for
 implementation by the Government of any externally financed project in Sudan at the time.

 (b) Quality of Supervision

 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 69.     The first TIL for TAF for all of the design stages and almost half of its implementation period
 was the manager of the Technical Secretariat who was also the Bank's Country Manager in Khartoum.
 This changed in September 2007 when a new TIL was appointed and he was then replaced in August
 2009 by the third TIL who continued as TIL until the project closed.
                                                  17

70.      At the time of project approval in January, 2006 to October the same year the Bank office in
Khartoum did not have access to the Bank's electronic network which created difficulties for Bank
staff but also for TCU staff who had no access to the internet for about nine months at the start of the
project and depended on Bank staff in Khartoum to perform standard functions such as publishing
requests for expressions of interest for cOiliracts. During most of the first year of TAF's
implementation aU such activities needed to be done on an exceptional basis with the support of Bank
coUeagues in headquarters.

71.      The Bank supervised TAF implementation with frequent mISSIOns, specialist advice on
procurement and considerable virtual support through E Mails once the TAF staff was connected to the
internet and even then all electronic communication with TAF staff was through their personal EMail
systems. Until September, 2007 when the second TTL for T AF was appointed some decisions were
delayed because the first TTL was not in a position to devote as much time as he would have liked to
interact with the TAF Coordinator and the TCU. On the other hand supervision missions were intense,
comprehensive aide memo ires were prepared and TAF received considerable hands on support on
procurement issues from the Bank throughout its implementation period. Financial management and
procurement specialists were not appointed to the Bank's office in Khartoum until early 2007 and
therefore for the first 12 months of implementation aU specialist fmancia! management and
procurement support came from either Bank headquarters, from the Monitoring Agent, or in the case
of procurement from a designated consultant.

72.     The Bank was, however, criticized by the MOFNE on a number of occasions for delaying the
implementation of studies. The Bank certainly did delay issuing "no objections" for requests for
proposals (RFPs). For example, the Bank frequently raised questions on the terms ofreference for the
studies because objectives were not clear. In other cases the conditions for contract payments were
vague or other aspects of the RFPs were incomplete. In one case questions that arose during contract
negotiations also delayed implementation. These questions certainly substantially increased the time
needed before RFPs were approved and issued, contracts signed and studies completed. On balance
the Bank considers that it was worth waiting for a good TORs, high quality RFPs and sound contracts
because, for example, when one study report did not compiy with the terms of reference the corrective
action required was clear. In addition, except for this one study there were no implementation
problems and the final outcomes of studies were satisfactory.

73.     As mentioned earlier in this ICR, the TAF Coordinator did not fully concur with the Bank's
recommendation or the regarding the recruitment of an external advisor for the project. It was the
Bank's view that TAF as an institution would not fully benefit from using the services of an external
advisor since sllch action often does not lead to the development of internal capacity of government in
project management.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.    In the light of the assessment of the Bank's performance above, and giving most weight to the
Bank's support for supervision, the Bank's overall performance was rated as moderately satisfactory


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
                                                      18



Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.     The Government took ownership of TAP from the start and was fully supportive of its
objectives and its implementation. The Under-Secretary chaired the Steering Committee meetings and
also ensured that adequate financial resources were available from the MOFNE to meet the
Government's financial commitments. As mentioned already, at the end of the project, the MOFNE
met TAFs·institutional objectives through the mainstreamil1g of the TAF PIU's functions in the newly
formed Directorate of Planning, Studies and Policy - thereby ensuring TAF's sustainability.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.      TAF was led by a Coordinator who succeeded, despite various challenges, in managing (I.e.
procurement,financial management and operations functions) the work program ofthe PIU. Among
these challenges were problems associated with the lack of relative experience of the PIU staff in
various areas of project administration. During the project's early stages the quarterly reports did not
provide adequate information for effectively monitoring and evaluating the progress of project
activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.       Overall borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory in view of the above.

6.~sonsLearned


      (i) Technical assistance for capacity building in fragile environments should especially cater to
          design and sequence flexibility, and learning needs of stakeholders.

      (ii) TAF had a broad impact in improving the capacity of government ministries in planning and
           implementation through the successful completion of the various highly technical studies.
           These studies provided government with the required knowledge in effective planning and
           motivated the sectors in pUrsuing the reform agenda.

      (iii) Sustainable technical assistance institutions can only be successful if there is a clear vision of
            objectives and mandate.

      (iv) The technical assistance management needs to have a competent staff trained in procurement
           and financial management as well as project management especially during the initial phase of
           the project.

      (v) High level ownership of the various sectors through the establishment of technical committees
          contributed to the successful completion of the various high level studies under the project.

      (vi)A technical assistance institution such as TAF can have a substantial positive impact on the
          capacity of government institutions when training is made as a major part of its mandate. In
          addition, the capacity acquired by TAF staff during the project resulted in the establishment of
          the new Directorate of Planning, Studies and Policy in the MOFNE. The new directorate
                                                  19

        provides intellectual support for national planning and design of development programs and
        projects.

    (vii) Lack of clarity of draft tenns of reference caused delays in undertaking the studies during
        the early stages of the project. This was add~ssed tbroughthe recruitment qf specialized
        consultants retained tq provide support in preparing adequate TORs.       '           .

    (viii) Provision of training is a key element of capacity building. Linking and sequencing domestic
         and international training opportunities can enhance the value and relevanc~ of capaCity
         building programs; as well as absorption capacity for trainees and ensure appropriate selection
         of candidates nominated for international training opportunities.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by GranteelImplementing AgenciesJDonors

(_> GranteelImplementing agencies
78.     The Government's ICR for TAF (see Annex 7, Section 5) concluded that TAF's design
should have been modeled on the Project Preparation Unit (pPU) in the former Ministry of Planning
mentioned in Section 2.1 of this ICR and also was critical that the PPU was not mentioned in the
Project Proposal Document for TAF (Annex 7, Section 6).

    •   The PPD mentioned the functions of the former Ministry of Planning (paragraph 30) bQt made
        it clear that TAF was seen as different from the PPU indicating that "The establishment of the
        TAF unit will re-invigorate a rigorous planning perspective in the MOFNE and prnvide a
        model for the planning departments in other ministries." The PPU was appropriate during its
                                                                                    be
        time but the project preparation functions of the fonner PPU can now _ easily done by
        individual ministries. The current challenge is to focus more on sectoral analysis and- national
        planning and leave the project preparation to the line ministries.

79.     The Govemment's ICR also stated in its section on "Lessons Learned" that" ... the objectives
of TAF were diversified and over ambitious given the amount of financing, timeframe of the project
and size and quality of staff and their organizational setup. The role of TAF should concentrate on
coordinating the activities' of project preparation and training in the same area. Such role could be
carried out on.a sustained basis as demonstrated by the successful experience of the PPU. - Other
issues relating to sectoral strategy and policy planning and overall national economic management
should be the responsibility of the relevant directorates of the MFNE (Annex 7, Section 7).

    •   There is no question that the "final strategic outcomes" in TAF's results matrix were
        ambitious but as an institutional objective this was agreed to be appropriate at appraisal among
        all parties. TAF was not able to meet this objective within the time frame and resources it had
        available. Nevertheless, as an institution TAF (perhaps under a different name) now has that
        opportunity in the newly established Directorate of Planning, Studies and Policies in the
        MOFNE to meet the final strategic outcome or higher goal.                           -

80.     The Government's ICR also refers to the lack of a monitoring and evaluation system (Annex 7,
Section 5). .                                                                         - -

   •    Apart from-the important role of the quarterly reports that were required fromTAF, the results
        matrix provided the M&E framework for a regular assessment of TAF'sprogress. This
        regular assessment was the core of almost all Aide Memoires prepared by Bank supervision

The table below provides a list of all workshop training programs in Sudan. It reflects the broad scope
of     training provided, even though the demand for training in subjects such as procurement,
monitoring      evaluation and project design meant that these programs were repeated a number of
times. TAF had planned to hold 26 workshops and in the event it was possible to arrange 25. This
number      exceeded the number originally envisaged in the Project Proposal Document.

Workshops were arranged by TAF but implementation was by various experts ranging from
Government Ministry staff, to Sudanese and international consultants, staff from World Bank Institute,
the Management Development Centre, the Sudan University for Technology, the National Centre for
Accounting Studies and Science as well as the Development Studies and Research Institute in the
University of Khartoum.. The DSru arranged most of the training workshops during the period -
December, 2009 and January 2010.

.International Training

The project funded and successfully implemented international and domestic training (Building the
Health Planning and Management Capacities of the States) to improve public health management in
the states. The training activities strengthened the capacity of the federal Ministry of Health and the
Public Health Institute to provide their own training activities. Thus, the two latter institutions intends
to utilize the program's training of trainers program and the public health training templates used by
the University of Washington in the USA (the consultant for the program). In addition a strong
professional relationship has been developed between the federal Ministry of Health and the
University of Washington for launching future joint capacity building activities. There is great
confidence, therefore, that this program has estabHshed a sustainable model for scaling up the public
health management training capacity in the state and federal ministries of health. A draft report on the
outcome of the program is being considered by the Ministry of Health and follow up training is being
planned.

Furthermore. ten (10) government staff were planned to be sent for international training each year.
However, by the time TAF closed only twenty one (21) federal and state government staff had been
sent to international training. This was mam!y due to the difficulties in the identification of qualified
candidates for international training. Also, close scrutiny of the candidates were undertaken to ensure
that the training proposal was relevant to the skill profile and current activities of applicants. While
supervision missions regularly requested reports by the international trainees on their experience, no
reports were received. However, during discussions held with focal persons during the ICR interviews
conducted in February 2010, the beneficiaries confmned that the training activities helped f'urth.er
educate the staff and helped them to learn of new state of the art knowledge on the various topics of
the training. The following table provides the list of international training carried out.

Review of the Structure oCtile Sudan Gezira Bollrd ($113,752). The report was used to re-organize
the SGB in October, 2009. The impact was a substantial change in structure and a considerable
reduction in staff. Approximately 4,150 staff was terminated in October, 2009 although 75 were
immediately re-hired for 6 months to perform essential tasks in the scheme. During March of 2010 the
recommendations of the consultant report were used to complete the structural changes in the SGS and
by July, 2010 it was expected that contract would number about 325 staff in the key positions. It has
been estimated by the SGB that costs for these staff will be 60 percent less than before the
restructuring of the SGB resulting in major benefits for farmers, the federal budget and the pational
economy.

which the MOFNE had proposed.

Sustainable Development of Semi-Mechanized Farming ($685,583). The study provided an in-
depth analysis of problems facing semi-mechanized farming areas in Sudan. It provided detailed
recommendations on technical strategies for sustainable farming in these areas, but the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry did not consider that the recommendations on policy were comprehensive
enou&h despite the fact that the terms of reference were clear about the i'\'eed for report to draw
conclusions on the policy actions needed. The Ministry is therefore arranging an intensive and high
level workshop to formulate policies for the rehabilitation and future sustainable development of semi-
mechanized farming in Sudan. The workshop was held on May 12,2010 in Khartoum.

  National Transport Master Plan ($1,496,100). This comprehensive study proposes a future
. transport policy and a 20 year investment program based on that policy with an estimated cost of $11
  billion for both Northern and Southern Sudan. The report was prepared with the consistent
                                                  26

involvement of stakeholders through technical committees which supported the consultant's work as
well as workshops with broad representation from the public and private sectors to discuss draft
versions of the report. The transport ministries concerned in Northern and Southern Sudan regard this
comprehensive report as a major sustainable contribution to their decisions on priorities for the future
strategy and transport public investment program. The Ministry of Transport, Roads and Bridges has
established transport sector reform taskforce whose responsibilities include the promotion and
implementation of policies recommended under the National Transport Master Plan. The first follow
up activity in the plan was to be a "Review by Major Stakeholders" in March, 2010. This was not held
but a workshop to consider the policy implications of the report is being planned by the Ministry of
Transport after the new Government has been formed following the elections.

Building the Health Planning and Management Capacities of the States $696,339). This program
was a highly successful international and domestic training and capacity building program for the
improvement of public health management in the states. It strengthened the capacity of the federal
Ministry of Health and the Public Health Institute to provide their own training activities because they
will be able to use this program's training of trainers program and the public health training templates
used by the University of Washington in the USA (the consultant for the program). In addition a
strong professional relationship has been developed between the federal Ministry of Health and the
University of Washington for launching future joint capacity building activities. There is great
confidence, therefore, that this program has established a sustainable model for scaling up the public
health management training capacity in the state and federal ministries of health. A draft report on the
outcome of the program is being considered by the Ministry of Health and follow up training is being
planned.

Agricultural Support Services ($129,800). The study ultimately provided a satisfactory draft project
proposal after the first draft had been rejected because it did not comply with the terms of reference.
An MDTF project, based on the report, was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in
collaboration with the World Bank and submitted to the Oversight Committee. The project was not
approved by the Committee because the scope of the final project proposal was substantially different
from the initial project proposal in which the scope was restricted to the Three Areas. Among other
objections raised by the Committee was the view that the project's implementation period, constrained
by the life of the MDTF, was too short for an adequate extension of improved agricultural technologies.
The prepared project will, however, remain as a basis for the improvement of agricultural services
when adequate financial support is available to implement the project.

Rehabilitation and Development of Faculties of Education ($94,875). The study provided a
detailed plan for the improvement of the infrastructure and curricula of education faculties which train
basic education teachers. The report was not used in the preparation of the MDTF-Basic Education
project because the project was narrowly focused on basic education facilities. On the other hand
officials in the Ministry of Higher Education declared the report has been extremely valuable because
(a) it has been recommended as a model for similar studies in the Ministry; (b) it is being used as the
template for a study of infrastructure and curricula in secondary education; and (c) it was used as the
basis for a submission to the Higher Council on Education in 2009 on curriculum development in
higher education. The report has also been sent to all Vice Chancellors of relevant universities with
the hope that funding for the improvement of education faculty infrastructure and their curricula can be
found.

Capacity Building in Environmental Management ($184,266). This study prepared a draft project
proposal for capacity building to strengthen the GONU's ability to implement environmental laws. It
was completed at the end of November, 2009 but there are high expectations among members of the
                                                      can be used to prepare a project to ' .... "'r'\v'"  capacity of the
                                 eIClpl1:leri1.   and Environment Plans are being made              a foHow up workshop.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
There was no economic and financial analysis of the project at appraisal and none was
attempted at completion because it is impossible to quantify the benefit and cost streams for a
technical assistance institution. Nevertheless a number of qualitative benefits and costs can be
identified for T AF.

Three significant and sustainable benefits from TAF can be anticipated, namely:

    •   Mainstreaming ofTAF as an institution into the Directorate of Planning, Studies and Policy in
        the MOFNE which will strengthen future national resulting in significant benefits from the
        national point of view
    •   The studies will, if implemented or followed up by policy change and investments, be capable
        of generating substantial benefits to growth, human development and poverty reduction.
    •   The training program through 25 workshops with a typical attendance of 25 to 30, and 21
        external training opportunities for individuals should have a substantial current and lasting
        impact on the quality of staff work in connection with development programs.

On the cost side there are positive and negative outcomes.

    •   On the positive side TAF has been quite efficient in the use of its administrative funds which
        absorbed only about 15.6 percent of expenditures which included the substantial expenditures
        on short term consultants on the technical committees for the various studies. This is a major
        achievement for a project that was implemented 'over a tedious 5 years and with a modest total
        project expenditure of only $5.77 million..

    •   On the negative side a substantial cost to TAF has been the long period of implementation to
        achieve the outcomes. In an environment in which making progress on development projects
        is urgent, any delays in receiving the results of technical assistance is a substantial cost and
        reduces the "present value" of the studies.

While mos~ ofthedQ":1~stic training workShops were held in Khartoum, the trainees came from all the
northern states as well as from Southern Sudan (mainly Juba) but there were many moretraipees from
the central govemmentthan the states or Southern Sudan. Tminees came from a wi." range of
ministries and professions and about 70,percent of them were female.

TAF arranged for an evaluation of the training program from project start up to November, 2'009 by a
                           a
consultant who was former World Bank staff member. 13 The summary o(the evaluation stated that:

            services. This result was not evaluated by the consultant.

The Development Studies and Research Institute provided an evaluation of the nine workshops it
arranged and summarized its experience as follows: 14

       •   close to 97 percent of the participants stated that the training met their expectations and
           needs and consequently achieved the stated objectives.
       •   about 95 percent of the participants said the training has included all the topics and
           information they perceived important to their work.
       •   the training medium of instruction was English!Arabic according to the preliminary
           consultation with the participants at the start of each training course. This was accepted by
           99 percent of the participants as useful and appropriate training language.

           11 percent made recommendation, on the importance of making ~e training highly

                          Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


Although a stakeholder workshop was not held, the Bank conducted interviews during the last
supervision mission for TAF in February 2010 with the chairs of the technical committees (TCs) and
their delegates on the results of the sector studies and the feasibility studies. They ranked the studies
according to six criteria shown in the table below. The table also shows the range of the rankings for
the seven studies that were rated, the average ranking as well as the rankings weighted by cost of the
studies. The unweighted and weighted average impact ratings without the Agricultural Services
project were 5.5 and 5.1; the unweighted and weighted ratings indicate that on the basis of all except
one criterion the studies were regarded by the clients as satisfactory. The only criterion not fully
satisfactory was TC remuneration. This is a difficult criterion to judge but TC chairs were all adamant
that, while they felt the remuneration of the TC members was not adequate in relation to the time and
energy they devoted to the task, everyone had benefitted from the TCs

        Range and Average Rankings of Outcomes of Completed Studies financed by TAF




Note: Rankings were indicated by the following scores: Highly satisfactory=6; Satisfactory=5; Moderately
Satisfactory=4; Moderately Unsatisfactory=3, Unsatisfactory=2 and Highly Unsatisfactory=l. The study for
which the impact was rated as 0 was the study on Improving Agricultural Support Services in Traditional
Rainfed Farming Areas where there had not yet been any follow up in terms of a project (see Annex 2 of this
ICR).
These ranking were based on interviews of the chairs of technical committees by the World Bank supervision
mission at the close of the project. For half of the studies the chairs were not available for interview; in these
cases the chairs of the committees were represented by a designated member of the technical committees.

This summary evaluation does not cover the Public-Private Sector Dialogue because it was not completed.

The project development objectives were to assist the GONU, .states governments and corporations to
strengthen their professional and technical capacities to·· identify, design, prepare, appraise and
implement development programs and proj ects derived· from the JAM Framework for Sustained Peace,
Development and Poverty Eradication. To achieve these objectives, a coordinating unit was
established in the MOFNE. The unit is lead by a' steering committee (sq which is responsible for
reviewing and'approvingtechnical assistance proposals submitted to it by the unit.

The project was designed to provide urgently needed professional and technical sqpP0rt ~o strengthen
the capacity of sectoral and line agencies to formulate programs and projects that will support the rapid
development of the national ecollomy and reduce poverty..

3. Key Facto~ Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The key development outcome is to provide technical assistance to enhance the quality and relevance
of public sector projects and programs (including those submitted to the MDTF for assistance) and
thereby enhance the efficiency wi~ which the MDTF ..is us.ed .py central and state government
ministries and agencies: This project will finally contribute to strengthening the MOFNE planning
capacity in the longer term because the proposed TAF Coordinatini Unit and the Steering Committee
will become core institutions in Jhe Ministry for the review ofanalytical studies aimed at evaluating
priorities among a range of policy and ,investnient options for Sudan's future development.

While the project background analysis, rationale.and concept were sound and timely and in line with
the JAM Framework an<iGONU strategies, yet the project was faced by some key factors that affected
its implementation and outcomes. These factorsare summarized below.
                                                  39

3.1 The project design was weak in terms of stated objectives, timeframe, management structure,
proposed financing, technical assistance recommended for the project and monitoring and evaluation
plan and system. These issues are elaborated below.

    a) The project objectives were considered mUlti-purpose and ambitious to be fulfilled given the
       scope and scale of the project, the management structure of its staff and their responsibilities,
       the timeframe of two years for implementation and the amount of grant fund of only US$S.O
       million allocated to the project from MDTF. Clearly defmed and more realistic objectives are
       necessary pre-requisites for the success of the project.

    b) The two years' time planned to implement the project was underestimated. The project became
       effective April 2006 and the first installment of the grant of US$500.000 received by the
       project was in May 2006. Yet, the project was scheduled to be completed by the original
       closing date Dec.3!, 2007. The project management structure and implementation
       arrangements took longer time than anticipated. Eventually, the closing date was to be
       extended up to Jan.31, 2010.

    c) The project management structure was inadequate in light of the project objectives. Staffmg
       should had included, in addition to the TCU Coordinator, the fmancial specialist and. the
       procurement specialist, other economists knowledgeable and experienced in project
       preparation and analysis in various sectors to include agriculture and rural development, infra-
       structure and services.

    d) The fmancing for the project ofUS$ 5.0 million from the MDTF was a small amount in light
       of the problem identified by the project document and the objectives thereof. This reflected the
       low degree of support given to the project by the donors and the World Bank.. This situation
       did not encourage the government to give enough weight to the implementation of the project
       in its initial stage in terms of proper staffing. The former PPU had received substantial
       fmancing and stronger technical support from donors, including IDA, which encouraged the
       government to provide the required facilities and staffmg which enabled the PPU to carry out
       its functions effectively.

    e) The technical assistance which was supposed to be provided by an international management
       advisor to the project in its first year, as was emphasized by the project proposal document,
       was inadequate in quality and time. The advisor who was recommended by the World Bank
       was expected to provide guidance on policies, procedures and monitoring system.
       Unfortunately, her performance was not up to the standard and her contribution was limited as
       stated by TCU staff. This situation adversely affected the implementation of the project.

    f) Project implementation had been weakened by the Lack of monitoring and evaluation plan and
       system.

3.2 The project operations were constrained by weaknesses in fmancial and procurement management
due to difficulty in adequately staffmg the project.

3.3 The Steering Committee which was supposed to work as the executive body of the project was not
functioning smoothly. The committee cotIlprises senior government officials who were fully engaged
with their own responsibilities and this made it difficult for them to meet as and when required. The
committee was, however, strengthened at a later date by two academicians who enriched its
discussions.
                                                  40

3.4 World Bank procurement procedures were lengthy and time consuming and this was coupled with .
weaknesses in the project procurement management which resulted in considerable delays in
implementation;

3.5 The working relationship between TeU and the World Bank office in Khartoum was at low level.
This might be due to the fact that the TOR and responsibilities of the Bank as the grant administrator,
the monitoring agent and the project task team leader were not sharply defined.

4.1 Intermediate Outcome 1: (I'o establish an effective institution within the Ministry ofFinance and
National Economy that can channel technical support to all government· institutions to assist them
develop public sector projects and programs.)

The project became effective April 2006 and Teu was established during the same year. The
implementation of the project was characterized by a slow progress during the initial stage due to
difficulties in adequately staffing the project and weaknesses in procurement and financial
management and also due to the ineffectiveness of the management advisor to technically support the
project. Following the strengthening of TeU, the project implementation picked up and significant
progress was made thereafter. Almost all planned activities were undertaken and were expected to be
completed by the revised closing date Jan.~l; 2010. The major management issues which include
procurement and financial management are discussed hereunder.

    a) Procurement management. Management of procurement and in particular selection of
       consulting  rums for major studies represented an important function of TeU. At the initial
       stage of project operations, TeU capacity to implement procurement procedures was not
       adequate. The problem was solved by recruitment of a procurement specialist early 2007 for
       about two years till Sep. 2009 when he was replaced by a: trained TeU staff. Procurement.
       process followed IDA guidelines and proceeded satisfactorily. The status of the project major
       procurement component (consulting services) is detailed in the Table below.

       Grant Agreement.

    b) Financial management. The project fmancial management remained a major issue since its
       start due to difficulty in recruiting a qualified financial specialist until early 2007 when a
       qualified specialist was appointed and the project implementation had improved thereafter.
       The TCU reported that even the outstanding financial issues raised by the World Bank
       supervision mission in its Aide Memoire ofNov.8-12, 2009 were resolved. These issues were
       namely a) unrecovered funds ofUS$ 3,756 from the authorized allocation ofUS$500,000, b)
       payments to technical committee members who had managed the major studies, and c)
       information for the interim financial reports.

       The project expenditure by component / category up to July 29,2010 is shown in table below
       which indicates an overall expenditure of85% out of the original proposal estimate. However,
       the project financing position is given in Table (4). It can be seen that for MDTF financing, the
       cumulative receipts amounted to US$ 4.9 million out of the grant allocation ofUS$5.0 million
       i.e. overall disbursement utilization of 98% which is considerably above average. The
       cumulative counterpart funds received from the GONU amounted to equivalent of US$
       867,121 compared to original estimate at project proposal ofUS$ 678,800 i.e. an increase of
       27.7% which indicates that the GONU had met more than its financial commitment towards
       the project.

4.2 Intermediate Outcome II: (An· increase in piPeline investment projects suitable for grantlloan
financing in strategic sectors such as infrastructure, agriculture, and rural development).

The project core component (consulting services) faced considerable delays in implementation mainly
in areas of preparation and clearance of TOR, preparation of shOrt list of consultants, provision of the
Bank no-objection, request for proposals and the technical and fulancial evaluation of proposals.

On resolving. the procurement constraint through the appointment of a pr60urement specialist in early
2007, the project was able to move forward and a number of studies and program proposals were
undertaken. Seven 'projec~ had been successfully completed and one prqject was suspended and part
                                                                    to

As a result of the lowrespon~e received from government states. in preparing well designed study
proposals that meet the World.Bank Template requirements and be in conformity with the JAM Report
Framework and GONU Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, TCU 'launch~ in 2008 need assessment
missions led by reputable local consultants to undertake the assignment. Ten states were visited by the
missions and some fifty four study proposals were identified,· three of which were approved by the
Steering Committee and the remaining proposals were in the pipeline. The total estimated cost of these
states study proposals amounted to equivalent of US$ 9.8 million which need additional funds for
fmancing.

4.3 Intermediate Outcome m: (lmprovedcapadty of centrai and state ministries to formulate,
design, prepare, and implement development programs and project).

T AF had designed and delivered a training program targeting the staff of the federal and state line
ministries .This program was conducted through internal workshops, external training and state
sensitization visits, with the assistance of local and external trainers. Review and evaluation of these
three interrelated capacity building activities are considered Qelow:
                                                                     j




  a) Internal Training Program. TAF plan was tailored, within the original two year dl,lration of
       the project, to design and implement 10 internal training workshops of two -week's dUration
       each, targeting an estimated 300 trainee representing the' federal and state levels. Tlie pace of
       training delivery was initially not in line with the plan. There was a quick start, but it then
       slowed down due to the delay in receiving the grant first advance payment and the delay in
       replenishment. This situation necessitates readjustment of the project training component.
       Consequently, TAF'had.managed to discharge the training activity more effectively to the extent
     . of surpassing the planned number of intern~l training through actual delivery of 28 workshops
    ., (i.e. 7.6 % increase) with a total of 797 participants. This achievement in the quantity of training
       workshops was made possible. by reallocating part of the funds earmarked for the Public -
       Private Dialogue Forum in agreement with IDA. The sharp increase of executing 13 workshops
                                                 43

    during January 2010 was attributed to the availability of funds and to the employment of
    renounced training institutions by TCU to assist in the implementation of the workshops such as
    the Development Studies Centre of University of Khartoum and the Management Development .
    Centre. Assistance was also provided by an ex-World Bank consultant.

    The undertaken workshops focused on Procurement Management, Project Design and
    Management, Monitoring and Evaluation for Results, Poverty Measurement, Targeting and
    Making Budget Pro-poor, Financial Management, Designing a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan,
    Public Finance Management, Formulation of Feasibility Studies, the Role of Informal Sector in
    Development, Social Indicators, Micro-finance and Computer Skills.
                                               ,
    Initial Selection of participants and subsequent workshop monitoring criteria was based on
    specific questionnaire formats which were subject for synthesis and evaluation procedures.

    The workshop attendees cover a wide spectrum ofadministrative position levels including entry,
    middle and top ranking officials in the federal and state governments. However; break down
    information on the administrative position level of the workshop participants was available for
    seven of the conducted training sessions only. Critical analysis of this important parameter from
    pooling the available data indicate that entry, middle and top position levels of the trainee record
    7.3 %,62.6 % and 30.1 % respectively. On the other hand, federal and states quota reached
    65.7% and 34.3 % in the same order.




b) External Training. The external training component was initially planned to address areas of
   financial management, project design and management, procurement management, feasibility
   studies, monitoring and evaluation and planning and management of development projects.
   Twenty one candidates had benefited from· this program representing federal ministries (9),
   states (8), and TCU Technical staff.
                                                   44

        The delay in the implementation of the external training program as reported by TAP due to the
        late receipt of the mandatory no objection from the World Bank Country Manager (approved
        November 28th, 2008) and the required consent of the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance
        and National Economy (MOFNE), (January 16th, 2009)

  c) Sensitization Workshops (State Visits). TAP carried out (10) sensitization workshops.
     Local consultants assisted by TAP staff members were contracted to lead need assessment
     missions to the states. The terms of reference of the consultant were:

           i.    To conduct sensitization workshops and brain storming dialogue with the
         concerned authorities in the states aiming at providing a general overview of JAM
         cluster and TAF mandate and explaining their templates, funding criteria and windows
         as well as assessing the state priority needs for development and investment study
         proposals and capacity bUilding.

          it     To formulate quality study proposals based on the identified development and
         investment needs of the states in the different productive, services and infrastructure
         sectors for possible funding consideration by T AF (MDTF) and submit a detailed
         report on the mission findings.

4.4 Assessment of Capacity-building Component

The accomplishments of TAF unit with respect to the three capacity building components, internal
workshops, sensitization and external training,. are believed to be very useful and positive in that:

   i.    The unit managed to acquire a good deal of sensitization and basic information on its
         clients and targeted beneficiaries that are useful for planning and improving service
         delivery.
  n.     The unit staff and the federal and state target beneficiaries have been exposed to
         training abroad which is likely to improve their expertise and technical know-how and
         functional performance.
 iii.    The unit was able to establish new partnerships and improving collaboration with
         existing partners.

In view of the satisfactory outcomes, performance could have been substantially improved by giving
more thrust and focus on project preparation and financial and procurement management through
prolonged courses and field work case study tutorials. TAF needs, if repeated, to better define
efficiency objectives, track efficiency outcomes, and enhance support to public-private partnerships
and improve collaboration and joint sector work with the unit in the area of capacity building.
Institutional mechanisms and an integrated approach are highly needed to improve coordination across
the functional planning units.

The challenges of capacity building vary markedly across states and sectors. While TAF has adopted
during its lifespan capacity building approaches that suit the prevailing conditions of the still weak
public sector in the war affected states, the need is still there to develop sector- specific guidance on
diagnosing capacity needs and evaluating capacity building measures.

5. Assessment of the Government Performance
                                                    45

   i.   A key factor that influenced the implementation of the project can be attributed to the low
        level of commitment of the government (represented by the MOFNE) to the project. This
        degree of commitment was reflected in the inactive role in the preparation of the project
        document, the negligence of the experience of the former PPU, the lack of appreciation of the
        acute need for external technical expertise to assist in the establishment of the project, and the
        quality of the staff assigned to the project and their instability. This lack of enthusiasm might
        be attributed to the small size of the grant and to the fact that its proceeds were already
        allocated to certain studies before the effectiveness of the project. On the financial aspect,
        however, the government showed strong commitment by contributing to the project above its
        assigned share of finance as previously indicated in the fmancial management section of this
        report.

 ii.    According to the institutional arrangements of the project the TCU has to assess the relevance
        of the study proposals it receives from the various units to the JAM Framework and submit
        them for approval by the SC and the technical secretariat of the MDTF. In the absence of a
        central body that decides on the order of priority of these proposals, the question of priority is
        left to the TCU and SC who may find themselves practically inclined to adopt a "first come
        first serve approach"

 m.     The lack of a monitoring and evaluation system and plan in TCU was one of the weaknesses
        of the project. It seems that there was some sort of misunderstanding as to who should design
        thIS system and prepare the plan. The unit had, therefore, to rely on the procurement plans as
        monitoring tools. The problem with these plans is that they do not take into account the
        activities relating to the receipt and processing of proposals prior to the procurement plan.

6. Assessment of the World Bank Performance

  i.    The project document was prepared jointly by the MFNE and IDA with the latter
        playing an active role. Unfortunately many of the lessons learned from the successful
        experience of the former PPU in the dissolved MPNE were not made use of. In fact
        there is no reference to this experience in that document This fact seems to have been
        the origin of most of the problems and difficulties encountered during implementation
        of the project.

 ii.    IDA Staff who played an important role in the formulation ·of the project had also
        assumed the responsibility of supervising its implementation. The consultants believe
        that this double role might have lessened the chances of revising the project to take
        into account the experience of the former PPU and the consequences of its dissolution.
        Such a revision could have led to redesigning the project to:

        a) focus on project preparation,
        b) reformulate the project objectives accordingly and make them much more realistic,
        c) increase the size of the grant and extend its timeframe to.encourage potential
           beneficiaries to apply for technical assistance,
        d) develop strict criteria for the selection of the project staff and a suitable salaries
           schedule and;
        e) emphasize the need. for technical expertise with clearly defined TOR and selection
           procedure.

  i.       The manager of the Bank's office in Khartoum was supposed to be the Tas~ Team
           Leader(T'rL) oftJ,te proj¢ot,' But beCause'of'his engagementintlie duties of his office
           he designated an: IDA cdtlsilltaiifto aetas a TTL. As a result ofthls and in the absence
           of an able project matlagement advisor the 'designated consultant had to make more
           than the planned, yis~ts to ~artoum to e,,&lua~ the sta1usof implemeJltation and assist

            Agent (MA) to. monitor expenditures related to the activities financed under the grant
            to ensure that the proceeds of the grant are disbursed only for the intended purposes
            and according to IDA's regulations and procedures.

.iii.      But because there was no clear TOR as to how the MA will carry out these duties they
           did not confme themselves to their strictly defmed financial iup.ctions and began to act
          '. as
              TTL. and interVe~e in the technical aspects of the project. This unfortunate
           development may have influenced the working relationship between the TeU and the
           MA.                             ' ,

7. Lessons learned

                                                    a
The implementation of the project haspr()vided number:ofles~ns that have to betaJ<en into
consideration in designing future projectS. These are as follows:     .

        a) The experience of a previous similar local project should have been made use of when
            designing this project. Reference is made her~ to tb,e former Proje9t Preparation Unit (PPU) of
            the Ministry of Planning and National Economy (MPNE) which was established in Aug. 1976
          . with a strong technical. assistance apd. finance .from IDA, Kuwait. Fund, ,.UNDP and the
          . Gov~rnm~t of Sudan .. Jhat unit continued fQnctioning' satisfactory till the dissolution of the
            said miriistiy in early nineties. Obviously, the lessons learned from the PPU experience could
            have helped in designing the' TAF' project with respect to objectives, components, activities
            and institutional setup.                                                      .
                               ,   ,"                                             ,   ~




        b) Clearly defined and realistic objectives are necessary pre-requisites for' the success of any
           project. The consultants think that the objectives of TAF were diversified and over ambitious
           given the amount 'o.f fmancing, timefrmne of the project and size 'and quality of staff and their
           organizational setup.

        c) The role of TAFshoul.d conc~ntrateon coordinating th~activities of project preparation and
           training in the same area. Such role could, be carried out on a sustained basis as demonstrated
           by the successful experience of the PPU. Other issues relating to sectoral strategy and policy
           planning and overall national economic management should be the responsibility of the
           relevant directorates of the MFNE.                                   .
        d) Institutional arrangements and size and quality of staff are critical for the success of a project.
            They are good predictors of project readiness for implementatio.n and should be taken ~are of
            at the start of the prOject in order to avoid unnecessary 'delays.

   Ie). Measurable performance indicators have'almost the same importance fOr easy, systematic and
        objective monitoring and evaluation.
                                                       47


        f) A necessity for success of a project is the full knowledge of the environment within which the
           project is to be implemented and the proper understanding of possible risks.

        g) The duties of the stakeholders of the project should be clearly determined and lines of
           communication should also be clearly identified.

        h) There has to be suitable criteria for assessing the commitment of the recipient to the project.
           The indicators that reflect this commitment should be subjected to proper analysis.

        i) The size of the project could have positive or negative impacts on potential beneficiaries.
           Larger and wide ranging launching and sensitization program could have increased the ability
           of the management to solicit more technical assistance proposals.

        j) Given the deliverables of the capacity building component indicated in the previous
           paragraphs, the efficacy and effectiveness of such program in direct support of staff at' the
           federal and state level need to be evaluated and further elaborated.

8. Justification and Rationale for the Continuation and Strengthening of TAF

The acute need for the establishment of TAF was clearly manifested in the institutional weaknesses
which constrained the capacity of the federal and states governments units to carry out the activities
concerning, the preparation of development projects. Such tasks were previously undertaken by the
former PPU of the MOPNE. Unfortunately when this unit was dismantled it was not replaced by an
alternative body and project planning activities were left to individual government units to undertake
with no national regulatory and technical guidelines and directives.

According to the Grant Agreement the US$ 5.0 million were considered as a first grant for the
implantation of the first phase of T AF and that the fund will be replenished upon the implementation
of this phase. It is true that TAF was not without problems and· constraints but it managed to fill the
long extending gap which resulted from the dissolution of the PPU. TAF began to move in the right
track and accumulated a reasonable experience that can enable it to carry out its mandate on a
sustained basis. The lessons learned so far will of course help in making some changes in the
objectives, components, activities and institutional arrangements of the second phase. These changes
are recommended below:

   i.      The objectives should be clearly defmed. They should focus on project preparation and the
           related training activities. This would mean that development planning, sectoral studies and
           studies of national economic management issues should be left to the relevant directorates in
           the MOFNE. An efficient and effective coordination mechanism between T AF and these
           directorates could be found.

  ii.      The' size of the grant should be increased considerably to encourage government organs to
           apply for fmancing and hence avoid cases where project studies, financing and execution are
           contracted with the same company or its affiliates.

 iii.      The institutional setup should include a body that can decide on the priority of study proposal
           and ensure the necessary coordination between various projects.

 iv.       If the priority issue is left to the SC it has to be composed of the relevant ministries and should
            include well reputed national academics and experts.
                                                      48


      v.    The SC should not confine its role to approving financing. It should broaden its TOR to be
            more active in outlining a development vision for TAF and implementation policies and
            determining objective criteria for the division of the fund between the centre and the states
            arid among the states according to the national development program.
                                                            .                   .
     vi.    The unit should be properly staffed with qualified and experienced 'personnel and its work
            should be organized on a sectoral basis.

     vii.   The pipeline of investment programs and project proposal profiles already prepared reflect the
            priority of the states and need to be considered for funding.
