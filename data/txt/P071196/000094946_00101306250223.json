The project will finance the\n            Government's purchases of electricity, and associated\n            fuel from short-term independent power producers, and fuel\n            suppliers while the power supply crisis lasts. The project\n            will also finance working capital requirements, for fuel\n            purchases arising from the drought-induced changes in the\n            power generation mix, between hydro, and technical sources,\n            and from reduced revenues caused by local shedding. The\n            project will be beneficial in preventing severe economic\n            contraction, and in providing fast-track reforms in power\n            transmission, and distribution systems, to create a more\n            competitive, and private sector-led system, as agreed under\n            the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Nonetheless,\n            risks include the potential of unrealized net revenues from\n            the domestic share of project financing, which is to be\n            derived from the collection from final consumers; possible\n            coordination problems between the power company, and\n            independent power producers, which may delay timely power\n            connections; and, possible misappropriation of funds.\n            However, well established management practices may well\n            reduce those risks."}, "docdt": "2000-09-14T00:00:00Z"}
