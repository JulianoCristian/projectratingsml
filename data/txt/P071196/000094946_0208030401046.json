This is so,\n            mainly because without additional measures undertaken to\n            strengthen the operations of the Kenya Power and Lighting\n            Company (KPLC), possibly through privatization/contract\n            management, the sustainability of the power sector\n            operations will be uncertain. Similarly, while the\n            Government's commitment to implement the project was\n            strong, it was however, weak in executing the institutional,\n            and policy actions required. Lessons question the provision\n            of emergency recovery support, where policy and\n            institutional factors have played a role in bringing about a\n            crisis situation, and if so, whether such support should be\n            accompanied by reform conditions. The experience with this\n            operation supports the notion that the decision should be\n            based on the implications of the \"with\" and\n            \"without\" emergency support scenarios on growth,\n            and poverty. But since the design of emergency operations\n            require implementation of mitigation measures, the\n            policy/institutional related causes of the emergency would\n            need to be addressed to avoid repeat disasters. Thus, by\n            linking measures to implement reforms, stakeholders would be\n            sensitized on important sector policy issues, and, the\n            Borrower should be required to commit irreversible actions\n            to be taken prior to financing approval."}, "docdt": "2002-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
