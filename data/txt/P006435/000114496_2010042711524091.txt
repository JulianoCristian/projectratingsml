Dear Dr. Choksi
Re:   Municipal Development Project in the State of Parana (Loan
      3100-BR) Local Competitive Bidding and "Tomada  de  Precos"
      Procedures.
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated August 14, 1989 (the Loan Agreement) 
between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the 
State of Parana (the Borrower).  On March 9, 1990, the Bank sent to the Government of 
the Borrower, at the request of the Borrower, a letter which proposed an amendment of 
Sections 2.02 (a), 2.02 (b) (xi) and 3.02 of the Loan Greement to allow for the use of 
"tomada de precos" procedures under local competitive bidding and to eliminate the 
reference to force account.  Section 3.01 (c) of the Loan Agreement was also amended 
to commit the Borrower to provide Us$ 21,000,000 equivalent as a minimum initial 
contribution to the State's Urban Development Fund by December 31, 1990.  These 
changes were consistent with the relevant clauses in a similar project which had been 
aproved for the State of Rio Grande do Sul.
While the Borrower agreed with the conditions related to Sections 2.02 (a), 2.02 
(b) (xi) and 3.02 of the Loan Agreement (see fax of August 15, 1990), it was 
unfortunately not in a position to commit to the condition in 3.01 (c), related to 
provision of the counterpart funds, preventing timely signature of the March 9, 1990 
amendment.  The reasons for this inability to commit funds were primarily due to 
macroeconomic difficulties at the federal and State levels which eroded the Borrower's 
budgetary allocations in real termes; and to subsequent legal and political 
difficulties with the aproval of a budgetary supplement (outlined in greater detail in 
PEDU's 1990 An Monitoring Report).
However, present conditions now allow the Borrower to make such a commitment to 
the provision of counterpart funds, in the amount of US$ 17,000,00 equivalent, by 
December 31, 1991.  This amount is fully consistent with PEDU staff estimates of 
antecipated total project costs, and subsequent need for counterpart funds, during the 
calendar year 1991.Thus, the amendments to Sections 2.02 (a), 2.02 (b) (xi), 3.02, and 
3.01 (c) of the Loan Agreement have been changed and are set forth in the Attachment 
to this letter. The modifications to Section 3.01 (c) constitutes the only change in 
this Attachment from the previous version dated March 9, 1990, originally sent to the 
Borrower by the Bank.
If you agree with the proposed amendments, please sign both copies of this 
letter and return one of the copies to us.
Sincerely yours,
By /s/ ROBERTO REQUIAO DE MELLO E SILVA
Governador do Estado do Parana
