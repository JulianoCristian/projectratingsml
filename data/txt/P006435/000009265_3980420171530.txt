MEMORANDUH AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE OF PARANA
WITH THE GUARANrEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE STATE OF PARANA
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
State of Parana for US$100.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repaid overi1S years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate.   The loan would help finance
municipal infrastructure investments in the State.
2.    Backaround  The rates of urban population growth and household formation
in Brazil were very high during the 19708 (4.42..and 5.72, respectively, per
annum). Although this trend has peaked, over the 1986-95 period urban households
are still projected to increase by 3.7? per annum to a total of 32.7 million by
1995, or almost twice the 1980 total. Parana's own urbanization trend was even
more intensive than for Brazil as a whole (6.02 p.a. for population and 7.32 p.a.
for households during 1970-1980), and projections show an annual rate of urban
household formation of 5.4Z over the 1986-95 period, generating 0.8 million
additional households by 1995, equivalent to 60? of today's State total.
3.    Meeting the growing demand for urban services will be the major sector
challenge for the State in the forthcoming decade, a task made more difficult
by the dramatic increase in urban poverty caused by the combipation of rapid
urban growth and the slowing of the national economy. In 1985, the proportion
of the total population with incomes below the poverty line (defined as less than
five minimum salaries per family) in the metropolitan region of Curitiba, the
capital of Parana, was 21.52 (up from only 6.0 in 1981), and deficits of basic
urban infrastructure and services, mainly affecting the urban poor, are high in
Parana. In 1985, 43.32 of urban households in the State had only rudimentary
sanitary facilities; about one-third burned, buried or discarded their garbage
in vacant lots or in drainage systems.- Hospital and other hazardous wastes are
not always separated from regular garbage. Even for water supply, where the
efforts of the public sector have been greatest, more than 235,000 urban
households (19.3?) in 1984 had no piped water and had to draw water from public
standpipes, wells or rivers.
4.    Municipalities-, whose powers to plan and administer urban development were
constrained during the military dictatorship (1964-1985), gained considerable
responsibilities with the new Constitution, promalgated October 5, 1988. These
responsibilities include provision of such services as basic sanitation, water
supply, education, primary and secondary education and health care.
Municipalities may either operate these services themselves or delegate them to
a higher level of government (as was done for water and sewerage under the
National Sanitation Plan, or PLANASA). At the same time, municipalities have
been awarded greater financial resources to pay for these services, through
direct taxation and increased revenue-sharing.  It has been estimated that the
fiscal arrangements of the new Constitution will increase the revenues of
Parana's municipalities by between 302 and 40?, with much of the gain being made
in the next two years as t e reform takes effect. Municipalities will rely on



2
State sector agencies for guidance in carrying out these responsibilities. The
Secretariat for Urban Development and Environment (SEDU) is in charge of overall
urban development policy. Within SEDU are FAMEPAR, the Foundation for Assistance
to Municipalities, SANEPAR, the State water company, SUCEAM, the State
Secretariat for Erosion and Environmental Sanitation, and COHAPAR, the State Low-
Income Housing Company.  These agencies are competent, but will require some
institutional  strengthening.   With the reduction  in many Federal poverty
programs, assistance to the poor in basic sanitation, housing and urban
transportation will increasingly be implemented by sub-national (State and
municipal) governments, making it possible to introduce redistribution policies
and strategies at this level and adjust the tendency to subsidize higher income
groups noted in previous Bank studies.
5.    The main sector issues are to: (a) develop and implement a coherent,
sustainable "core" program to improve overall urban sector policies in an
integrated approach focused on the municipality as the primary agent for economic
development; (b) continue to address sector constraints in basic sanitation,
low-income housing and urban transportation; and (c) deal with serious
environmental problems.   The State's program to accomplish this should: (a)
increase mobilization of local resources; tb) improve the efficiency of resource
allocation; (c) strengthen the institutions dealing with rapid urbanization; (d)
improve targeting of benefits to low-income populations; and (e) contribute to
reducing fiscal deficits.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement  The Bank's assistance strategy to Brazil
is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth and
social development in a context of macroeconomic stability, with an emphasis on
efficient resource allocation and administration in the public sector, and
appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor. The proposed
project- is fully consistent with these longer-term development goals, in its
targeting  of  economically  efficient  investments  to  mainly  low-income
beneficiaries.   In the shorter-term,  the Bank's assistance would help to
strengthen municipalities' institutional capacities and promote investment
planning on the basis of sound financial policy, at this critical point of
increased responsibilities and resources. The Bank's previous experience ir. the
sector, in particular with the Parana Market Towns Project, or PRAM, (Loan -2343-
BR) and the Santa Catarina Project (Loan 2623-BR), provides a basis for
continuing the momentum in the sector, and transferring lessons learned in
project design and implementation. These projects resulted in a rapid transfer
of knowledge and have pro-vided an institutional memory for the sector.
7.    Prolect Objectives  The main objective of this project is to increase the
general c-apacity of municipalities to effectively assume their increased
responsibilities under Brazil's new Constitution, thereby enabling them to
efficiently utilize the large concurrent increase in resources, and strengthen
administrative capabilities, after nearly twenty years of relative neglect. The
specific objectives are to: (a) increase institutional capacities to plan,
finance and execute cost-effective projects and programs, through appropriate
policy reforms; (b) improve coordination of urban development, environmental
policy and investment decisions at the State and municipal levels; (c) target
project benefits to low-income populations: and (d) strengthen the State's Urban
Development Fund (FDU) as a reliable source of funding.

8.    Project Description   The project involves two components: Part One -
Institutional and Human Resource Development would comprise about 10? of total
costs, and would include technical assistance, training and equipment to (i)
municipalities, SANEPAR and COHAPAR to strengthen their financial management and
overall administration; (ii) SEDU and FAMEPAR (and selected other sector
agencies) to improve their institutional capacity for project management and
appraisal of sub-borrowers and sub-projects; and (iii) training and technical
assistance agencies.   Part Two - Infrastructure Investments would represent
about 90% of total project costs, and would include water supply and basic
sanitation, street paving and lighting, drainage, erosion control, solid and
toxic waste management, community facilities (health posts, day care centers and
school building extensions), and other eligible sub-projects including a pilot
project for low-income self-help house construction. About 47? of to_al project
costs would be incurred for investments which directly contribute to containing
environmental damage resulting from uncontrolled urban growth, and to minimizing
further deterioration through better planning and improved resource management..
9.    The project objectives would be achieved through the support of a State-
wide urban development program (PEDU). Under PEDU, eligible sub-borrowers would
have access to sub-loans from an Urban Development Fund (FDU), managed by a
special unit (PCU) in SEDU, and administered-by the State Bank, BANESTADO. These
sub-loans would finance essential municipal infrastructure, services and related
equipment.   Eligible municipal sub-borrowers would be selected by FAMEPAR
according to established limits on revenues and debt-servicing capacity, and
commitment to improve their finances and administration. Sub-project eligibility
criteria, including low cost technical design standards and location in low-
income areas, would be set out in detail in an Operation Manual.  Each sub-
borrower would undergo a financial and institutional appraisal by FAMEPAR, which
would establish a credit limit and also define the minimum content for an
institutional development package to be implemented by the sub-borrower. The
principal element of this package would be the sub-borrower's financial action
plan (FAP),.aimed at improving its financial soundness by increasing revenues
and reducing current expenditures.  The appraisal of this FAP by FAMEPAR would
lead to an agreed program of technical assistance and training, under Part I of
the project, in order to meet the established financial targets.  All sub-
borrowers will be required to participate in Part I of the project. Those-sub-
borrowers demonstrating to FAMEPAR satisfactory financial and institutional
capacity would be eligible for sub-loans to finance investments under Part II.
Based on experience under the PRAM Project, about 90? of the municipalities can
be expected to participate within the first 18 months of the program. Financing
of Part I would include a grant element for technical assistance and training;
for Part II, grant funding would be for community facilities, erosion control
and toxic-waste management. The a priori requirement of demonstrated financial
and managerial performance improvements would stimulate competition for limited
funds among sub-borrowers, an essential feature of this project.
10.   About 318 municipalities plus SANEPAR and COHAPAR would be eligible to
participate in PEDU. Undet- the proposed loan, policies and conditions for SANEPAR
would be generally consistent with those of other Bank water sector operations.
The project, to be carried out over five years, provides funds for equipment,
civil works and consultant services. The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$226.9 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$56.2



4
million equivalent (25Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule
are sho-vm in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events, and the
status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map (IBRD 21580), and the Staft Appraisal Report, No. 7715-BR,
dated May 17, 1989, is also attached.
12.   Actions Agreed Agreement was reached on the following: (a) the Operation
Manual; (b) that the PCU and FAMEPAR (including CPO and RPOs) are established,
staffed and maintained in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (c) the operating
terms and conditicns of the FDU; (d) eligibility criteria for sub-borrowers and
sub-projects; te) appraisal criteria to be used by Fl PAR in determining
borrowing capec.ty, assessing FAPs and establishing guarantees; (f) criteria for
allocation of grant funds; (g) that FAMEPAR enter into a Technical Cooperation
Agreement with selected state agencies-for provision of supervisory and technical
assistance services in project implementation; (h) that the PCU and FAMEPAR would
carry out jointly with the Bank an annual review -of sub-borrowers' investment
programs, borrowing capacity and creditworthiness, financial performance, status
of institutional development and monitoring and evaluation programs; this would
form the basis for an annual investr.ent program for PEDU, satisfactory to the
Bank; (-i). that not later than September 30, 1989, the PCU and FAMEPAR would
prepare and furnish to the Bank, a final set of financial, economic, technical,
environmental and social monitoring indicators, satisfactory to the Bank, for
the project and the sub-borrowers, to be included iLn the respective part.`:ipation
agreements; (j) by October 31, an annual review of the adequacy of FDU lending
terms and conditions; and (k) an interim review (in December 1991) of the pilot
housing sub-component with a view to making adjustments to its share of project
funding, if necessary.
13.   Specifically for SANEPAR, agreement was reached on: (a) compliance with
the National Tariff Law, which regulates water sector financial performance; (b)
continuation of the use of PLANASA eligibility criteria for sub-projects; (c)
completion of a study on marginal cost pricing by end-1989 and implementation
by end-1990; (d) completion of a study of asset value by mid-1990, incorporation
of recommended asset value changes by end-1990, and updating of such revaluation
every three years; (e) consultation with the Bank on proposed changes-of more
than 102 in annual investment targets; (f) that debt:equity ratio does not exceed
70:30, nor debt service coverage ratio fall be-low 1.5; (g) that other monitoring
indicators and a schedule for adjustment of the commerciallaccounting system,
to be implemented by end-1990, be included in the Participation Agreement between
the PCU/FDU and SANEPAR; and (h) furnishing of a five-year projection, in detail
for the first year, specifically to include the targeting of internal generation
of 202 of investment funds by 1993.
14.   The  following would be undertaken prior to Loan Disbursement:  (a)
appraisal, and review by the Bank, of technical, financial, economic and
institutional aspects for any sub-project costing in excess of US$3 million; (b)
technical and financial appraisal of each pilot housing sub-project, together
with a list of the intended beneficiaries and the selection criteria applied;
(c) furnishing of a satisfactory resettleirent program for any sub-projects
invQlving relocation; and (d) submission of a satisfactory economic, technical,
financial, institutional, and enviroment appraisal of any toxic waste sub-



5
project.   The establishment of the PCS, and the execution of the FAIEPAR,
Financial Agency Agreements. and the Participating Agreement with SANEPAR. would
be required prior to Loan Effectiveness.
15.   Benefits    The  improved  capacity  by  the  State  of  rarana  and  its
municipalities to mobilize and allocate local, resources, coupled with overall
improved fiscal policies and management, will. dnsurp the sustainability of
investments, provide a timely response to new demands upon local governments
(dictated by the recently approved Constitution), and also directly contribute
towards meeting objectives of increased public sector efficiency and lower
deficits. The project emphasizes improving the living standards of the urban
poor, rather than those of-higher income groups as has happened in the past.
The weighted average rate of return of quantifiable benefits is estimated to be
17.12. Additional unquantifiable benefits are derived from the large number of
project components wnich directly contribute to reduction of environmental damage
caused by uncontrolled urban growth.
16.   Risks  There are two specific risks:  (a) the potential lack of political
will to carry out financial and institutional agreements; and (b) the difficulty
inherent in coordination of the program, given the number of participating
agencies. Sub-project and sub-borrower eligibility criteria, secure guarantee
through receipts and sales tax commitments, and agreed policies for full cost
recovery have been designed to minimize the former. In addition, the enthusiasm
and results shown by both State and municipal governments. in spite of a
difficult macroeconomic environment, ensure strong commitment to project
objectives. Considerable attention has been placed on defining the institutional
roles and responsibilities of the various agencies before project inception,
through the use of a pre-approved Operation Manual, which should reduce the risk
of problems resulting from the lack of coordination. The previous experience
of FAMEPAR, BANESTADO, SANEPAR and %.he majority of the participating
municipalities in previous Bank-financed projects should further mitigate project
risks.  The straightforward nature of the technical assistance, training and
works involved, implies few technical risks.
17.   Recommendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommena that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
