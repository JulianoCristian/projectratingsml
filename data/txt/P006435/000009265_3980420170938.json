{"cdata!": "Taking Brazil's municipal reform\n            agenda some important steps further, the Parani Municipal\n            Development (PEDU) Project (Ln. 3100-BR) was modeled upon\n            its predecessor, the satisfactory Parana Market Towns\n            Development (PRAM) Project (Ln 2343-BR). PEDU itself was the\n            third municipal development operation supported by the Bank\n            in Brazil. It was prepared jointly with the Municipal\n            Development (PIMES) Project in the State of Rio Grande do\n            Sul (Loan 3129-BR)-- approved four months later--with which\n            it shared a similar design and set of objectives. The PEDU\n            project was replicated by similar on-going operations later\n            approved in the states of Minas Gerais (Ln. 3639-BR), Ceara\n            (Ln. 3789-BR), and Bahia (Ln. 4140-BR). T'he objectives\n            of the project were to: (i) Improve the managerial and\n            institutional capacity and fiscal efficiency of\n            municipalities and state agencies. (ii) Provide basic\n            economic and social infrastructure in urban areas. (iii)\n            Decentralize urban administration and financial management.\n            (iv) Improve targeting of urban programs to lower-income\n            populations. (v) Create and strengthen a State urban\n            development fund (FDJ). To fulfill these objectives the PEDU\n            project used Bank Loan proceeds and Parana state counterpart\n            funding to capitalize a specially created Urban Development\n            Fund (FDIJ), which provided a line of credit for investments\n            in urban infrastructure and services by municipalities\n            throughout the state. The PEDU project design required that\n            FDU loans would be made to municipalities embarked upon\n            institutional reform. Implementation responsibility for the\n            project was in the hands of the state Secretariat of Urban\n            Development (SEDU) and the Parana Foundation for Assistance\n            to Municipalities (FAMEPAR). This arrangement brought to\n            PEDU the considerable experience acquired by both agencies\n            through the implementation of the earlier PRAM project."}, "docdt": "1997-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
