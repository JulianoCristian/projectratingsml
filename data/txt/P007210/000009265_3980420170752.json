Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Economic Modernization Loan (EML) to\n            Guatemala. The Government launched a program to stabilize\n            the economy and lay the basis for medium-term growth, and\n            requested assistance from the Bank in the form of a\n            structural adjustment loan to support its economic program.\n            The key objectives of the program were to: (i) strengthen\n            public finances through the implementation of a\n            comprehensive tax package and reform of tax and customs\n            administration; (ii) improve public enterprise efficiency;\n            (iii) further liberalize trade; (iv) promote financial\n            sector reform through restructuring public banks and\n            improving prudential regulations and bank supervision; and\n            (v) intensify efforts to alleviate poverty by increasing\n            allocations to basic health and education services. Overall\n            Bank performance in the EML is assessed as satisfactory.\n            Borrower performance in terms of identification,\n            implementation and covenant compliance was satisfactory. The\n            most important lessons learned are: (i) design of reform\n            programs in countries without prior experience with\n            Bank-supported adjustment operations should aim for\n            simplicity and compactness; (ii)a realistic assessment of\n            the Borrower's institutional capacity is critical to\n            the success of a structural adjustment program; (iii)\n            effective coordination with other co financiers should also\n            be promoted to help prevent lack of coherence in the\n            conditionality design; (iv) the legal department should be\n            involved from the outset to enable it to examine and\n            consider alternative legal approaches, if any, to achieve\n            the desired objectives; and (v)while specificity is\n            essential to avoid ambiguity with respect to adjustment loan\n            conditionalities, some flexibility is also called for."}, "docdt": "1996-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
