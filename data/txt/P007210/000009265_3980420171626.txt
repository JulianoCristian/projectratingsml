Svrua               Repayment in 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
hescrsa:t  s        The proposed loan ould support the Government's
economic modornization and social development
rogram which is designed tos (i) strengthen public
finances through the itmplementation of S
comprehensive tax package and reform of tax and
customs administration, (ii) improve public
enterprise officiency, (iII) further liberalize
trade, (iv) promote financial sector reform through
restructuring public banks and Improving prudential
regulations and bank supervision, and (v) intensify
efforts to alleviate poverty.
B_nefits:           The implementation of the economic modernization
program would raise tax rvvenues, allowing for
increased expenditures in the social sectors whie
maintaining fiscal discipline. Trade and financial
sector reform would promote a more efficient
allocation of domestic resources. In addition, the
program would help alleviate poverty, especially In
rural areas through the Implementation of a Socia
Investment Fund project and through an expanded
public investment program in the social sectors. It
also would improve the country's creditworthiness,
thereby facilitating access to medium- to long-term
external finance for sustainabl. economic growth.

Iiikos              The principal risks are: (1) the Government's
abllity to sustain a political conensus with
Congress needed for program implementation, (it)
resistance o thp part of interest groups to fiscal
and financial sector reform, and (ill) Wvaknesses In
Institutional capacity to carry out the program.
Countering these risks is the Goveroment's strong
commitment to its economic modernization program and
a track record of sound economic vanagement,
domestic cr3dibility, and success In building
political support for its economic program. The
recent unanimous Congressional approval of tax
legislation is a case in point. Moreover, the
Government is using tseOnical assistance effectively
in such critical areas as tax and customs
administration, budgeting, and program
implementation in the health and education
minlstries to improve Its institutional capacity.

A PROPOSZD ECONOMIC MOERNIZATION 1AN
IN N AMON EqUIVALNT TO US$120 MltLION
TO TUE REPUBLIC OF GUATEMAL
1.  SI ubmit the followig report and recommendations on a proposed Economic
Modernization Loan (lUL) to the Republic of Guatemala for the equivalent of
US$120 million. The proposed Bank loan would support the Government's medium-
term economic reform program. It would be repayable over 20 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variAble interest rate and charges. The financial sector component would be co-
financed with a US$75 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB).
2.    Tie Government of Guatmala which took office in early 1991 is attempting
to negotiate an end to more than three decades of guerilla warfare, to strengthen
democratic procesats, and to accelerate economic growth and social progress.
Macroeconomic stability and the successful pursuit of economic modernization are
critical to attanling these goals. To this end, the Government has stabilized
the economy and started implementing a medium-term economic modernization and
social development program. The documents for a stand-by arrangement will be
circulated to the 1W Boord in mid November 1992.
3.    The proposed MML would be the first operation in Guatemala since 1988.
Relations between the country and the Bank were interrupted in July 1990 when the
emergence of arrears required the Bank to declare Guatemala in non-accrual
status  The Guatemalan Government resumed debt-service payments to the Bank in
May 1991 and will clear remaining arrears in mid November 1992.
1. COUNTRY POLICIES AND BAMM 0ROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
4.    Guatemala has been a sharply divided society dating back to the Spanish
Conquest. The distribution of Incame, land and other assets is highly skewed
toward a small share of the Spanish speaking population. The Indian half of the
populace, speaking over 20 different indigenous languages, generally lives in
extreme poverty and isolation in the rural areas.
5.    The country's social indicators are among the worst in the Western
Nemisphere and the averages mask even sharper inequalities between social groups
and regions. Infant mortality is 76 per thousand live births, one third of all
children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition, half the population is
illiterate, and the housing stock is seriously deficient, with a third classified
as tenements and hovels.  These Indicators reflect, inter alia, persistent



-2-
und.rinve.tment In social services and basic rural Infrastructure which ha
aggravated social tesioon.  Political violence has adversely affected the
country's economic development, contributing, among other thing., to economic
uncertainty and depressed investment which avera8od a low 12 5 percent of GDP
during the last docade compared to 17.5 percent during thw preceding decade.
6.     Despite this legacy, Guatemala hs been making progrees since the aid
1980e toward tre gthening democracy, increasing attention on pressing social
issues, and opening the economy. The mllitary left office of its own volition
In 1985. Free elections were held in 1985 and 1990, with the latter leading to
an unprecedented peaceful transfer of the Government between political parties.
The press ha become open and efforts have begun to serengthen the judiciary.
Last year the Government initiated formal peace talks rith the remnant guerilla
groups. Moreover, the political debate In Guatemala is shifting more toward how
to tackle the accumulated "social deficit" and ways to better address needs of
the poor after years of social under-investment.
Y'ec et Econoadc Develouments and Woed for Adluetmotl
7.     Guatemala has the largest economy in Central America, with a 1991 GDP of
US$9.3 billion, equal to about 30 percent of regional GDP. During the 1980s, the
population of Gutemala grew by 2.9 percent annually, reaching abcut 9.5 million
by end 1991. The economy Is predominantly agricultural, with more than half of
the country's working population engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishing.
The sector contributed more than one-fourth of the GDP and generated about 75
percent of the county's export revenues during the 1980s.   Apart from
traditional export crops like coffee, banana, cardamom, and cotton, non-
traditional agricultural exports have become major export earners.   The
industrialization efforts of the 1960s and 1970s have also created an industrial
base, accounting now for about 21 percent of GDP.
8.     During the 1960s and 1970., Guatemala's econo.m" enjoyed steady growth,
averaging 6 percent per year. Fiscal deficits averaged 1.3 percent of GDP and
onetary policies were consistent with low Inflation rate- . However, the economy
stalled in the early 1980a due to external economic factors, civil conflict, and
incrased distortions from an Import-substitution industrialization strategy.
Concmitant loose fiscal and monetary policies led to sharp licreoses in fiscal
and current account deficits (Table 1). The need for fiscal restraint and
alleviation of pressures on the balance of payments required sharp cutbacks in
economic activity, especially In public investment, and per capita GDP fell by
about 20 percent between 1980 and 1985.
A          G s             (Report No. 9378-l) was circulated to the Executive Directors

9.     The civilia                          la nly 19t  retored mac economic
staxility and started redressing sow *    ajor economic distoriLos by sharply
reducing price cotrols, simplifying end, lx 19 , unifying the echage rate
system, ad rationalizing imort tar'ff levels (par". 52 oad 56). As private
sector lnestment recuporatid, GtP and ono-traditional ezports grew at annual
average rAt's of S and30 percent reepectiv4y  dring 1986-1490. Fiscal policy
loosened,  hoevr, when the tax rform of 197 failed to incre"a  revenes beyond
1988 and ezpenditures continued epending  ntll 1989. te overall public sector
deficit rose sharply to 4.7 percent of MP In 1990 (Table 1), financed mainly by
Central Bank credit and arreas to external crittors.
10.   Rising inflation In 1990 wao  not  *otered by a tightening of monetary
policy. As a result, slowly rising nminA lteet ro;tes became increasigly
negative in rea  term  durizg the course of the year, putting pressure On tbe
excharge rate and stimulating capital fl t. Exchang  rate management becme
erratic, with the adoptioe of several different excanse rate systems In 1990.
Insufficient flcal revenue and foreign exchange In 1990 led to a rapid
accumulation of external arrers, includn  to the World Ba& and IDB.

11.   When Preident Serrano  as            t in Jauary 1991, the country was
in a fiscal"nd balance of pmts crisis, reflecting    deqte macroeconomic
policies and fundatal econ c distorti .                  i4g thse problem  are
a rapid rate of population growth, eniromental presures, and poverty affecting
over so percent of the populatio.  To deal with these structural problem,
Guatemala is joining the other Central Amrian countrie  wlhch have Initiated
far-reachIng refoms in the fiscal, financial, ttade, and social areas.

12.    The Sewrano Adminitration launchd a program to stabilize the economy and
lay tho bseas for medium-term  growth.   Substantial progress in terms of
stabilizstion haJ already bean achevet, vithout adversely affecting economic
growth (Table 1). In 1991, the Bank of Guatemala (the Central Bank) pursued a
tight monetary ad credit polley, whil, maintaining the exchange rate auction
system which allow the exchange rate to move within an adjustable band (para.
53). Open market operation boeame the principal instrument to control base
money growth. Reflecting the restrictive monetary atance, cumulative inflation
for 1991 was 10 percent compared to 60 percent for 1990. Inereased public
confidence and the reemergence of positive real Interest rates stimulated a
significant liflow of foreign exchange and minimixed speculation against the
Quetzal in 1991.
13.    The Government also moved to strengthen fiscal performance. During 1991,
tax revnues inreoased through temporary measures, including a tax amnesty and
a one-tim tax on gross income, end non-tax receipts grew substan:ially from a
surcharge on petroleum products.   Current expenditures were sharply cut,
generating a surplus In the non-financial public sector. In addition, losses of
the Bank of Guateala were reduced by the elimination of all exchange rate
guarantees and th. reduction of interest rate subsidies to the Central
Government. As a result, the overall public sector deficit in 1991 fell to 1.2
percent of GDP compared to 4.7 percent of GDP in 1990 (Table 1).
14.   During the first nine months of 1992, the economic recovery bas been
accompanied by a strong expansion of bank credit to the private sector. Together
with a real appreciation of the Quetzal, this has accelerated import demand while
overall export growth has slowed largely because of falling prices for
Guatemala's traditional xports, especially coffee. The current account balane
is, therefore, expected to worsen during 1992 (Table 2). However, the Government
is coumitted to reducing the current account deficit through tighter monetary
policies and stricter control on public expenditures, particularly after
restoring real wages of public employees to their 1990 level (see para. 45).
Inflation has been running at about 10 percent on an annualized basis and the
Government is expected to again run a small non-financial public sector surplus
In 1992 (Table 2).
15.   To build on the progress achieved by the stabilizatioa effort and to
address structural economic problems, the Government has defined and started
implementing a broad bsed economAc modernization and social program (described
in Section II) for the 1991-96 period. As outlined In the Government's document
entitled Gustomslas T m_do an Economic and Social Democracy", the program
includs such key objectives as: (i) implementing a comprehensive fiscal reform,
(ii) improving public sector performance through restructuring of enterprises,
(11i) import tariff reform and elimination of most non-tariff barriers, (iv)
financial sector reform designed to increase compotition, stimulate private
savings, and ensure sound banking practices and improved bank supervision, and
(v) strenghning the delivery of *-cial services to the most vulnerable groups.
The progra would be fully stpportzd under the proposed EL.

16.    Guatemala's economic growth potential has not yet been realised due to a
combination of throe factors. First, macrooconosic Instability has resulted In
unsustainable public sector deficits whieh fueled inflationary pressures and
economic uncertainty, sad, hence, deprsseed nvestment (pars.. 8 and 9). Second,
distortions In trade, price, and finacial policies (see Sections 11- and II-C
below) have contributed to the inefficient allocation of resources, thereby
diminishing the country's growth potential. Third, Increasing poverty levels,
especially in rural areas, remain the single most serious obstacle to long-term
growth (see Section 11-D below). The latter reflects, In part, the Government's
insufficient lvestment In the so-4.al sectors and misallocation of resources way
fron primary services where the highest rates of return can be expected.
Therefore, Guatemala's medium-term economic recovery and growth prospect. depend
critically on the country's ability to cowrect its public sector deficit,
economic distortiors, and underivetment in the social sectors.

17.    Given the country's natural resource base, full Implemetation of the
Goverme It's econnmic modernixation and social developmet prom should enable
Guatemala to grow at 4 to 5 percent per year over the medium-term. Non-
traditional exports and tourism ore expected to be major sources of expansion.
Moreover, there would be a wider participation in the benefits of economic
development.



18.   Fiscal reform is critical to the economic modernizatlon effort (para. 38).
Under the Government program, public savings would incresse from 3.0 percent of
GDP In 1991 to 3.7 percent in 1995, while public capital expenditures vould rise
from 2.8 percent of GDP to 4.1 percent during the same period. Owerall deficit.
below 1 percent of GDP would be fintaced by external grants and loans. Domestic
and external public debt would decline as a percentage of GDP. Control over
monetary aggregates would be improved with the elimination of both inflationary
financing of the fiscal deficit and Central lank interest subsidies to the
Government. 5hz monetary authorities would pursue a monetary policy consistent
with annual inflation rates of less than 10 percent during the 1990s.
19.    Guatemala's large external current account deficits of the 1980s are
expected to be redressed by the Implementation of the fiscal and monetary
adjustment =e, oures. Togetber with the trade liberalixation reforms (Section B),
thebe measures should Improve the trade balance and help to reduce the current
account defLect.  The decline in the current account deficits would reduce
external financing requirements and help to prevent further increases in the
external debt/GDP ratio. Successful iaplementation of the Government's economic
program would also strengthen Guatemala's creditworthiness (para. 94).

20.   Cemnosition of Past Prjesct Lending.   Between 1955 and 1988 Guatemala
received 22 Bank loans totalling US$559.6 million net of cancellations (Annex G).
Seventeen loan have been fully disbursed. Approximately US$178 million remains
undisbursed under currently suspended projects. The Bank's exposure In Guatemala
is US$231 million, about 0.2 percent of total Bank loans oatstanding. Until the
aid-1980s, Bank lending was heavily concentrated in the power and
telecommunications sectors. With the civtlian Government'a shift in priorities
the Bank was able to support several projects directly addressing rural and
social sector needs in Guatemala.
21.    Seven loans were suspended in March 1990 when Guatemala went into arrears
on its servicing of Bank debt - One loan has since closed, another has been
canceled by the Government, an. a third partially canceled. The Secondary and
Regional Roads Rehabilitation Loan (Ln.3002-GU&) approved in 1988 has not yet
been signed. Given the negative Impact of the extended suspension on their
financial viability, the Government Is reviewing whother it wishes to reactivate
the remaining four loans which are targeted at priority sectors--Power
Distribution (Lu.2724-GUA), Municipal Developeant (Ln.2972-GU&), Water Supply
Rehabilitation (Ln.2759-GUA), and Basic Education II (La. 3003-GUA). Should the
Government choose to cancel the Power Distribution and Municipal Development
projects, the Bank would be prepared to process on a priority basis a replacement
infrastructure project with a high poverty alleviation impact.
22.    Cougtrv Asslst"anc  Strat-v.  In view of the country's urgent need to
promote sustainable economic growth and social development, the country
assistance strategy for Guatemala will focus on a two pronged effort supporting
the Government's program of economic modernization and poverty alleviation. The
level of lank support would depend on country performance and willingness to



-7-
undertake policy measures. The main objectives of the Bank Group's medium-term
assistance are tot (1) strengthen public finances vhrough reform in both revenue
and expenditure execution, (Ii) deepen the trade, financial sector, and
agricultural reforms, (iII) expand investments in preventive and primary health
care and education, (iv) strengthen the capacity of the education and health
ministries and encouraging broader public sector management reform, (v) assist
programs to support small farmers and address land use and other environmental
problems in rural areas, and (vi) support key investments in basic
infrastructure. The Bank will pursue Its strategy through an intensified policy
dialogue, assistance In the implementation of already approved projects,
adjustment and project lending, aid coordination through the existing
Consultative Group, provision of technical asistance for institutional
strengthening, and close project supervision.
23 lank Group Lendimn ProarM (If 93-927 . The pluaned volume of lending for
the FY 93-97 period is expected to be about two operations annually amounting to
approximately US$70-75 million a year on average. Implementation of the strategy
will be initiated through two complementary operations.  The iN, will help
consolidate the macroeconomic stabilization achieved since 1991 and deepen the
structural reforms being undertaken in the public sector, trade, and finance
areas*  In addition, the program supported by the 3MM explicitly addresses
poverty alleviation by strengthening public finances, supporting institutional
development In the health and education ministries, and by Increasing social
spending on primary education and primary and preventive health care.
24.   At the same time as these efforts are being made w thln the Central
Government, the lank, In a separate operation, will support the Government's
Social Investment Fund (SIP) (para. 73) which is designed to directly target the
poorest rural communities. The SIP will rely on NGOs, community groups, and
local governments to identify, propose, and impl_met health, education,
infrastructure, and micro-enterprise subprojects. The SIP is designed to provide
direct assistance to the rural poor quickly, serve as a catalyst for improving
Central Government operations in the rural areas, and demonstrate the
Government's commitment to a significant intensification of its poverty
alleviation program. Major efforts will be made to ensure that the projects
financed by the SIP, as well as new forms of project identification and
management developed in the SIP, are incorporated into the operations of the
Central Government ministries. Prompt Implementation of the suspended Basic
Education II project has also been Identified by the Government as a key priority
in its poverty program.
25    New lending over the medium torm would continue to have predominantly a
povertv allevil-tion focus. Possible operations have boen Identified in several
fields. An education project would build on the current operation to support
rural education especially aired at indigeneus groups, promote administrative
reform and strengthen the minfstry. A health project would address the needs of
the most vulnerable groups including strengthenig the institutional capacity of
the line ministry, Increasing cost recovery, Improving coordinstion with non-
governmental organizations, and possibly supporting  family pl"&=ing.   An
agricultural project would be targeted on mall producers with policy and
institutlinal development elements aimed at extension, marketing, and information
services A low Income housing loan would holp strengthen housing policies.



-8-
26.    Bank operations in Infr atr4 wturs vill be targeted on areas of acute
poverty where the scope for private nvestment io aore liulted. A rural water
and sanitation project would be directed to mmnicipalities outside the capital
city to support investment and policy and institutional strengthening. All
investment operations would also be poverty oriented and would strengthen
institution.  In lie with the G0vernment's efforts to promote decentralization
and consolidate democracy, greater rellance will be placed on the private sector,
WOOs, comuity graups, and local goavrnment. The foregoing would be undertaken
in clear recognition that raising the education and productive capacity of women
is critical to the attainment of the Government's social and economic goals.
27.   Another major goal of the Government is to further liberalize the economy
so as to remove remaining impediments to 2rivate sector investment*  The
Government is seeking to reduce regulatory, trade, and financial sector
distortions (see Sections 1I-C and II-D)   It is reviewing options for opening
economic sectors heretofore reserved for public enterprises and encouraging an
expanded role for the private sector in the provision of electricity. The Bank
would be prepared to support fundamental reform programs in central government
management *nd sectotal reforms including the divestiture of state enterprises
(see Section II-A).
28.   The Government also wishes to address pressing enironmental issues,
especially ongoitg deforestation whb1h threatena -.o eliminate old growth forests
within thirty years.  The IDB is finalizing a US$2 million grant for the
strengthening of the national environmental agency. The Bank is working with the
country under the terms of the Montreal Protocol and investigating possible
operations for financing under the Global Environment Facility (GER). It is also
considering a satural reource managemet component in the agricultural loan
focused on improving land use information, and forestry policies and management.
29*   P-ortfolo IUne SMetAtion lasue. Given institutional inadequacies and a
poor record of project implementation and loan disbursement, intensified project
supervision will be a major priority for the Bank. Seminars on Bank procurement
and disbursement procedures are being organised for relevant project aanagers and
Central Government officials In Guatemala.   The Ministry of Finance is
strengthening the Department of External Flasnce with the aim of improving and
speeding project implementation, and it has established revolving funds to reduce
funding delays on Bank projects. A coordinating unit has been established to
oversee Implementation of the EL and a similar unit sot up in the SIP. The Bank
has also discussed with the authorities possible cancellation of several existing
projects.
30 *    g Eonomic And ector Work (9SV)   The a*ssistance strategy would Include a
program of economic and sector work designed to expand knowledge in priority
sectors and Improve the Government's lnstitutioral capacity. A Public Sector
Expenditure Review (PSER) with a particular focus on public sector msangement and
the problems plaguing social sector spending is scheduled for completion in PY93
(par. 46). Both a Poverty Assessment and Health Sector Review will be initiated
this year designed to Identify practical measures to Improve social service
delivery systema   The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) is
completitg an Energy Sector Study. Regional studies on financial sector reform
and institutional development will complement the country specific ESW.

31. *   Satus of Policy DiAoave. After an extendte  hiatus in normal contacts
due to the country's non-accrual statue, the Bank and Government of Guatemala
*etablished a clooe and iroductive working relationship during the preparation
of the MM. and SIP operations.  The policy dillogue is continuous, open, and
carried on at the Cabinet level. A succeosful two day seminar was presented in
June 1992 to the Guatemalan Congre.s explaining the role of the Bank in promoting
development and economic reform, and contacts have been made with various other
groups within Guatemlan society to exchange viewpoints and foster dialogue.
32.   &i Cgoditln.  Major agencies in Gutatmala are the IDB, USATD, GTZ,
UNDP, and the Sank.   Aid coordination Is particularly Important given the
inherent potential for inconsistencies and duplication stemming from a widespread
donor focus on policy reform  and poverty alleviation.  The Bank chaired a
Consultative Group Meeting for Guatemala in March 1992, whero the Government
outlined to the donor* community its stabilization, uodernization, and social
sector developmeat strategies.  The Government has asked the lank to chair
another Consultative Group meeting In 1993 following approval of the EML and 8SI
operations end IMP stand-by arrangement (pars. 86), where it will seek support
for its program of social development.
33.      INE I QAG.  Bank staff bas worked with the =  in reactixating its
presence in Guatemala. At the suggestion of the Bank the Government ap'proached
the TIC to discuss possible support for specific privatization efforts. The TIC
is also pursuing several possible equity Investments and loans in Guatemala.
Guatemala has signed the HIGA convention, and following ratification and
subscription, MIGA wuuld be prepared to move forward with investment guarantees
and policy and advisory services.
i_Y=
34.   Guatemala is seeking to restore peace and national consensus, establish
the basis for more rapid and sustainable growth and development, and address the
severe poverty confronting its people. Its economic and social development
program also att (i) maintaining economic stability, (11) Improving the
efficiency of the public sector, (iii) incresing the revenue base of the public
sector, (iv) promoting the continued liberalization of the trade and financial
sectors, and (v) moving aggressively to alleviate poverty through better focussed
and financed Investments in the social sectors.
35.   The Bank would asist In the lmplementation of the Government strategy
through the IHL, the SIF, and other new lending for education, health,
agriculture, housing, water and sanitation, and environment. The Bank's program
would be complemented by policy dialogue, improved project supervision, and close
coordination with other donors and YGOs.
36. The economic and social performance of Guatemala over the next one to two
years should be judged ons (i) adherence to fiscal and monetary targets required
to maintaMn macroeconomic stability, (11) timely end full Iplementation of the
program being supported by tbe IML, and (111) sustained Government actions to
strengthen revenue performnce and to increase investments in the social sectors.

II. TUE ShXH'3 ZqOROfIC MOUUZATIOM PROGRUM
37.    The reform program supported by this loan is described by a Letter of
Development Policy (Annex F) and presented in detail in the Matrix of Actions
(Annex B), and action plans on tax end customs administration (Annex C), non-
tariff barrier. (Annex D), and prudential norms and bank supervision (Annex E).
The Letter spells out the Government'. medium term economic modernization and
social program which is focused on (i) public sector reform; (11) trade reform;
(iii) financial sector reform; and (iv) poverty alleviation.
A. Public Sector Refom
38.   Large public sector deficits persisted in the 1980. despite various
adjustment efforts. Fiscal measures mainly involved cuts in capital expenditures
while current expenditures were not sufficiently restrained. Tax reforms in 1983
and 1987 failed to increade revenue because of implementation difficulties and
policy revisions that eroded the original intent of the reform. In addition,
past Governments failed to adjust public utility prices, particularly
exacerbating the financial problms of the public power generation company.
While the authorities are determined to control expenditures, the main goal of
the public sector reform will be to raise the low level of tax revenues (Table
3) to generate more funds, especially for social sector development. Another
objective is to achieve greater public sector efficiency through public
enterprise restructuring.
Tax Revenue
39.   In Aprill/May 1992 the Congress unanimously approved the Government's
proposal to raise tax revenues of the Central overnment  The main features of
the tax reform legislation weres (i) ellnination of virtually all exemptions on
the value-added tax (VAT) (para. 40); (1i) modifications in income tax
legislation (pare. 40); and (iii) nodifications in taxation of petroleum products
(para. 41). The eliumation of most import duty exemptions and the reform of
import tariffs belonging to Part III (i.e. noncompeting imports) of the Central
American Common External Tariff were approved by Congress in October 1992 (para.
56).
40.    The elimination of virtually all VAT exemptions is a key element of the
new law which would generate additional revenue of Lbout 0 7 percent of GDP  The
law also elIninated most exemptions and reduced deductions to income taxes, while
returning to a system of marginal progressive taxation. It reduced the number
of brackets for personal income tax from 16 to 3 (15, 20, and 25 percent) and
replaced the three rates of the corporate income tax with a single rate of 25
percent.

41. *   ith regard to revenues for petroleum products, the Government introduced
a flat tax per gallon (e.g. Q 2.50 for gasoline, i.e. about US$ 0.50), a 10
percent import tariff, and replacement of the consumption tax with the VAT.
These measures are intended to substitute for the petroleum surcharge in 1993,
while still assuring significant tax revenue from petroleum products.
42.   Better tax and customs administration will form the second pillar of the
Governamet's effort to increase tax revenue. A comprehensive action plan for
Improving tax and customs administration is being implemnted, draving on the
program designed by the Ministry of Finance and on existing technical assistance
projects  financed by USAID  and IDB.   Enhancing  the efficiency of tax
adminlstration would include organizatioual changes, strengthening of a.diting
practices, and simplification of procedures.  The measures for .the customs
administration ould focus on Improving the. control systems so as to increase
collections of import duties and VAT. Annex C outlines the Government's adopted
tax and customs administration reform with specific timetables (for tranche
XSJ*sg&.cgnd1t&oW see paras. 77 (i), 79 (i), and 80 (i)).
43.   The impact of the new tax legislation combined wittW the tax and customs
administration program is expected to increase tax revenues collected by the
Central Government. They would reach at least 7.7 percent of GDP in 1992 and at
least 9 percent of GDP in 1993. ftor tranche relaset conditions see paras. 77
(1), 79 (1), and 80 (1)].  The tax reform would not hurt the poorer sections of
the population since people earning below Q20,000 (about US$4,000) per annum
would be exempt from paying personal income taxes. Moreover, the broadening of
the VAT would affect the poor in only a limited way since VAT would not be
collected In local open air markets where the majority of the poor make their
basic food purchases.

44.   The Cecrment plans to restructure expenditures to make them more
compatible ith den.lopmt objectives.  In 1991, In its efforts to balance the
budget the Govermnet United wag. Increases, froze the level of Central
Government employment, and cut purchases of goods and services. As a result,
current expnditurs In 1991 f.ll by 1.6 percent of GDP to 7.1 percent of GDP.
45.    In 1992, the Government adjusted real public sector wages to the 1990
level. As a consequence, the Central Government'. wage bill will increase from
2.7 to about 3.2 percent of GDP. Despite thi. increase, the wage bill will stay
well below tho  verage of 4.1 percent of GDP registered during the 1980s. In
conformity with Its progrm of rationalising public expenditures, the Goverrment
Vill cut current expenditure of lovr priority, especially within tEs category
of goods end services, .o a. to assure that public savings increase steadily
during the 1990 .
46.    The 1992 budget includes a real increase of 13 percent in social sector
spending. The authorities have included a further 15 percent real increase in
outlay. for basic education and primary and preventive health care in the 1993
budget proposal presented to Congr ea In September 1992 l¢ondigson for Board
fltresglt&jionj par.  72 and 77 (ii). In order to assure that the increase is
allocated to priority areas, the authorities have developed specific expenditure
targets for education and health. The Government has requested that the Bank
help prepare a public sector expenditure review (PSR) to assist them in the
design of a 1994-95  nvstomnt program that is consistent with sound fiscal
policy and the plas for lncresed expenditure In the social sectors and
Infrastructure (para. 72).

47.   The public enterprise sector in Guatemala Is relatively small compared to
other countries. There are 11 public sector non-financial enterprises, with
combited revenues of 3.1 percent of GDP in 1991. The largest enterprises involve
power (U3DE) and telecomunications (GUATEL), representing about 82 percent of
the rewenu generated by public enterprises. While U3DE requires substantial
government subsidies (see para. 49), GUATBL' s high tariffs on international calls
have yielded surpluses equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP in 1991.
48.   The Govertment has decided to restructure several public enterprises in
order to reduce their financial and managerial burdens and to enable them to
operate more efficiently. Due to their gross inefficiency and heavy demands on
the Government's budget, both INUD and I3DKCA (National Agricultural Marketing
Institute) are receivng special attention from the Government.
49.  TSh   atlil 3lectwIav Iastiltute  IND )l            I3D  has faced four
principal problems. lirst, average electricity rates amounted to only 65 percent
of Pong run marginal cost In 1990. Second, M3DE as the power producing company
bas sold electricity to the power distributor of Guatemala City, EBOSA, at bulk



- 13 -
rates that were 47 percent below production cost In 1990, thereby subsidizing
U305k and reducing INDE's revenues. Third, MEDB tariff adjustments have depended
on government authorixation which was rarely given. Therefore, MEDE had to rely
oan Centrol Government subsidies, amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP In 1991, to
cover its substantial deficits.   Fourth,  MEDB exhibit. major operational
shortcomings that have resulted In klgh operating costs and poor quality of
services, as well as In cost overruns and delays In the execution of projects.
50.   The Government has designed and initiated an action plan to deal with
these problem. Since 1991, INDE has Improved its productivity through an 18
percent reduction of its staff. Moreover, the Government ia actively promoting
private sector participation In cogeneration activities in order to keep
installed  capacity  in  line with  electricity  demand.    During  the  iKL
implementation period, the Government would eliminato subsidies to IDDE by 1994
and establish an adequate revenue base for MED. [for tranche releae condition.
see paras. 77 (iii), 79 (1i,), 8a (iii)]. To this end, the Government increased
electricity tariffs, on average, by 47 percent -in August 1991, and by 20 percent
In September 1992. The new bulk rates cover now about 77 percent of long run
marginal cost and about 90 percent in the case of average retail electricity
rates.
51.   The  ational Atricultural Marketina Iastitute (IMDMC&)  A main cmponent
of past agricultural policy In Guatemala has been to raise production of basic
grains while Improving food security and nutrition through public intervention.
The implementing agencies were INDICA to market basic grains and the National
Bank of Agricultural Development (BANDESA, see para. 67) to provide subsidized
agricultural credit. However, INDECA was ineffective In supporting bauic grains
prices. In 1991, the Government stopped public intervention in the basic grains
market  It did not budget any funds in 1992 for INDECA grain operations nor are
any funds included in the 1993 budget proposal.  INDECA has begun a voluntary
retirement scheme to reduce excess employment and the Government has adopted and
Initiated the implementation of a program to further redirect INDECA's operations

S. Trad Reform
52.   During the second half of the 1980s, the Government initiated a trade
liberalization process whoae main features were the unification of the exchange
rate and devaluation of the Quetsal, the reduction of import tariffs, and the
elimination of export taxes   The Government is continuing this process, which
is necessary for achieving greater domestic efficiency and International
competitiveness in order to generate export-oriented growth and employment. In
1991, the Goverm"ent joined GAkT and began phasing out non-tariff barriers
(NTBs). After a tariff reduction in February 1992, the Government now intends
tot (i) establish a tariff structure in the 5 to 20 percent rnge (para. 57),
(ii) eliminate virtually al1 MTBs (para. 58), and (iil) establish a price band
for a few agricultur.l commodities based on a system of variable levies (pars.
59).

S3.    Tbe  "xcha$g  rate system, permitting grsdual nominal exchange rate
adjustmeat, was established in November 1990. It is based on daily auctions by
the Bank of Guatemala of foreign exchange within a band. This band extends 5
contavos above and below he base exchange rate which can be adjusted by a
maximum of 5 centavos every three weeks provided bids have been consistently made
at band li its.
54.    Tbe relatively stable nominal rate has helped to moderate inflation.  The
parallel rate remained very close to the official rate for much of 1991. During
tho first rnne months of 1992, the exchange rate moved narrowly in nominal terms.
55.   The Government has increased the flexibility of the system by raising the
amounts in the auction market when demand exceeded supply. In addition, the
Goverment is seeking congressional approval for the establishment of foreign
exchangeo ouses. Since the maintenance of a market-based exchange rate is a
fundamental prerequisite for the credibility and eventual success of the economic
reforms, developments in the exchange rate will be monitored closely during the
MM Li  coordination with the IMF.
56.    Nominal tariff protection has been relatively low, with an average current
rate of 16.4 percent (Table 4) and with about 47 percent of all tariff positions
at rates of 10 percent or less. Widespread tariff exemptions further reduced
nominal protection. In 1991 the collected import duty revenue amounted to only
7 percent of imports. Given the large dispersion of tariff rates, however,
effective protection remained high, especially in the production of final goods.
To remove this source of distortion and in line with other Central American
countries, the Government moved to a tariff structure in the 5 to 30 percent
rane as of February 1992 for all import items, except those belonging to Part
III (i.e. noncompeting Imports such as petroleum and luxury goods) of the Central
American Common External Tariff. Legislation covering Part III imports passed
Cogress In October 1992 (condition for Board presentatio; para. 77 (iv)].
57.    Prior to second tranche release (para. 79 (iv) ], the Government will
further reducod dispersion levels. As of January 1993, the tariff ceiling will
be lowered to 20 percent and the floor will be maintained at 5 percent. An
exception will be made for textile, clothing, and shoe imports, whose tariffs
will be adjusted with a one year lag in order to allow for a more gradual
adjusttomnt In these sectors.

58. *The covernment is also reducing the incidenc, of NBT In its trade
regime. In 1991, it elmtinated a myriad of NTIs on exports and imports.' The
overnment bas prepared an action plan (Annex D) to remove most re mining Import
and export NTSI gonditions for Board gresentation and s-¢ond tranch. releaoo;

59.    In the contezt of liberalising agricultural trade, the Government will
phase out agricultural NIBs In 1992 as agreed by the Central American countries.
This includes the substitution of all NTBs applicable to yellow maise, rice, and
sorghum  ith price bands to be implemented by variable levis . These price bands



- 16 -
took effect in July 1992. Remaining agricultural MITe will be eliminated as
described in Annex D.
60.    In parallel with the trade liberalization efforts, the Goverrment lifted
all remalaing price control. in early i991, except for petroleum products and
electricity. After the approval of the new legislation for petroleum products
(para. 41), the &overnrent has adopted an action plan to liberalize the domestic
oil market (condition for Board tresentation; para. 77 (Iv)]. Prices will be
fully 14beralized by maid-1993 tsecond tranche releese (para. 79 (iv)].
C. FLiAgcial Sector Reform
61.   The banking sector consists of 3 public banks, one public finance company
(para. 64), 23 private banks, and 6 private finance companies, with the private
sector Institutions representing 87 percent of banking assets. During the 1980s
the performance of the financial sector deteriorated. Private savings fell from
an average of 13.6 percent of GDP in the second half of the 1970. to 7.8 percent
during 1980-85 and to 6.8 percent during 1986-90, Indicating the negative impact
of inadequate finamcial sector and macroeconomic policies. Althoug% declining
to 1.6 percent of GDP in 1991 (Table 1), Central Bank losses, stemming from
subsidized rates on past Government loans and large interest payments on foreign
liabilities, have been monetized and exerted inflationary pressures. Public
sector banks suffer from Inadequate management and are mostly Insolvent (see
para. 64). Moreover, bank supervision and the regulatory framework in Guatemala
have not evolved in line with international practice, raising questions about the
strength  and finanzial health  of the bankling  sector.   During  the EHL
implementation period, the Government intends tos (i) complete the interest
liberalization process (paras. 62-63); (41) implement action plans for public
banks (paras. 65-67); and (III) improve prudential norms and bank supervision
(paras. 68-70).
Intorest Rates
62.   In August 1989, the authorities initiated a process of interest rate
liberalization by eliminating interest rate ceilings.  This has fostered a
process of competition and modernization in the banking system.  Although
interest rates have been market-determined In the private sector segment of the
banking system, interest rates of public banks continued to be set by the
Government. In July 1991, the Government Instructed state banks to align their
interest rates on new loans with those of private banks. Except for the state
housing bank (DAUVI, para. 66), all public banks are in compliance with this
decision.
63.   Although the Government currently pays less than market interest rates on
its debt to the Bank of 6uat_mala (the Central Bank), it will pay interest rates
which reflect the cost of such funds to the Bank of Guatemala, beginning in 1993
(second tranche relesse condition; para. 79 (v)3. As a first step toward the
elilination of interest subsidies, the Bank of Guatemala increased the interest



_ 17 -
rate it cbarges the Government on new treasury bond Issues afteL March 1991 from
7 to 12 percent. The tncrease In interest rates on new Government debt would
help to reduce the Interest subsidy lose.. of the Bank of Guatemala. In March
1992, the GovernAmnt took another step toward reducing these losses when it
started to place Its own bonds (CERTIBONOS) in the local capital market.
WPtak
64.   The three public banks - IA DES& (agriculture), BANVI (housing), and CHU
(mortgage bank) - and the public finance company, COTPIE&, are among the least
efficient institutions in the Guatemalan financial system.  Only CHN shows
profits, while ZANDISA, BAUVI, and CORPINA have experienced substantial losses.
The Government has Jopted far-reaching action plans to address the problems of
each of these entities a mentioned below. The satisfactory implementation ef
these action plans will be monitored during the loan period (tranch. relerse
¢ondAtioAs paras. 77 (v), 79 (vi), and 80 (iv)].
65.   During 1991, the Government began scaling down operations of COISINA,
reducing its labor force from 180 to 87. Through Sepi:ember 1992, another 40
percent of staff left CORPINA. Its eventual liquidation is contingent on a
settlemeAt of the large external debt contracted by COPYIMA to finance a pulp and
paper factory (CBLGUSA) that has never operated. Notwithstanding an agreement
on this debt, the Government is winding down CORPIMA*s operations.
66.    BAMVI    technically bankrupt because of a large non-performing portfolio
and excessive operating costs. Given BAMY 's insolvency and high operational
inefficiency, the Superintendency of Banks temporarily intervened BANVI in May
1992. Its financial assessent concluded that BANVI is not viable. Between the
intervention and Septembr .1992, about 35 percent of staff voluntarily resigned
from DMVI, thereby reducing staff to 746 employees. A plan for BAVI's eventual
liquidation is being Implemented.
67.   Problem  affecting BANDESA have been extensively examined by IDB, USA D,
and GTZ. Based on these reports, a restructuring comnission appointed by BANDESA
has worked out an action plan which would form the basis for improving its
financial situation and cerational efficiency. The restructuring plan envisages
that UDEISA would: (i) serve primarily small-farmers, (ii) be in full compliance
with existing prudential norms by third-tranche release, (iii) be recapitalized,
and (iv) Improve its operational efficiency.
R2UIlatorv XameIoA  and Bank SUmervision
68.      The Government recognizes that strengthening of the regulatory framework
and bank supervision is needed to improve the banking system's ability to
mobilize financial resources in an efficient manner. To this end, the Government
has eliminated the 3 percent stamp tax that applied only to bank credit, and
presented an action plan for Introducing and implementing new prudential norms
as described in Annex  .   In conformity with this plan, urior to Board



- 18 -
u*seSS1D   (para. 77  (v)),  the  Governmet will effect  the  following
modificatione of prudential norms (I) establisbment of a credit clearing houses
(Si) *stabli.b t of acceptable rollover praetices; and (11i) codification and
requirement of periodic external audits. In addition, orior to effectiveness
(para. 78), the Governrnt will approve three new norm  related to: (i) asset
classification and provisioning; (11) disclosure guSdelin.s as per international
practicea and (111) accounting guideline as per international practice.
69.   Tbese changes are being complemented by additional modifications in
prudentill regulations and more fundamental reforms in bank supervision,
especally by endowing the Superiatendency of Banks with more enforcement powers.
To this end, prior to effctvenss (para. 78), the Government will approve a
reorganization plan for the Superintendency of Banks.
70.   During the loat poriod, all banks will be subject to external audits. The
Government'. action plans to lmprove prudential norm and strengthen bank
supervision will be monitored during the NL implementation period [Annx 3; for
tranche rlaxs-econdltione see pars. 77 (v), 78, 79 (vi), and 80 (iv)). In this
context, the lank bha closely coordinated with GTZ and the IDB which intends to
cofinance this component of the NEL (see pars. 1 and 87).
D. Social Sector Oelount and Poverty Alleviatiom
71.   Malutrition, shortages of housing, inadequate access to basic education
and health services Including water and sanitation, and low real wages
characterize the conditions of life of the vast sajority of the Guatemalan
population.   The low level of social spending, compounded by pervasive
Inefficiency In the public sector, has thbwarted efforts to reduce poverty. In
1991, public expenditures for education and health were only 1 6 and 0 9 percent
of GDP, repectively (Table 6).

72. The Government recognizes that social sector spending should be increased
considerobly as a share of total Government expenditure and GDP. Toward this
end, the Governmaet has included a 15 percent re4 increse in both primary
health care and education expenditures In the 1993 budget proposal (condition for
o"2d 2t entgtia; pars. 46 and 77 (ii))e The Government has identified key
programs to which this Increase wil be primarily allocated. Since the increase



- 19 -
In social expenditures should also be accompanied by improved efficiency in the
executing ministries, a thorough revw,aw of expenditures in the social sector is
planned for the PSER (para. 41). In the context of the PSER, agreement would be
reached on an investment program for 1994-95, with a focus on expansion of
primary education, preventive and primary health care, and nutrition programs in
the rural are;. (se¢ond and third tranch. release conditions; pareas 79 (ia) and
80 (ii)l.
73.    Given the inastitutional weaknesses of the public sector, as well as the
lack of coverage by the Ministry of Health in rural areas, the Oovernment has
decided to address the most pressing poverty issues by establishing a 8IF (para.
24) attached to the Presidency grior to Board nresentatioj  [para. 77 (vi) I. The
Bank assisted the Government in designing a SIF project which is expected to be
presented to the Board in parallel with the proposed EML.
III.  THE PROPOSED ECONOMIC MODEIIIZATION- LOAN
ObJctive and Size of EML
74.   With the proposed KM operation, the Bank would support implementation of
the Government'a economic modernization and social development program. The
proposed loan would concentrate on the most important areas of reform as
described in Section II. The size of the loan would be US$120 million.
Prono_ed Trssche Conditional4it
75.   A three tranche operation over 12 to 15 months is proposed. Forty percent
of the loan would be disbursed upon effectiveness, and the remaindor in two equal
disbursements. The second tranch. is expected to be disbursed after about seven
monthes and the satisfactory compliance with second tranche release conditions.
The release of the last trancbe is anticipated for early 1994 after satisfactory
compliance with third tranche release conditions. The closing date will be
September 30, 1994.
76.    In addition to the monitorable actions specified below (see also Annexss
B to E), all tranche releases would be contingent upon the maintenance of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework and satisfactory performence in overall
program implementation consistent with the Letter of Development Policy.

81 Loan proceeds would be used to financo the foreign exchange cost of
general Imports (goods and relevaut foreign services), exluding goods financed
by othor bilateral agencies, luxury goods, military equipment and otbhr goods
specifically prohibited in a negative list defined under the Standard



- 22 -
Internatioal  Trade  Classification  (SITC)  or  equivalent  classification.
Retroactive finmacing for up to 40 percent of the loan amount is recommended for
eligible expenditures incurred since April 15, 1992. Although this increase
would exceed the standard 20 percent guideline for general imports under
adjustment operations, the exemption is justified to help alleviate speedily the
impact of the arrear clearance with the Bank on the country's international
reserve position.
82.   A recent Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) initiated by the
Bank has concluded that Decree Law No. 35-80 (Ley de Compras y Contrataciones)
and its Regulations (Reglsmento de la Ley de Contrataciones) dated July 1980,
which govern public procurement, promote contracting on the basis of competitive
bidding. However, a nwmber of provisions mainly concerning the procurement of
works and consulting services, are in conflict with the BaDk procurement
guidelines. Among such provisions only one has a significance in relation to
the procurement of goods and is relevant to the proposed adjustment operationt
Imported goods must be Insured during their transportation by insurance companies
authorized to operate in Guatemala. Therefore, under the proposed loan the Bank
would finance either the C&P or the FOB cost of imports made by public sector
entities as shown in the respective import documentation.   As to other
conflicting provisions of the Law, the Bank would not accept their application
to the procurement of Bank-financed items under investment or techuical
assistance operations. However, it is expected that the conflicting provisions
of the current law will be addressed under a new procurement law. The Bank will
follow closely any developments concerning the passage of the new procurement
law.
83.   Under the aforementioned CPAR, the Bank carried out a survey of the
procurement procedures followed by major private importers and determined that
private companies generally follow acceptable commercial practices among which
the moat current Is the solicitation of price quotations from suppliers included
in pre-established lists. The lists are revised periodically and the frequency
of the revision depends of the nature of the imported goods. For instance, in
the case of raw materils like plastics, lists are reviewed more frequently
because of the changing characteristics of the product.
84.   On the basis of the CPAR, it is proposed to apply the following
procurement proceduress
(i)   Imported goods by public and private sector entities valued at US$5
million or more would be procured through simplified international
competitive bidding (ICd) procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines,
except for future petroleum imports for which modified ICB procedures,
satisfactory to the Bank, would be used. Such procedures have been
agreed upon with the Government of Guatemala during negotiations. For
petroleum imports being supplied under existing contracts, relevant
expenditure would qualify for reimbursement under the loan in an amount
not to exceed per unit the reference average FOB price published In the
Platt's Oilgram for the US Gulf Coast or the Caribbean, as applicable, on
the date of loading aud adjusted for the type and quality of crude or
product.  No finance charge on such contract would be eligible for
reImbursement under the loan. A similar criterium would apply to the



- 23 -
reimbursemnt of expenditures for imported c        lodities under existing
contracts for which the rsferece uit pric, would be the average price
posted by a roi   commdity exchanges and
(ii)  Imports valued at below US$5 million equivalent would be procured in the
case oft (a) public sector entities, In accordanc with the procedu res
applicable to thom as governed by the laws ad (b) private importers, in
accordance with eatabliabed comercial practices of the sector based on
price quotation. except where dirct contracting may be appropriate under
para. 3.5 of the Bank Procurement Guideline..
85.   Disbursements of each trenche would be made agast import documentation
received from the Ministry of Publi2c Fiane which would be reponsible for the
collection of the relevent documentation and submisslon of loan withdrawal
applications. The Bank will follow the simplified documentation procedures for
adjustment operations deseribed in the recent Board note on this subject (Secl92-

86.   The Bank staff has xoordinated extensively with the IKV and IDB staff in
carrying out a policy dialogue with th authorities. It will continue to work
closely with both institutions on key iussus as the econolc program progresses.
The ]W completed an Article IV consultation mission In June and will present an
15 month stand-by arrangemnt for Guatemala to its Board i December 1992. The
ZpI will continue to be the primary source of external asistsace to Guatmala
during this decade. It is expected to pursue a lending program supporting
economic reform, socil sector investment, and irastructure.
87.   The 1DB is expected to co-finance the proposed EIL with a U8$75 million
loan (para. 70). The IDB loan would complemet the fiaancial sector reforms
included in the EL and is expected to be proested to the IDB Board In December
1992.

88. The GOvernmat has obtained external funds for necessary technical
assistane to  upport actions included In the economic modernization program.
Grants and oneassional finance are supportings (1) a strengthening of general
budgetary seeution, particularly with regard to social sector ministries (UNDP
and USAID) g (11) Iproving prudential regulations end bank supervision (IDB); and
(Iii) improving taz administration through assistance programs financed by USAID
sad IDB (see para. 42). The Bank has coordinated closely the actions supported
under the DML with the technical *astance programs of the respective agencies.
Benefits and Risk.
890    Successful Implementation of the Government's program will help alleviate
poverty In Guatemala. A sustained increase In tax revenues will keep budget
deficits under control and permit more predictable levels of resources for
exanded public investments in infrastructure and the social sectors. The fall
in inflation will reduce the inflation tax on the poor. Trade reform will
stimulate non-traditional exports and msquila industries, providing Increased
employment. linancial sector reform will help increase competition and domestic
resource mobilization.   imultanaous implementation of the SIP project s-ld
directly benefit the poor through targeted education and health expenditures,
while Institutional itprovements are pursued in the Government's social sector
delivery system.
90.   The proposed operation faces several risks. The Serrano Administration
does not bave a majority coalition In the Congress and may therefore face
opposition to the reform program.  Secondly, opposition may be expected by
interest groups which will be adversely affected by the implementation of the
reform program. Thirdly, poor tax collection may threaten prospects for Improved
revenue performance, a cornerstone of the economic modernization program.
Finally, Guatemala's limited lstitutional capacity in the public sector could
undermine Itplementation of several key components of the program.
91.   Countering these risks is the Government's strong commitment to its
economic modernization program and a track record of sound economic management,
domestic credibility, and success in building political support for its economic
program. The recent unanimous Congressional approval of tax legislation is a
case in point. Moreover, the Government is using technical assistance in such
critical areas as tax and customs administration, budgeting, and program
Implementation In the health and education ministries to tprove institutional
capacity.

92.   Guatemala's financing requirements and its likely sources of finance for
the 1992-95 period are detailed In Table 7. Guatemala's continued access to
external crodit was seriously compromised in the wake of the earlier build up of



- 25 -
exteral arrears.   Therefore, settlement with the international financual
Institutions (IMls) bas berm* top priority of tho Governmet. It is ezpected
that Guatemala will settle all remaining arrears In the first semester of 1993.
930    It is ezpected that funding from multilateral institutions, particularly
from tho IDB and the IBRD, will remain an Important oource of external finance,
accounting for almost 25 percent of floancing needs during 1993-95.  Their
disburssemto are projected to increase to over US$200 million in 1993 with the
MIL and Its cofinancing, but would fall to about U8$140 million during 1994-95.
Bilateral disbursements would average about 12 percent of total financing, during
this same period. As a result of the surge In Imports, credit from suppliers and
comercll banks incresed substantially in 1992 and is expected to cover about
21 percent of financing neods during 1993-95. Official grants are projected to
stay below US$62 million per annum after 1992. foreign direct ivestment would
steadily increase and return to the levels observed during the late seventies.
Financing gaps vould rematn small, mainly as a result of the stabilization and
adjustment policies pursued by the Goverment.

Guatemala, October 16, 1992
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President
2he world Bank
1818 n Street, I.I.
Washbngton, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. Preston,
Guatemala  faces profound  structural ecooic  and  social
challenges.   Years of poor economic managet, insufficient
investment ia human capital- domestic civil strife, and non-
desocratic governmet crePf't  a fragmented socLety plagued by
poverty, disease, and illl s.eracy * The Government of xational Uaity
is confronting these p-onlems by pursuLng a politLcal and econoamc
strategy that seks sustained economic and social development, a
angotiated peace accord with the insurgency, and the consolLdation
of a            secratic system reflecting the involvement of every sector
of ociety. The Government 1i convinced that Guatemala must: (1)
Lncrease equal opportunity and access to factors of production; (2)
lower disparities in the distrLbution of Lacome ad regLonal social
development;  (3)  inerease  the  quantity  and  quality  of
lnfrastructure and social services, especially in education and
health; (4) Lacrease savings and investment In both the public and
private sectors; (5) mobillix more resources for financing
development; (6) diveraLfy exports; (7) lncrease efflcioncy and
transparency in financial intermdiation; and (8) ecourage more
competitio   n domestic markets.
Achieving these objectives will not be ccomplished easLly nor
in one presidential term. The Governmeat, however, is committed to
using its mandate to advance these goals and establish the
framework for continued progress. in these efforts we need the
financial, technical, and moral support of the international
rn_unity. We therefore request from the World Sank an Econoeic
Modernixation Loan of US$120 i&llion equivalent to support the

GUATEMALA. C. A.
implmentation of the Govermat's pogram for econoic and social
modernization.
Om Naiotmia Stabilix0io  Zf fot Since 1991
The first priority of the Governmeat when it took office ia
January of last year had to be economic stabilization as poor
macroeonomic management during the firt half of the 1980's and
failurs to aeately  plet stabilization programs during the
late 1980's had ld to an  omc crisis.  Revenues had fallen to
a mere 6.9 percent of GDP in 1990, th. fiscal deficit  aled 2. 6
percent of GDP, Inflation had reached record highs, Internatiol
reserves had fallen to new low, our relations ulth inteatioal
creditors were damaged, and the people's faith in tho ability of
any   vexrt to effectively address the nation's problems had
declined.
the  ermet adopted a cnompehasive stabilization program
designed to curb inflation and to lay the fouadations for a
sustaLied rovery. Fiscal and monetary dlscipiLne have bee  key
to the stabiLization effort.   The Central Government made an
extraordinary effort in balancing its budget ia 1991.  In this
context, the Government reduced its dobt to the Central Bank.
Tight monetary policies helped reduce inflation oan a December to
December basis from 60 percent in 1990 to 10 percent in 1991. Net
short-ter reserves rose from about $20 million in January to $500
million by end 1991.
DurLig 1992, we have sought to maintain discipline. Although
the Government has adjusted real wages in the public sector to
their 1990 level, we *epect to achieve a surplus in the non-
financLal pub1lc sector. Inflation has remained at 10 percent.
Noreover, real economic growth is projected to reach 4 percent as
compared to 3.3 perzent in 1991. The recovery has led to a sharp
increase Li Imports, inaluding strong demand for capital Imports.
Despite continued expansion of non-traditional exports, they have
not bee  able to compensate for a prioe related declLne of
tradltional export  arigs.  as a result, the current account
defiLcit is expected to Irease in this year. We will control thLs
situation through flscal policies and a reduction of the losses of

the Bank of Guatmala, thereby further diminishing iaflationary
pressures.
To hovernment. also bogan LI 1991 the process of normalLizLng
elatlons with the international financlal commuity. Arrears to
the ID  have been eliminated and we intend to cmplete the
clearance of World Bank arrears shortly. Reschedulng agr ts
have ben "ached with several blateral and commrcial creditors
and we expect thls process to be completed in 1993.
we are comuitted to maitaining a sound macomic policy
framwo   i  order to assure  that the stablizatlon  effort
translates into  sustainble economic growth.   This framerk
includes the continuatlon of a market-determined exnge rate and
a financial reglme in which lnterest rates are freely set ia the
market.   Ficoal policy, together with the rate of growth of
monetary agregates, wiL4 be consistent with higher real CDP growth
and declin  iflation rates.  The economic program is supported
by the International Konetary Fund through a stand-by agreeent
which we expect to be approved in November 1992.

nhe Goverment has deigneod a program of economic modernization
and soclal development for the perlod 1991-1996. As outlieod in
our publLcation entitled "naaia Una Demacracia NoonYSica y Social",
we ar commtted to laying the foundatlon for a democracy that will
encourage econmaic growth, justiee, and social welfare.
The guiding principle of thls program ies ia modernizing the
ecoamy by encouraging investmet, competition, efflciency, and
applying a neutral pollcy stance n relation to the efficlent
substitutlon of Imports and promotion of exports. To this end we
are settiag clear pollcy rules to prmote market con and
consumer proteatlon, and expanding  ad improving services and
social  infrastructure  in   ucation,  health,  transportation,
communication, and energy.

requesting support from the Latersatonal commulty. They ares (A)

GUATEMALA. C. A.
public sector reform, (3) trade reform, (c) financial sector
modernization, and, most ospecially (D) social sector developmet.
A.  Madernixatio  of the Pblic   tor
As fiscal deficits have been the main causes of macroeconomic
instabilities during the last decade, their sustained reduction is
of utmost importance. Simultaneously, both public savings and
investment by the non-financLal public sector must increase to meot
pressing economic and social needs. The Government therefore aims
to raise public saviags primarily through an increase in taxation
levels.   It intends to utilize these additional resources to
inerease Investment in the social sectors and infrastructure, and
to increase the efficiency of investment through improved
programming and ezecutLon.
To achieve these goals we are implementing a Fiscal
Modernization Program which consists of two components: (1) a Tax
Modernization Program which seeks to iacrease effective tax rates,
in  addition  to  lncreasing  tax  compliance,  improving  tax
administration, and reducing distortions; and (2) a Program of
Rationalizing Public Uxpeaditure which will address inefficiencies
in programming and executing the budget to strengthen the delivery
of public services.
We have made considerable progress already in our Zaz
Ma4driLsatioALP Pgz. in April and Kay 1992 the Congress approved
four key laws designed to help increase the taxation level to at
least 7.7 percent of GDP in 1992 and 9 percent of GDP in 1993. The
new inacome tax law eliminated a host of exemptions and established
three rates for the personal Lacome tax (compared to 16) and one
for the corporate income tax (compared to three). The base for the
value added tax was significantly broad ene, which will also act to
promote greater economic neutrality ia the tax system.
Petroleum taxation also underwent major revisions.  A fuel
consumption tax was replaced by the value added tax, and a 10
percent import duty and a fixed excise tax on petroleum products
were introduced.   These measures are meant to substitute the
surcharge for the petroleum compensation fund which will be
eliminated no later than July 1, 1993. Congress also eliminated a
- 4 -



- 67 -
MINIST-RIO  DE FINANZFS PUBLIC-S
GC ATEdSLA. C A.
3 percent stamp tax on bank credits and replaced other stamp tax s
with the value added tax.
Finally,  legislation  covering  noncompeting  imports  as
identified in Part III of the Central American Commoan External
Tariff has passed Congress in October 1992. The legislation would
establish an import tariff range of 10 percent to 20 percent with
a few minor exceptions. The law also eliminated all exemptions on
imports except those granted for diplomatic missions and
international agencies and public sector institutions.
We are implementing a major program to improve tax and customs
adinistration. A fiscal analysis unit was set up in the Finace
Ministry in mid-1992 to provide technical support to the Minister
and his staff. The Government has eliminated data entry backlogs
and will complete the establishment of a decentralixed informatLon
system by the end of 1993. In order to improve productivlty in the
tax administratLon, the Government intends to strengthen training
progrs Q   s well as to lncrease the number of auditors.  The
auditors are expected to complete at least 500 field audits and
carry out an average 100 VAT credit audits per month by mid-1993.
As a result of these measures and the new legislation, the
overnwent expects that its tax revenue targets can be met.
The second element of th  public sector modernizatLon rogram
is the rationalization of public expenditures.  Its objectives
include: (1) elimination of redundant current expenditures, (2)
reallocation of expenditures to the priority sectors, especially
socLal sectors, (3) selective increases of expenditures only if
financing requirements are assured in a non-inflationary manner,
and (4) improvements in the delivery of public services.
We are programming a major Lncrease of investment in the social
sectors.   The Goverment has included in its 1993 budget an
inerease of more than 15 percent in real terms over 1992 for
expeaditures in pre-primary and primary education as well as for
preventive and primary health care. It wi11 execute these programs
primarily in the rural areas where poverty levels are highest and
will introduce innovative systems to better deliver education and
health services.
To promote greater public sector effIciency, the Government is
reviewing the status of gublic sector enterprises. although this

sector ts rolatively small, euivalent only to 3.1 percent of GDP
in 1991, Its effectLveness must be increased. Toward this end, the
overnmet has been work^in closely with the electricity generating
company (1MP) and the agricultural  rketing institute (XNDECR) to
Improve their perforance.   The Econcmic Cabinet is currently
reviewing the role of public sector enterprises and to draft the
legal framwork which would peraLt an expanded private sector role
In various sectors of the economy.
in the cae  of T ED, the ovsernment's position is based on the
expansion plan for the national eleatriCity syste. This plan aims
ats (1) stregtheg the final vility of the electricity
secor  (2)  n as    Italled  capacity; (3) improving the
quality of  eice pvied b   XD; (4) setting tariffs that
reflect the real cost of poctio; (4) enouraging private sector
participation i L oeet         avities; and (5) clearing the
esLernal debt arrear of this Institutioa.
The Gowexrm"t already has made progress ia virtually all these
areas.  Electriaity genration increase  by 138 MW in 1991 and is
expected to grow by another 90 W in 1992. Cogeneration projects
are bein  undertake by private investors. Tariffs were adjusted
by 47 percent in August 1991 and by 20 percent in September 1992,
thereby signflcantly reducing the gap between tariffs and long-run
maginal cost.   3DM  staffig has boee  reduced by 18 percent and
productivity icreasedby nearly 20 percent.  Central Government
transfers to I1  were r                1992 to app ately U8$40
million allocated to debt service and arrears reduction.  The
Governma t Idrmine  to build on the progress achieved and to
contiue me i   the electricity sector by making it more
efficient ad idepedet of state subsidies by 1994.
INDCA is another public enterprlse undergoLng profound
changes.   ational agricultural policy is iacreasingly being
coordnated  at the Central Aerican regional level and the
overnment has IMplmented a policy of non-intervention ia the
basic grains market. it instead will devote more resources to
small holders with the goal of achieving higher growth rates for
basic grains production though transfer of tochnology, improved
aocess to Lnputs, better market Information, and higher investments
n rural infrastructure.   The Gornment Is considering the
establishmet of a strategic reserve fiancial fund for basic
grains. For these reasons, the role and slie of INDECA is being

B.  Rkegheii Guatmala's Yae Rgm
noe Goverment considers trade reform to be a key elemant of
its efforts to modernixe the economy Ln order to strengthen the
productive structure and lay the groundwork for sustained growth
based on the efficient use of resources.   Complementing the
liberaliatLon  of other markets  and  a stable macroeonomic
framework, the trade reform is desigd to shift the economy more
toward export activities and efficient import substitution.  The
long-termcompr hesive nature of the trade reforms undertaken by
the Government will ensure the comptitiveneoss needed by
Stimulating growth of production and employmeat through the
expansion of investment opportunitLes and active integration with
the global economy.
This policy is beiag implemented by an imoxrt tariff
rmtLaU ali.atioU pkogr  agreed upon by Central American countries.
As of February 1992, the Government established an import tariff
structure in the S percent to 30 percent range for all tariff
positions, except those pertaLinig to Part IU it em (mainly
petroleum, cars, and luury Imports).  Congress modified Part III
tariffs Ln October 1992. wLth this legislation the three percent
surcharge on  imports will also expire.  Consistent with Central
American agreements, Guatemala will move toward a 5 percent to 20
percent liport tariff structure as of January 1, 1993.    The
Governmnt will adopt a tariff floor higher than 5 percent if
agreed wLth the other Central Aerican countrLes.
in the past, the Guatemlan tariff system was applied together
with exemptions and a host of non-tariff controls such as licenses
deslgned to grant discretlonary protection to specific sectors.
After assumitg office, the Government moved decisively to further
reduce these sources of distortion by eliminating most nao-tarLU
haxliou rduring 1991 and 1992. In July 1992, we replaced all non-
tariff barriers on yellow maise, rice, and sorghu with a price
band systm that operates through variable levs.  All remainng
non-tariff barrLers, except those with specific natLonal security,

June, 1993.
Since November 1990, exohan rate nolLc has been implemenated
through an auction based system where the exchange rat* can
fluctuate within a flexible band. The base exchange rate can be
periodically adjusted, in line with prevailing supply and demand
condltions in the foreign exchange market.  In September 1992, the
Monetary Board approved a draft decree to be submitted to Congress
for the establishmeat of foreiga exchange houses which would
provlde the market with greater flexibility. Consistent with its
economic modernisation program and the policy stance of the Bank of
Guatemala, the overent will contiaue an exchange rate policy
that reflects mrket forces.
The Gavernmet is committed to maintaia a noicy of free nrices
To strenogthen competition and transparency in the petroleum
market we have initiated  a program of liberaliing petroleum
prices. ThLs prooess will be completed by mid-1993 and will be
accompanied by the establishment of a regulatory, legal, and
quality control framework.
C. Filanal seLctor mbdcrhfzatioa
There is a consensus that the Guatemalan financLal sector needs
to more efficiently perform  its intermediary functions.  The
overnment has desLgaed a comprehensive plan to address the
following problems confronting the sector: (1) subsidized Lnterest
rates on Central GoVernment debt and in public banks, (2)
inadequate prudential norms and bank supervLsLon, and (3)
institutional weaknesses, including insolvency and illiquidiLty, in
Som of the public banks.
Th  overnmet is committed to a policy allowing Laretst rates
to be determnd i the arketplace. Although this policy had been
fully  Implemented in th  private  segment of the  Iuatalan
financial system, interest rate liberaliation was lacking in
publia banks. The Government intructed public banks in mdd-1991
to adjust their rates to market levels on all new operations. All
public banks, exoept the public housing bank (s*e below) are now

setting their interest rates in line with the rest of the banking
system.
Subsidies granted by the monetary authorities oan Goverzment
debt have constituted an important source of the losses of the Bank
of Guatemala   To reduce these losses, the Central Government has
progressively increased the interest rates paid to the Central Bank
from 3 percent in 1985 to 12 percent in 1992. Begining Jsnuary 1,
1993 it will commence paying interest on its new debt at a rate
commensurate with the weighted average deposit rate of the banking
system as calculated by the Superiatendency of Banks.
although 9uba  bank  were established primarily to serve
special target groups of beneficiaries, they often have neither
effectively nor efficiently met their objectives. Moreover, they
frequently have caused losses to the Governmaet and curbed the
efficiency of finanoial markets   Therefore public banks will be
rationalized to increase efficiency, target benefits more
accurately, and eliminate fiscal losses to the government.
Trade and price reform have significantly improved incentives
to agriculture. However, increasing medium-sixed and amallholders'
produation will require addltional credit resources and improved
access of producers to the financial system. To this end, the
overall efficiency of rural finance needs strengthening.   The
Government, therefore, has decided to restructure its agricultural
development bank, BN2Ma, into an agency which will cater to small
and medium-sized farmers and move its operations increasingly to
the rural areas* BANDISA has undertaken an external audit in
August-October, 1992 and will be in full compliance with prudential
norms by the end of 1993.   organizational reforms will be
implemented through 1993 and will be substantially complete by
early 1994.
The public housing bank, MM.x, has not been able to provide
low-income housing on the expected scale. Duriag its 19 years of
existence, about 9,300 houses were financed, while Guatemala has a
housing deficit estimated at more than 860,000 units. Moreover,
EASVI'  financial situation has deteriorated over the years,
accruing substantial losses. In May 1992, BAWI was intervened
temporarily by the Superintndency of Banks.   Its financial
assessment has concluded that the lnstitution is not viable. The
Executive Branch has begun implementing a phased process directed

at presentation to the Congress of a proposal to liquidate SAN?.
Ths process includes the suppression of banking activities,
progressive staff reduction, assets liquidation, liablliti6s
clearance, and transfer of responsibilities to other institutions.
The National Finaace Corporation,  CDRFNA,  also has not
fulfilled its original mandate. The Government, therefore, decided
to progressively phase out CORFINA's operatLous and has been
implementing asset sales and voluntary retirement since 1991.
These measures will continue through 1993.
Wlthin the Government's modernization program, new rudential
noas are needed to: (1) increase the transparency of bank
financing; (2) improve asset quality and capital adequacy; (3)
ensure that banks compete according to a uniform set of rules and
accounting standards; and (4) deal more effectively with eventual
problem  banks.    oew  norms  concerning  loan  classification,
provisioning, accounting standards, and new guidelines for rollover
practices, external audits, and information disclosure will became
effective  January  1993.   A  credit  clearLg  house will be
established by that date. Banks will Lmplement these norms during
1993 and be in full compliance with them by end-1993.
The Central Bank is committed to removing unnecessary barriers
to entry into the financial market.  By June 1993, the period
between the application for and a decision by the Monetary Board on
granting a new bank charter will be reduced to no more than 6
months.  This policy will be translated into a new norm to be
submitted for approval to the ixecutive Branch no later than the
end of 1993. At that time, the Central Bank will present draft
leglslatLon for submission to Congress rescinding all exemptions
fram capital adequacy requirements. In addition the Governent
will submit draft norms or laws dealing with problem banks.
Given the changes occurring ln the financial system, including
new norms and incre"sed presence of new banks, the Governmet is
aware of the need to strengthen the. .uperinteadencg of Banks.
During 1991, the first phase of an early warning system was put
into place to improve the institution's surveillance capability.
The full system will be operational by early 1993. The Goverment
has also decided that the Superintendency needs to be reorganized
with regard to its functions and human and physical resources. As
- 10 -

a result, the Monetary Board will approve a reorganizatLon of the
agency na De:ember, 1993, whicb will be fully implemented by end-
1993.
The Goverment will also undertake a review during the next
half  year  of  other  potentLal  steps  to  strengthen  the
Superintendeacy's  autonomy  and  authority.    Based  on  this
assessment, legal provislons stipulating independence for the
Superiatendency wll be issued or logLslation will be submitted to
Congress, if so required.

The basic objectLves of the Government's social policy are to
reduce poverty and increase social welfare.  These will be pursued
through a variety of programs to improve health servLeos and raise
nutrition levels, and expand the coverage and improve the quality
of education. Progress will be achieved through: (1) increases in
public spending in social sectors; (2) strengthening of delivery
capabilities through decentralization of budget decision-making,
streamlinLng of administrative procedures, implementation of
innovative projects and programs, and training of staff; and (3)
efforts to better target expenditures and services for the most
vulnerable groups and obtaLi the highest social return on spendiag.
As many of the administrative modernization measures in the
line social sector miaistries will require time to be implemented,
the Government has established a Social Investment Fund (SIF) under
the Presiodency. It has been given a mandate to address some of the
limmediate neds of poor rural communities in term  of investments
iL health, nutrition, oducation, and productive ventures. The SIF
will rely on loaal institutions, groups, and non-overnmental
agencies for their mplementation. The SIF will coordinate closely
with the aneceary lie minstries to ensure that its sub-projects
are Incorporated into the programs of those ministries.   in
parallel to the Economic Modernization Loan, the Goverment is

seeking the World Bank's financial support for the Social
investment Fund.
Bducation coverage contLnues to be unsatisfactory despite the
offorts of the last 20 years to build schools and iacrease the
number of teachers and students. Overall primary school atteadance
has Increased to only 61 percent of the corresponding age group and
about 73 percent of children between the ages of 5 and 6 years do
not attend school.  The precarious situation of the education
system is also reflected by high rates of dropout, absenteeism, and
repetition. The lack of programs to maintain school facLlities has
led to a serious deterioration in those facilities and
complemntary services. As a result of these problems, 52 percent
of the population over the age of 15 are illiterate, and the figure
reaches 70 percent in rural areas.
We are commLtted to addressing the most pressing needs in the
education system and have identified several goals, the most
important of which is to increase public school attendance of
Primary school aged children to 80 percent by 2000.  To begin
achieving this goal, public expendlture on education will increase.
For 1993 the Government is seeking more than a 15 percent real
increase in the budget for education.  This Increase will be
largely directed toward investments and primary education in rural
areas and to implement an innovative pilot project to finance and
supervise grass-root organizations to deliver educational services
at the basic level In a completely decentralized way.
ealth  coverage,  at  54 percent  of  the  population,  is
unsatisfactory. Nearly 60 percent of children between 3 and 36
months have symptoms of malnutrition, and more than one-third of
all chlldren between 7 and 11 years old show evidence of a
significantly smaller size for their age. Health education and
preventive care are inadequate, and the decline in rural incomes
has aggravated problems of infant mortality and malnutrition. The
delivery of health care by the Government has been curtailed by low
budgets, inefficiency in the management of resources, and
deterioration in physical facllities.   It is concentrated on
ourative medicine and is located largely in the capital city.
We intend to improve the nationa's health care system through
Increased spending, strengthened human resource management, broader

We proposed to Congress a more than 15 percent real increase
iL health expenditures in the 1993 budgot. Thes, resources will be
largely allocated to preventive and primary health care, nutrition
programs, and an expansion of health care coverage Ln rural areas.
We have decided to utilize the Quetzal eqruvalent of the
EcoanmLc Modernlzatlon Loan to further strengthen our soclal
development program.  This would be accolih   by f cing
