were satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was negligible to low; Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory; borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: a\n            government that is embracing the concept of information\n            society may not necessarily be ready to take the policy\n            decisions that such a concept implies in terms of sector\n            liberalization, private sector participation, level playing\n            field competition, freedom of expression, and access to\n            information and the Internet. ICT for disabled children and\n            adults is an important issue that can be successfully\n            addressed if a Government is committed to making a genuine\n            difference for this group. The key elements of success of\n            this initiative were the existence of a policy for the\n            sector, the availability of excellent statistics on this\n            target group that enabled customization of this program, and\n            the leveraging on Non Government Organizations (NGOs) that,\n            while not fully independent provided a better follow-up on\n            this activity than would have been the case if the activity\n            had been placed under a government department. A\n            technology-based project requires flexibility and capacities\n            in the field. The appraisal did not capture the flexibility\n            needed in a technology project well enough. This project\n            showed that planning costs of ICT acquisition of equipments\n            and applications more than one year in advance is likely to\n            bring inaccurate budget evaluation."}, "docdt": "2011-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
