A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues

Since the late 1990s, the Govemment o f Tunisia (GOT)has designated information and
communication technologies (ICT) as a priority development sector. A central objective o fthe
1Oth Development Plan (2002-2006) is fostering the emergence o fa knowledge-based economy.
Insupport o fthis objective, the Plangives priority to further developing the ICT sector andaims
at increasing ICT revenues from 3.5 percent o f GDP in2001 to 7 percent by 2006. The GOT,in
partnershipwith the World Bank, prepared and issued in2001 a national ICT strategy. In2003,
at the GOT'Srequest, the Bank carried out a study on private participation ininfrastructure (PPI)
that included a chapter on telecommunications and information technologies. The current
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tunisia identifies modernization of information
infrastructure services through opening them to private investment as a priority to be supported
byBank operations. Increasedcompetitiveness andeconomic diversification supported by ICT is
a key to Tunisia's economic growth, especially since exports will be coming under ever greater
competitive pressure inthe next few years and its internal market will needto gear upto face the
impending completion o f the free trade zone with the EUby 2008.

Inpursuingthese goals, the GOThas successfully undertakenseveral measures aimedat
enhancing the diffusion of ICT among enterprises and consumers. Inthis field, Tunisia i s ahead
o f comparable countries and is the leader inMENA. The GOThas, among other initiatives: (a)
successfilly developedthe e-dinar platform; (b) developede-procurement; c) contributed to
dissemination o f ICT intrade facilitation programs and policies (Tunisie TradeNet); and d)
supported PubliNets and affordable PCs for the population at large.

The GOThas also implementedcertain measures to reformthe telecommunications sector
underpinning the broader ICT sector: (a) Competition inmobile telephone service, introduced in
2002 by awarding a second operating license to a private operating company with foreign
participation, has increased I C Trevenues to 6 percent o f GDP in2003; (b) New Intemet service
providers have been authorized; (c) A license was issued for data services usingVSAT (Very
Small Aperture Terminal) satellite technology; and (d) A global mobile satellite service was
introduced by Tunisie Telecom, the incumbent state-owned telecommunications operator.

Progress has also been achievedtowards modemizing the legal and regulatory framework o f
telecommunications. Duringthe last three years the GOThas: (a) enacted a new
telecommunications law; (b) issued implementing regulations on interconnection, numbering,
and spectrum management; (c) created the Instance Nationale des Telecommunications (INT) to
regulate interconnection, numbering, and other matters and adjudicate disputes between
operators; (d) created the Agence Nationale des Frequences (ANF) to manage the radio
spectrum; and (e) approved an amendment to the telecommunications law to increase INT's
financial independence.

Telecommunications sector reform, however, has been slower than incomparable developing
countries inMENA and other regions. This is likely to be constraining growth o f information-
intensive sectors across the whole economy. Reformis also behind schedule relative to Tunisia's
commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO), which included fully liberalizing


                                                 1

packet switched data transmission from 1999, mobile telephony from 2000, and local telephone

2002. The GOTschedule under the lothDevelopment Plan to issue additional
service from 2003, and allowing up to 10percent o f foreign ownership inTunisie Telecom from

telecommunications licenses and sell a minority ownership share o f Tunisie Telecom to foreign
investors i s on track, but it would still fall short o fthese commitments, placing at risk the GOT'S
ambitious targets for ICT growth.

Specific issues that will remain a priority over the coming years are: (a) developing the ICT
potential o f the Tunisian private sector; (b) accelerating Internet and ICT use by firms and
consumers; (c) extending access to I C T in rural areas; (d) increasing competition and private
participation in all segments o f the telecommunications market; (e) improving availability and
reducing price o f broadband services; and (0 enhancing reliability and security o f information
and communications networks.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The proposedproject approach i s consistent with the World Bank Group's strategy for the ICT
sector approvedby the Board of Directors in September, 2001. This strategy calls for advancing
sector reform by (a) broadeningthe focus across all ICT components (including the postal
sector); (b) creating an enabling environment for e-commerce and e-government; (c)
strengthening policy and regulatory institutions to implement sector reform; (d) promoting
growth, efficiency, quality, and innovation through competition andprivate sector participation;
and (e) promoting access to information infrastructurewith a special focus on rural communities.
The Bank has several comparative advantages to assist the GOTinthis sector:


    0   The Bank brings the right mix of technical assistance and advice to help focus the GOT
        on priority issues and make the case for sector reform. The Bank has maintained an
        extensive ICT policy dialogue with the GOTfor several years and i s fully aware o f the
        sector issues andmainplayers. It also maintains a dialogue on telecommunications sector
        reform, e-government, and I C T development inabout eighty countries all over the
        developing world, including the MENA region (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,
        Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia). The Bank i s thus well equippedto informthe GOT
        about sector best practices and discuss the benefits of different approaches to sector
        reform inthe Tunisian context.
    0   The Bank has implemented scores of telecommunicationsprojects and has proven
        expertise as well as a large pool o f specializedskills indesigning effective policies for
        helping countries make the transition to an information-based economy.
    0   The Bank can identify international global best practices relevant to the developing world
        innew areassuch as e-applications ande-government.
    0   The Bank i s well placedto play a leadership role among donor agencies inthis broad and
        complex area, helping to prevent overlaps and conflicts.

The GOTrequested the Bank to support I C T sector reform intelecommunications and the e-
agenda inconjunction with their preparation for the second phase o fthe World Summit on the
Information Society (WSIS), which will take place inTunis inNovember, 2005.

3. Higher level objectivesto whichthe projectcontributes

The project contributes to the implementation o f Tunisia's lothDevelopment Plan covering the
period 2002-2006. The project helps (a) develop the information infrastructure neededto
underpin rapideconomic growth and employment, especially inmodern and export-oriented
sectors; (b) increase competition andprivate sector participation inthe I C T sectors; and (c)
achieve more effective delivery o f social and govemment services.

The project is also consistent with the Bank's CAS o f June 3,2004, the PPI study o f2003, and
the ICT strategy o f 2002. The project provides an opportunity for the Bank to accompany the
GOTas it faces new opportunities andchallenges inICT sector policy and strategy. Inparticular,
the project helps prepare the way towards (a) modemizing the ICT infrastructure neededto build
the knowledge economy and integrate into the global economy; (b) reducingthe highcost o f
telecommunications services currently handicappingmany sectors o f the economy; and (c)
improving the effectiveness and transparency o f ICT sector management and regulation.

More immediately, the project also helps (a) identify impediments to private sector participation
inICT andcreate anddevelop ICT firms; (b) leverage Tunisia's goodrecordingovernment
services by devising an e-government strategy and implementing selected e-government
applications; (c) increase ICT training and capacity buildingfor ICT firms, professionals,
disabled persons, and govemment service providers; and (d) strengthen the GOT'Sproject
management capacity.

                                                 4

The project activities will include (a) technical assistance; (b) procurement o f goods, IT
equipment, and services; and (c) training.

5. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

The following lessons drawn from past Bank operations and global good practice were reflected
inthe projectdesign:

         Where there is full ownership by the Borrower o f a project, the likelihood o f success i s
         enhanced. The GOTrequested this TA loan to support Tunisia's readiness to host the
         World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) to be held inTunis inNovember
         2005. This is a unique opportunity for the Bank to support the modernizationo f the ICT
         sector inTunisia and set the stage to buildour policy dialogue for lasting changes
         around the world.
         Support from on-site advisers and operational advice regarding priority issues duringthe
         initial stage are invaluable for the design and implementation o f the project.
         Governments that have succeeded inthe e-agenda have opened upthe ICT sector to
         competition andprivate sector participation, andhave established a telecommunications
         regulator that i s independent from the operators andprotectedfrom political
         interference.

6. Alternatives consideredandreasonsfor rejection

Given the tight time frame within which the GOTis seeking assistance, a possible conventional
operation with substantial policy conditionality was considered impractical at thisjuncture. The
project, rather than being a reformproject, helps develop a cooperative relationship that will
provide the basis for further policy dialogue. Many project activities will provide direct support
to sector reform.

An alternative project approach originally envisaged, but subsequently rejected, had a broader
scope regardingprivate sector development inthe ICT sector. This approach would have
includedthe financing o f substantial civil works for the `Technopole' cyberpark and direct
support to small and medium enterprises inthe ICT sector. This approach, however, would have
added complexity to the project, reducedproject focus, required detailed economic analysis, and
resulted insubstantial delays.


C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

This Information and Communication Technologies Sector Development Project is financed by
the IBRDand the Tunisian Government. The GOT'Sinterest indeveloping the I C T sector goes
back several years. In 1998, following a speech from President Ben Ali, the ITU's
plenipotentiary meeting inMinneapolis adoptedResolution 73 selecting Tunisia as the host o f
the second phase o fthe WSIS inNovember 2005. In2001, the GOTprepared and issued a
national ICT strategy, inpartnership with the World Bank. In2003, at the GOT'Srequest, the


                                                   5

Bank finalized a study on private participation ininfrastructure(PPI) that included a chapter on
telecommunications and information technologies.

Although no formal co-financing or parallel financing i s plannedwith other donors for this
particular project, both the African Development Bank and the EuropeanUnion(EU) were
partners inrecent Bank ICT sector operations inTunisia. The EUremains active intraining
initiatives (MEDA) and insupport for the second phase o f WSIS. USAID is providing funding
to the Sfax cyberpark, one o f the seven planned ICT technopoles inTunisia. Inaddition, the
Japan Bank for International Cooperationandthe European Investment Bank have planned
activities inthe area o ftechnopark investment and development. These initiatives andthe
proposedBank project complement each other.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

Implementation period: The project will be implemented over a period o f four and a halfyears,
from July 1,2004 to December 31,2008.

The Ministry o f Communication Technologies and Transport (MCTT) will be responsible for the
overall coordination, implementation, and supervision o f the project. For each activity
concerned, MCTT, through the Project Management Unit (PMU), will consult with, and delegate
to, the relevant participating agencies and ministries.

The Project Management Unit (PMU) of the MCTT, currently coordinating the Bank-financed
Transport Sector Projects Iand 11, will assist the MCTT. The PMU, under the responsibility o f
the Director General o f Planning and Studies o f MCTT, i s currently composed o f a Project
Coordinator and two staff. The PMU has acquired significant experience in accounting and
financial monitoring, as well as some experience inprocurement, under Bank-financed projects.
The PMUwill be strengthened per the procurement assessment summarized inAnnex 8.

For this project, the PMU will be (a) the main counterpart to the Bank in the implementation o f
procurement activities and quality assurance o f the documentation subject to the Bank's review
and no objection, and, as such, it will ensure compliance with the Bank's procurement rules in
this project; and (b) responsible for the overall financial management o f the project, including
disbursements.

Financial reporting and disbursements: The P M U will be in charge o f the overall financial
management of the project. The PMU has acquired a substantial accounting and financial
monitoring experience with World Bank-financedprojects. The PMU will consolidate data related
to transactions made by participating agencies and ministries and will periodically prepare
consolidated financial statements and quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports. Overall, this unit is
responsible for sustaining a financial management system acceptable by Bank standards, and for
ensuring compliance with the Bank's procurement, disbursements, and financial reporting
procedures.




                                                  6

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

The PMU will be responsible for monitoring progress via performance indicators. A
procurement package in Project Component 4 (Project Management and Support to the
Preparationo f WSIS 2005) will provide the technical assistance required by the PMU. The P M U
will generate and submit to the Bank semi-annual progress reports. The Bank will conduct a
minimumo f two supervision missions per year duringproject implementation as well as annual
progress reviews. A mid-term review will be conducted, which will encompass (a) a thorough
review o f the execution o f the project and the achievement o f project objectives to date; and (b)
agreement between the Bank and the Borrower on recommended measures to ensure efficient
execution o f the project and successhl achievement o f project objectives in the period after the
review, all in accordance with agreed performance indicators. The GOTwill transmit to IBRD a
project completion report within six months o f loan closing.

The head o f the PMU will act as Monitoring and Evaluation Project Coordinator. The
Coordinator will be responsible for M&E activities across the units of the various participating
agencies and ministries, and for monitoring and evaluating results. The Statistics and Economics
Unit inthe MCTT will report to the Coordinator for project monitoring and evaluation matters.
They would report to their own director inthe MCTT for providing inputs to policy-makers. For
the monitoring and evaluation fhctions, the Coordinator will collect information from a range o f
participating agencies, including ATI, SUP'Com, ISET'Com, ANSI, CNI, and the concerned
Ministries (Justice, Social Affairs, SecrCtariat d'Etat  la RCforme Administrative). The Statistics
and Economics Unit at the MCTT will work with the PMUto produce an annual Monitoringand
Evaluation Report, and they will share ownership and responsibility for it. Ultimately, the
Coordinator at the PMU will oversee, and is accountable for, the annual report and its
submissionto the World Bank.

A steering committee (Comitk de Coordination) will be in charge o f general policy guidance
and ensuring the consistency and smooth execution o f the project. It will meet at least twice a
year. Placed under the Minister MCTT (or his representative), it will be composed o f
representatives o f the Ministry o f Development and Intemational Cooperation and the Ministry
o f Finance, and o f the participating agencies and ministries, as well as the Project Coordinator.

4. Sustainability

The project takes advantage o f a moment when increased demand for ICT services from the
private sector and civil society is coinciding with strong GOTmotivation to support andpromote
the project. The project exhibits a number o f important characteristics that contribute to its
sustainability:

        The project uses lessons learned not only from the previous Bank projects but also
        lessons from ongoing successful efforts made inthe region by countries such as Algeria,
        Morocco, Jordan, and Turkey. The governments can learn from world best practices in
        ICT, andto incorporatethese lessons into sustained ICT, telecommunications, and e-
        govemment programs.
        The project plans to provide capacity buildingactivities to the MCTT. These activities
        will strengthen the long-termcapability for the sector agencies to effectively manage the
       telecommunications andICT sectors andhelp buildup the ongoing policy dialogue.
        Training activities are included inthe project design, and will benefit employees from the
        MCTT andother participatingagencies andministries.
        The project will embed a M&E component and support to an economics and statistics
        unitwithinthe MCTT.
        Intensified policy dialogue on sector reform will benefit sustainability o freform inthe
        area o f telecommunications competition andregulatory reform.

D. APPRAISALSUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analysis

The project is expected to result inconsiderable economic benefits but these cannot be separated
out from those o f ICT development generally:

       Increased I C T expenditures, initially intelecommunications services not directly relatedto
      project activities and inthe longer runfrom both investments inthe I C T sector to expand
      production andbackward linkages to other sectors.

       Declining production costs as effective competition develops intelecommunications, in
      the short term benefiting mainly the service sectors and, inthe longer run, also spurring
      productivity gains inother sectors.

       Lower transaction costs throughout the economy andbetter access to services by the
      population at large, resulting from increased used o f the Internet, including e-commerce
      and e-government applications.

       Lower risk o f systemic failure o f critical Government administrative information systems,
      resulting from the adoption and implementation o f an e-security program.

       Employment creation related to (a) new work opportunities inthe ICT sector that more
      than offset labor productivity gains from competition; and (b) higher economic growth and
      diversification, following economy-wide spillovers o f ICT development.




                                                    12

Technical assistance included inthe project, together with the arrangements agreed to procure all
goods and services, are likely to result incost-effective solutions being generally adopted.
Annex 9 gives further details on the economic appraisal.

2. Technical

Experience inTunisia under previous projects involving the MCTT, as well as inother countries,
suggests that the technical choices the government has made for the various subcomponents o f
this project are overall reasonable. The Government established a technical committee within
MCTT for project preparation, which reviewedthe quality o fproposals from a technical
standpoint.

A teamo fspecialists from eachparticipatingentity prepared each subcomponent o fthe project,
which were then submitted to the technical committee. Only subcomponents accepted by the
technical committee were presented to the World Bank for evaluation. Based on this list, the
Bank pre-appraisal mission assessedthe technical aspects o fthe various subcomponents as well
as their consistency with Bank policies and the Tunisian CAS objectives. Inparticular,
subcomponents were evaluated interms o f their potential to increase private sector participation
and competition. As a result, several subcomponents were excluded. Further selection occurred
duringloanprocessing andnegotiations, to reduce the number o fsubcomponents andkeep those
whose technical choices better satisfied the selection criteria and were ina more advanced state
o f preparedness. As a result, the subcomponents selected were generally ratedas satisfactory.

3. Fiduciary

Financial Management

Overallfinancial management risk is low.

The Project Management Unit (PMU) has acquired a substantial accounting and financial
monitoring experience with World Bank-financedprojects. As a result, its management capacity
is inaccordance with the Bank's financial management requirements. Hence, the risk inherent to
the financial management o f this project is low.

An assessment o fthe PMU's financial management capacity has been conductedinthe context
o f the appraisal mission o fthe project. The assessment focused on the accounting system, the
internal control mechanisms, the audit modalities, the existing information system, the
monitoring and financial management software application, andthe financial management
reporting capacity allocated to the project implementation. The FinancialMonitoringReports
(FMR)templates were presentedto and discussedwiththe PMU.

The MCTT provides an appropriate accounting and internal control system, as well as
satisfactory yearly external audit arrangements. The M C T T prepares satisfactory Project
Management Reports (PMR) and will be able to prepare Financial MonitoringReports (FMR)
for the new project, considering that they are a simplified form o f the PMR. The FMR format has
been agreed andwill be integrated into the Project ImplementationPlan (PIP). The software used
bythe PMUcouldproduce the FMRinaccordance withthe templates discussed, provided the



                                                  13

software development firmupdates the reporting forms, This is considered as a minor weakness,
which needs to be addressedtimely by the PMU, but which does not require a formal actionplan
to be detailed inthis report.

Procurement

Overallprocurement risk is high.

Procurement o f goods and services, including consultant services (firms and individuals) will be
processed inaccordance with World Bank guidelines Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits, May 2004, Selection and Employment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers, May
2004.

The implementation arrangements for the project are provided inAnnex 6. An assessment o fthe
capacity o fthe implementing agency to implement procurement actions for the project has been
carried out duringpre-appraisal/appraisal mission. The PMUhas acquired some procurement
experience with World Bank-financed projects. However, given the complexity andthe tight
timetable for the project, the PMU's staffing will need to be strengthened. The corrective
measures to address the highprocurement riskwhich have been agreed are: (a) recruitment by no
later than September 30,2004 o f a procurement specialist (to be hired by MCTT out o f loan
funds and incompliance with Para. 1.8 o fthe Guidelines for Consultants), to provide technical
assistance to the PMUto handle the initial procurement activities, while buildingup the capacity
o f the PMU. This specialist will work with the P M U for a period o f at least 12months; (b) as an
effectiveness condition, strengthening the PMUby staffing itwith specialists inprocurement,
ICT, andproject management with knowledge o f ICT. These specialists are expected to be
recruitedfrom withinthe Government and couldbe appointed for the duration o fthe project. If,
duringproject implementation, additional efforts appear necessary to strengthen the PMU's
capacity, loan funds couldbe usedfor such purpose; (c) providing representatives o f all
participating agencies and ministries a short training inTunisia no later than the time o fproject
launch, and (d) an indepth training o f at least one member o f the PMUinthe Procurement
Course organizedby the World Bank inDakar (November 2004).

4. Social

The project will have a positive impact on citizens, firms, disabledpersons, and generally those
who use Tunisian online information services. The project will create readily available content
on the activities o fthe Government, facilitate opportunities for investment by the private sector,
provide additional and affordable access to telecommunicationsthrough the provision o fnew
licenses andtesting o fprovision o frural access through a pilot broadbandprogram, strengthen
the capacity o f ICT firms inTunisia, andallow for transparent online transactions with the
Government.

Specific impacts are anticipated, for example, inthe following activities o fthe project:

        Providing handicapped persons with improved access to basic education, specialized
        workstations and an improved ability to participate inthe information society from a
        civic or professionalperspective



                                                  14

     0   Providing improved and easy access to government information(i.e.: regulations and
         jurisprudence, health information, etc) as well as to transactions with the government

The project will increase the effectiveness of government services delivered. Reducingthe
burden by government on private sector development (e.g., by transparently obtaining a permit)
will free entrepreneurs' energies anddirect them to productivelabor, andhence contributingto
the general economic growth. Similar indirect impacts will flow from reducing the burden of
time and expense on individuals who needto interact with the Government.

There are no resettlement or other possibly negative social issues associatedwith the project.

5. Environment

Environmental category: C Not Required
                                   -
This i s a telecommunications, ICT, and e-applications within government project which
encompasses policy, legal, regulatory, and institution-building activities, and an investment
component to help computerize, streamline and Web-enable the management ofvarious
government agencies and ministries. There are hence no environmental issues anticipatedinthe
project  .

communication technologies (ICT) as a priority development sector. Most recently, inits loth
Since the late 1990s, the Government o f Tunisia (GOT)has designated information and

Development Plan (2002-2006) it highlightedas one o f its key objectives fostering the
emergence o f a knowledge-based economy. As one o fthe main underpinnings ofthis goal it has
given highpriority to the further development of the ICT sector, inorder to increase ICT
revenues as a percentage o f GDP from 3.5 percent in2001 to 7 percent by 2006. The current
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) under preparation also clearly identifies modernization of
information infrastructure services through opening them to private investment as one o fthe key
priorities to be supported by Bank operations.

This section discusses the status o fthe ICT sector, focusing on telecommunications sector
structure, telecommunications and Internet growth, regional performance comparisons, and the
consequences on the e-agenda inTunisia.

Strategy andPolicy:

Tunisia's strategy, as spelled out inits Country Assistance Strategy, is to
    0   Strengthen the business environment to support the development o f a more competitive,
        internationally integratedprivate sector and improve competitiveness o f the Tunisian
        economy
    0   Enhance skills and employability o f graduates and labor force ina knowledge economy
    0   Improve the quality o f social services through enhanced efficiency o fpublic
        expenditures.

Tunisia's ICT Policy Note, preparedby the World Bank on behalf o f and inpartnership with the
Government o f Tunisia, sets ambitious targets for the country's ICT sector interms o f industrygrowth
andjob creation. O fparticular relevance to the proposed project are the followingpolicy measures
outlined inthe policy note:


    0   Facilitate the procedures for acquiring software and IT services and externalize the
        development o f software and ICT services
    0   Technical support programs: Develop a brand name for Tunisia as a favorable business
        location (FBL) for'firms inthe ICT sector (eTunisia)
    0   Further development of venture capital financing (indirectly)
    0   Increase the human resources endowment of Tunisia to better serve the needs o f market
        segments where Tunisia should develop a competitive advantage
    0   Develop e-government
    0   Make private firms active elements ine-commerce
    0   Develop and introduce sectoral portals (tourism, etc).

The Government has implemented certain measures to reform the telecommunications sector in
view o fthese goals -these are addressedbelow.

communications.

Tunisian Internet Agency (Agence Tunisiennede 1'Internet -ATI). AT1was created in 1996 as a
national Internet operator andto promote Internet services inTunisia. Itoperates under the
supervision o fMCTT and its responsibilitiesinclude (a) providing bandwidthto ISPs; (b)
managing andregistering domain names under the TN suffix; (c) website hosting; and(d)
organizing seminars andtraining on ICT.

The incumbent monopoly operator i s the government-owned Office National des
TClCcommunications, also called Tunisie Telecom (TT), which was established by Law No. 95-
36 o f April 17, 1995.

Reformsby the GOT

So far, the GOThas implemented certain measures to implement its program to enhance
competition inthe telecommunications sector:

    0   In2002, it introducedcompetitioninthe mobile cellular market, through the awardofa
        competitive license to Orascom;
    0   The number o fInternet Service Providers has been increased;
    0   The Government has awarded a data license usingVSAT (Very Small Aperture
        Terminal) satellite technology;
    0   GMPCS mobile satellite services have been introducedthrough the incumbent operator,
        Tunisie Telecom.

Interms ofregulatory reform, the Governmenthas also undertaken several important steps inthe
last three years, which include (a) the enactment o f a new Code des Communications; (b) the
passing o f implementing regulations inseveral areas, including interconnection, numbering and
spectrummanagement (a regulation covering the area of private networks is under
consideration); (c) the establishment o fthe Instance Nationale des Telecommunications (INT), a
semi-independent agency which oversees over interconnectionmatters, numbering and other
disputes among telecommunications operators; (d) the approval o f an amendment to the Code
des Communications to increase INT's financial independence, andto create the Agence
Nationale des Frkquences, an EPIC under the responsibility o fthe Ministry.

Inaddition to introduction ofcompetition andregulatory reform, the Tunisian Governmenthas
also undertaken several measures aimed at enhancing the diffusion o f ICT among Tunisian
enterprises and citizen. Some relevant initiatives include (a) successful development o fthe e-
dinar platform; (b) development o f e-procurement; (c) diffusion o f Information Technologies in
trade facilitation programs and policies (Tunisie TradeNet); and (d) support for PubliNets and
affordable PCs for the population. Inthis broad area o fproactive public policies infavor ofI C T
diffusion, the Tunisian Government is particularly advanced comparedto other countries o f the
region, and leads the reform inthe MENA region.

Tunisia is behindschedule with regards to its commitments under the WTO inthe
telecommunications services sector. Tunisia committed to liberalize packet switched data


                                                  18

transmission from 1999, mobile telephony from 2000, and local telephone service from 2003,
andto allow up to 10percent o f foreign ownership inTunisie Telecom from 2002. There has
beenprogress inall these directions, but at a slower pace than committed. (There are only two
mobile operators and Internet competition is limited. Tunisie Telecom i s still the only authorized
local telephone operator, and although it has been restructured as a share corporation it remains
fully state owned.) The GOTplansto issue additional licenses andopen shareholding o fTunisie
Telecom to foreign investors, but limitations inthe number o f licenses still would fall short o f
the WTO commitments.


Sector Reform andRegulation

Universal Service Obligation

According to the 2001 Telecom Act, any telecommunications network operator must provide
basic telecommunications services, andmust:

    0    provide opened contact points on the whole territory
    0    ensure equal access to all users.

The obligations include the free routing o f emergency calls, publishinga directory inprinted or
electronic form, and meeting promptly any request for connection. The ministry sets maximum
tariffs for basic services.

ScarceResources

Frequencies are managed by the National Agency for Frequencies that was created by the 2001
Telecommunications Act.

A new telephone numbering system basedon eight digits was introducedinOctober 2001. The
MCTT established the National Numbering Plan after receiving an opinion from the INT, which
is incharge o f its management.


LicensingRegime

According to the 2001Telecommunications Act, the provision o f telecommunications services is
subject to the preliminary authorization o fthe Minister incharge o ftelecommunications (MCTT)
and to the application of terms o f reference approvedby ministerial decree.

The decree No. 97-501 o f 1997 liberalized value added services. The provision ofthese services
is subject to a prior declaration (list defined by ministerial decree).

The government can grant 15-year maximum concessions for the installation and exploitation o f
public telecommunications networks to private or public companies selected by a public or
restrictedcall for tenders.




                                                   19

The decree No. 801-2001 sets all conditions andrequirements for the attribution o f a second
cellular license.

Internet services are subject to a regime ofpreliminary declaration (applied to the value added
services as well).

The GOTgranted Tunisia's first mobile phone license in 1996 to state-owned Tunisie Telecom.
The second GSM license was awarded to the Egyptian operator OrascomTelecom inMarch
2002 for a US454 million fee.

Interconnection

The 2001 Telecom Act (chap. 2, sect. 2, art. 35-38) establishes the obligation o f interconnection
for every public telecommunications network operator. Agreements are concludedby negotiation
between operators. The operator mustpublish a Reference Interconnection Offer after opinion o f
the National Instance o fTelecommunications.

The Decree n. 2001-83 1 o f April 14,2001 provides a general regulatory framework for general
interconnection conditions and for the method to fix rates.

I nformation SocietyIssues

Since the end o f 1997, the GOThas launched several initiatives to develop the use o f information
technologies inthe country. A first part o fthis actionplan i s a decrease inInternet
communication rates, financial support to the development o f web sites, and the installation o f
Internetpublic access points ('publinets').

The second part o fthe action plan addresses electronic commerce andthe development o f
networks to promote the use o f Internet inthe social field:

    e   A legal framework for electronic commercehas beenadopted though the Law n. 83-2000
        for the use o f the electronic commerce as well as electronic signatures.
        A programwas implementedfor the development o fIntemet-use inthe education system.
        Itincludes aninvestmentplanto increase the number o fPCs inschools andthe
        installation o f two networks, a university network connecting 87 universities and the
        Edunet network connecting 100percent of colleges and more than 50 percent o f the
        secondary schools. It will be extended to the primary schools. A similar plan was also
        implementedinthe healthcare sector: a national healthcare network connects 84
        hospitals. The network aims to develop telemedicine practices and to improve health
        services quality inrural zones through better communication.


Sector Performance

Compared with regional benchmarks, Tunisia's fixed line penetrationis above average, and the
basic network is well balanced between main city and other parts o fthe territory. However, the
Internet infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, the mobile infrastructure are not yet well developed


                                                   20

compared to regional and global benchmarks. At end o f 2003, Tunisia mobile penetration
(number o f mobile subscribers per 100 inhabitants), is less than 20 percent, while it is over 24
percent inMorocco, 65 percent inEstonia, and 95 percent inIsrael. Similarly, Tunisia has 0.27
Internet Hosts per 10,000 inhabitants, while Egypthas 0.49, Lebanonhas over 21, and Israel and
Estoniahave 643 and499 respectively. International bandwidth capacity is also lower than
regional benchmarks. For example, the highest link-to-link international connection i s Tunis-
Palermo with 40 Mbps, while (to quote some regional competitors), the Rabat-Palermo capacity
i s 68 Mbps, Rabat-Paris is 76 Mbps and Tel Aviv-New York i s 472 Mbps.'

Concerning PCpenetration, the Government has undertaken initiatives to expand access, such as
subsidizing 6000 Publinets and 10,000 personal computers under the PCFamilial program, as
well as introducing computing insecondary schools. This particular development o fthe
information infrastructurehas the advantage that the domestic network allows the promotion of
ICT-enabled services, Le., call centers, outside the main cities, enhancing widespread job
creation. However, bottlenecks inthe Internet and data infrastructure are a constraint to the
development oftechnology-intensive export services, which is a competitive disadvantage with
respect to other developing countries that can rely on a low cost-high quality data and Internet
infrastructure.

The procurement expert will be hired for a period o f at least 12 months. He/she will be French-
speaking and will work bothwithinthe P M U and indirect contact with participating agencies
and ministries, as needed. It i s anticipated that the ICT andproject management experts
(appointed for the entire length o f the project) canbe made available from Tunisian entities. In
this perspective, the total cost allocated for these recruitments is US$250,000. If,duringproject
implementation, additional efforts appear necessary to strengthen the PMU's capacity, loan
funds couldbe usedfor suchpurpose.

For this project, the PMUwill be (a) the main counterpart to the Bank inthe implementation o f
procurement activities and quality assurance o f the documentation subject to the Bank's review
and no objection, and, as such, it will assume full responsibility for procurement inthis project;
and (b) responsible for the overall financial management o fthe project, including disbursements.

Other institutional strategic elements

The project implementation calendar i s exceptionally ambitious, and includes tasks that, though
well-defined and determined, are relatively new and complex for the Borrower. A detailed
Project Implementation Plan (Plan d'Exe`cutiondu Projet) will define the diverse roles,
responsibilities, and individual work programs o f each participating agency or entity, and will
also include the timetable that shall be respectedto ensure the success o f the project. Technical
implementation o f project activities shall be delegated to the participating agencies and
ministries.

A steering committee (Comite`de Coordination)will be incharge o fensuringthe consistency
and smooth execution o fthe project. Itwill meet at least twice a year. Placedunder the MCTT
(or his representative), it will be composed o frepresentatives o f the Ministry o fDevelopment
and InternationalCooperation and the Ministry o fFinance, and o f the participating agencies and
ministries, as well as the Project Coordinator.

Given the importance o f "e-government" activities inthis project, special attentionwill be paid
to the coordination and strategic consistency o f e-justice, e-culture, and e-disabled activities, for
which the State Secretariat for Administrative Reform (Secre`tariatd'Etat ti la Re`forme
Administrative - SERA3)will help the Government informulating andrefining a national e-
government strategy, andwill assist the relevant agencies intheir efforts to translate this strategy
into their own activities.




  SERA provides secretariat functions to two E-government Commissions (Ministerial andTechnical), which gives
  it a strategic position inthis respect.

OverallFinancialManagementRiskAssessment

The Project ManagementUnit (PMU) that will be responsible for the overall project financial
management reports to the Ministry o f Communication Technologies and Transport (MCTT). It
is partially inplace and currently manages PhaseIand I1o f the Transport Sector Project (1998-
2006). An assessment o f its financial management capacity has been conducted inthe context o f
the appraisal mission o fthe project. It focused on the accounting system, the internal control
mechanisms, the audit arrangements, the existing information system, the monitoring and
financial management software applications, andthe financial management reporting capacity
allocated to the project implementation. The PMUhas acquired substantial accounting and
financial monitoring experience with World Bank-financed projects. As a result, its management
capacity i s inaccordance with the Bank's financial management requirements. Moreover, an
adequate accounting and internal control system i s inplace, and satisfactory arrangements have
been made for independent external audits. Hence, the overall financial management risk inthis
project i s low.

The PMUacquired in2002 a project monitoring and financial management software. This
application is reliable and offers sufficient computer security; however, some reports do not
match the Bank's new guidelines, namely for the Financial MonitoringReports (FMRs), which
replacedthe earlier Project Management Reports (PMRs). Inorder to conform to this new
requirement, the reports need to be updated to match the FMRtemplates that were presented to
and discussed with the PMU.

The technical implementation o fthe project components will be delegated to various
participating entities, comprised o f six state-owned enterprises and three ministries (see also
Annex 6). The MCTT, which will also be a technical implementing agency, will be solely
responsible with regard to loan commitments and relatedpayments.

The various participating agencies are state-owned enterprises. As such, they already have
accounting, financial management, and internal control systems that comply with Bank's
requirements. Their financial statements are preparedinaccordance with International
Accounting Standards (IAS) and certifiedby independent auditors, all members o fthe Tunisian
board o f certified accountants (Ordre des Experts Comptables de Tunisie). The ministries
(Justice and HumanRights, Social Affairs, Culture) acting inthe context o f this project are
subject to public accounting rules andto a double oversight performed by the ContrBle GCnCral
des Finances (CGF), under the Ministry o fFinances, andby the Cour des Comptes, under the
Office o fthe Prime Minister.




  SERA provides secretariat hnctions to two E-government Commissions (Ministerial andTechnical), which gives

These components are explained indetail inSection B4 o fthe main PADtext.

RiskAnalysis

Overall financial management for this project i s low (see also first section o fthis annex above).
BothPhaseIandI1o fthe Transport Sector Project are implementedinaccordance with Bank's
procedures andagreedobjectives. Yearly audit reports are certifiedby independent auditor
members o fthe Tunisian boardo f certifiedaccountants (Ordre des Experts Comptables de
Tunisie). Theses reports are systematically sent to the Bank. They do not report significant issues.

FinancialManagementSystem

General context. The financial management system inplace at MCTT i s based on the principles
and procedures o f the legal framework of the public sector, and more precisely, o fthe
governmental institutions. The main characteristics o fthis system are as follows:

Accounting system. An accounting system based on payments and their analysis inaccordance
with anofficial budgetarynomenclatureis inplace. The public accounting system is
computerized. The software called ADEB (Aid to Budgetary Decision) shows the initialbudget
allocation by the Ministryo f Finances. Eachministry inputs its own commitments and
disbursements at the time o f implementationprogress withinthe budget cycle. State-owned firms
enjoy legal and financial autonomy; expenses paidon their funds are not recordedinthe ADEB
system, but are recordedintheir accounting books and subject to their own internal control
procedures. For public sector projects with external financing, recording o f financial data is done
bymeans o ftwo computerizedpublic expenses accountingsystems. The ADEB system records
the expenses o f the Tunisian State budget, andthe SIADE system (Computer-aided external debt
management system) covers the expenses incurrencies financed by external sources. These data
are also recorded by the MCTT. The SIADE i s used for keeping separate accounts inview o f
external debt management and preparation o freports requiredby donors.

Paymentprocedures. For IBRD-financed project expenses, accounting data are recorded into the
SIADE system by the PMU, which keeps original documents and issues payments. Payments are
preparedinthis unit, based on the documents received from various implementing agencies and
M C T T technical departments. The PMUverifies the accounting documents receivedand submits
them for approval to the Director General for Planningand Studies o f MCTT. The documents are
then sent to the Central Bank o f Tunisia (CBT) that administers the special account from which
payments are made. The CBT verifies supporting documents and expense eligibility according to
internal procedures and the official agreement, and thenprocesses the payments. Payments made




                                                  42

for counterpart funds follow internal control procedures o f each o f the related entities; these
procedures are deemed reliable.

Budget system. Basedon programs and actions to be undertaken duringthe coming fiscal year,
availability o f external financing finds, andneeds still financed on the State budget, MCTT
prepares an annual budget for commitments. Interms o f fund sources, the general budget
includes Government contributions as well as funds made available to MCTT by different
national and international donors for specific projects. The budget is submitted for approval to
the Ministry o f Finances, which is incharge o f a rigorous control through its specialized
services. The budget i s accepted each year before December 31. Expenses o fthe current year
cannot be committed andpaid unless they have been included inthe accepted budget. A
budgetary control is inplace through a public sector budget management system (ADEB).

Proiect-specific arrangements. Two types ofentities will be involvedinthe project implementation.
The first one includes state-owned enterprises andministries andthe secondincludes the Directorate
General for Planningand Studies(DGPS) o fMCTT, which is incharge o fmonitoring, controlling,
andmanagingthe overallimplementationofthe project, as well as ofimplementingsome
components. These tasks willbe entrustedto the PMU, which will be hostedwithinthe DGPS.

Project Management Unit. The PMUwill be incharge o f financial management and project
accounting, according to public accounting principles. On a regular basis, the PMUwill prepare
reports on the status of project implementation, on disbursements (by component andby
category) and loan-related commitments, on the budget, and on the respective funds ofthe
various participating agencies and ministries involved inthe carrying out o fthe project. The
PMUwill consolidate data relatedto transactions made byparticipating agencies andministries
and will periodically prepare consolidated financial statements and semiannual FMRs that will
be sent to the Bank within 45 days following the endof the period coveredby the reports.
Overall, this unit is responsible for sustaining a financial management system acceptable by
Bank standards, and for ensuringproper application of the Bank's procurement, disbursement,
and financial reporting procedures.

Organization of PMU: The PMUis composed of a Project Coordinator, who is responsible for
the overall project management system and for the timely preparation o f financial statements and
FMRs. He i s assistedby two experienced financial management specialists, who worked on the
financial management of Phases Iand I1o fthe Transport Sector Project.

Organization of theparticipating agencies and ministries. Eachparticipating agency and
ministrywill designate a personincharge of project and financial monitoring. He or shewill be
the PMU's only counterpart and will ensure timely submission o f all documents relating to the
project and to progress reports, based on templates to be provided by the PMU, and according to
clear information transmission procedures. Eachparticipating agency and ministry will be
responsible for technical execution o fthe relevant project component. Moreover, and inorder to
optimize the PMU's financial management capacity, the following actions need to be done:

    a) Prepare the I C T Project Implementation Plan including financial management aspects to
        be finalized before project launch;
    b) Plantraining sessions for PMUandthe staff o fparticipating agencies and ministries on
        procurement and on preparing financial monitoring reports (FMRs) according to Bank
        guidelines to be delivered before project launch.


                                                  43

Project accounting system.The project accounting will be done usingthe financial management
application inplace for the Transport Sector Project and developed in2002 by a consulting firm.
This application is reliable andoffers sufficient computer security. The general principlesfor
project accounting are as follows:

        Project accounting will include all the sources anduses o fproject funds, including
        payments and expenses incurred. All transactions relatedto the project (whether cash
        expenditure or not) will be taken into account inthe accounting andreporting system.
        Disbursements made directly by the Bank andthose made through the special account
        opened with CBT will also be recordedinto the project accounting system. Counterpart
        funds will be recorded separately.

        Transactions and activities linked to the project will be differentiated from other activities
        performed by the participating agencies and ministries and MCTT. Financial statements
        summarizing project-related commitments, income, and expenses will be prepared
        semiannually by the participating agencies and ministries according to the relevant forms,
        and transmitted to the P M Utogether with the related supporting documents. The PMU
        will be incharge o fconsolidating these data into the financial monitoring system.

        The general ledger for the project will be prepared inline with classification o fthe
        expenses and sources o f funds defined inthe project documents (Project Implementation
        Plan, Project Appraisal Document, COSTAB) and o fthe budget details. The general
         ledger should allow the recording o f data ina way to facilitate the preparation o f financial
        reports for the project expenses by component and subcomponent, by expense allocation
         andby disbursement category.

Financial MonitoringReports. The financial monitoring reports (FMRs) o fthe project will be
generated by the Transport Sector Project's financial management application. They must
include information on the financial situation and on the progress o fproject implementationand
procurement activities. The FMRmust also include: (a) a report showing use and sources o f
funds for the periodunder consideration using cumulatedvalue as well as project account
balances; (b) a report showing use o f funds by component andby category o f expense; (c) a
report on the procurement activities not submitted for preliminary examination by the Bank; (d) a
report on implementationprogress o fthe project activities; and (e) a reconciliation o fthe special
account. The FMR i s prepared semiannually by the PMUbased on consolidated data provided by
the participating agencies and ministries and submitted to the Bank within 45 days after the end
o f the period covered inthe report.

Flow o f hnds. Disbursements of the loan funds will be made according to the traditional system:
reimbursements against supporting documents or statements of expenses and direct payment.
Withdrawal applications and replenishment o f Special Account would be prepared by the PMU
and sent to the Bank under authorized signature. The counterpart funds are covered by the State
budget, or by the budgets o f participating agencies and ministries. Payments within the budget
will be made through Treasury under the responsibility o f the participating agencies and
ministries and usingthe current bank accounts for state-owned enterprises.




                                                  44

Internal control. The intemal control system in place within the PMU is deemed satisfactory,
both by the project's external auditor (for the Transport Sector Project) and by the Bank. The
same assessment holds true for the various participating agencies and ministries.

Audit Arrangements

All accounts (including SA) will be verified by an auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the audit
reports will be validated by the participating agencies and ministries under the coordination o f
the PMU, and will be sent to the World Bank no later than six months after the end of the fiscal
year. The auditors will have the responsibility to exercise their function in conformity with the
generally accepted audit principles and inrespect o f specific terms o f reference acceptable to the
Bank. In addition, according to the new Bank audit procedures, the financial conditions o f the
project should indicate at a minimum a statement o f resources and expenses, the accounting
principles adopted, supplementary notes, and an attestation produced by every participating
agency and ministry indicating that the Bank funds have been used to the anticipated ends. This
will be inaccordance with the applicable provisions contained inthe Bank LoanAgreement.

All participatingagencies andministrieswill provide the auditor with access to project
documents and files as well as to information required by the auditor to perform the verification
o f accounts. Inaddition to the auditor, the project is subject to controls conductedby the
General Control o f Finances (GAFF), under the Ministryo f Finances, andby the Cour des
Comptes, under the Prime Ministry, which i s incharge o f supervising public finances andgiving
discharge on the management and on accounts relatedto public funds accounts. The Bank
considers the audit conducted by the GAFF as satisfactory.

Furthermore, the various agencies are state-owned enterprises, whose financial statements are
audited inaccordance with intemational accounting standards by independent auditors. Their
reports could be sent as needed to the Bank within six months after closing date o f the financial
year.

DisbursementArrangements

The proceeds o f the loan would be disbursed in accordance with the traditional disbursement
procedures o f the Bank and will be used to finance project activities through the disbursement
procedures currently in use, Le. withdrawal applications for direct payment, for special
commitments and/or reimbursement accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation or
using Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs) in accordance with the procedures described in the
Disbursement Letter and the Bank's "Disbursement Manual." The PMU will be responsible for
submitting the appropriate supporting documentation for services rendered or activities
implemented to the Central Bank o f Tunisia (CBT) so that payments can be made from the
special account opened for that purpose, or to submit applications for direct payment to the
Bank. In case payments are to be made from the special account (SA), the PMU is required to
send to CBT payment orders for services rendered or activities implemented with supporting
documentation. The CBT reviews the documentation received to ensure their compliance with
the terms o f the loan agreement and relevant project documentation as well as the eligibility o f
the expenditures being incurred, then proceeds with the payment if these expenditures are
deemed eligible. The CBT monitors the level o f the special account, and prepares and submits
withdrawal applications to the Bank for replenishment of the SA. Under existing disbursement


                                                 45

procedures, the PMUwill be also permittedto submit withdrawal applications for direct payment
accompanied by the necessary supporting documentation. As projected by Bank's standard
disbursement profiles, disbursements would be completed four months after project closure.
Retroactive financing o f an amount o f Euro 500,000 i s considered for this project.

Special Account (SA): To facilitate disbursement o feligible expenditures, the Government will
open and establish at the Central Bank o f Tunisia (borrower's Central Bank) a special account in
Euros to cover the loan's share o f eligible project expenditures. The special account will be
managed by CBT. The authorized allocation o fthe special account would be the equivalent o f
Euro 1.5 million, covering an estimated o f4 months' o f eligible expenditures financedby the
loan. Initially the authorized allocation will be limitedto Euro 1.O millionuntilcumulative
disbursements under the loanreach a level equivalent to Euro 3 million. CBT will responsible for
submitting monthly replenishment applications with appropriate supporting documentation for
expenditures incurred andwill retain and make the documents available for review by Bank
supervision missions andproject auditors. The replenishment applications will be prepared on
the basis o f information providedby the PMU. To the extent possible, all o fthe loan's share o f
expenditures should be paid through the special account. The supporting documentationwill
include reconciled bank statements and other documents as may be required.

Use of Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs): All applications to withdraw proceeds from the loan
will be fully documented, except for: (a) expenditures o fcontracts with an estimated value
equivalent to US$350,000 or less for goods; (b) US$ 100,000 equivalent or less for consulting
firms; (c) US$ 50,000 or less for individual consultants, and (d) training, workshops and
seminars, which may be claimed on the basis of certified Statements o fExpenditures (SOEs).
Documentation supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retainedby the CBT and
will be available for review when requested byBank supervision missions andproject auditors.
All disbursements will be subject to the conditions o fthe LoanAgreement andthe procedures
defined inthe Disbursement Letter.

Freauencv o fthe FMsupervision: The proposedfrequendy o f supervisionmissions is every six
months.

model contracts for goodskonsultant services procured, technical specifications and terms of
references will be presented inthe Tunisia I C Project ImplementationPlan (PIP).

8.3     Prior Review Thresholds

The proposed thresholds for prior review are based on the procurement capacity assessment o f
the PMU and the Ministryo f Transport and Communication Technologies, Secretariat d`Etat        la
RCforme Administrative (SERA), ATI, CNI, ANSI, ISET'COM, SUP'COM, Ministry o f
Culture, Youth, and Leisure, Ministry o f Justice and Human Rights, Ministry o f Social Affairs
and Solidarity are summarized inTable B.

8.4     Assessment oftheAgency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement

The Project Management Unit (PMU), incharge o fthe overall project management o fthe
Tunisia Information and Communication (IC) project, reports to the Ministry o f Communication
Technologies and Transport (MCTT). Procurement activities will be coordinatedby the PMU,
which will also assume responsibility for compliance with the Bank procurement Guidelines and
procedures o f all participating agencies and entities. The PMUis partially inplace and currently
manages PhaseIand I1o fthe Transport Sector Project (1998-2006). As such, the PMUhas
acquired some procurement experience with World Bank-financedprojects.

An assessmentofthe capacity o fthe Implementing Agency to implement procurementactions
for the project has been carried out by a Bank Procurement Specialist from April 26-30,2004.
The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the
interaction betweenthe project's staff responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant
central unit for administration and finance.

The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation ofthe project have been
identified and include (a) limitedknowledge and experience related to World Bank procurement
guidelines andprocedures; (b) highvolume o fprocurement to be executed inthe first year o f the
project intechnical complex sectors; and (c) tight timing ofproject deliverables.

The corrective measures which have been agreed upon are to establish the PMUwith adequate
staffing on the basis o f experience and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank, which should
include (a) recruitment by no later than September 30,2004 of an internationalprocurement
expert (to be hiredby MCTT out o f loan funds and incompliance with Para. 1.8 o fthe
Guidelines for Consultants), to provide technical assistance to the PMUto handle the initial


                                                 48

procurement activities, while buildingup the capacity o f the PMU.This expert will work with
the PMUfor a periodo f at least 12months; (b) as an effectiveness condition, strengthening the
PMUby staffing itwith specialists inprocurement, ICT, andproject management with
knowledge o f ICT. These specialists are expected to be recruited from within the Government
and could be appointed for the duration o f the project. If,duringproject implementation,
additional efforts appear necessary to strengthen the PMU's capacity, loan funds could be used
for suchpurpose; (c) providing representatives o fall participating agencies and ministries a short
training inTunisia no later than the time of project launch; and (d) an indepthtraining o f at least
one member o f the PMUinthe Procurement Course organizedby the World Bank inDakar
(November 2004).

The overall project risk for procurement is high.


8.4.1 ImplementingEntityDmplementationArrangements

The implementation arrangement for the project is provided inAnnex 6. The PMUo f MCTT
will be incharge o fthe overall projectmanagement o fthe Tunisia Information and
Communication (IC) project. The PMUi s under the responsibility o fthe Director General o f
Planning andStudies o fthe MCTT, andis composed o f a Project Coordinator andtwo staff. The
project would be implemented by MCTT's PMUincoordination with the Project Manager o f
each participating agency. The PMUwill also provide control and quality assurance for
procurement activities, which are delegated to the various agencies and ministries involved inthe
project. Inaddition to the current staff, the unit will include a full time international Procurement
Specialist, an I C T Specialist, and a Project Management Specialist knowledgeable inICT. For
the purposes o f the project, the fiduciary aspects o f the project will be managed by the PMU. The
roles and responsibilities o fthe various participating agencies and ministries, including the role
o fthe PMUvis-a-vis those agencies andministries, will be provided inthe Project
Implementation Plan.

8.5. ProcurementPlan

Duringthe mission, some elements o ftheprocurementplanwere discussedwiththe Borrower.
The procurement planwas then refined, and an agreement on the principles was reached. The
Borrower, at negotiationpresented a procurement plan for project implementation, which
provides the basis for the aggregate amounts for the procurement methods (per Table A). This
planwas agreed upon by the Borrower andthe Project Team at negotiation andwill be available
at the World Bank HQ.It will also be available inthe project's database and inthe Bank's
external website after BoardApproval. The ProcurementPlan will be updatedinagreement with
the Project Team annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project implementationneeds and
improvements ininstitutional capacity. At the beginning o f each calendar year or whenever
requiredunder Appendix 1to the Bank's Guidelines, the Borrower will update the Procurement
Planwith a detailedprocurement schedule for the coming eighteen months. Prior to the issuance
o f any invitations to bidfor contracts, the procurement plan for the Project shall be furnished to
the Bank for its review and approval, inaccordance with the provisions o f paragraph 1o f
Appendix 1to the Guidelines. Procurement o f all goods and consultancy services shall be
undertakeninaccordance with the approvedprocurement plan.

The terms ofreference to hire an internationalprocurementexpert, along with the invitationfor
application for the procurement expert were discussed at negotiations. The draft bidding
documents and RFPs for the priority procurementpackageswill bepreparedbyproject launch.

8.6. Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

Inadditionto the prior review supervisionto becarried out, the capacity assessment ofthe
ImplementingAgency has recommendedquarterly supervisionmissionfor the first year and
every 6 months afterwards. A procurement audit should be carried out every year.

                            Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
    Tunisia Information and Communication Technologies Sector Development Project

The economicjustification o fthis project stems from its support of, and consistency with, the
objectives andpriorities set forth inthe Bank's CAS o fJune 3,2004 and the I C T strategy
developedjointly by the Bank andthe GOTin2002. Technical assistance included inthe project,
together with the arrangements agreed to procure all goods and services, are likely to result in
cost-effective solutions beinggenerally adopted.

The project i s expected to result inconsiderable economic benefits. The project, however, cannot
be meaningfully disaggregated from the overall ICT strategy o fwhich it is an integralpart. The
benefits from the overall ICT strategy are likelyto materialize mainly along the following
directions:

    0   Increased ICT expenditures. Inthe short run, the impact o fICT development is being
        driven primarily by growth intelecommunications services. The advent o f mobile
        telephone competition in2002 has already increasedICT expenditure from about 3.5
        percent o f GDP in2001 to about 6 percent in2003, as boththe new entrant andthe
        incumbent operator (Tunisie Telecom) expanded rapidly to meet pent-up demand, offer a
        range o f new commercialpackages and service modalities, and lower prices. Inthe
        longer run, investmentby the ICT sector to expand productioncapacity will also increase
        demand for the outputs o f other sectors.

        Decliningproduction costs. As effective competition develops inall telecommunications
        market segments, the cost o f communication to business users (averaging about 1.2
        percent o f total output) can drop by as much as 50 percent. The services sector will
        benefit most, with total costs o fretail and wholesale trade reduced by as much as 2
        percent. Finance, insurance, transport, and other service sectors will also benefit from
        above-average cost reductions. Inthe longer run, ICT will also spur productivity gains to
        Tunisian enterprises and the economy at large through technology-related enhancements.

        Lower transaction costs. Improvedavailability o f(and less costly access to) the Internet,
        andrelated development o f applications, including e-commerce, will help businesses
        improve supply chain and inventory management, upgrade quality control, and adopt
        more efficient marketing techniques. The e-government program will facilitate access to
        Government information by businesses andthe population at large and, together with the
        simplification of administrative procedures, will reduce transaction costs inthe economy.
        The e-security component will reduce the risk o f systemic failure o f critical Government
        systems incase o f major disaster.

        Employment creation. Aggregate employment intelecommunications is expected to
        grow as new work opportunities generated by new entrants, contractors, suppliers,
        retailers, and others more than offset labor productivity gains from competition. Faster
        GDPgrowth stemming from economy-wide spillovers o fICT development would fbrther
        accelerate the pace o f employment creation. As much as one out o f every six newjobs
        created by 2006 could stem from ICT-driven growth.
