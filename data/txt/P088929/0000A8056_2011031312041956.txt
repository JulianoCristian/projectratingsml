                         project implementation has allowed to complete the last 4 activities under implementation (only one of them unfinished). The contribution of the ICT sector to the GDP (PDO) has
                         doubled during project life, and telecom penetration is reaching 107% (from 36% in 2004).
                         The preparation of this last ISR, as well as the ICR, is taking place as Tunisia is going through an unprecedented social and political revolution.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Technologies and Communication (in the previous Cabinet that has now been changed) had clearly expressed its intention to prepare a follow-up investment

                         operation in the area of ICT. In this context, the Ministry had (i) put in place a working group that collected the needs of the agencies active in the sector and presented a first scope
                         of work to the World Bank, and (ii) organized a discussion with the Ministry of International Cooperation to insure that a formal request for a new project be sent to the World Bank
                         shortly. In the newly appointed Cabinet, the new Minister in charge of ICT is coming from the private sector, and there is good reasons to believe that the Government will soon
                         endorse the earlier policy orientation towards further private sector participation in the ICT sector, and larger investments in broadband.
                         With a view to bridge the closed operation with a new one, the Team (i) has funded, through a Korean Trust Fund, a Workshop on mobile applications that has helped identified the
                         gaps in the enabling environment (legal, regulatory, technologically, human resources) and needs that may be addressed in the next operation, (ii) has put a request to the Korean
                         Trust Fund for Fy11 support focusing in the area of broadband and mobile application, and (iii) is preparing to launch the ICR activity with a view to take stock of lessons learned and
                         ways to improve project implementation in the next operation. This approach is subject to the re-engagement of our dialog with the Government.
