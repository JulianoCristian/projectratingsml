The\n            four project components will: 1) assist in the development\n            of an information and communications strategy, policy, and\n            regulation. In particular, the component will elaborate a\n            strategic long-term plan for developing the ICT sector,\n            including a strategy for the promotion of universal access,\n            and assist in the award of additional licenses, including\n            assistance to the telecommunications regulatory authority;\n            2) formulate an e-government benchmarking, and strategy,\n            being coordinated by the State Secretariat for\n            Administrative Reform (Secretariat d'Etat a la Rbforme\n            Administrative - SERA), and, develop e-government\n            applications and online services in the Government's\n            ministries and agencies, i.e., the Ministry of Justice and\n            Human Rights (portal and on-line services), the Ministry of\n            Culture, Youth, and Leisure (portal and on-line promotion),\n            and the Ministry o f Communication Technologies and\n            Transport (virtual ICT library). The component will also\n            provide solutions to equip selected schools, and social\n            service centers with specialized information technology (IT)\n            solutions for the disabled, and, assist in the development\n            of an Arabic Domain Name System (DNS) registry. ICT training\n            shall increase capacities by providing a distance-learning\n            platform; 3) develop and implement a computer\n            risk-prevention strategy, based on the Computer Emergency\n            Response Team (CERT) model, and, strengthen e-security\n            research and training capacity. A data backup center will be\n            established to ensure the continuity of the\n            government's critical computer applications; and, 4)\n            provide technical assistance (TA) for the implementation of\n            a fast-paced project, with emphasis on results by the 2005\n            World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).
