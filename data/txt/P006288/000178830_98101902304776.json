providing\n            agricultural extension services, in support of the Brazilian\n            Government's on-going programs to increase agricultural\n            production, significantly speed development of the less\n            developed areas of the country, and improve the productivity\n            of farmers, particularly small farmers. Although the project\n            is national in scope, special emphasis will be given to the\n            three priority regions of the North, Northeast and\n            Center-West. About two-thirds of total investments under the\n            project, and about two-thirds of such programs as farming\n            production systems and demonstration field trials included\n            in the project, will be designed to assist smaller farmers\n            whose average annual per capita income is estimated to be\n            below the relative poverty level in Brazil of US$380\n            equivalent. The proposed project complements the on-going\n            agricultural research project, concentrated in the same\n            three priority regions, and is intended to ensure that the\n            new agricultural technologies developed under the project\n            actually reach the greatest possible number of farmers."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
