Philippines: Meeting Social Needs in Poor and Conflict-Afflicted Areas                                 July 1, 2002
Expanding access to basic social services is the overarching thrust of the Special Zone for Peace and Development
(SZOPAD) Social Fund, a World Bank-assisted project designed to alleviate poverty in poor and conflict-affected areas,
particularly in Southern Philippines and Palawan. To date, the project has made a strong impact in sectors where its support
matters most, at the local level. More children will be able to attend schools as 334 new classrooms were constructed and 56
more were renovated. Education accounts for the biggest chunk at 37 percent of all completed subprojects, reflecting
SZOPAD’s and the Bank’s priority concern to give children wider opportunity to shape a better and safer future for
themselves.

Water supply and sanitation projects make up 24 percent of completed subprojects while health projects have a share of 10
percent. Pre- and post-harvest facilities, composed mostly of warehouses, account for 22 percent. Rural roads and community
development projects round out the sectors assisted by the Fund.

These infrastructure were completed through close to 450 subprojects, with more than 400 community groups or peoples'
groups, local government units, and non-government organizations, participating in such projects.
