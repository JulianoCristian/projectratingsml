"The project would support the\n            Government's objective of rationalizing and developing\n            the mining industry by providing consultancy services for\n            the following project components:  (a) Phosphate - The\n            efficiency and profitability of CPG's existing\n            operations would be improved, and feasibility studies on\n            four open pit deposits prepared; (b) Potash - This component\n            would lay the ground for the establishment of a potentially\n            important new export industry.  A first phase would develop\n            technical and economic information on three potash deposits\n            in Southern Tunisia to identify the optimal configuration of\n            a potash project.  In a second phase, the feasibility of the\n            option selected in Phase I would be studied in detail and\n            investment proposals prepared; and (c) Mining policy - This\n            component would analyze and define the role of ONM in\n            mineral exploration and development, and define\n            organizational, staffing and budgetary requirements to help\n            ONM meet its objectives.  The component would enhance the\n            ability of the Government and ONM to plan and implement a\n            rational mining exploration policy."}, "docdt": "1983-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
