MINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2346-TUN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Mining Technical
Assistance  Project  in the Republic  of Tunisia.   Loan 2346-TUN  (US$13.4
million)l/ was approved on September  13,  1983.   The loan was closed on
December 31, 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Division of Country
Department II in the EMENA Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary,
Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of the PCR was started during the Bank's last supervision
minsion of November 1990, and is based on information supplied by the Borrower,
the President's report, legal documents, supervision reports, and corres-
pondence between the Bank and the Borrower.
Original loan amount.  US$5.6 million have been cancelled with effect from
December 15,  1988.   US$0.4 million was cancelled after completion of
disbursements. The final disbursements under the loan are US$7.4 million.

-WIiING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(LOAN 2346-TUN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.      The idea for a technical assistance project in Tunisia's mining sector
emerged during Bank discussions with the Government on its Sixth Development
Plan (1982-86). Subsequently, Bank staff assisted the Government and project
entities in formulating a technical assistance prograwr financed under the
Mining Technical Assistance Project ("The Project").  This project supported
(a) the restoration of viability of the phosphate mining industry; (b) the
diversification into the mining of other fertilizers; and (c) efficiency
improvements in the Government's mineral exploration efforts. At the time of
project preparation, these objectives were the basis of a sector strategy
consistent with macroeconomic policy objectives (paras. 2.2-2.4).
Objectives
2.      The Project was to assist the Government in developing its mining
industry by: (a) improving the efficiency of Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa
(CPG), the largest w-ining company in the country; (b) studying the feasibility
of exploiting new potash deposits; and (c) improving the institutional
framework for the formulation of an eZiLcient exploration policy.   Part I,
para. 4.2 describes the various project components in detail.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.      The Borrower supervised the Project's implementation adequately but
there were important discrepancies between actual and estimated project
execution dates. The actual loan Closing Date of December 31, 1990, was three
years later than the original estimate. The delay resulted from difficulties
in procuring and executing consultant contracts, and to the late addition of
a supplementary contract.   Total actual project costs amounted to US$16
million, about 35% lower than estimated at appraisal (para. 5.4). The lower
costs mainly resulted from the fact that certain activities planned under the
Project did not take place (para. 5.2).  The Project helped the Government
achieve several important objectives, which were the improved management
performance of CPG, a decision to abandon potash mining as a result of Project
findings, the attraction of private foreign investment in non-fertilizer mining
and reorganization of the mining sector (paras. 6.4-6.7).
Project Sustainability
4.      CPG's performance has improved significantly since the inception of the
Project (para. 6.2) and continued progress will require the determination of
its management to keep productivity high and costs low along with the active



- iv -
participation of CPG staff in this process. Future decisions concerning the
viability of underground mining activities will be of particular importance to
the sustainability of CPG's improved performance. CPG will have to close some
uneconomic underground mines if the company is to remain financially and
economically viable (paras. 6.2 and 7.1) and given CPG's successful reduction
of personnel over the last few years, there is a good chance that CPG will be
able to handle the closures without major disturbances, provided CPG, the
Government and labor representatives continue to work systematically towards
that goal.
Lessons Learned
5.      The principal lesson to learn from the Project is the importance, in
the design phase, of being realistic about the absorptive capaciiy of the
implementing agency and the project timetable. Major delays often result from
a tendency of the Borrower and the Bank to overestimate the absorptive capacity
of the implementing agency and in such a case even good project organization
and supervision may not be able to compensate for project design flaws. To
reduce the risk of delays in executing similar projects, it is advisable to
involve line managers in detailed project design at the earliest possible stage
in the project cycle. In addition, the number of consultant contracts should
be kept low and a project manager should handle most of the procurement matters
instead of delegating them to committees.   Finally, before finalizing the
design of study components, it is important to take the time to evaluate
relevant data thoroughly since an initial review may result in significant cost
and time savings (para. 13.1).

2. Background
2.1     The concept of a technical assistance project in Tunisia's mining
sector emerged during Bank discussions with the Government on its Sixth
Development Plan (1982-86). Subsequently, Bank staff assisted the Government
and project entities in formulating a technical assistance program, financed
under the Mining Technical Assistance Project ("The Project"), which supported
the following development objectives for the mining sector: (a) restoration of
viability of the dominating phosphate mining industry; (b) diversification into
mining of other fertilizers; and (c) improvement of efficiency of the
Government's mineral exploration efforts. At the time of project preparation,
these objectives were the basis of a sound sector strategy consistent with
macro policy objectives. The following paragraphs outline essential background
information on the various sectors which the Project covered.
2.2     Phosphates. Phosphate mining, which dates back more than 100 years, is
important to Tunisia's economy because it accounts for about 10% of the
country's exports, ranking second after oil. The Compagnie des Phosphates de
Gafsa (CPG) mines all phosphates and its operations currently produce about 9
million tons per year of raw phosphate rock from several open-pit and
underground mines in the Gafsa region. After washing of the raw ore, CPG sells
about 6 million tons per year of phosphate rock concentrate, mainly to the
export-oriented domestic fertilizer plants. Phosphate mining and processing
expanded rapidly in 19709. In 1974, the Bank participated in the financing of
the Sehib underground phosphate mine and beneficiation plant with a loan of
US$23.3 million.Y1 This project failed because the new Sehib underground mine
never reached its planned capacity and CPG had to compensate for the missing
mine production through contracted open-pit mining.   In addition,  lower
phosphate prices than anticipated aggravated the company's financial situation.
The design of a technical assistance program in 1982, to facilitate restoration
of CPG's financial viability and help prepare further expansion of production,
!  Loan 1042-TUN for the Gafsa Phosphate Project.  The loan has been fully
repaid.



-2-
coincided with the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the previous project.!'
Lessons learned from the previous project had a major impact on the formulation
of this program. Details of the program and implementation arrangements were
finalized in 1983, after a change of the company's management.!' CPG's
technical assistance program became, at that time, the Project's most important
component.
2.3     Potash.   Given the country's expertise in producing and marketing
phosphate-based fertilizers, the Government wanted to diversify into other
fertilizers. In 1981, Soci6t6 de D6veloppement des Industries du Sud (SDICS)
was created to develop a potash fertilizer industry based on salt lakes in the
country's south. There were contracts for preliminary technical studies in the
same year. In early 1982, SDICS prepared bids for a comprehensive feasibility
study of the Zarzis deposit.  The Tunisian Government showed an interest in
obtaining Bank expertise and facilitating the financing of an eventual
industria-' project.   However,  in agreement with the Bank,  there was  a
modification in the scope of work for the Zarzis study to include pilot plant
testing for the Zarzis deposit and test work on two other deposits for
comparison.  A separate market study added to the project, along with the pilot
testing, was to determine if a full feasibility study was warranted.  Tunisia
obtained financing from the French government for the Zarzis pilot plant, while
the other components received financing under the Project.
2.4     Mining Policy.  Tunisia has few mining activities besides the sector's
dominant phosphate industry, though there is a tradition of lead and zinc
mining in small, difficult underground mines which are of minor importance to
the overall economy. Fluorspar mining on a small- to medium-scale is the only
significant additional mining activity in recent years. To address the issue
of overall mining sector development, the Bank and Government agreed to include
a study on the Government's role in non-fertilizer mining, which was to focus
on mineral exploration.
3. Project Design and Organization
3.1     Based on the implementation experience of the Project, some aspects of
its design and organization could have been more efficient. In the phosphate
sector, for example, despite CPG's considerable efforts in project control,
there was a significant underestimation of the workload for preparing and
administering a relatively large number of consultant contracts. Furthermore,
some line managers were reluctant to male the best use of the technical
assistance provided.
3.2     A smaller number of contracts, together with a stringent control of the
number of persons visiting Tunisia, would have facilitated their administra-
tion. Also, there could have been an increase in efficiency by earlier and
more responsible involvement of CPG's line management in the formulation of the
technical assistance program, closely linked to ongoing operational needs.
2' Report No. 5134, dated June 1, 1984.
" During project preparation, and shortly after personnel changes in the
Government, a new General Manager was appointed, who actively pursued the
formulation of the technical assistance program.



-3-
Concerning the potash component, there were three different entities (SDICS,
CPG and ONM) involved in its implementation, with DMG as the coordinating
agency.  Thiis arrangement, in line with the Loan Agreement, worked well in
terms of evaluating study results and coordinating actions to avoid unnecessary
costs.  A more carefully designed phasing of the work, taking into account
ongoing project results, might have helped to reduce the costs even further.
In retrospect, such an approach probably would have prevented the purchase of
a costly specialized vehicle for sampling brines (paras. 5.2 and 6.6).
3.3     Concerning mining policy, there was a debate UJthin DMG and ONM about
the specific tasks of the consultant and ultimately the study did not take
place (para. 6.7). An earlier discussion of the terms of reference within the
institution and with the Bank probably would have been useful and could have
led to either elimination of this component from the Project's scope, or to a
better focussed definition of objectives and tasks.
4. Project Objecdves and Description
4.1      Consistent with sector development objectives, the Project was to
assist the Government in developing its mining industry by: (i) improving the
efficiency of CPG, the largest mining company in the country; (ii) studying the
feasibility of exploiting new potash deposits; and (iii) improving the
institutional framework for the formulation of an efficient exploration policy.
The Project provided technical assistance$ in the form of consultants' services
and some related equipment, for three components -- phosphate, potash and
mining policy as described in paras. 4.2-4.4 below.
4.2     Phosihate Mining.  This component was to help reestablish CPG as a
financially viable company by improving existing operations and by evaluating
tl.e company's most promisin- investment projects for efficient output expansion
needed for the continued growth of the country's dynamic phosphate processing
industry. In light of the failure of the Sehib mine and the high production
costs of CPG's urierground mines in general, there was greater emphasis on
open-pit mining, mainly with a view to improve equipment maintenance and study
expansion possibilities. The phosphate component consisted of the following
actions and studies, including training of CPG staff:
(a)  Analyzing CPG's financial organization and management system
and establishment of a comprehensive cost control and moni-
toring system;
(b)  Reviewing CPG's underground mines in order to define attainable
capacities and identify inefficiencies;
(c)  Reviewing spare parts management and introduction of computer-
ized inventory management for mining equipment;
(d)  Reviewing personnel administration and implementation of a
computerized payroll system;
(e)  Training workshop personnel  in repair and maintenance  of
specialized mining equipment and of instrumentation personnel
in the maintenance of process control equipment;



(f) Studying the feasibility of rehabilitating the washing plants
at Metlaoui and M'Dilla and improving ore handling facilities
at M'Dilla, and, if warranted, subsequent engineering and
supervision;
(g)  Developing and implementing procedures for maintenance, cost
control and training for the open-pit mine Rof Eschfair, and
studying of the feasibility of its expansion from 2.5 to 3.6
million tons per year production capacity; and
(h) Studying the feasibility of new open-pit mines at Djellabia,
Oum El Khecheb and Sehib South.
4.3      Potash Mining. This component was to help the Government evaluate the
potential of three deposits at Chott El Jerid, Zarzis and El Adiabate, leading
to an investment decision on a possible potash project. Actions consisted ofs
(a) Analyzing existing geological data and conducting puwping tests
to provide reliable estimates of reserves and their quality;
(b) Conducting laboratory and pilot plant tests to identify the
processing method;
(c) Preparing, if warranted, a detailed feasibility study of an
industrial project; and
(d) Investigating the market for potassium chloride and sulphate.
4.4     Mining Policy.  This component was to help the Direction des Mines et
de la Geologie (DMG) to increase the efficiency of government exploration work,
carried out by Office National des Mines (ONM), by defining guidelines for data
collection and evaluation, criteria for exploration policies and investment
priorities, and staffing and training requirements and budgetary implications.
5. Project Implementation
5.1     The Borrower's control of project execution, including procurement
matters, was satisfactory but there were important variances between actual and
estimated project execution dates. Project objectives remained the same but
there were significant adjustments in the Project's scope of work.   These
adjustments had no adverse impact on the Project. Actual project costs were
close to estimates, mainly due to the fact that certain components did not
materialize (para. 5.2).
5.2     Chanses in Project scope.  In agreement with the Bank, there were
several modifications in the scope of the Project during the course of its
implementation. The Borrower initiated the3e changes in the interest of saving
costs. Out of ten different contracts for the phosphate component, only six
proceeded as originally planned.   Despite signing of the four remaining
contracts, only partial fulfillment resulted as follows:
(a) Two contracts, one for a cost control system and another for
personnel administration, were terminated early because the



- 5 -
consultants did not forward, as requested, an acceptable
proposal for computerization of these services. However, as
explained below, CPG later concluded an additional contract for
computerization of these services.
(b)  One contract, for rehabilitation of old washing plants, was
terminated at the moment when it became apparent that an
economic solution to the problem was not possible.
(c)  The contract for the Oum El Khecheb open-pit mine was ter-
minated as it became apparent that there would be technical
uncertainties with the execution of the project, while a
technically proven and more economical alternative mine
development became apparent at Kef Eddour.
In addition to the ten original contracts, CPG added another contract for
custom design and installation of a software system*' to complete the
establishment of a computerized management information system (MIS). For the
Rotash component, CPG purchased only one special vehicle for brine sampling
instead of the two originally estimated. This decision resulted from safety
problems with the operation of the first vehicle and indications that
development of -he deposits would not be economic. The mining policy component
did not materialize in view of the progress made in attracting private sector
investment in the non-fertilizer mining sector and the difficulties encountered
in negotiating a consultant contract (para. 6.7).
5.3     Time Schedule.  The actual loan closing date of December 31, 1990, was
three years later than the original estimate. About one year of delay may be
attributed to the procurement phase, one year to the execution phase, and one
year to the addition of a task for CPG.  Table 4 shows the actual and   timated
timing for the completion of each task.   The procurement of ct.,sultant
contracts, in particular for the phosphate component, took on average about 1.5
years from issuing bidding documents to signing the contracts, despite CPG'8
good organization to deal with all aspects of the procurement proces6. Many
of the delays occurred during the negotiation phase, which required agreement
on the personnel and the details of their stay in Tunisia. CPG had internal
working groups which made decisions on all procurement matters, from prepara-
tion of terms of reference to contract signature and this group decision-making
procedure added considerably to the delays. Furthermore, there was a delay in
loan effectiveness but the longer procurement delays overshadowed the impact
of the effectiveness delay. During execution of the contracts, delays occurred
because CPG could not provide spare parts required for practical training
courses on time or decide quickly enough on alternatives offered by a
consultant, or because consultants could not make available personnel as agreed
or deliver an acceptable product. CPG's decision to include, at a later stage
of the Project, an additional contract for installation of a computerized
information system resulted from insufficient support for this task through
41 Contract of February 1990 with MINCOM, Australia, for supply and installa-
tion of integrated computer software for spare parts management, equipment
maintenance, personnel management, cost control and management information
(contract value US$0.7 million).



- 6 -
previous consultant work and from difficulties in evaluating and coordinating
different views on the subject by the various consultants.
5.4     Proiect Costs.  Total actual project costs amount to US$16 million,
about 35% lower than estimated at appraisal. Actual and estimated costs for
each task are shown in Table 5. Savings resulted mainly in the foreign costs
and mostly for those items financed by the Bank. The savings are mainly due
to non-execution of tasks (para. 5.2), but also to lower than estimated charges
for consultant man-months (para. 11.1). However, if the cost comparison is
restricted only to the tasks actually completed and included in the appraisal
estimate, then the actual costs are not significantly different from the
appraisal estimate.
6. Project Results
6.1     The Project achieved its major objectives, as outlined in para. 4.1.
It helped bring about improvements in CPG's management performance, reach a
decision in the Government to abandon the development of potash mining, and
pave the way for institutional changes in the mining sector and the attraction
of private foreign investment in non-fertilizer mining. The implementation of
some Project tasks could have been more efficient, in particular, through a
more appropriate, focussed project design (Section 4). The following sections
outline the physical results of the Project and their financial and development
impact for each of the three project components.
6.2     Phosphate Mining.  Over the period 1982 to 1989, CPG increased its
output of washed phosphate rock from 4.7 to 6.6 million tons, or by 402, while
during the same period personnel employment dropped from about 14,000 to
10,000, or by 30%.   Some of the remarkable productivity increase can be
attributed to engagement of subcontractors for some open-pit mining and ore
transport, but most of it is due to CPG's own efforts.   After initial
deterioration of CPG's performance, significant improvements started in
1986/87, towards the end of the originally planned project implementation
period and with a change in the company's management. CPG's operations are
clearly better managed now.  The company's personnel in central workshops,
spare parts management and maintenance of instrumentation received training.
There are improved procedures for equipment maintenance and spare parts
management.   The Ref Schfair open-pit mine is now producing at its rated
capacity and production from smaller open-pit mines has become more stable.
Expansion possibilities for open-pit mining have been studied.   While the
prospects of the options studied under the Project were judged negative, a
decision was made on appropriate other new open-pit development and investments
were initiated. CPG also increased the productivity of its underground mines
through personnel reductions and started to phase out production from
uneconomic mines (para. 7.1). In addition, washing plant performance improved
and despite some initial difficulties, the Project either met or exceeded all
technical targets agreed at negotiations (Attachment to Table 6).
6.3     It is likely that the Project has contributed to the significant
improvements in CPG's financial situation. In July of 1989, the Bank made a
Public Enterprise Reform Loan (PERL) amounting to US$130 million to Tunisia,
whi..h included a component for improving CPG's financial performance. This
report noted a tight cash situation, serious difficulties in financing
operating costs and a shortage of spare parts which inhibited mining effici-



- 7 -
ency.  Furthermore, the report pointed out that a 9% increase in phosphate
prices had significantly improved the financial position in 1988 and that
future financial performance would hinge on future phosphate prices in dollar
terms and the implementation of a staff reduction programs. The accumulated
cost savings since 1982, which CPG achieved due to increased output and
reduction of personnel and other costs, amount to about US$150 million. Only
a small fraction of these savings justifies the cost of the phosphate component
(US$9.2 million).51  In 1989, the Company made a profit for the first time
since  1976.    Financial  discipline  improved  and  the  current  ratio  and
debt/equity ratio reached normal levels, consistent with the covenants of the
Project Agreement, though only in 1989 instead of in 1986 and 1987 respectively
as originally stipulated. A full evaluation of CPG's financial and managerial
performance is being undertaken as part of the review of the second tranche
release of the PERL.
6.4     Despite further erosion of phosphate and fertilizer prices in real
terms after 1982, and a reduction of employment in the sector, the Project,
indirectly, made some significant contributions toward improving the economy.
It facilitated the necessary adjustment and improvements in CPG's production
capability, meeting the increased demand from an expanded downstream fertilizer
industry.   In addition,  the Project helped to improve the technical and
managerial competence of Tunisian staff.
6.5     Potash.  The comparison of geological data from the three salt lakes
confirmed that the Chott El Jerid deposit has the lowest grade raw material,
making it at present unsuitable for economic exploitation, and that the
Adiabate deposit, due to its small size, could only be viable if connected with
Zarzis, the most promising of the three deposits.   None of the deposits,
however, would have attractive production costs. Furthermore, the market study
showed only a narrow market with considerable risks. Consequently, DMG decided
correctly to stop the Project and halt all further development work.   The
abandonment of the goal to develop an industrial project has helped to prevent
firther losses6/ and saved scarce resources for other economic activities which
are likely to be more productive.
6.6     Mining Policy.  ONM prepared terms of reference, invited offers and
selected a consultant for this component but contract negotiations did not
arrive at an agreement before the reorganization of DMG and ONMZ' obviated the
need for a study. Although the signing and execution of the contract never
5t If it is assumed that only 6% of the savings can be attributed to the
Project, then the expenses have already been fully recovered by now and they
would yield a rate-of-return of 20% if the present production costs are
maintained for three more years.
6 The capital cost of an industrial project would be in the order of several
hundred million dollars.  For further studies of a hypothetical project,
expenses could easily exceed US$10 million.
t/ In connection with major personnel changes in Government, Direction des
Mines et de la G6ologie was reorganized into Direction G6n6rale des Mines.
Tighter budget restraints were introduced and the ONM study lost its
priority.

occurred, it seems that the preparatory work for the study was helpful in
determining some of the institutional changes needed and attracting foreign
investment in the mining sector.a1
7. Project Sustainability
7.1     CPG's performance has improved significantly since the inception of the
Project and contiiiued progress will require the determination of its management
to keep productivity high and costs low along with the active participation of
CPG staff in this process. Some major indicators of improved performance are
better-trained staff, the greater use of open-pit mining technology, invest-
ments to replace obsolete equipment enhanced by the availability of financing
for new investment,91 and the planned establishment of an improved cost control
and management information system, which should be available by mid-1991.
Future decisions concerning underground mining activities will be of particular
importance to the sustainability of CPG's improved performance.  It appears
unavoidable that CPG will have to close some uneconomic underground mines if
the company is to remain financially and economically viable. CPG has taken
steps to prepare some mines for closure as early as 1992 and is developing no
new panels in other mines which, in effect, would schedule them for closure in
the second half of the 90s. Given CPG's successful reduction of personnel over
the last few years, there is a good chance that CPG will be able to handle the
closures without major disturbances, provided CPG, the Government and labor
representatives continue to work systematically towards that goal.
8. Bank Performance
8.1     During the Project identification and preparation period, the Bank
contributed substantially to the Project's design.  The Bank's involvement
helped to secure co-financing and to establish the appropriate project
implementation arrangements. The Bank showed readiness to adapt, within the
framnework of the legal documents, to modifications of the Project's scope and
workplan. Bank involvement in this Project also facilitated preparation of the
Public Enterprise Reform Loan (PERL).101 However, Bank involvement in super-
vision of the Project was not able to compensate fully for inherent weaknesses
in project design (Section 4) or the considerable delays in project execution.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1     The Borrower and its implementing agencies put considerable effort into
the Project's design and established an efficient organization to implement it.
During project implementation, the executing agencies for the phosphate and
potash components had good control over the activities under their responsi-
/ In 1981/82, Arab Mining Company and IFC invested 50% in the fluorspar
project FLUOBAR. In 1989/90, Metallgesellschaft of Germany and Geomines of
Bulgaria invested 50% in the lead/zinc projects Bougrine and Fej Lahdoum.
gI CPG obtained a loan from African Development Bank for the financing of
urgently needed replacement of mining equipment in the small open-pits and
for the new Ref Eddour project.

bility.   They coordinated the different activities well, exerted a strict
quality and cost control and did not hesitate to redirect or stop work when it
became apparent that further pursuance would yield little results. However,
some of the control procedures contributed to project delays (para. 5.3).
10. Project Relationship
10.1    The cooperation of the Borrower and its agencies with the Bank was
good. Nearly all covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements have been met
without major difficulties, except for CPG's late compliance with two dated
financial ratios (see Table 7, Status of Covenants, sections 4.04 and 4.05).
11. Consulting Services
11.1    The reputation and qua'lifications of the selected consultant firms were
good.   However,  actual performance and results  often lagged behind the
expectations of Tunisian professional staff. Some of the disappointment may
be due to unrealistically high expectations. However, there have been several
cases where a consultant had difficulties in recruiting and maintaining staff
with the required qualifications.  Probably the most successful assignments
were the on-the-job training tasks in mine operations and workshops.   The
average cost of a consultant man-month, including overheads and travel cost,
was about US$10,070, or 35Z lower than originally estimated.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1    The President's Report contained a technical background annex on
Tunisian phosphate mining and the potash project. While this proved useful as
a reference during project execution, the information could have been more
concise and more focussed on the project description and rationale.   The
availability of the appropriate documentation from CPG and DMG facilitated data
collection for the PCR.
13. Lessons Learned
13.1    The main lesson learned from the Project is the importance, in the
design phase, of being realistic about the absorptive capacity of the
implementing agency and the project timetable. Major delays often result from
a tendency of the Borrower and the Bank to overestimate this capacity, and, as
a result, even good project organization and supervision may not be able to
compensate for the related delays that may occur in project execution.
Specific steps which may help to minimize the risk of delays in similar
projects are (a) involving line managers, as early as possible, in the design
of a technical assistance program,  (b) minimizing the number of different
consultant contracts and related personnel on site, allowing consultants to
sub-contract additional services if necessary, and (c) streamlining procurement
procedures for consultant contracts by avoiding a cumbersome approval process
involving several layers of decision-making and enhancing the responsibility
of the contract manager in the process. In terms of identifying and phasing
study components for similar projects, a further lesson learned is the value
of taking the time to evaluate relevant information thoroughly since a rigorous
initial review may not only result in significant cost and time savings but may
even obviate the need for further study altogether.

(English translation)
MINING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(IBRD LOAN 2346 TUN)
POTASH SUBSECTOR
EVALUATION BY THE TEAM (DGM-ONM-CPG)
RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE PROJECT'S
EXECUTION AND PROGRESS
1.    PROJECT EXEUCTIQg
The progress of the Potash Subproject has been slow. The planning
was not followed, and was in fact updated several times, for the following
reasons:
-     Problems %ith procurement of rolling stock suited to the
particular conditions of the sebkhas, and especially of CHOTT JERID (this
operation took two years).
*    Despite all the precautions taken in issuing specifications for
the amphibious equipment, the prospecting operations at CHOTT JERID were very
incomplete, covering less than 301. Because of the impermeability of the
soils and the low potash content at CHOTT's southern end, prospecting
operations could not proceed in the normal manner.
*     Difficulties in drilling and pumping resulting from instability of
the machinery and poor aquifer porosity.
2.    aSUIsP
*     iADHIBAT:  the principal Phase I works were completed (reserves
estimated, hydrogeological and geochemical characteristics determined, draft
solar evaporation flow sheet established, etc.)
Since the ZARZIS project was put on the back burner, Phase II was
not started.
o    CHOTT JERID:  the program was not completed because of the
difficulties mentioned. Investigations were carried out, however, and these
resulted in the identification of accessible areas and areas potentially rich
in potash (in the northern part of CHOTT JERID; the aquifer in the southern
part has a low saline content).

3.   EVLUATION OF CONSULTANTS' WORK
The consultants retained in accordance with the World Bank's
Guidelines gave an overall satisfactory performance in providing estimates and
advice in connection with the works at LADHIBAT and CHOTT JERID.
With respect to the critical analysis of the technical and
economic feasibility study of the Zarzis project, which was carried out by an
American, French and German consortium for SDICS, this was rather
insubstantial and not sufficiently objective.
