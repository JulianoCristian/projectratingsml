LILONGWE LAND D-EVE±OPMENT PROGRAM - PEASE III
SLThlARY AND CONCLUSIOMS
ITn 1968/69 L-alawi ermarked on the first of its intensive rural,
efc.ieerent projects, the Lilongwe Land Development Program  (LLDP) which
ti.- to,- .t he paterr. of the cou try's strategy in assisting the country's
-t      r  for the remainder of the decade and into the 1970's. TMe
'P          i ,n tne central region -arid ncw completing its second phase has
be         v.-'.a.ed Iwfith iDA assistance and has been f'ollowed (19 69/70) by the
cv Deve-.op-aent -Eroject ±n the southern region no.T in its sezond
ck..a, e Xrcnga Development Project (1972/73) in the northern regi4n in
A. .-;t phase  botlb a-so assisted by IDA, and the Salima Lakeshore Develoy:
, ~,, W   9 t  os ssited  y th el e-I Federal Republic of Germany.
All of t'.hese four projects are characterized by the provision of
inVfr's-uctssre., eaztension and farmer services within relatively con'.>&stec
at t<-"cr completion, it ,s' expected that some 1 million peovi.:  ,.
iila-n en!azlefi tted from them. While the intensive Projects have made signif
ca-.it cont- iblt-o10n  bloth to institution-building and improved production and
St 4srd S  livi ng for large numbers of people, nearly three-quarters of
alae.^t populatIon still remain unaffected by these developments.  It is
nereesary,, thereiore, to adopt a strategy which will promote more broad-based
de-velor,menc irn an expeditious manner.  With the objective of providing improved
t,r)dctIen opportunities to the rest of Malaw7i's farm population over a 20-year
period, a Bank agriculture sector mission identified in 1973 the possibilities
0v, .-Nmore extenmsive type of development which has become knowrm as the Nationa-1
?:&;-c.D. Derclopmrent Project (NPDP). This is now under active discussion with
o7erme.netx and is likely to form an important part of the Bank's future
c.sr5bution. to this sector.
The proposed Project would constitute the third and final phase of
started in 1'368j69 with the aim of increasing crop production and farm
xnecŽncs oiler the program area. With the completion of Phase II in 1974/75y
i  _  eex-pected that of the gross program area of 1.2 million acres (874,000
ac^es Oc''4 e6d by rmallholders) infrastructure and extension services would
;,>, .>en .rovvded to serve 664,000 acres through 25 unit centers and that
a L) 3J.  tfarmn(rers o£ the area's 109,000 total would have been reached wTith
c:,Z   u*ptlts.The Project over a three year period would thus prov-7de
0r 05 tinit centers, roads, conservation works, boreholes and
--st., tihe last to be establisthed by the Agricultural Development and
Marketing Corporation (ADMARC)) ancl extension serving an additional 21,00)0
acrf.s snn Drovriding improved inputs to 32,000 more farmers making a total
ott >9 000Q hby 1977/73.  In addition, the Project would provide continued
serrico-.    to units established under earlier phases but not yet fully developed,
f7:r land dlemarcation and registration of 270,000 acres, for the contirnued
t



development of the Dzalanyama ranch and associ ated stall feeder scheme, arnd
would introduce s.aall prograrns for poultry and dairy development.  It would
also introduce a program of improved health services throughout the prog-ram
area and provide funds for continued program evaluation and the prepara.ion
of the proposed NRDP.
(iv)      The Miniistry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) woul.'-
have overall responsibility for the Project which would be implemented ':hrough
the LLDP staff, with the health component administered by the Ministry of Healtr.
ADMARC would contitnue to supply seasonal inputs and to purchase farmer t;
produce, while the Departmerit of Animal Health and Industry would assis- the
smallholder egg and milk production programs.
(v)       An IDA credit of US$8.5 million is proposed which would cover the
foreign exchange component (US$5.4 million) and about 46% of local costs, or
about 70% of total Project costs of MK10.1 million (US$12.1 million).  The
United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) would contribute US$1.6
million or 13% of project costs.  Government's contribution would total US,$1.0
million or about 8.5% of total Project costs, and ADMARC (stores and markets),
the Dzalanyama Rarvch, and farmers downpayments together would contribute the
remaining US$1.0 million (8.5%). Project costs and financing are net of all
taxes except personal income tax on salaries which is immaterial.
(vi)      Vehicles, machinery and equipment, in orders exceeding US$30,000
would be procured by international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank/IDA guidelines; orders would be bulked whenever possible. Procurenmn~rt
of farm inputs and other recurrent supplies would be subject to local co.1-
petitive bidding.  Civil works wou'd be constructed either under contraci:s
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally, or by Go.'ern-
ment or LLDP force account.  Boreholes would be constructed by the Geolo,;.ical
Survey Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. These methods of procure-
ment and construction have proved the most economical and satisfactory ii
the past.
(vii)     The Project would provide increased production of maize, groun.r:nits,
tobacco, beef, milk and eggs.  At the end of the three-year Project pericd
the incremental annual crop production would be 56,000 short tors of mai:e,
4,000 short tons of groundnuts, 1,000 short tolls of tobacco, 100 short tCas;
of beef. 40,000 gallons of milk and 2.5 -million eggs.  Crop and livestock
production would not achieve their full. production levels until 1985 and 1983
respectively. At full development the program's incremental annual produ-t:ion
would be 184,000 short tons of maize, 13,000 short tons of groundnuts, 1, :) 
short tons of tobacco and 395 short tons of beef.  Non-quantifiable benef ts
would include improved health services, and benefits from the land demarc:ition
and registration program.



- iiti -
(viii)    The economic rate of return of the Project would be 18% over a
twenty-five year period. The major risk facing the Project would be that
increases in fertilizer prices would reduce fertilizer use with corseGuent
reductions in crop yields: a 10% reduction of benefits would reduce the
Project's return to 14%.  The rate of return for all three phases of the
total program is estimated at 13%. As a result of the Project and program
the annual income of a typical farmer cultivating 4.5 acres is expected to
increase from MK101 to MYb142 over a three year period, that of a farmer
cultivating 2.5 acres would increase from MK48 to MK70, while the income of
one cultivating 8 acres would increase from MK 179 to MK273.  Additional
incremental income would accrue to the smaller number of farmers participating
in the beef, dairy and poultry production programs. More than any other
significant income group in the LLDP area, the Project would benefit the 24%
of farmers cultivating less than 3 acres and earning half the national average
income.  Such farmers woulad increase their income from crops by 46% as a
result of the Project.
(ix)      With the end of the Project, the provision of the program's in-
frastructure and basic services would have been completed and Government
would then assume responsibility for the cost of continuing operations, asset
maintenance and incremental farm credit, expected to result in full develop-
ment in 1985/86 with 134,000 farmers participating. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that Malawi Government would not later than September 1, 1976,
submit to the Association satisfactory proposals for the continued administration
and financing of the program's operations.
(x)       Since 1964 Malawi has received eleven IDA credits totalling US$76.6
million.  Five of these credits - two for each of LLDP and Lower Shire and
one for Karonga - have supported integrated rural development schemes. Other
credits have been for road development and engineering, power, education and
for transport engineering and services connected with a wood and pulp project.
Project implementation has been one of the best in East Africa, although due
to world price escalations and currency revaluations, costs overruns are
expected on Karonga and one of the two power projects. Progress under the
Lilongwe program has been generally satisfactory, and most development targets
have been achieved ahead of schedule.
(xW)      Subject to the required assurances, the Project would be su-itable
for eSn IDA credit of US$8.5 million.

LILONGWE LAiND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM- - PHASE III
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1968/69 Malawi ernbarked on the first of its intensive rural
development projects, the Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP) which was
to set the pattern of the countryts strategy in assisting the country's small
farmers for the remainider of the decade and into the 1970's. The LLDP situated
4n the central region and now completing its second phase has been financed
with IDA assistance and has been followed (1969/70) by the Shire Valley Develop-
ment Project in the southern region now in its second phase, the Karonga Devel-
opment Project (1972/73) in the northern region in its first phase, both also
assisted by IDA, and the Salima Lakeshore Development Project assisted by the
Federal Republic of Germany.
1.02      All of these four projects are characterized by the provision of
infrastructure, extension and farmer services within relatively concentrated
areas and, at their completion, it is expected that some 1 million people would
have benefitted from them. While the intensive Projects have made significant
contributions both to institution-building and improved production and stand-
ard of i-ving for large numbers of people, nearly three-quarters of Malawi's
population still remain unaffected by these developments. It is necessary,
therefore, to adopt a strategy which will promote more broad-based development
in an expeditious manner. With the objective of providing improved production
opportunities to the rest of Malawi's farm population over a 20-year period,
a Bank agriculture sector mission identified in 1973 the possibilities of
a more extensive type of development which has become known as the National
Rural Development Project (NRDP). This is now under active discussion with
Government, and is likely to form an important part of the Bank's future
contribution to this sector.
1.03      Since 1964 Malawi has received eleven IDA credits totalling US$76.6
millior.  Apart from five credits for the rural development projects - two
for Lilongwe, two for the Lower Shire and one for Karonga-other credits have
been extended for road development and engineering, power, education and for
transport engineering and services connected with a wood and pulp project.
Project implementation has been one of the best in East Africa, although in
part owing to price escalation and currency revaluations, cost overruns are
expected on both the Karonga project and one of the two power projects (Tedzani
II). Progress under the Lilongwe program hias been generally satisfactory;
most physical targets have been achieved ahead of schedule although crop yields
have not reached expected levels. These and other aspects of the program are
discussed in Chapter III.

1.04      The proposed Project was prepared by Government with the assistance
of the IBRD Regional Mission in East Africa. This report is based on the
findings of an appraisal mission which visited Malawi in May/June 197g. com-
posed of Messrs. U. Mbanefo, K. Niemann and H. van Voorthuizen (IDA).

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Malawi, a landlocked country in Southeast Africa, is bordered on
the south by Mozambique, on the northwest by Zambia and on the northeast by
Tanzania. It has a total land area of about 36,000 square miles, and the
current population, estimated at 4.8 million, is increasing at about 2.6%
per annum. About 90% of the population lives in rural areas, but the urban
population is now estimated to be increasing at twice the rate of the rural
population.
2.02      Between 1965 and 1973 Malawi's gross domestic product (GDP) at con-
stant prices grew by an average of 8% per year to reach K429 million (US$515)
in 1973. Per capita income grew at an average rate of 5.5% in the same period,
reaching K88 (US$105) in 1973. In 1972/73 Government was for the first time
able to finance recurrent expenditures out of current revenues, and it is
expected that future ordinary budget requirements will be fully met from
domestic sources. Development expenditures, however, are expected to continue
to be heavily dependent on foreign sources of finance.
B. The Agricultural Sector
2.03      Agriculture is the most important sector in the Malawi economy,
contributing about half of GDP and employing about 9$> of the rural
population. The average rate of growth at current prices in the past 5 years
has been about 8% compared with about 12% for total GDP. Agriculture accounts
for 95% of total export earnings; in 1973 the main export crops were tobacco
(44%), tea (21%), groundnuts (10%), maize, sugar, rice and cotton.
2.04      About 82% of the total land area is held under customary tenure;
about 2% is either freehold or leasehold estates or plantations, with remain-
der state land mainly devoted to forests and national parks. Holdings are
generally small (averaging about 3.5 acres), and their size is dictated in
part by the scarcity of additional cultivable land. Average population den-
sity is 137 per square mile although it exceeds 280 per square mile in the
most productive areas of the Central and Southern Regions. Customary tenure
or usufruct, generally vested in the family unit gives the right to cultivate
and harvest crops, but not to exclusive grazing or to mortgage or sell the
land. As a first step in land tenure reform, Government in 1967 enacted
legislation which provides the legal and institutional framework for the
classification, registration and utilization of land. Over the past decade
increased food requirements have been met mostly through an expansion of
cultivated area. This in turn has meant that land more susceptible to erosion
has been cultivated, and that fallow periods have been reduced. In view of
the current need to maintain soil fertility and to reduce land pressure, the
emphasis of agricultural policy is now on increased productivity.



-4-
, .05     Smallholder production accounts for over 87% of all agricultixral
production. Maize is by far the most important crop, occupying 80% of all
cultivated land; other major food crops are pulses, groundnuts and cassava,
and co a lesser extent rice, sorghum and wheat. The export value of s?nall-
older crops (mainly groundnuts, rice, fire-cured tobacco, cotton, pul:!es
3nd maize) has grown from MK12.2 million in 1964 to MK28.2 million in i972
though x'ith considerable annual fluctuations.  Some production increases
have been achieved within the major development projects. Elsewhere produc-
Lion has been hampered by a lack of credit and farm inputs, as well as by a
scarcity of trained staff.
2.06      Estates represent only 2% of the cultivated area, but account for
aDout 13% of total agricultural production and slightly over half of agricul-
tural exports (notably tea and tobacco) which have increased from MK10 m:Lllion
in 1964 to MK(24 million in 1972.
2.07      The total number of cattle within Malawi was estimated at 580,000
head in 1973, with an offtake rate of about 9%. Only about 10% of rural
families own any catt:le, although many own some goats and poultry. In the
past the Department of Animal Health in the Ministry of Agriculture has
aimed to expand livestock production through the introduction of more pro-
ductive cattle breeds, through artificial insemination and selective breed-
lng to upgrade the lcocal Zebu cattle, and through a disease control program
aic-.ed at the eradication of Foot and Mouth Disease, East Coast Fever and
tuberculosis in cattle and to guard against Newcastle Disease in poultry.
Other programs undertaken by the Department include a chicken distribution
and egg production and marketing program, and a stallfeeder program for
smallho1der producers.
C. Agricultural Services
2Q08      The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources is primarily
responsible for the provision of services to the agricultural sector. It
ooerates through four departments, Extension and Training which provides
farmer services throughout the country, Animal Health (para. 2.07), Research
wita particular specialization in agricultural economics, cattle breeding
and pasture improvement, and the Technical Services Department which super-
vises land use planning, settlement schemes and irrigation programs.  Thi
Ministrv is also responsible for the four major agricultural development
projects (para 1.01). Almost all organized smallholder credit in Malawi is
provided through these projects.
2.09      The Ministry of Agriculture also exercises general supervision
over the activities of the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corpor<-:.tion
(ADMARC) - the most important institution involved in the marketing of sr,aLl-
holder produce. ADMARC buys, stores, processes and markets (both locally and
abroad) all marketable cotton and tobacco grown in Malawi and is also emyowered
to purchase all produce grown on customary land; for the latter ADMARC vcews



-5-
itself only as a residual buyer of smallholder produce, purchasing only that
output which farmers choose to market through it. A large amount of marketed
smallholder produce is either sold or bartered among the farmers themselves,
and ADMARC's maize purchases, fo_ example, represent only a small proportion
of the marketed total.  In addition ADMARC implements Government's price
policy and supplies inputs to smallholders. Commodity prices are established
by ADMARC (with the Approval of the Minister of Agriculture) and its official
price list includes most cash and subsistence crops. In recent years ADMARC
has accumulated substantial crop marketing profits particularly from trading
in tobacco, cotton and groundnuts and these have been applied to a variety of
development projects. ADMARC also devotes part of its turnover to a price-
equalization reserve to stabilize domestic commodity prices, and maintains a
small food reserve stock. For these purposes it maintainIs 52 main storage
depots, over 700 temporary produce buying stations and in addition it operates
tobacco and groundnut grading centers and seed production farms. ADMARC also
supplies fertilizer, seed, and agricultural equipment to smallholders. Govern-
ment formerly subsidized fertilizer prices to smallholders from the development
budget. These subsidies are being phased out, and current policy is to maintain
farmer incentives through higher crop prices rather than througlh input subsidies.
2.10      Other institutions involved in the marketing of smallholder pro-
duce include the Cold Storage Company which is responsible for Government
price and stabilization policies in the livestock sub-sector. It is a resi-
dual buyer of cattle at official auctions, and currently handles about 20%
of the cattle marketed. The Danish-financed New Capital Dairy Company at
Lilongwe purchases milk from smallholders for bulking, processing and dis-
tribution.



-6-
III.  rHE LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
3.01      The Lilongwe Land Development Program (LLDP) is a three-phase in-
tegrated developr.ent schemne covering an area of approximately 1.2 million
acres of which about 870,000 acres are cultivated by smallholders, and in
which 101,000 1/ farm families are estimated to live. The program was
designed with the aim of increasing the production of the major farm crol)s,
mainly naize, groundnuts and tobacco, and thus the incomes of farmers living
within the program area.  This was to be achieved through the phased imple-
mentation of an intenisive program providing substantial infrastructure and
improved farmer serviLces planned to cover the entire program area over 13
years. New infrestructure provided under the program includes crop extraction
roads, administrative centers, market facilities and boreholes, and farmer
services provided include improved extension and marketing, and credit and
input supplies. In addition comprehensive soil conservation measures have
been undertaken, and a program introduced to survey, demarcate, and register
farmers land.
A. The Program Area
3.02      The program area lies to the west and south of Lilongwe, the new
national capital and the main trading center of the Central Region. Most of
the area is at altitudes of 3,500 to 4,000 feet above sea level, with the
average temperatures ranging from 6o0F to 74°F. Rainfall varies between 25
and 43 inches per annum, the majority of which occurs during the December-
March rainy season.  The well-drained red clay to sandy loam soils are :;light-
ly acidic and generally have adequate nutrients, but with continuous crcipping
they need some fertilizer to maintain yield levels.
3.03      With an estimated populatioin density of about 305 per square nile
(more than twice the national average), the average farm size within th.
program area is about 4.5 acres; cropping patterns vary, the most imporlant
crops being maize, groundnuts and tobacco. In 1973/74 it was estimated that
of the total program area under cultivation, 62% was planted to maize, 22Z. to
groundnuts and 13% to tobacco, with 3% to other crops. Most crops are Frown
on ridges, and nearly all preparation, planting and weeding are carried ou1t
by hand labor, as alsD is harvesting, threshing and groundnut shelling. A
few of the more prosperous f-armers lia e purchased ox-carts and maize mill:.
The use of fertilizer has increased substantially over the past few years
with the increased availability of program credit facilities. More tha. hialf
of the farmers now own some small livestock; over 80% of them keep poultry
and about 25% of the farmers have some cattle.
1/   With a 2e6% per annum population- increase, the program area is expected
to contain about 134,000 farm framilies by 1985/86.



-7-
3.04      For development and administrative purposes the area has been divided
into units of approximately 20,000 acres each. There are two types: standard
units (in areas of higher potential) which would eventually cover about 661,000
acres and modified input units (of lower potential land 1/), on about 213,000
acres. The LLDP Program is phased to bring some new units into the program
each year, and the rate of development of the various program activities thus
varies considerably. Initially, a unit center comprising offices, staff
housing, a borehole and a shopping center is constructed to serve as the base
for program activities: in those units where marketing facilities are irnade-
quate, a marketing and store center independently administered by ADMARC is
also established. Once unit centers have been completed, a wide range of
extension, credit and other farmer services in the area served are then
introduced.
3.05      Originally, it was envisaged that the entire program area would
cover about 500,000 acres and the first phase project included investment
for all the equipment and 0O0% of the administrative structures for this area,
as well as provision for extension training and credit services for the pur-
chase of fertilizer and improved seed for farmers over 163,000 acres. The
first project (IDA Credit of US$6 million) thus provided for the establishment
of 14 unit centers, 630 miles of crop extraction roads, 125 boreholes, and
11 permanent markets with a 8,500 ton crop storage facility, constructed
1,400 miles of diversion channels to help control soil erosion prevalent
within the area. During implementation, most of these infrastructure compo-
nent targets were in fact exceeded. The project also provided for a compre-
hensive land survey, demarcation and reorganization of land holdings, and
eventual registration of family plots. It was recognized that this land
reorganization scheme would require extensive planning, and that it would have
to proceed more slowly than the rest of the program.
3.06      With the second phase (IDA Credit of US$7.25 million) the gross LLDP
area has expanded from 500,000 to 1.2 million acres (Annex 1, page 3) and the
second project was originally planned to extend those activities initiated
under the first phase over an additional 240,000 acres. In fact by the end
of Phase II, the total area covered by Phases I and II would be 664,000 acres
instead ot the 403,000 acres projected in the Appraisal Reports (para. 3.07).
Thie Phase II project provided for a further 12 unit centers and markets, 540
miles of crop extraction roads, 1,700 miles of rainfall diversion channels
and 160 boreholes. Credit and extension services were to be extended to those
areas covered by the new unit centers and the land surveying and registration
program continued in both the Phase I and II areas. The second phase project
also established the 161,000 acre Dzalanyama ranch, designed to provide up-
graded feeder stock for stall fattening by selected farmers and set up a
liaison committee to coordinate the program related policies of various Govern-
ment agencies.
1/   Mainly in the northwestern, southern and southwestern parts of the
progranm area.

B. Achievements under Phases I and II of this Program
3.07      With the anticipated completion of the second project in June 1975,
the LLDP is expected to have successfully implemented within estimated cost
all the physical infrastructure required to support development under :;its
first two phases.  In particular, the construction of unit centers, rord3,
diversion channels, boreholes and marketing facilities has proceeded e.iit er
on or ahead of schedule and the area and number of farmers served by pxogram
infrastructure has thus considerably exceeded estimates. The land registra-
tion program has proceeded more slowly than expected and experience to date
suggests that the detailed planning and procedures required involves a time
lag of 12 - 24 months between farm demarcation and eventual registration of
titles. The shortfall shown below in acres registered (and farmers cove-red
by land registration) merely reflects this time lag. The following table,
which details the main achievements of LLDP, also shows that there is at con-
siderable gap between the number of farmers served by the developed unit centers
and those adopting irnproved inputs through the seasonal credit program. However,
the actual adoption rate is more than twice the appraisal estimate.

3.08      In contrast to the more easily verifiable data on physical develop-
ment, the measurement of production increases over the first two phases has
been more difficult to establish.  Although LLDP was among the first projects
to include an evaluation unit, its initiation after the project had been
started posed problems in determining base-line figures and subsequent staf-
fing problems added to the intrinsic difficulties in obtaining reliable and
representative data. In the case of maize in particular, marketed surplus
represents only a small proportion of total production and of that most is
sold or bartered privately among farmers and is therefore unrecorded. In
addition, the project has had difficulty in determining the extent to which
estimated total incremental production has resulted from increased planted
acreage as against increased yields.
3.09      The Phase II project appraisal estimated that maize yields for the
total program area would increase from an average of 1,000 lb/ac to 2,000
lb/ac by 1979/80. This expected increase was based on total demonstration
plot yields of 7,000 lb/ac and some individual farmer average yields of
3,400 lb/ac. Experience todate indicates that up to 1973/74, maize yields
over the total program area have probably averaged about 10% below implied
targets with yields on developed units increasing from 1,045 lb/ac in 1969/70
to 1,557 lb/ac in 1971/72, declining to 1,143 lb/ac in 1972/73 (a poor sea-
son climatically) and increasing again to an estimated 1,340 lb/ac in 1973174
(see Annex 1).
3.10      Groundnut yield increases have clearly been more disappointing, and
against an expected total program increase over 12 years of from 500 to 650
lb/ac, actual yields have shown a decline (to 438 lb/ac on developed units).
The picture however is confused as in some years, yields from 'undeveloped'
areas were reportedly higher than under the developed units. Over the
period, the price relationship between maize and groundnuts has changed in
favor of the former and as groundnuts require a greater labor input, and
yield increases depend mainly on improved cultivation standards, all indi-
cations suggest that this crop has been relatively neglected. Empirical
evidence, however,. confirms that with the recently agreed price increase,
an average groundnut yield of 650 lb/ac remains a realistic target. In the
case of tobacco, the actual yield has probably exceeded the expected 380 lb/ac
(from 340 lb) and would be even higher if its cultivation was not discouraged
by the quota limitation.
3.11      In so far as farmers' incomes are concerned, the shortfall in yields
as well as cost increases have probably been more than compensated by increases
in farmgate prices, particularly in maize. Other aspects of performance under
the first two phases have been a high level of credit repayment by farmers and
the program's demonstration and design value to other projects in Malawi and
elsewhere.  The Dzalanyama ranch and stallfeeder scheme has been slow to take
off due to difficulties of obtaining enough cattle to stock the ranch, but the
situation has improved in 1973/74 and is expected to go on improving in the future.
3.12      The IBRD Operations Evaluation Department has recently carried
out an audit of Phase I of the LLDP and its report is expected to be issued
soon.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The Projec:t would constitute the third and final phase of tha
Lilongwe Land Development Program. Over a three year investment perioIl
(1975/76 - 1977/78) it would (i) continue to support extension, farmer
credit and infrastructure maintenance services for those previously es:eb-
lished units which have not received up to five years of LLDP developmet.
and financing; (ii) provide infrastructure, extension, credit and other
services to farmers within an additional 210,000 acres not previously de-
veloped, and (iii) introduce several new services throughout the entire pro-
gram area. As a result of the Project, the total influence of the program
would cover a net smallholder cultivable area of 870,000 acres (the
Dzalanyama ranch covers another 161,000 acres), whose 101,000 farm families
in 1974/75 are expected to grow to 109,000 in 1978/79 and 134,000 in 1985/86.
Specifically the Project would provide for:
(a)  construction of 15 uiiit centers, each containing an
input store, offices and staff housing and permanent
markets in selected centers, roads, conservation works
and boreholes;
(b)  survey and demarcation of about 200,000 acres and
registration of 270,000 acres;
(c) the prcovision of incremental seasonal and medium
term farmer credit;
(d) extension services on units not fully developed and
to be developed;
(e)  continued development of the Dzalanyama ranch;
(f) introdluction of poultry and egg production and
dairy development programs;
(g) expansion and improvement of health facilities in the
program area; and
(h) project evaluation and future project preparation.
The Project would be implemented by the LLDP management under the gener .1
direction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The hez.lth
component would be administered by the Ministry of Health.
Headquarters Unit
4.02      The Project would include provision to meet the incremental cap-
ital as well as the operating costs of the program headquarters established



- 11 -
at Lilongwe. Project costs would include salaries for staff and supporting
personnel, as well as vehicle operating costs (Annex 8, Table 2).
Planning and Infrastructure (Annex 2)
4.03      The LLDP Planning and Conservation Unit undertakes comprehensive
planning and construction of most program infrastructure. The Project would
thus include provision for:
(a)  Surveys of land to be developed under the Project
(Annex 8, Table 4);
(b)  the construction of the remaining 15 unit centers
(12 standard and 3 modified) comprising offices,
staff housing, boreholes and land provision for
later community facilities;
(c)  the construction of about 265 miles of new crop extraction
earth roads, serving 160,000 acres;
(d)  the construction and equipment of 143 boreholes pro-
viding the only service of potable water within the
Project area; apart from those to be constructed at
unit centers, boreholes would also be drilled through-
out the Project area at the rate of one per 2,000
acres in standard units and one per 4,000 acres in
modified units; and
(e)  soil conservation measures comprising 1,075 miles of
diversion ditches, 160 miles of waterways and marker
ridging serving 160,000 acres.
Markets and Input Stores
4.04      In addition to other facilities provided at unit centers, seven
permanent produce markets would be constructed and operated by ADMARC in
those units which do not already have adequate marketing facilities. Each
would have facilities for weighing, grading and bulking produce, storage
facilities and ADMARC offices and staff housing. The project would also
provide for input stores with a 380 ton fertilizer storage capacity to be
constructed by ADM}C in each of the 15 unit centers (Annex 8, Table 5).
A Marketing Officer, Development Officer and supporting staff would be
provided to oversee these market facilities. (Annex 8, Table 6).
Land Demarcation and Registration (Annex 3)
4.05      The LLDP activities include the survey, demarcation and registration
of land in all the standard units withiin the LLDP area. The Project would
provide for the demarcation of some 200,000 acres not covered under the pre-
vious two phases, and for the registration of a total of 270,000 acres (Annex



- 12 -
8, Table 7).  Because of the economic  social and po_itical implicaticas of
land registration,  :esultiag Erom the high value attached to land in aa agrariant
community land is generally not registered until about two years after it has
been demarcated (paragraph 3.05) and at the end of the Project period thLere
would remain up to 50,000 acres undemarcated and 114,000 acres unregistered.
This would be completed by Government in the post-Project period.
Extension and Training (Annex 4)
4.06      Extension services would continue to be provided to farmers served
by units previously established for the remainder of the five year development
period (when extension becomes the direct responsibility of the Ministry of
Agriculture) and to additional farmers to be served by the remaining 15 unit
centers to be established under the Project. There would be a total o:' 8
extension workers in each of the standard units - a Development Officer, an
Assistant Development Officer, 4 technical assistants, a livestock ass:istant
and a farm home instructress - and 5 extension workers in modified input areas
(Annex 8, Table 8). The staff/farmer ratio in LLDP areas under development
would remain at about 1:300 in standard units and 1:450 in modified input
units declining for all units after the five year period to 1:500. The Project:
would continue the current farmer training program whereby farmers and their
wives are brought into unit centers for training and demonstrations in crop
storage, home economics, etc. More formal farmer training would continue to
be carried out at the training center at Nsaru. The program training center
at Lilongwe would coatinue to offer courses for Project staff: new staff
members would receive specialized courses in their particular fields, and all
extension staff wouldl receive follow -up training at the start of each crop
year (Annex 8, Table 9).
On-Farm Credit (Annex 5)
4.07      The Projecl: would provide -funds to meet the incremental credit re-
quirements of the 55,000 farmers expected to be receiving credit under WI.DP
by the end of the Project period (Annex 8, Table 10). Apart from seascial
crop requirements (fertilizer, improved seed and sulphur dust) short term
credit would be proviided for the purchase of stall feeders from the DzaLanyama
ranch (paragraph 4.08), dairy cattle (paragraph 4.10), and to support t:he
poultry and egg production program (paragraph 4.11), medium term credit would
be provided for farm equipment (ox-carts, maize mills, tobacco barns, e:c.).
Credit would be administered through the unit centers; farmers receivin,,
credit would be registered at the market center which supplies their inp)uts
and through which they would be required to sell their produce. The pro2ram
would be directed by the Senior Agricultural Credit Officer in each uni:,
with four credit assistants per standard unit and two assistants per modlified
input unit.  Instead of an interest charge there is a markup on seasona:. inputs
which would be increa.sed from the preserit 10% to 15% in 1974/75 and to .'0% in
1975/76 to cover the cost of money and the administrative costs, and to
encourage participation in the newly introduced credit groups which willi. be
allowed a lower marku.p.  Credit for other purposes carries an interest rate of
10% annually and medium-term credit i's repayable over three years.

Livestock Development (Annex 6)
4.08      The Dzalanyama Ranch.  Tne Dzalanyama ranch was started under phase
II to produce young steers to be stall fed by LLDP smaliholder farmers. Al-
though most of the ranch's physical development has been completed, the build-
up of the necessary breeding herd has been slow due to limited availability
of cattle within the country, and the high cost of imports. The Project would
include provision for the ranch's incremental capital costs mainly for the
purchase of cows and immature steers and its net operating costs over three
years (Annex 8, Table 12).  Apart from feeder cattle to be sold to smallholder
producers (paragraph 4.09), cull cows would be sold to either local butchers
or to the Cold Storage Company, and breeding heifers for dairy development
(paragraph 4.10).
4.09      Stall Feeder Program.  This program would be considerably expanded
under the Project (Annex 8, Table 13). About 2,200 additional farmers are
expected to participate in this scheme during the Project period. Apart from
the provision of credit for the purchase of stall feeders (paragraph 4.07),
livestock extension services would be provided to improve the production of
village cattle by encouraging greater use of crop residues, production and
storage of fodder crops, and controlled grazing. Artificial insemination
services would also be expanded, and a mobile cattle market established.
4.10      Dairy Development.  In response to the growing demand for liquid
milk in the LLDP area, the Project would introduce extension services to
encourage farmers to keep dairy cattle. (Annex 8, Table 14). LLDP would
provide credit paragraph 4.07) to pay for up to two-thirds of the initial
capital requirements (2 cross-bred dairy cows, buildings and equipment)
and three months' working capital.  Repayments would be deducted before
farmers were paid for their milk.
4.11      Poultry and Egg Production.  Under the Project, credit and exten-
sion services would be introduced to encourage production of poultry and
eggs to meet increased local demand. It is expected that 120 farmers would
participate and they would be selected within a five-mile radius of the
milk collection points, which would also be used for egg collection. The
Cold Storage Company would set up processing facilities for cull hens once
the program is underway. Credit would be provided under the Project (para-
graph 4.07) to cover fixed and working capital requirements and would be
repayable over three and one-half years (3 laying cycles).
Hiealtlh Facilities
4.12      Tile Project would introduce a comprehensive health improvement
scheme throughout the program area through a network of primary health centers,
sub-centers and health posts accessible to every member of the community.
Services provided would include preventive and curative treatment, health
education, maternal and child health, communicable disease control, environ-
mental hygiene and collection of health statistics. Provision, would be
included for the construction, staffing and other operating costs of six
sub-centers and 21 health posts as well as for the improvement and staffing



- 14 -
of some existing health facilities (Annex 8, Table 11). The health comnponent
would be staffed and managed by the Ministry of Health under the direct super-
vision of a Senior Medical Officer with public health experience who would be
based in Lilongwe working with LLDP management. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations regarding the early appointment of the Senior Medical Off:>cer
and the provision of adequate staffing for the new health facilities p :oposed
under the Project.
Evaluation and Future Project Preparation
4.13      Continued support would be provided for the program evaluation
unit established under Phase I. Apart from continuing field surveys the
unit would process data already collected and would aim to improve its
analysis of the Project achievements. During negotiations, the Association
discussed with Government the possibility of improving the effectiveness,
and defining more precisely the role of the evaluation unit, by concentrating
its future activities on the collection and analysis of reliable data such as
on crop yields, acreages under cultivation, number of farmers in the LLDP
area, number of farmers adopting Project inputs, and farm incomes.  The
Project would also provide NK 200,000 for sgro-economic surveys, land
resource surveys and crop trials to help with the preparation of the National
Rural Development Project (para 1.02).
Environmental Effect
4.14      Through the construction of diversion channels and waterways the
Project would reduce soil erosion prevalent throughout the Project area.
The supply of potable water, public health education, environmental hygiene,
communicable disease control, and the increased availability of public icealth
facilities would alsco help improve living standards over a wide area.
B. Project Cost Estimates (Annex 8)
4.15      Total project cost is estimated to be MfK 10.1 million, or US$ 2e1
million, witlh a foreign exchange component of US$5.4 million (45%). Detailed
cost items are estimated as follows:

Costs have been estimated at prices prevailing as of December, 1974, and in-
clude capital costs plus all operating costs. A physical contingency of 5%
per annum has been allowed on staffing and 10% on all other costs. A price
contingency equal to about 20% of base costs over the Project period has also
been included. These price contingencies were calculated at the following
rates: vehicles, equipment and operating costs 11% in 1975 and 7.5% in
1976-1978; civil works, wages and salaries 15% in 1975 and 12% in 1976-1978
Except for tax on salaries, which is not significant, project costs do not ..nclude
any tax.
C. Financing
4.16      The financing of Project costs would be shared in the following
amounts and proportions:
% of
MlK (million)    US$ (million)   Total Cost
IDA                       7.1               8.5            70
UNCDF                     1.3                1.6            13
Government                0.8                1.0             8
Farmers                   0.2               0.2              2
Dzalanyama Ranch          0.2               0.2              2
ADMARC                    0.5               0.6             5
Total               10.1              12.1           100
The Proposed IDA credit of US$8.5 million would be on standard terms to
Government. It would f:inance the foreign exchange costs (US$5.4 million)
and about 46% of local costs, or about 70% of total Project costs. The
United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) would contribute a grant of
US$1.6 million towards t:he financing of the capital elements of the health
(US$0.8 million) and credit (US$0.8 million). components amounting to about
13% of total Project costs.  The farmerst contribution would be in the fonl
of downpayments on credit purchases of farm inputs.  The ranch is expected
to defray US$295,000 of its expenses out of its own revenues. ADMARC's
contribution would be for the construction of 15 input stores and 7 market,
with offices and staff housing, and includes a proportionate share of the
total provision for contingencies.



- 17 -
D. Procurement
4.17      Vehicles, machinery and equipment, (US$1.3 million) in orders
exceeding US$30,000 would be procured by international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines; orders would be bulked whenever
possible. Procurement of farm inputs, drugs and other recurrent supplies
would be subject to competitive bidding advertised locally. Civil works
(US$1.7 million) would be constructed either under contracts awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally, or by Government or LLDP
force accotnt. Boreholes (US$0.4 million) would be constructed by the
Geological Survey Department of MANR and markets and input stores (US$0.6
million) by ADMARC. Construction of staff housing, offices, roads and
bridges, as well as soil conservation works (US$2.2 million) would be under-
taken mainly by LLDP force account. This procedure has proved a satisfactory
and efficient way of providing the agricultural expertise required for con-
servation works, and fully utilizing existing construction capacity.
E. Disbursement
4.18      Disbursements of funds from the Credit account would be on the
following basis:
(a) 85% of total costs for civil works excluding the
health facilities; and
(b)  100% of foreign exchange costs or 85% of local costs
for other costs except vehicles, equipment and drugs for
the health component, and incremental seasonal and meditw2
term farm inputs.
All the items mentioned in (a) and (b) are (detailed and individually costed
in Annex S. Disbursement against (a) and for vehicles, machinery anci
equipment would be fully documente(l. Disbursement against all other costs
would be mlade against certiLicates of expenditure endorsed by the LLDP Program
Manager, the documentation for hiich would not be submitted for review but
would be retained by the Government and available for inspection by the
Association during the course of supervision. The estimated schedule of
disbursement is at Annex 9. Any funds remaining in the Credit account at the
end of the Project would be reallocated witlh the approval of the Association.
As the Association is going to approve all Malawi Government claims for re-
imbursement (including re-imbursements by UNCDF), there should be no difficulty
in ens-uring that every such claim is correctly allocated either to the
Association or to UNCDF.



- 18 -
F. Accounts and Audit
4.19      LLDP would continue its present accounting procedures for a:1
project costs, subject to improvements now being introduced by the Fialan-
cial Controller for IDA projects in Malawi. Individual accounts wou1c
be maintained to reflect costs for the various project components listed
in para. 4.01, except the health and NRDP components, which would be re-
corded by the Ministry of Health and MANR respectively. Program, Government,
and ADMARC accounts would continue to be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to th.e Association, and would be submitted to IDA within six months
of the end of each fiscal year. Assurances on the above were obtained during
negotiations.



- 19 -
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Organization
5.01      The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) would have
overall responsibility for implementing all aspects of the project, apart from
the health component, which would be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Health. MANR responsibility vwould be exercised mainly through LLDP manage-
ment, with ADMARC supplying seasonal inputs and purchasing farmers' produce,
and the Department of Animal Health and Industry staffing the smallholder egg
and milk production. No changes are envisaged during Phase III in the organi-
zational structure of the LLDP management itself. The program would continue
to be administered through five divisions under the Program Manager covering
respectively, evaluation, survey and management support; construction; finance
and credit; field development services; and institutions and administration.
Further details of the organizational structure and functions are in the
organization chart (IBRD 9121).
Management and Staff
5.02      Since its inception, LLDP, as most other major projects in Malawi,
has depended heavily on expatriate staff, most of whom are on short term
contracts. Efforts to train more Malawians for senior positions in the Project
have been hampered by a shortage of university graduates. The Government has
therefore designed a staff development program which includes the expansion
of the training facilities at Bunda Agricultural College, participation of
8 Malawians in the three-month courses sponsored in Swaziland by the Common-
wealth Development Corporation, post-graduate training for agricultural
economists, and on-the-job training programs for other senior staff members.
These training efforts would ensure that by 1979 all but 3 of the more than
15 super scale and professional posts in LLDP would be occupied by Malawians,
and enough trained Malawians would be left to substantially meet the projected
staff needs elsewhere in the agricultural sector. Governments and the Asso-
ciation would consult on any new appointments to the posts of Program Manager,
Financial Controller and Principal Agricultural Officer.
5.03      At the completion of the Project, it is anticipated that the
program management would be absorbed into MANR, though it is probable that,
at least initially, the post of Program Manager and three divisions covering
field development services, finance and credit, and administration would be
retained. The proposed administrative organization would form part of the
transfer arrangements which Government would propose (para. 5.05).
5.04      No significant increase in tlhe number of junior construction staff
or labor is expected during Phase IIT.  It would be necessary, however, to
employ and train about 10 credit staff and about 60 junior extension staff.
There would be no difficulty in recruiting secondary school leavers or in
training them, either in LLDP's Staff Training Center or at Colbv College.
Applications for these positions generally exceed the number of vacancies.



- 20 -
Intermediate level staff of the Technical Officer and Senior Technical Ji-ficer
grades are usually promoted from within the LLDP or the MANR. About 12 of
such staff would be needed for the new unit centers proposed under the Pr-oject.
Sufficient experienced staff exist either in LLDP or elsewhere in the country,
to enable these posts to be filled by promotion. After Phase III the namber
of junior staff and labor is likely to be progressively reduced by about 50%
with the completion of all construction, earthlworks and land demarcatio:i; it
is anticipated that those released from the program would subsequently be
employed on other projects including the proposed National PRu-a" Development
Project (NIRDP).
LLDP Administration after the Project (Annex 10)
5.05      LLDP was designed as a three-plhase program to establish a delivery
system for the provision of extension services and credit for improved agri-
cultural inputs throughout the Lilongwe area. By the end of the Project
period that delivery system would be complete, and the projected increases in
production and farmer incomes should be achieved without significant new
capital investment. The program area is not expected to achieve its pro-
jected maximum crop production until 1985186, however, and there is there-
fore a need to maintain a skeletal administrative structure, staff, equipment
and farm inputs to continue these services in the program area after the
Project's completion. Government is preparing proposals for post-project
administration, but no arrangements have yet been proposed for the continuing
administration of sma]lholder credit. Consequently, assurances were obtained
at negotiations that Government would inform the Association by September 1,
1976, of comprehensive proposals acceptable to the Association for admin-
istering post-Project agricultural services, including credit to farmers.
The cost to the Malawi. Government is estimated at about K750,000 (US$900,000)
a year for operating expenses and equipment replacement and about K90,00;3
(US$108,000) a year for the recurrent costs of the health facilities. ITh
addition, at full development, fertilizer and other inputs would cost ab,::Put
K3 million annually, requiring additional credit funds rising to about
MK500,000 (US$600,000) by 1985/86. These costs are all estimated at constant
1974 prices. Government is aware of these costs and recognizes its obli>;arion
to finance them. Government projected cash flow statements (Annex 14) stLow
that the funds to be generated by the Project would be more than sufficient
to meet these expenses.

VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARMER'S BENEFITS
AND EFFECTS ON GOVERNMENT BUDGETS
A. Yields and Production
Crops
6.01      Under the Project, the average yields of a typical 4.5 acre farmer
adopting improved inputs are expected to increase over three years as follows:
maize from 1,000 to 1,900 lb/ac. groundnuts from 450 to 650 lb/ac and tobacco
from 340 to 380 lb/ac. These estimated individual farmer yields are considered
realistic having regard to experience under the earlier phases, 1/ the changed
farm-gate price relationship (favoring groundnuts)., continuing technological
developments and improving LLDP extension experience.
6.02      Crop production is expected to increase, as a result of the above
individual yield increases, and as more farmers adopt improved inputs and
techniques. Phase III expenditures would increase production not only in
Phase III areas, but also in areas developed under Phases I and II.  During
the 3-year Project period, crop productioni in all these areas is expected to
increase from 185,000 short tons (1974/75) to 241,000 short tons for maize,
from 27,000 short tons to 31,000 short tons for groundnuts, and from 10,000
short tons to 12,000 short tons for tobacco in line with projected demand
within the limits imposed by national quota. Compared with previous esti-
mates, these are conservative projections based on experience gained during
Phases I and II. For example, whereas Pihase II project estimates assumed
that 85% of project farmers would fully adopt modern inputs within 5 years,
the above estimates assume a 75% adoption rate, and that this would take 8
years to achieve.
Livestock (Aninex 6)
6.03      With the accelerated expansion of the Dzalanyama Ranch anticipated
during the Project, the number of steers supplied by the ranch to farmers
for fattening would increase from 300 in 1974/75 to 1,100 in 1977/78, thus
increasing the beef output of the stall-feeder program (from 75 short tons to
200 short tons per year). The number of cull animals produced by the ranch
is also expected to increase from 300 to 550 per year. Smallholder dairyink
and poultry efforts would produce about 40,000 gallons of milk and about 2.5
million eggs annually by 1978.
1/   These individual yields of farmers adopting improved inputs should not
be confused with actual yields achieved under Phases I and 11 (paragraph
3.09) whicih represent average yields of farmers, both adopters and non-
adopters, in units under various stages of development.



- 22 -
6.04      Crop and beef production in the LLDP area are not likely to
achieve their anticipated maximum potential until about 1985 and 1983 respec-
tively, although the infrastructure necessary for such achievement wol.l  have
been completed by tide end of Phase III.  At full development the total ..LDP
area is expected to show annually, an incremental production of 184,0(.;0 short
tons of maize, 13,000 short tons of groundnuts, 1,500 short tons of tobalcco
and 395 short tons of beef, compared with projections without LLDP (Arnnex 15,
Tables 6 and 7). These represent increases of 98% for maize, 43% for ground-
nuts, and 15% for tobacco.
B., Markets and Prices (Annexes 11 and 12)
Markets
6.05      Sufficient demand is projected for all Project output, and well
organized marketing arrangements already exist for them. ADMARC would buy
maize, mostly for consumption within the country and groundnuts and tobacco
most of which would be exported. The Cold Storage Company (CSC) would buy
beef, which although now almost wholly required for domestic consumption,
could be exported. Egg marketing, now undertaken by the Department of Animal
Health and Industry, would eventually be taken over by the proposed Egg Market--
ing Board. The New Capital Dairy would buy and process milk for consumption
within Malawi.
Prices
6.06      The existing mechanism, whereby prices of all Project output are
fixed by parastatal organizations and approved by Malawi Government, is
expected to continue;; ADMARC's pricing policy and price list as of July  5,
1974, are at Annex 11. The maize purchase price has been increased in lS'74,
with a view to maintaining farmers' incentives following recent increases in
the world prices of fertilizer and maize.  As of July 15, 1974, CSC's official
beef buying prices ranged from 15 tambala per lb for commercial grade t1) 24
tambala per lb for choice grade beef.
C. Farmers' Benefits (Annex 13)
b.07      The Project would extend LLDP extension services and inputs tc
32,000 farm families who have not previously directly benefited from LLIP
and some 75% of the Project's recurrent expenditure would continue to benefit
farmers covered under the earlier phases, many of whom are estimated to hive
not yet reached their expected full production potential.  For a typical
farmer cultivating 4.5 acres, annual net income from maize, groundnuts aad
tobacco would increase over three years from K101 to K142. The income cf a
farmer cultivating 2.5 acres would increase from K48 to K70, while an 8-acre
farmer's income would increase from K179 to K273. About half of LLDP farriers
grow between 3 and 6 acres of crops, about one quarter grow less than 3 acres,
while the remaining oIne quarter have more than 6 acres. These income estimates



- 23 -
include subsistence. About 120 farmers are expected to take up egg production
yielding an annual net income of K231 while dairying would produce an additional
net income of K107 per year for about 60 farmers. All these income estimates
are at constant 1974 prices.
D. Effects on Government Budget (Annex 14)
6.08      The Government cash flow arising out of the Project (Annex 14,
Table 1) shows that there would be a cumulative surplus from 1978/79 while
that for the total program (Table 2) would show a cumulative surplus from
1977/78. Post-Project Government expenditures for the program include
continuing operating costs (including that of the health program) and fixed
asset replacements which in total and at constant prices are expected to
decline from about K 950,000 in 1978/79 to K 850,000 in 1984/85, and the
incremental resources for the credit fund requiring a total increase over
the period of about K 500,000. During this period the most significant revenue
item is the projected ADMARC net surplus realized from its marketing of farmer's
produce under the program which is estimated at constant prices to increase from
about K 850,000 in 1978/79 to about K 1,250,000 in 1984/85. This surplus is
freely available to Government.



- 24 -
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
(Annex 15)
7.01       The primary benefits of the Project would be the increased produc-
tion of maize, groundnuts, tobacco and beef, and in addition small pro,::uction
increases in milk and eggs.  Based on IBRD forecast internatlonal prici:s, the
Project's internal economic rate of return to the economy (IER) is estimated
at 18%. IER of the ranch and stall-feeder program is estimated at 11% if all
costs and benefits are included, and 22% if costs and benefit prior to 1975/76
are treated as sunk costs and benefits. No hiring of labor for farm operations;
is envisaged.  Family labor, whose employment may be slightly increasec: ?zy
the project, is shadow-priced at zero cost because there is practically :no
alternative employme:nt for such labor.
7.02       The risks most likely to affect the Project's rate of return
would be lower production levels arising from abnormally adverse climatic
conditions, or through lower than expected fertilizer use (despite increased
maize prices which are expected to fully offset increased fertilizer costs).
A 50% reduction in maize yields (and fertilizer use) would reduce the IER
to 12%. A 10% reductiLon in benefits would reduce the rate of return to 14%,
and this combined with a 10% increase in costs would reduce the return to 11%.
7.03       At the end of the Phase III Project, the LLDP infrastructure and
delivery system would. virtually be completed, providing an intensive extension
service and modern farm inputs to some 109,000 farm families in 1977/78
increasing to 134,000 families in 1985/86. At full development in 1985,'86
the program's total incremental production is estimated to be 184,000 s:Lort
tons of maize, 13,000 short tons of groundnuts, 1,500 short tons of tob.cLcco,
and lesser quantities of beef, milk and eggs which would help meet the .row-
ing internal needs of Malawi and also contribute to exports. Based on P.he
revised estimates reflecting experience to date (including more conserv.. tive
yields and adoption rates) assumed in this report, the IER for all thre: phases
of LLDP is now estimated at 13%.
7.04       Both the program and Project analyses, exclude the benefits of
LLDP's land registration and health programs and senior staff training
scheme, whiich are expected to be considerable.  In addition, the progranv
would continue to provide a successful demonstration of rural development which
has already attracted wide interest, and it would also provide a valuable base
for planning, launching and administering the proposed National Rural Develop-
ment Program.
7.05      More than any other significant income group in the LLDP area, t:he
Project would benefit the 24% of farmers cultivating less than 3 acres, lnld
earning about half the national average income. Such farmers would incr2ase
their real income frora crops by 46% as a result of the Project.

VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
principal issues:
(a) A Senior Medical Officer with public health-experience to be
based in Lilongwe would be appointed by Malawi Government
within 6 months of credit signing, to supervise the implemen-
tation of the health component (paragraphs 4.12).
(b) Government would inform the Association, not later than
September 1, 1976, of proposals satisfactory to the Association
for administering project activities and assets after the
Project period (paragraph 5.05).
(c) Government would consult the Association on any new appoint-
ments to the posts of Program Manager, Financial Controller
and Principal Agricultural Officer (paragraph 5.02).
8.02      Subject to the above assurances, the Project would be suitable for
an IDA credit of US$8.5 million to the Government of Malawi.

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PTHASE III
The Lilongwe Land Development Program
A. Background
The Lilongwe Plain
1.        The Lilongwe Land Development Program is located on the Lilongwe
Plain in Malawi's Central Region. The topography and the good, red-brown
loam soils of the plain makes most of the area suitable for cultivation.
The best soils on the upper and middle slopes are deep and well drained.
Maize is the main food crop and is grown on about 60% of all cultivated
land. Groundnuts and dark fired tobacco are important sources of cash
income for the farmers. Associated with the good hill soils are large
tracts of shallow valleys, locally known as dambos, which are made up of
heavy alluvial black soils with impeded drainage conditions. Dambos occupy
about 20% of all land and are traditionally communal land used mainly for
cattle grazing. A better utilization of dambos - as through improvement of
the pastures - appears to be feasible but little progress has been made so
far because the dambos are traditionally communal land.
Original LLDP Area
2.        The forerunner of the Lilongwe Land Development Program was the
Tsabango Pilot Scheme which was started in 1965 with British aid. It in-
volved the building of crop extraction roads, intensive extension advice
backed up by the availability of improved seed and fertilizer and the
creation of Village Planning Committees to stimulate agricultural and
general community development within the villages.
3.        Subsequently, a 500,000 acre program area was defined by the
Lilongwe Land Development Order of 1967.  The Lilongwe area was selected
because its agricultural potential was considered to be the highest of any
region in Malawi. The population density was about 250 per square mile in
1966, or twice as high as the national average. The soils were among the
most fertile in the country and rainfall was considered adequate. Develop-
ment opportunities were numerous. Few villages had a reliable supply of
water, but there were abundant supplies of good underground water which
could be tapped by boreholes with simple hand pumps. Although the relief
was generally moderate, soil erosion was already becoming a problem in



ANNEX 1
Page 2
certain areas.  hlere were few roads and the existing network of pat is
and tracks was inadequate. Marketing facilities and extension servi-es
were weak and the use of improved seeds and fertilizers very limited.
Briefly, the area was found ideally suited as a site for the first major
food and cash crop development project.
4.        The program was designed as a 13 year continuing program, and
for purposes of implementation the area was divided into development units
of approximately 20,000 acres each. Development of each unit would start
off with the construction of roads, soil conservation works, boreholes,
staff housing and storage and marketing facilities. These physical develop-
ments would be followed by the establishment of the necessary extension,
credit and land reorganization servrices. It was expected that each unit
would be fully developed in five years time, and that nine years after the
beginning of the program the physical development would have been completed
in all units; it was expected that by the end of year 13 full development
would have been reached in all units.
5.        For purposes of financing, the program was divided into three
phases of four, five and four years respectively. Thus the physical de-
velopment would be completed at the end of the Phase II project (year 9)
and Phase III (years 10-13) would consist of a continuation of extension,
credit and land reorganization services in the not fully developed units.
Enlarged LLDP Area
6.        During the preparation of Phase II the program area was extended
by 376,400 acres of crop land.  Another 161,000 acres of the Dzalanyara
Forest Reserve on the western border of the program area was included as
well for the development of a cattle ranch.  Part of the additional crao
land, mainly on the north western, the south western and southern edges
of the program area had poorer soils and were less densely populated.
Therefore these lands were grouped into modified input units" which re-
quired a less intensive development approach than the "standard input
units". Because the program area was virtually doubled and because the
Phase II project was scheduled for four years instead of the originalli'
planned five years, physical development will not be completed by the  mnd
of Phase II despite the fact that construction works were implemented
well ahead of schedule right from the beginning of the program.
7.        Except for a few minor changes of the borders no new land world
be added to the Program area during the Project. The amount of land in-
volved in the program can be summarized as follows:

A large proportion of Malawi's population benefits from the program.
In 1973 an estimated 425,000 people, or nearly 10% of the country's rural
population, were living in the LLDP area.
Land Use
8.        Because of the continued population growth the intensity of
cultivation is increasing steadily in the LLDP area. The Evaluation Unit
found the following cultivation rates during the 1970/71 and 1971/72 gar-
den surveys (average figures for the two seasons):
Total Area   Cultivated Area  Percentage Cultivated
Phase I project area         276,800         159,480               58

ANNEX 1

The percentages of land being cultivated varied from a high 75 to 80% :in
the first two devel'oped units close to Lilongwe Town to a low 36 to 44,'
in the southern and south western Modified Input areas.
9.        Unfortunastely, no accurate information is available on the 31:atus
of land which is not cultivated. The program management estimates that: on
average 30% of all land in the program area cannot be cultivated. This in-
cludes mainly all dambo land (estimated at 20% of the total LLDP area) as
well as the roads, residential and commercial areas, the areas covered by
conservation works, graveyards and rocky outcrops. The balance of land not
yet cultivated consists mainly of natural or regenerated bushland.
10.       A system of bush fallowing was formerly practised in the Lilongwe
Plain but this system was gradually abandoned when the population grew to
its present proportions. During the 1971/72 garden survey only 2% fallow
land was recorded. Restoring of the soil fertility must therefore neces-
sarily be achieved through the application of fertilizers. Only small
quantities of farm manure are available and these are mainly used in
tobacco fields.
11.       It is est:Lmated that the farmers will continue to clear bush
land at a rate of 2% annually until a maximum cultivation intensity of 70%
of all land will be reached, probably by about 1985. It is evident that
under these conditions the main effort of the Project must be directed
towards achieving higher productions per acre of land through better crop
care and the use of improved seeds and fertilizers.
Holding Size
12.       The 1971/72 garden survey confirmed that LLDP farmers grow o0i
average 4.5 to 5 acres of crops annually.  This figure has remained fa'rly
stable for several years and is not expected to change very much up to
1985. Variations in the areas cultivated by individual farmers are nol
excessive.  About half of them grow between three and six acres of cro!Ps,
while one-quarter have less than three acres and the remaining quarter
have more than six acres. Only four percent of the farmers grow more
than ten acres of crops annually. Traditionally, the village headmen
allocate the land to the farmers; the size of their families is the mai'n
determining factor for the amount of land they can cultivate.
13.       According to the 1971/72 garden survey the areas cultivated
by the farmers are somewhat smaller in the Phase III (Project) area than
in the Phase I and II areas.

Farm Operations
14.       Virtually all cultivations are done by hand with simple tools.
There are about 71,750 work oxen in the area but they are mainly used for
transport purposes and only a few farmers use them for ploughing. Private
estates and government farms employ tractors, but none are used on smalLholder
farms. Maize shellers were introduced in 1971 and have proved very successful.
About 8,000 short tons, or 9% of the total maize production, were mechanically
shelled in 1971772, and in the following year the performance increased to
16,000 short tons or 16% of the total production. The shellers are still
operated by the program management at a fee designed to cover the costs of
the operation. It is hoped that village communities or other groups of
farmers will take the shellers over in the near future. A series of ground-
nut shelling machines have been tested in Malawi but none has been successful
for confecti onery nuts so far because of breakage and damage problems.
Crops
15.       Maize cultivation increased from less than 50% of all LLDP land
in the 1960's to about 60% in 1971/72; at the expense of groundnuts, which
fell from nearly 30% to about 22%, and fallow areas, which declined from
about 7% to only 2%.  Dark fired tobacco areas remained fairly stable at
about 14%. The introduction of improved seeds and the availability of fer-
tilizers favored the cultivation of maize. However, groundnuts also appeared
to be less attractive because sizeable yield increases can only be achieved
through more crop care which inevitably means more work for the farmer.
Moreover, the groundnut prices were not competitive with those of maize until
they were raised during 1973/74. Besides the three main crops only very
limited acreages of pulses, sweet potatoes and a few other vegetables are
grown in the area.  Experiments have shown that soya beans and sunflower can
be grown successfully in the Lilongwe Plain but no major introduction of
these crops is anticipated in the near future.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
Rainfall
16.       Rainfall is the single most important factor determining the success
or the failure of a crop year. The rainy season runs usually for about 4 to
5 months from November to April and the average annual rainfall of 30 to 35
inches is adequate for the crops grown in the area. Variations in the annual
rainfall are considerable, however. Data for Lilongwe Airport (Table 1) indicate
that the 1967/68 anti 1972/73 seasons were very dry with a total rainfall of less
than 25 inches. On the other hand, 1973/74 was exceptionally wet with a record
42.5 Inches up to the end of May. Distribution of rainfall over the plain and
through the growing season is also liable to considerable variation. Rainfall
patterns during the planting and harvesting seasons are particularly important,
and data show that these patterns are quite unreliable.  The first raiis
usually fall in late. October/early November but may not arrive
for a further two weeks. The variability of the main rains poses a dilemma
for the farmers since the advantages gained from early planting of crops is
offset by the danger of severe scorching of early germinating plants if there
is a long lag before the main rains commence. The risks involved are especially
great in the case of groundnuts because of the high value of the seeds. Rain-
fall can be very heavy, especially in the early parts of the season. Since
the fields are still bare at that time the heavy rains can create serious
erosion problems. lDng term protection through the implementation of soil
conservation works is therefore indispensable especially in view of the in-
creasing intensity of cultivation in the area.
B. Crop Development
General
17.       The main objective during the Project period would continue t) be
to raise the level of crop production in the LLDP area. The incentive :!c,r
increases in the tobaLcco production is small because of limited market i)utlet
possibilities, but there are no such constraints on the production of the
other two main crops, maize and groundnuts. Higher crop productions womild
be achieved through expansion of the cropped areas and through increases; in
the yields per acre. The areas under crops are expected to increase by 2%
annually until a maximum of 70% of all land would be cultivated by 1985
The increase of the cropping intensity in the LLDP area is basically now
related to the program but results from the continued growth of the popl-la-
tion. The Project would, however, speed up this development to some ext:eat
mainly through the construction o' roads and boreholes; no attempt has lean
made to quantify the effect of this increased activity, however.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
18.       It is expected that the proportions of maize, groundnuts and tobacco
in the cropping pattern would not change substantially, and that no new crops
would be introduced on a large scale in the near future.

62       22         12.5           3.5           100
This assumes, however, that the relationship between the per man-day returns
of the various crops would remain fairly stable and that price changes in
major cost elements (for instance, fertilizers) would be reflected in the
crop prices. Table 2 gives the gross LLDP areas under development, the crop
areas and the proportion of land expected to be cultivated from 1975/76 to
1985/86.
19.       The Project's extension, credit and marketing services would con-
tinue to help improve the maize and groundnut yield levels. Experience indi-
cates that some of the crop yield targets employed in appraising Phases I
and II need to be revised for the Project. A 5 year period is too short to
raise the yields to the original full development level, and it is now be-
lieved that a period of at least 8 years would be more appropriate. Both
the existing and future groundnut yield levels were probably over-estimated
when Phase II was appraised and have been revised downwards. Phase II
achievements and Project projections are discussed in detail below.
Maize
20.       Phase II Achievements.  A precise assessment of the project's impact
on the yields during the limited number of years for which data are available
is difficult because of yearly fluctuations due to varying weather conditions
and because the available data do not appear to be very reliable in spite of
the considerable efforts by LLDP's Evaluation Unit. Both the project's staff
and the farmers claim that yields have been increasing over the past years.

The low 1972/73 figures are puzzling. According to the Chitedze Research
Station maize breeders, 1972/73 was a better maize year than is indicated
above. This is reflected in higher research yields both on the Chitedze
Station and in LLDP trial plots.  In January and February 1973 the rainfall
was more than 50% below average however, and since the farmers tend to
plant too late it is quite possible that their crops have suffered. The
data suggest that slightly higher yields were achieved in the developed
units than in the units which were not yet reached by the project.
21.       Maize yield increases rely heavily on the use of improved seeds
and fertilizer combined with better crop care. A comparison between the
appraisal estimates and the actual sales figures for seeds and fertilizers
during the first three years of the Phase II Project is given below:

22.       Total sales of both fertilizers and seeds fell short of appraisal
estimates, mainly because the farmers appeared to be unwilling to buy these
items on cash terum. The farmer's reluctance is not surprising because
spending part of their limited cash resources on fertilizer and seeds would
imply a major change from their traditional spending patterns. It would prob-
ably take a long time before the farmers change their attitude, especially
when credit terms are readily available to them. Moreover the steep rise in
fertilizer prices from an average MK40 - 45 per MT in 1970 to about MO70 -
75 per mt in 1972 and 1973, while the official maize price remained unchanged
at MK2.50 per bag of 200 lb discouraged the farmers from buying larger quan-
tities on cash terms. Indeed it is quite surprising that sales on credit
still increased under these conditions. Sales of seeds fell considerably
short of targets, but it should be noted that the quality improved. More
than 50% of seeds sold in 1973/74 consisted of the high yielding Rhodesian
SR52 hybrid variety against less than 10% of the 1971/72 sales. Sufficient
quantities of both seeds and fert-ilizers were available throughout the first
three years of Phase II to satisfy the demands of the farmers.
23.       Project Projections.  The Project would continue to encourage the
supply of improved seeds and fertilizers to the farmers. The Rhodesian hybrid
SR52 by far out-yields other seed varieties, as shown in the following results
of trials in the LLDP area.
Yields in lb per acre
1971/72     1972/73
SR52                        7,458        7,369
U.C.A.                      5,067        5,674

SV 37                       4,211        4,514
No new varieties which do better than the hybrid SR52 are yet in sight.  It
is therefore expected that this variety would be introduced on a large scale.
The Ukiriguru Composite A (U.C.A.) was recently introduced from Tanzania and
is doing very well in the Lilongwe area. Yields from U.C.A. trial fields
were markedly higher than those from the local hybrid LH 11 and from the syn-
thetic SV 37 which have been supplied to the farmers in the past. U.C.A.
produces a high proportion of flint cobs and is as palatable as the local
synthetics. It is expected that the farmers would be willing to replace
their local hybrid and synthetic varieties by U.C.A. for their home consump-
tion while SR52, which produces dent cobs only, would be grown as a cash crop.



ANNEX 1
Page 10
24.       By 1985 some 30% of the total maize area would be planted with
SR52 hybrids; 40% with composites such as U.C.A. or synthetics, and the
remaining 30% with local seed varieties. SR52 seeds cannot be prodi.:ced in
Malawi and would continue to be imported from Rhodesia or Zambia. 'Ance
SR52 is a hybrid, fresh seeds need to be supplied every year. Comptosites
and synthetic seeds are produced on ADMARC seed farms and each farmo r is
advised to buy comnpletely new seed from the seed farm every 3 years.
25.       Continuous cropping of the fields - which is now common practice
at LLDP - necessitates the use of fertilizers, especially when improved seeds
are used. The use of fertilizers must be accompanied, however, by good crop
husbandry practices such as timely planting and weeding and proper spacing.
This becomes increasingly necessary as fertilizer prices increase. Maize
requires both nitrogen and phosphor fertilization, but no response to potash
has so far been determined at LLDP. Experiments at the Chitedze Research
Station on SR52 and U.C.A. maize varieties have shown that, provided that
40 lb P 05 is applied per acre, applications of up to 90 lb N per acre
result in almost linear yield increases. Farmers who take proper care of
their crops would certainly be able to increase their SR52 yields by about
1,000 lb, the U.C.A. yields by 700 lb to 800 lb, and the synthetics yields
by 600 lb to 700 lb of maize for every 50 kg bag (110 lb) of CAN 26% or
compound 20.20.0 fertilizers. The yields would start to level off at about
3 to 4 bags of fertilizer per acre for SR52 and 2 to 3 bags for U.C.A. and
synthetic maize varieties.
26.       Since fertilization of maize is not yet common practice at LLDP,
and because fertilizers are expected to be both scarce and expensive, at
least in the immediate future, only modest fertilizer applications a: e rec-
ommended:

The projected yield levels reflect proper cultivation practices when fertil-
izer is applied but below average crop care for the non-fertilized maize.
The farmers could eventually raise the yields through improvements of crop
husbandry techniques only, but it is assuned that those who do take more
care of their crops would apply fertilizers at the same time. From the dis-
cussion in the previous paragraph, it is clear that further yield increases
through the use of more fertilizers are possible. Future price relationships
between fertilizers and maize and the farmers responses to the program act-
ivities wtill ultimately determine the level of maize production in the LLDP
area.
27.       Storage losses.  Insects and moulds are known to cause damage to
maize when the maize cobs are stored under traditional village conditions.
The extent of the damage varies with the seasons and is highest during pro-
longed rains. A grain storage survey conducted throughout Malawi during the
1969/70 and 1970/71 seasons recorded losses of 6% and 2% respectively, but
experienced agronomists in the country estimate that the losses can be as
high as 10'., or even 20%. It is understood that a new survey would be under-
taken in the near future. Use of lindane, a benzene hexachloride, was recom-
mended to reduce storage losses, but this insecticide was banned for use on
farms in 1972 because it contaminated the tobacco.  HIybrid maize is more suscep-
tible to insect attacks because the tips of the cobs are not entirely cov-
ered by the leaves.  One of the aims of the maize shelling program is to re-
duce the period between harvesting and marketing of maize and thus minimize
the storage losses.  The use of improved storage cribs-is also being encour-
aged by the program extension services.
Groundnuts
28.       Phase II Achievements.  As in the case of maize, a full assessment
of Phase T' results cannot be made.  The available data unfortunately suggest
that groundnut yields did not increase.

/1   Provisional estimate.
The particularly bad 1972/73 yields were largely due to unfavorable weather
conditions. Rainfall was 30% below normal and its distribution over the
crucial growing months was even worse. January received less than half and



ANNEX I
Page 12
February less than one-third of the normal amounts. Long dry spells harip-
ered the establishment and early grcrwth and the growing season was of com-
paratively short duration.  This was especi ally bad for the CThalimbana con-
fectionery nut which requires a. long growing season of about 150 days.
Moreover the poor rainfall conditions caused a severe outbreak of rosett:e
disease. About one-quarter of all fields were abandoned by the farmers and
in certain areas which are especially prone to the rosette disease, nearly
one-half of all fields were not harvested.
29.       Unfavorable weather conditions in one particular year can, however,
not explain the lack: of progress in groundnut yields over a period of four
years. Many possible reasons have been put forward, but no consensus has
yet been reached on the subject. It is reasonable to assume that the farmers
have given priority to maize at the expense of groundnuts. Maize is the
staple food crop and receives therefore more attention than other crops.
Planting of maize always precedes that of groundnuts , and the latter are
often planted too late, especially when the rains do not arrive in time, or
when the early rains are followed by a long dry spell. Since groundnuts
are sensitive to late planting the yields suffer. This is reflected in
large variations of groundnut yields between different years and different
locations. Secondly, the scope for maize yield increases is much larger
than for groundnuts. Maize yields may be easily doubled, or even tripled,
through the use of improved seeds and fertilizers.  The incremental produc-
tion requires only a few additional days of work at harvesting time. Ground-
nut yields depend mainly on, good crop care, however, for instance:
(a)  early planting, which definitely results in a
higher production, but involves the risk of
losing the seeds if the rains fail;
(b) proper rotation with other crops; groundnuts
should not be grown ori the same field for two
or more successive vears and should not be
grown after tobacco;
(c)  sufficient plant denss.ity which reduces the risk
of losses through rosette disease;
(d) timely and thorough, weedings;
(e)  repeated sui.phur dst t.gs to minimize losses
from :Leaf spot diseases.
These activities inevitably involve xaorc a.ork for the farmers.a It migh t very
well be that they havre devoted a larger share of their time and attenti 3n to
maize because increase in maize yields require less additional physical ef-
forts than for grouncinuts.  Under these conditions the competitiveness 'i.
groundnut growing cart only be manintained through sufficient price incentives.
A modest price increase from 6 to 6.5 tambala per lb was annotunced durili;
the poor 1972/73 grotmdnut season. The official price was substantialli
raised to 8 tambala per lb during the 1973/74 season and it is anticipated
that this should result in increased. production levels.

30.       The sales of fresh seeds and sulphur dust lagged behind the ap-
praisal estimates in 1971/72 but exceeded them in 1972/73 and 1973/74. As

31.       Project Projections.  The long-term projections of groundnut acreages
have been revised for the Project. When Phase II was appraised in 1970 it was
estimated that the area under groundnuts would double over a period of 10 years,
while maize and tobacco acreages would remain stable. The experiences of the
past years indicate, however, that it is more realistic to assume that ground-
nut, maize and tobacco areas would increase in the same proportions. A rate
of increase of 2% per year is expected for all crops, both with and without
the program. Further, it was assumed during Phase II appraisal that groundnut
yields would rise from 575 lb per acre before development to 725 lb at full
development. But past experience indicates that the estimated yield levels
are too high, and that a gradual increase from 450 lb to 650 lb, mainly due
to improvements in crop husbandry, appears more realistic.

32.       Fresh seeds and sulphur dust would continue to be distribut:ed by
ADMARC with credit support from the Project. It is expected that tAe
Chalimbana nut will remain the most appropriate variety for most of the
LLDP area, at least for the near future. Several rosette resistant varie-
ties have already, been developed, as for example RG1. This variety is due
to be released in 1974/75 in Units 4 and 5 which were very badly affected
by rosette disease in 1972/73. The nuts of this variety are however smaller
and are classified as a grade B by ADMARC. Crossing of rosette resistant
varieties with Chalimbana continue on Chitedze Research Station and it is
hoped that high yielding, good quality, rosette resistant varieties will be
developed in the near future.
33.        Experiments conducted on Chiitedze Research Station have shown that
groundnut yields can be increased by 50% from an average 1,000 lb to about
1,500 lb of shell(ed nuts per acre through the use of sulphur dust when com-
bined with punctual crop care.  Large scale trials on LLDP farmers fields
during the poor 1972/73 season confirmed that a yield increase of about 50%
can be achieved with sulphur dusting.  Sulphur dust is a fungicide which
kills the cercospora fungi and reduces the incidence of leaf-spots; more
leaves will therefore stay on the plants and yields will be higher.  't
should be applied at a rate of about 80 lb in about 8 successive fort--
nightly intervals.  Its effectiveness depends on good cultural practices,
and it tends to work better in the higher altitude areas such as the ]Lilongw!
Plain.  It is estimated that the level of crop care should be high e-iclugh to
allow for an incremental yield of 300 lb in order to make sulphur du.;3t:ing eczno-
mically attractive for the farmer.  About 10% of the groundnuts in the developed
units of LLDP were! sulphur dusted in 1973/74 and it is expected that this pro'-
portion would rise to 20% by 1977/78. This low adoption rate is ref:Lected in
the average yields quoted in paragraph 31 above.
34.       Althoughi fresh seeds and the use of sulphur dust would help to
increase the yields in the coming years, the main effort should be made by
the farmers themselves through improvements of their crop husbandry 1.rac-
tices.  It is expected that farmers would take more care of their grc1und-
nuts and other crops when the scarcity of land becomes more evident :ln the
years ahead. It is also expected that the recent substantial increace in
groundnut prices will encourage the farmers, and it is essential thal: -rices
remain competitive in the future.

Tobacco
35.       Because of the limited export possibilities, the production of
Northern Division dark fired tobacco is officially restricted by an indi-
vidual quota system. Quotas were introduced in 1967/68 and are adminis-
tered by ADMARC.  In 1972/73 the national quota was 27 million lb, out of
which 11.6 million lbs were allocated to the developed part of LLDP.  The
administration of the quota system is not without shortcomings. LLDP's
extension staff observed that in some cases quotas are given to registered
growers who do not in fact grow tobacco but simply act as front men for
non-reg' st-ered growers. A recent LLDP survey indicated that 25% of all
tobacco growers have no quota. It should also be noted that there is a
steady demand for tobacco for the local trade, and recently for trade over
the border to Zambia. For this reason it is estimated that the production
exceeds the official quota, but there is no information on the quantities
involved.
36.       The large differences in ADMARC prices paid for the various grades
of tobacco results in considerable wastage of lower quality tobacco by the
farmers. Because of the quantity restrictions farmers attempt to fill their
quota with high value long leaves while throwing away the low value short
bottom leaves. In 1972/73 a new market was found in Europe for the low
quality bottom leaf and it is believed that about two million lb can be
disposed of without difficulty. The farmer's response in that year was
low and only a few thousand lbs were delivered to ADMARC markets. Tihe pros-
pects for this special market are unclear.
37.       The complicated marketing situation has impeded the Evaluation
Unit's attempt to measure the yields of tobacco.  Yields of 370 to 380 lb
per acre have been computed for the seasons 1971/72 and 1972/73 by dividing
the total weight sold by the total acreage. These figures must be regarded
with caution, as the actual yields were probably higher than the "total
weight sold". The estimates of the national yields obtained by ADMARC
buyers varied between 1970 and 1972 from 340 to 370 lb per acre. The stan-
dard of tobacco cultivation in the LLDP area is high. About one third of
the farmers use farm yard manure on their tobacco and the application of
fertilizers appears to be almost universal. Sales olf fertilizer for tobacco
totalled about 1,900 MT in 1973/74 - more than double the 825 MT estimate
duiring the Phase II appraisal. Virtually, all sales were made on credit,
contrary to the appraisal's projection that 85% of the fertilizer would be
sold for cash.
3!.       For Project planning purposes it is estimated that tobacco grown
in the not v,et developed areas of T,T,T)P receives 25 kg CAN, 26% and 25 kg
20.20.0 compound fertilizers per acre and that the yield averages 340 lb
per acre. In the developed areas the fertilizer application is estimated
at 30 kg cf both types and the yield at 380 lb per acre.  The estimated



ANNEX 1
Page 16
yield levels assume the same degree of wastage of low quality tobacco as
over the past years, but improvements on this situation are possible (para.
36). The assumptions used imply that the tobacco acreage, like those of
other crops, would increase by 2% annually. Less tobacco, and conseqiuently
more maize or groundnuts, would however be planted if one of the folli:wing
situations arose:
(a) ADMARC was unable to increase the quotas by
2% annually;
(b) the yields rose substantially above the
estimated levels;
(c) the possibilities of disposing of tobacco
through unofficial marketing channels was
reduced.
Supply of Crop Inputs
39.       Fertilizer, improved seeds and sulphur dust requirements for the
Project, are listed in Table 3. ADMARC would continue to assure the sale
of these inputs with credit support by the Project (for details see Annex 5).
Registered tobacco growers would continue to receive seeds free of charge
from ADMARC.

LILONGOWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMI - PHASE III
Plarning, Construction and Conservation
1.        The Land UJse Planning and Conservation Section of the LLDP carries
out land surveys, construction of roads and soil conservation works, as weil as
all building work except for the construction of boreholes. The health fac:ili-
ties proposed under 8be Project would be contracted out.
Roads
2.        Since the start of the LLDP the construction of roads has proceeded
well ahead of the original targets. It is now estimated that by the end of
Phase II about 1,295 miles of roads serving an area of 702,550 acres will have
been built. This compares with 1,180 miles over an area of 478,000 acres
projected in the Phases I and II appraisal reports. The increase in the area
covered is larger (50%) than the increase of constructed mileage (25%) as the
density of the network for the modified input areas was reduced by roughly one
half to about one mile of road for every 1,000 acres of land.
3.        The road network in the LLDP area woule be completed during the first
two y.aa&s of the Project.  Some 265 miles remain to be constructed over an area
of 160,700 acres; about: half of the mileage would be earth roads for crop
extraction, generally with a maximum width of 24 feet, and the other half
16 foot-wide feeder roads.  A summary of the road construction program is nre-
sented below:

LLDP maintains its own roads. Road maintenance arrangements for the post-
program period are discussed in Annex 10.
Soil Conservation Works
4.        Farmers in the LLDP area have traditionally grown their crops on
ridges to protect them against excessive rains. In many instances, however,
these ridges do not follow the contour lines as they should in order to help
prevent uncontrolled run-off of water. Marker ridging at 30 yard intervals by
tractor and disc plough in order to indicate the proper direction of the ridges
has proven to be very helpful to the farmers and would continue under the
Project.
5.        A diversion of excess water from the fields which also avoids soil
erosion is provided for by the construction of V bottomed ditches with a grade
of about 1:400. The water is discharged from the ditches into embanked, widen-
ing, waterways which channel the water downwards to the swampy areas. About
7 miles of ditches and one mile of waterways were constructed per 1,000 acres
during Phases I and II.

/1   As road construction precedes soil conservation by about 6 months,
the figures quoted here are smaller than those quoted in paragraph 3.
The constructed mileages are in line with the appraisal estimates.
6.        An additional 1,075 miles of diversion ditches and 160 miles of
waterways would be constructed during the Project. These estimates were
initially based on a standard treatment for the remaining 160,000 acres of
standard input areas; the modified input areas were not to receive any con-
servation measures at all. Recently it was decided to be more selective in
the implementation of soil conservation works and to take the prevailing
soil types and slopes in the area into account. The conservation input in
standard input areas where the slope is of less than 2% would be reduced
under the Project. Areas of 2-4% slope would be given standard treatment
if on sandy soils and areas of 4-6% slope would receive standard treatment,
regardless of soil type. The anticipated reduction of works in the standard
input areas would permit the implementation of some conservation measures
in the modified input areas.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
7.        Benefits from the soil conservation works are difficult to quantify
but are expected to be considerable in the long run. The farmers would be
expected to mainitain the conservation works themselves. When these works
are well constructed the maintenance requirements are not particularly high;
however, the extension services would have to make a major effort ta impress
the long term benefits upon the farmers.  As a positive side effect of the
construction of the ditches it should be mentioned that they improvE the
accessibility of the area.  In many instances, the embankments of twe ditches
are being used as tracks for ox-carts, bicycles and even motorized ve.hicles.,
Boreholes
8.        People in the Lilongwe have traditionally relied on rivers and
drainage ponds for their domestic water supply; hauling water from these
sources is time consuming, however, and use of such water is hazardous to
health. Excellent groundwater is available at depths of 100-120 feet, and
the construction of boreholes equipped with simple hand pumps, is now being
undertaken throughout the program area. Construction of these boreholes
commenced prior to initiation of the LLDP, and the construction schedule
has been greatly expanded by the program. Drilling and maintenance of the
boreholes is done by the Geological Surveys Department of the Ministry of
t ricu_ture and Natural Resources, and a minimum distance of half a mile
between the boreholes is maintained.
9.        Prior to LLDP 130 boreholes were constructed, and by the end of
Phase II LLDP would have added another 344. This compares with the total of
285 estimated during the Phase I and II appraisals. The constructicn
schedule for the Project is as follows:
1975/76     1976/77   1977/78   Total
Number of boreholes             54          46         43      143
At the end of the program period ai total of 487 boreholes would have bieen con-
structed by LLDP; thus including the boreholes constructed prior to .3hase I,
the area would have a total of 617 boreholes. This would represent l density
of one borehole for every 150 to 175 families in the LLDP area.
10.       LLDP provided funds for the maintenance of those boreholes constructed
for the program by the Geological Survey Department. Financial responsibiliLy
for borehole maintenance in the post-Project period is discussed in 1.nnex 10.
Unit Centers
11.       Major development services such as extension, credit and nErketing
services are provided through the local LLDP unit center. An existir.g rural
service center or entirely new center may be developed for this purpcse, the
major factor determining its location being its accessibility to the farmers
within the unit. The size of the icenters varies from 25 to 60 acres, and a



ANNEX 2
Page 4
typical unit center includes housing and office space for LLDP staff, a
borehole and a market and input store owned and operated by ADMARC. It is
expected that the unit centers will gradually expand into true administrative
and commercial centers once the basic services have been established. There-
fore, provisions are being made for land to establish shops, schools, clinics,
churches, community halls, etc. Shops have already been established in all
completed unit centers. By the end of the Project, unit centers would be
completed in 25 standard input areas, 8 of which would not require new markets
as they already had permanent markets. Staff housing and office space are
constructed by LLDP's building unit, while ADMARC constructs the markets and
input stores.
12.       During the three year Phase III Project, unit centers would be built
in the remaining 12 standard input areas and in 3 modified input areas. Be-
cause of envisaged reductions in the LLDP staff, housing requirements would be
only 14 units in the standard input areas and 9 in the modified input areas.
ADMARC would construct 7 new markets and 15 input stores during the Project.
Three units already have sufficient existing market facilities and 5 other
units, among them 4 modified input areas, do not require markets. The storage
capacity of the input stores (measuring 1,800 sq. ft.) is about 380 tons of
fertilizer, which is sufficient for the normal annual requirements of a unit
area. The stores are designed on a module basis and extensions could be easily
added if required.

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Land Demarcation and Registration
Background
1.        Since the beginning of LLDP a great deal of attention has been
given to improvements in the customary land rights system. Pressures upon
the traditional system resulted in Parliament passing the customary Land
(Development) Act, the Registered Land Act, and the Local Lands Board Act
in 1967 in order to institute a legal system for controlling and establish-
ing land holdings and land use, and regulating matters pertaining to land.
So far the Customary Land (Development) Act has only been applied within
LLDP.
2.        Because the establishment of legal land rights is a new concept
in the traditional society, objectives and procedures needed to be tested
in the field during the first two phases of LLDP. Important conclusions
can now be drawn after several years of pioneering. First of all, it has
been clearly established that providing a firm legal base for land owner.-
ship in a situation where land is becoming increasingly scarce responds t:o
a real need among the rural population.  The farmers who have so far beei,
affected by LLDP's activities in this field are unanimously in favor of
land registration because it provides them with greater security.  Althotgi
the effects are hardly visible at this stage, land registration will
certainly encourage farmers to invest in their land in order to maintain
and improve its fertility. Secondly, it has become clear that the transition
from communal to indivLdual ownership is too big a jump to be made in a single
operation. Therefore it has been decided to consolidate land iLlto family
unit holdings which might encompass some 100 to 200 acres of land. This
should be looked upon as a first important step in a framework into whicL
ultimately a movement to individual land tenure can be instituted.  Thircl11
it has been established that ample time should be allowed for the subseqtUent
stages of demarcation, recording and registration of land. Land is the
basis for livelihood for the vast majority of the population and a low-kEy
but a persuasive approach is appropriate in order to obtain full cooperation
of all people involved.
Procedures
3.        The land allocation and registration process in LLDP is precedel
by various improvements in the infrastructure such as the construction of
roads and conservation works. These works are planned on topographic map;



ANNX 3
Page 2
which are drawn up by the Department of Surveys using aerial photographs as
a base. After the construction of the roads and conservation works a second
series of aerial photographs are made which are then used as a base for land
allocation and registration purposes.
4.        The allocation process begins with the gazetting of unit areas as
"development sections" and grants of powers of land allocation to the
demarcation officer. Introductory meetings are held and a land committee
of traditional leaders is elected to advise the demarcation officer on
customarv matters. After seven days notice of commencement of work, back-
ground information is collected on all relevant aspects such as the village
historv, family structure and the migration pattern of the people.
5.        The demarcation wor7k begins with the definition of village bound-
aries in cooperation and agreement with the traditional authorities and the
headman concerned. Work then devolves to the village level and boundaries
between the various family unit groupings within the village are defined
with the approval of the village headman and family leaders. They are
demarcated so as to provide an equitable share of land amiong all people.
The elected family representative becomes the absolute proprietor, and the
land is categorized as "private freehold land."  "Public land" is reserved
for public purposes such as unit centers and trading centers, schools and
other communal purposes. Finally "customary land" is set aside for resi-
dential purposes, forest sites, graveyards and communal "dambo" land.
6.        When all pieces of land are demarcated and the boundaries drawn
up, the aerial photographs are passed on to the survey section.  From the
photographs, and in consultation with land allocation field staff, beacons
are located along every boundary. The beacons are then surveyed and their
exact locations plotted on a demarcation map.  Ground methods of surveying,
using a bar and theodolite, have been adopted at LLDP because this has proved
to be more suitable than aerial methods. Meanwhile, a recording team visits
each family unit and records the number of demarcated plots within that
family unit. In the case of private freehold land, a record is made of the
family representative and all the members of the family who are to be regis-
tered as owning that land. For every parcel of land, al allocation record
is then completed showing the identification number and area of the piece as
shown on the demarcation map, the owner(s) of that land if it is private, or
whether it has been recorded as customary or intended public land.
7.        Notice is then given that the demarcation map and allocation
record are completed and both are made available for public viewing and
scrutiny for a period of 60 days.  Thereafter the registrar of the local
registration district orders a registry map to be prepared from the demar-
cation map by the Survey Department and he compiles a register in respect
of each piece of land. Finally a land certificate is issued to the pro-
prietor(s) of the private freehold land, the family leader being the elected



ANNEX 3
Page 3
representative of his people. Once the land has been registered all land
matters have to be referred to the Local Lands Board, which is legally estab-
lished for each registration district.
Program Achievements
8.         In the earlier years of LLDP the land allocation and registration
process had a slow start and by the end of Phase I only 143,000 acres had
been demarcated. By the end of 1973 the demarcation and recording parts of
the process were well under way and about 100,000 acres could be handled
annually. Final registration of the land has lagged, however. It appears
that a time lag of one to two years between demarcation and registration has
to be allowed for.
9.        The schedule for the Project is included in the table below:
Demarcation    Registration

/1   Revised estimate.
Since only about 120,000 acres were registered (or about to be registered)
by the end of 1973 this schedule assumes that registration of the alreadi'
demarcated areas would catch up during the remainder of Phase II.  About
200,000 acres would be demarcated during Phase III. An additional peridcl
of 18 months would be required to demarcate and register all the standarc
input areas.  No land allocation is yet envisaged for the modified input
areas.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
10.       It is expected that during the Project the per acre costs would be
in the neighborhood of MK1 for the allocation and demarcation process and
that another MKiper acre would be required for surveying and mapping of the
area. Total costs would thus be about MK2 per acre. It should, however, be
kept in mind that the gross value of annual crop production would rise from
about MK25 to MK40 per acre as a result of all development activities.  In
this context the one time only costs of land allocation do not appear to be
excessive. Especially in a situation where land is becoming increasingly
scarce, the long term benefits of secure land ownership rights are larger
than the costs involved.

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Agricultural Extension and Training
Introduction
1.        The success or failure of LLDP depends to a large extent on the
performance of the extension services. During the first two phases of the
program valuable experience has been acquired with respect to the organiza-
tional structure, staffing and working methods of the extension services.
No basic changes in the operations are being anticipated under the Proj ect
although the number of field workers would be reduced to some extent and a
few dairy, poultry and home economics extension workers would be added to
the staff. The program would continue to provide facilities for the
training of both staff and farmers.
Extension
2.        The organizational structure of the extension services would remain
unchanged during the Project period. The field staff would continue to be
based in the unit centers from where they are serving on average about: 2,200
farmers per unit center.  Distances extension workers need to travel ia order
to visit the farms generally do not exceed 5 miles. The units are heaidd by
a Development Officer who in turn is responsible to a Senior Developme.t: Officer
in charge of an average of 6 or 7 units. At headquarters in Lilongwe a Senior
Extension Officer is in charge of all extension activities.  He has daily radib
communications with the field staff in the units.
3.        All positions in the extension staff, including the Senior E:.tension
Officer, are presently occupied by Malawi nationals. Colby College tu:ns out
sufficient numbers of technical assistants to fill vacancies of the juilior
field staff levels without any difficulty.  But the number of graduate  from
Bunda College has so far been too small to fill all senior positions w::.th per-
sonnel having a sufficient educational and professional background.  T.iis sit-
uation would probably continue to persist for a few years. Program ma;zagement
has therefore made it a policy to promote outstanding and experienced ;taff
members from the ranks whenever this appears feasible.
4.        In terms of numbers the field staff is being reduced in the last
year of Phase II from 8 to 6 technical assistants per standard input a::ea.
During the Project there would be a further reduction to 4 technical assistantc
per unit. With better trained and more experienced staff this lower s :aff
density is considered adequate.  The unit staff would continue to inclvd: a
livestock assistant. A farm home instructress would be added to each t:nit



ANN EX 4
Page 2
during the Project which would enable greater attention to be given to the
role of women in agriculture. As in Phase II the Standard Unit's Development
Officer would be assisted by an Assistant Development Officer. The modified
input units would have a smaller staff comprised of either a Development
Officer or an Assistant Development Officer, two technical assistants, a
livestock assistant and a farm home instructress. The staffing ratio on the
unit levels would thus be one for about 300 farmers in the standard input
areas and one for 450 farmers in the modified input areas. It is envisaged
that in the post-Project period the staff density in the standard input areas
would be further reduced to about the same level as in the modified input areas.
5.        The extension field staff would continue to assist in the setting
up and functioning of the Village Planning Committees. Extension workers
would also continue to collaborate closely with the credit assistants (number-
ing 4 in the standard input areas and 2 in the modified input areas) in selec-
ting and advising those farmers who would receive credit packages from the
Project. Monthly programs of activities are drawn up by the Senior Extension
Officer which contain the guidelines for the establishment of weekly working
programs for individual staff. The program's Livestock Section formulates
programs for the livestock technical assistants.
6.        Specialized extension staff would advise the new Project dairy and
poultry farms. For dairying there would be 2 technical assistants in 1975
and 1976, increasing to 4 in 1977; the general livestock assistants in the
units would also assist in the scheme. A technical officer specialized in
dairying would coordinate the activities, and overall technical direction
would come from the Central Region Dairy Officer through the program's
Livestock Officer. For the poultry scheme there would be three poultry tech-
nical assistants to be headed by one of the existing livestock technical
officers. The Central Region Poultry Officer would have overall technical
responsibility for the scheme.
Trning
7.        The program's Training Section would continue to run the staff train-
ing center at Lilongwe. All new staff members receive courses in their partic-
ular fields and all extension staff receive followup training at the start of
each crop year.
8.        One or two weeks training courses would continue to be provided for
farmers and their wives at the Farmer Training Center at Nsaru. In addition,
some farmer training would be provided at Nambuma and Nathenje by the Regional
Agricultural Office. However, the training facilities at Nambuma would be
improved during Phase II, and those at Nathenje under the proposed Project.
The recurrent costs of these centers would be borne by the Regional Agricul-
tural Office. Facilities for women's training would be introduced at each of
these centers one year after the physical improvements; provision would be



ANNEX 4
Page 3
included for the cost of a demonstration kitchen. Finally, the Training
Section would continue to operate two "yellow vans" as extension a.1ds for
demonstration purposes and film shows to farmers.

LILONG1E LAND DEVELOPN1ENT PPOGRAM - PIASE ITI
Agricultural Credit
General
1.        The availability of credit facilities to finance the purchase Co
inputs such as fertilizer and seeds is essential for the improvement of
production levels.  At this time, however, there are only limited onpor'r_u2Izes
in Malawi for smallholders to obtain short- and medium-term credit.  Tttout
the availability of credit facilities, the use of chemicals, fertilizers and
improved seeds would be sharply reduced over current levels, and agricuitnural
productivity would suffer. Therefore, the LLDP has provided credit facilities
during Phlases I and II and will continue to do so durin- the Project period.
Project costs include the annual incremental credit requirements of thne nro-ram.
Due to the administrative cost of running a scheme projected to serve ai<2out
55,000 farmers at the end of the Project, a new feature in the form of groun
credit would be introduced. All credit operations would continue to be con-
trolled by the LLDP's Chief Agricultural Credit Officer (who reports to thc
Program tanager through the Financial Controller). Field administration of
credit operations would be based in the unit centers; each standard unit has
now four credit assistants and each modified unit two assistants. Each farmer
would be registered at a market through which he would obtain his input supplies
and to which, if he received Project credit, he would be obligated under the
terms of his loan agreement to sell his produce.  Credit repayments would be
collected by LLDP credit clerks posted at ADXARC markets for this purpose.
Following traditional practice in Malawi, smallholders are not charg,ed -i
specified interest, but rather a "credit clharge which usually includes
implied interest rate of about 10% a year with or without some additionai per-
centage points designed to recover administrative costs of operating the credit
scheme.
Seasonal Credit
2.        Seasonal credit is made available in packages to eligible farmers
(the makce-up of these packages is detailed In Table 1). Up to 1973/74
seasonal credit carried a mark-up of 10 percent, and the proposed increase
to 15 percent in 1974/75 and 20 percent thereafter is designed to cover rising
administrative expenses. The increase is also expected to encourage the use
of group credit which would carry a marl-up of only 7.5 percent.  In addition,
it is hoped that the increased credit charges would encourage farmers to buy
more inputs for cash than thev have done so far. Very good recoveries were
obtained in 1968/69 and 1969/70 (100%) and in 1970/71 (99%).  Of the 1971172
and 1972/73 credits, 95.3%. and 88.5% had been recovered as of January 31, 1974.
This limited recovery rate was due in part to a relaxation of credit ratings
(para 8). It is now proDosed that no new credit will be given to farmers
unless their old debts are fully paid up. Should a farmer not be able to repay
credit due to crop failure, a charge of MK2 would be added and the new total



AN,EX 5
Page 2
debt would be deducted from receipts from the next crop. This would mak:e the
farmers more conscious of their commitments, and it is expected that the rate
of recovery should improve. The projected seasonal inputs and credit re luire-
ments are detailed below:

Medium-Term Credit
3.        Medium-term credit would continue to be provided for farn carts, naize
mills, farm implements, tobacco barns, fencing and for rural craftsmen.  0:, carts
constitute the most convenient method of transporting smallholder produce, and
the program would support the training of these animals; the carts themsel,es
are too expensive for farmers to buy for cash and the program therefore pr:vides
a three-year loan for their purchase.  These programs would both be contin ed
under the Project.  The purchase of maize mills is expected to decline aft(:r
the Project period as the number available reaches the saturation point. i.
nominal sum has been provided for fencing of pastures, dambos and forestry
plots.  The construction of tobacco barns with more permanent materials wotLd
be encouraged and a nominal sum for the necessary construction materials wculd
also be provided. The funds required for rural craftsmen would cover a subsi.s-
.ence allowance for the initial period of operation. Recovery of medium-termi
credit has been satisfact:ory. Details of projected cash requirements for
medium-term credit are given in Table 2, and the corresponding cash flow
statement is at Table 3.

Credit for Stall Feeders
4.        Credit would continue to be given under the Project for all stall
feeders issued from Dzalanyama Ranch over the 3-year period. Projections are
based on the expected ranch sales detailed in Annex 6.  In practice farmers
would be encouraged to purchase steers for cash (or part cash and part credit)
by restricting credit availability to farmers who have not been issued steers
on previous occasions.  Some of the steers issued may be trained as work oxen,
in which case medium-term credit would be provided. Other credit would be
repayed 6 months from date of issue when feeder stock is sold for slaughter.
LLDP would make arrangements for credit repayments to be deducted from the
animal's sale price. Consequently, no bad debts have been incurred and none
are expected in the future. A projected flow of the credit funds is shown
below:

Poultry
5.         Credit for poultry would be given in the form of two loans:
(a)  one to finance capital requirements (estimated at MK263) to be repaid
with interest-at 10% per annum over three laying cycles of 60 weeks
each; and



ANNEX 5
Page 4
(b)  one to finance working capital for the cost of 96 birds an,l the
rearing feed (estimated at MK154) with a mark-up of 15% repayable
over a single egg-laying cycle. It is proposed to provide the
working capital for four egg-laying cycles, after which th(! farmer
should have saved sufficient capital to be self-financing.
Repayments for both loans would be made by deductions from egg sales to the egg
marketing organization. Projections of capital requirements and repayments are

Dairying
6.        To assist in the expansion of the dairy scheme, farmers with-r, the
LLDP area would be eligible for credit to purchase two dairy cows each. The
amount provided by the Project would cover two-thlirds of the initial c.: pital
requirements; the remaining funds are expected to come from the farmer con-
cerned. In addition, the credit fund would advance the necessary work:ing
capital for the first three months.  Details are set out in Annex 6.  Por
each of the first two years 15 farmers are expected to participate in [: his
scheme and in year 3 this number would increase to 30. Repayments would
be over a four-year period. The flow of funds is projected as follows;

Projected Credit Fund
7.        Table 4 summarizes the cash flow of the various credit components
discussed in the previous paragraphs.  After completion of the Project, the
credit fund would generate a surplus of MK204,000 for lQ78/79.  However, as
more farmers would adopt program inputs, another K500,000 would be required
to bring the ftind up to the peak requirement expected in 19g5/86.
Group Credit
8.        In 1971/72 the strict application of regulations for the assessment
of creditworthiness was relaxed, and there was also growing awarness of the
benefits of using improved seed and fertilizers. Consequently, the number
of loans issued per unit increased considerably as compared with the previous
season. An attempt at group credit was made at LLDP in 1970/71 when hybrid
maize packages were issued on credit terms to smallholders through village
headmen in twenty villages. The village headman was the individual legally
responsible for the issue, and he allocated the packages among farmers in
his village. While the result of this experiment looked promising, it was



AiNEX 5
Page 6
found that credit issues to village headmen involved far more administra-ive
time per issue than those to individual growers. A very considerable leirel
of supervision of the accounts of village headmen was necessary because of
the low levels of literacy among this group. and it proved necessary tc
maintain duplicate accounts. The experiment was not repeated.
9.        Due to the increasing cost of administering a credit scheme,
operating costs would be substantially reduced if seasonal credit were
available only to those smallholders who really need it.  Group credit offers
a method for effecting this reduction. It is proposed that initially
seasonal credit would be made available only to groups in the three modi-
fied input areas and that it would be simply encouraged elsewhere.  It is
envisioned that a group of smallholders would form a voluntary association
for the receipt of seed and fertilizers on credit. These would be issued
as separate items, not as packages, with the exception that if groundnut
seed were required, an equal weight of sulphur would also be issued and
a charge levied. Before any issue would be made, the group would pay a
deposit amounting to 10 percent of the ADMARC retail value of the credit
issues requested. Each member would contribute to the deposit in proportion
to his requirements. (This is not essential as other members of the group
could cover any other member judged by the group as a whole to be credit-
worthy but unable to find the cash for the deposit.)
10.       One or several members would together act as agent for the group,
but responsibility for repayment would lie with the group as a whole. Tie
agreement forms ensure that this requirement is recognized. Failure to
repay the loan in full means that the group as a whole (and therefore eszl
member) loses its deposit, and that the group members 1/ could not be deized
worthy of credit in the following season. Responsibility for extracting
payment from defaulting individuals within the group would lie entirely
with the group as a whole.
11.       It was expected that each group should have an average of 25
members. In the 1970/71 exercise numbers have ranged from 9 to 52. A
group would be expected to take credit to the value of about M200 althoi gh
in the past a few have taken less (the lowest being MK148). The interes:
charged on group loans would be 7-1/2 percent of the ADMARC retail cost.
In addition, groups would pay an administrative charge of 10 percent of
the deposit.
12.       The expectation is that each unit would have an average of 1,350
accounts. By 1977/78 the number of accounts in developed units might total
1/   The injunction must apply to individual members, since the whole pri:-
ciple breaks down if the defaulting group were dissolved and members
formed new associations with other smallholders.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
43,200. Bv that time the standard input units would need 128 credit assis-
tants, and annual operating costs would reach about !1K114,000. If 10 Percent
of borrowlers in a standard unit form groups, the number of accounts per
credit assistant would fall from 350 to about 310 on average; if 20 percent
of borrowers were to form grouDs, the number would fall to 275, assuming
four credit assistants per unit. If the number of credit assistants were
then reduced to three, each would have approximately 360 accounts. If the
number of accounts and credit assistants per unit is reduced, the need
for additional supervisory staff would also decrease. The implication for
the credit fund is, of course, that because of a lower effective interest rate
on group credit a smaller margin over the cost of seeds and fertilizers would
accrue to the fund than is the case with individual credit.  This would only be
fair, since administrative costs and bad debts are also expected to be reduced.
13.       Unless some form of group credit structure evolves within the
LLDP, the cost of operating the credit program will continue to be high
in relation to the value of credit issues of seeds and fertilizers. Because
funds available for the financing of a credit nrogram are limited, not only
should group credit be encouraged as an alternative to individual credit,
but incentives for purchases of seasonal inputs for cash by individuals and
groups should also receive greater attention.
Farmers' Contribution
14.       Farmers' direct contribution to Project costs is restricted to
their participation in the medium-term credit, poultry and dairy schemes.
The expected incremental cash purchases of seasonal inputs (estimated to
be about NX435,000) is not included in Project costs, as such purchases
would be handled directly by ADMARC. No account has been taken of contri-
butions to the group credit scheme because of the uncertainty which still
prevails regarding the ability and willingness of farmers to form credit
groups. The following table summarizes the anticipated pontributions by
types of credit:

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Livestock De'elpment
Introduction
1.        Livestock development was started at LLDP during Phase II and
included extension and disease control activities designed to improve
the productivity of the village cattle herd. Moveover, the development
of a breeding ranch was started with the aim of raising feeder stock
which would be issued to LLDP farmers for fattening.  During the Projet,
livestock developmerLt would be given greater emphasis and dairying and
poultry keeping would be added to the program activities,
A. Cattle Improvement
Background
2.        LLDP has a large cattle population of about 70,000 head (1972
estimate) which is about 12% of Malawi's entire cattle herd. There are
not many grazing lands left in the LLDP area, besides the dambos (swamps)
where the cattle are kept during most of the year. The cattle density .Ls
high:  about one head of cattle for every 12 acres of land.  Overgrazinl,,
is therefore a serious problem, especially during the dry season when t]Eie
animals are concentrated in the wetter parts of the dambos after having
ranged over the harvested fields. About one half of the animals are cow>s
or heifers, one quarl:er are calves and weaners and the remainder are bulls,
steers and about 7,500 to 8,000 work oxen.
3.        Mortality rates, especially among calves, are high and the pra-
ductivity of the catt:le is still low because of generally poor husbandry
techniques and in spite of the fact that about three quarters of all
animals are now regularly dipped against tick-borne diseases.  Veterinary
Department Statistics over the period 1967-71 indicate that the average
annual offtake for the Lilongwe District was about 10% and the growth rate
1% per annum, giving an average productivity of about 11%.
Proj ect Activities
4,        Livestock extension services have been set up during Phase II :!in
order to improve upon the productivity of village cattle, and these
services would be expanded during the Project.  Activities would include



KN2NEX 6
Page 2
(a)  encouragement of greater use of crop residues with stall
feeding in order to achieve greater slaughter weight and
higher grades of beef;
(b)  production and conservation of fodder crops particularly for
farmers participating in dairy developmenit with half-bred
Friesiar's;
(c)  controlled grazing of the dambos, e.g. through fencing and
education of the stock owners;
(d)  further culli'ng of surplus animals and a reduction of the
number of surplus bulls.
5.         Provisions was made in Phase II for construction of 14 dip tanks,
but that number was reduced to five during implementation because construc-
tion costs turned out to be about MK 5,000 each against an appraisal
estimate of E  2,OO0. A careful investigation by the LLDP livestock
section has led to the conclusion that a further five dip tanks would
need to be constructed during the Project. After completion of the
programe all LLTDP area cattle would be within 4 to 5 miles of a dip.
6.        Artificial insemination services would be expanded with the
introduction of four inseminators in the first year, increasing to six
in year two and eight in year three.  The main semen used would probably
be Friesian which would give a supply of stock for the Lilongwe milk shed
and also produce a high quality beef carcass. The services would be
based at the Regional Veterinary Office at Lilongwe and the Project would
provide ftunlds to cover salaries and transport of the inseminators as well
as the direct costs of the inseminators, equipment, semen and liquid
nitrogen.
7.         A mobile cattle market would be set up, which could lead to the
siting of a permanent market if cattle flows are sufficient.
8.         It is anticipated that continued extension and disease control
activities would increase the productivity of the program area cattle
herd. Beef production would rise from an estimated level of about 1,050
short tons in 1974 to about 2,040 short tons in 1994.  Some 850 short
tons would be produced through stall fattening of village raised steers
by that year (see Table 1).

9.         Stall fattening or cattle by smallholders using maize meal, grass
and crop residues such as maize bran, maize stems and leaves and groundnuts

haulms has been successfully encouraged in Malawi during recent years. Stall
fattening is an attractive proposition for the smallholders because nilarly
all the required feedstuffs are readily available on the farms and thi! amount
of labor involved is small and evenly spread over the year. Usually wso
animals are fattened at the same time, but some farmers already opera!:e
larger units.
Phase II Achievements
10.       As a part of the Phase II project the development of a breedi.ng
ranch to produce stall feeders for LLDP farmers was started in 1970. The
ranch covers an area of 161,000 acres of the Dzalanyama forest reserve
which is the major catchment area of the Lilongwe river in the south-western
part of the program area. During the appraisal of Phase II it was estimated
that full development of the ranch would be reached in 12 years, and that
about 1,800 steers would be raised and issued to the farmers annually by
1982/83. From year 8 onwards a surplus of breeding heifers rising to about
700 annually was expected and these were to be sold to the farmers for
milk production or fattening. Finally the ranch was expected to produce
about 950 cull cows, bulls and heifers annually at full development.
11.       According to the Phase II projections all investments in the
ranch were to be completed during the four year project period. These
included physical developments like the construction of roads, buildings,
fences, fire breaks, boreholes, dip tanks and the purchase of some 6,000
breeding cows and in-calf heifers and 230 bulls. Moreover some 1,000
immature steers were to be purchased annually to be issued subsequently
to the farmers during the build-tip period of the ranch.
12.       The physical development of the ranch, not including the purchase
of breeding animals, was virtually completed by the end of March 1974. The
capital costs involved amounted to about M( 210,000 which compares with an
appraisal estimate oil MK 252,000. Savings were made on boreholes; only
three were constructed instead of the 14 planned because water proved mare
abundantly available from natural sources than anticipated. Expenditure<,
on machinery and equipment were also lower than estimated.
13.       The Phase II cattle purchase projections could not be fulfillcd how-
ever. Malawi's estimated catlie population of 560,000 to 580,000 head g10'ows
by about 3.5% or 20,000 head annually.  Stocking of the ranch at the anl.i::i-
pated pace of 1 ,500 coDws and 1 ,000 steers annually would have meant thal: inore
than 10% of the national herd increase were to be diverted to the ranch,
Moreover LLDP cattle buyers found themselves competing in the local market:s
with representatives of other cattle expansion programs, for instance th;se
implemented by the Veterinary Department and the Central Region Lakeshora
Development Project. Prior to 1973 only 1,030 cows and in-calf heifers amd
660 steers could be purchased over a period of 18 months, and this was
less than half of the appraisal estimaLtes of 1,500 cows and 1,000 steers
annually. During 1973 LLDP cattle buyers were more successful and managed



ANiEX 6
Page 4
to buy 970 cows and heifers and 1,040 feeders and young bulls. Although
the market situation was very tight, purcahse prices for cows exceeded
the appraisal estimate of MK 36 per head by only 10-20%, The prices paid
for steers and bulls exceeded estimates of MK 22 per head by 60-80%,
mainly because older animals were bought when no immature steers were
available. The slow expansion of the ranch herd resulted in a shortfall
of steers sold to the farmers. Up to May 1974 a total of nearly 1,500
steers were issued to stall fatteners, which is less than half the number
estimated at appraisal.
Pr        o
14.       Building-up of the Dzalanyama herd would continue through the
Project, but at a slower pace than originally estimated (Table 2). The
possibility of stocking the ranch with animals purchased in neighboring
countries has been examined but does not appear to be feasible because
of high prices, disease problems or transportation costs. In view of the
encouraging 1973 purchase record it is considered possible to buy locally
750 cows and in-calf heifers and 600 immature steers per annum. By 1979/80
the maximum number of 5,000 breeding cows would be reached and four years
thereafter the ranch would reach full development production level. Some
further investmen-s would be made during the Project, mainly for the
replacement of machinery and equipment and for the construction of
additional fencing.
15.       A stocking density of one animal unit for every 14 acres of the
ranch is considered feasible and would be reached at full development.
In the dambos (swamps) which make up about 20% of the ranch area, the
carrying capacity is about 2-3 times higher than in the natural forest
areas. Some thinning out of the latter would increase the grazing
possibilities without impeding its natural role as a watershed. Discuss-
ions between the Forestry Department and Project management should result
in a balanced policy on this matter.
16.       Particular attention would be given to the supply of minerals
and supplementary feeding of the animals. Salt and phosphate are essential
for all stock throughout the year.  A protein supplement in the form of
urea or maize germ is required for all breeding stock for a period of 4-5
months during the dry season in order to maintain acceptable weaning and
mortality rates.
17.       Upgrading of the herd would be achieved through bulls raised in
the Chitedze Experimental herd and purchased exotic bulls as well as through
artificial insemination. A satisfactory working arrangement exists between
the Chitedze Research Station and Project management with regard to the
experimental herd. The herd 1/ is stationed on the ranch and Project
1/   As of March 31, 1974, the Chitedze herd included 371 Zebu cows, 129
calves, 21 mature Zebu bulls and 38, 3-year Zebu bulls.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
management in return has the first choice of the male offspring of the herd.
To a certain extent the ranch would help relieve the shortage of half breed
dairy cattle through the use of Friesian bulls for artificial insemination.
18.       The ranch would continue to be managed by a qualified Ranch
Manager and an assistant manager. The Project Manager would have ovecirall
responsibility for the development of the ranch until the end of the
Project. Thereafter, the Veterinary Department would assume responsibility
for the ranch. In order to control predators which caused the death of
60 out of 110 animals lost in 1973, two game rangers would be employed
by the ranch.
19.       At full development the ranch would produce annually:
(a) About 1,700 ranch-bred steers to be sold to smallholders at
an age of about 30 months and a live weight of about 700 lbs.
During the first six years the majority of the steers would
however st:ill be Zebu types either purchased or ranch bred,
weighing about 100 lbs less.
(b) About 750 cull cows weighing about 650 lbs. Cows culled from
local purchases during the build-up period of the ranch are
assumed to, weigh 550 lbs.
(c) About 180 cull heifers and 40 cull bulls, weighing 550 lbs and
1,100 lbs respectively.
(d)  About 510 breeding heifers which could be a half-bred Friesizn
type suitalble for dairy development depending on the overall
demand and supply situation for this type of animal in the
country. If sufficient da-lry cattle would be available from
other sources the heifers could be fattened.
The cull animals produced by the ranch would be sold either to local bu.tchers
or the Malawi Cold Storage Company. Beef production from cull animals sold
by the ranch and froml stall feeders issued to the farmers would be about
620 short tons annually from 1984 onwards (see Table 3).

values for the different types of steers to be issued:
Purchased                                 MK 14.2
Ranch bred, Zebu type                     MK 17.3

The added values are net of feed costs; details are given in Table 5.
C. Dairying
Background
22.       In February 1973 Government decided to concentrate the development
of Malawi's dairy industry around the urban centers of Blantyre and Lilongwe.
It was decided that resources available for dairy development would be very
largely directed to areas within a 25 mile radius of the two towns. In support
of this policy a smallholder dairying scheme is included in the Project.
23.       With the help of a Danish loan, a new Capital Dairy and five collec-
ting centers with cooling facilities were built in the Lilongwe area in 1973/74.
The initial installed equipment of the dairy has a capacity of 2,000 gallons
of milk per day, but the dairy buildings have been designed to accommodate
equipment dealing with a daily throughput of 4,000 gallons. Based on supply,
demand and sales projections for milk the Veterinary Department estimates that
the additional equipment necessary to reach the 4,000 gallons per day level
would need to be installed in 1978. Out of the five collecting and cooling
centers, two have been constructed inside the LLDP area.



ANNEX 6
Page 7
24.       In 1973 liquid milk sales in Lilongwe averaged about 100 g.llons
per day, but the effective demand was projected at 600 gallons.  Demw. nd is ex-
pected to grow rapidly with the expansion of the new capital city, a:..d it is
estimated that by 1980 a market for about 3,000 gallons of milk per c.ay woul(d
be developed. Half of the sales would be in the form of 3.5% fat or sD-called
"high-income` milk and the remainder divided between 3% fat "middle-fnzome" and
2% fat "low income"r milk.
25.       The milk would be almost entirely supplied by smallholders, with orLly
small quantities to be produced by a modest Government dairy farm which is
presently being developed. Cross-breeding of local Zebu cows with imported
Friesians has been practiced successfully in Malawi during recent years. There
are only a limited number of cross--bred animals available, however, and the
number available from Government Expansion Centers is expected to rise rather
slowly from about 80 in 1974 to about 140 in 1982. It is therefore essential
that animals bred by artificial insemination in the traditional herds are broughlt
into the dairy scheme. The Dzalanyama Ranch offers a third possible source of
supply. The ranch started using artificial insemination on a limited scale in
1972 and has enlarged its program for the 1973 breeding season. A first batch
of heifers could be ready for issue in 1977, and some 100 and 150 animals
could be delivered in 1978 and 1979 respectivley. The issue of these animals
from the ranch would depend upon a counter balancing number of other female
Zebu stock being available as replacements for the ranch.
Poject Activities
26.       The number of dairy farms to be started inside the LLDP area .is tenta--
tively estimated at 15 during the first and second year (1975/76-1976/77)
and 30 during the third year of the Project. This assumes that half-breds wouLd
be available from the ranch, but takes no account of the success in en ouragine;
farmers to milk thei.r own heifers bred from artificial insemination. 'The Proj-
ect would provide credit to pay for up to two thirds of the initial capital
requirements (cows, buildings and equipment) including three months wovking
capital.  The amount of the loan would be 1K272 and the interest rate  0'K per
annum. Repayments would be made over a period of four years.
27.       Initially the smallholder would keep two half-bred Friesian (ows.
The half-bred can produce 400 gallons per lactation but requires a much hligher
standard of management. The system would be based on summer grazing arid winter
stall feeding of conserved hay and crop residues. Concentrate rations are based
largely on home produced crops with some purchased protein and minerals.  Where
land acreages are limnited, stall feeding all the year round may be neces£ary
and the labor input :Ln such a case would be greater.
28.       The farmers' capital requirements and the annual costs and re . v.rns
of a unit consisting of two half-bred dairy cows can be summarized as follows:

29.        Experience has shown that a two cow unit can be looked afti r by
the average family and that the labor requirement is somewhere in thi: range
of 130 to 160 man-days per year.  The net margin per acre of fooder (-rops is
higher than can be obtained from an acre of hybrid maize or groundnuts, but
sligntly less than from an acre of tobacco.  The margin from dairying would be
increased from .g107 to about KM165 per year for a two cow snit when three
quarter-bred Friesilans would be kept instead of half breds.
D. Poultry
Background
30.        Lilongwe has experienced regular egg shortages for a nunber of years
and demand is expected to grow rapidly with the expansion of the new capital
city. The results of a 1973 survey carried out by the Veterinary Department
suggest that the stpply of eggs to the town of Lilongwe was in the region of
750,000 to 1,000,000 eggs per year, while the demand was estimated at 2.5 to
3.5 million.  The annual demand is expected to rise to about 6.5 to 9 million
eggs in 1978.
31.        It is estimated that in 1973 about one half of the egg supplv for the
town of Lilongwe came from Bunda College and a few small comrmercial farms, while
some two to six thousand eggs were shipped every week from Blantyre to Lilongwe.
Local farmers were thought to bring only a few dozen eggs into town every week.
32.        Detailed proposals for a smallholder poultry project in the ientral
Region were drawn up by the Planning Unit in conjunction with the Department
of Ani.mal Ilealth and Industry in order to try to alleviate the supply Jproblem.
Local progressive smallholders would be encouraged to enter commercial egg
production along the sarae lines as the poultry project which has been X perated
successf lfly for a feBw years in the likolongwe area near Blantyre. A s;mall-
holder poultry enterprise would provide farmers with a regular income and can
be integrated into t le farming system.  The proposals were submitted tc 1:he
Britis'n Government and a Central Region poultry project for areas outside LLDP
is expected to start in 1974/75.  Similar proposals for poultry develor;:l.ent
inside LLDP would be implemented during the Project from  19751'76 onwardz_
Project Activities
33.        SoTme 40 new poultry farms would be established per year, each with
a battery cage laying unit of 96 hybrid birds,  Battery cage production has
been selected as this has been proved to give higher egg production and requi.re
lower feed consumption than other systems.  The type of bird used in th>. Proj-
ect would be an improved hybrid layer type.  At present the majority of the
chickens are imported but it is expected that existing Malawi hatcheriesb would
increase their capacity. Up to the age of 6 weeks the chickens would bR. 'kept



Page 10 
on the poultry farm of the Veterinary Department at Bweniba near L,longwe.
After delivery to the farmers the chickens would be raised uip to the point-of--
lay (age about 20 weeks) in rearing houses and subsequently be transferred to
the laying cages.  The cages must now be imported, but the possibility of local
production by rural craftsmen trained at the Rural Trade School (in Salima) is
being explored.  The Grain and Milling Company at Blantyre supplies feedstuffs
for other poultry enterprises and would do so for the LLDP poultry project as
well.
34.       Participating farmers would be selected from within a 5 mile radius
of the milk collection points, which would also be used for egg collection.
The farmers would transport their eggs to these points and the eggs would then
be transported by the milk lorry to the department grading center at Bwemba.
Since the farmers would have considerable difficulty in disposing of 80 to 90
birds at the end of the laying cycle, processing facilities for cull hens would
have to be set up when the project starts. The Cold Storage Company has ex-
pressed its willingness to assist in this matter and facilities could probably
be set up at Bwemba adjacent to the Company's Lilongwe abattoir. Marketinig of
the hens would not present a problem since it is estimated that a minimum of
2,000 extra table birds are required weekly in order to meet the present demand
in the main townshitps of Malawi.
35.       The Project would provide extension services and credit facilities
to the farmers. Credit would be given from the LLDP credit fund in the form
of two loans. The first loan would finance the initial capital requirements
excluding the costs of labor and materials which are locally available. The
estimated amount of the capital loan is MK263 with an interest of 10% per annumA
and to be repaid over three laying cycles.  The second loan would provide work-
ing capital for the cost of a batch of pullets and the rearing feed.  The amount
of the loan is estimated at NK154 with an interest change of 15% and repayment
over a single egg laying cycle (60 weeks).  It is assumed that the working cap-
ital loan would be given over four egg laying cycles, after which the farmer
would have saved sufficient capital to be self-financing. Repayments for both
loans would be made by deductions from egg sales to the egg marketing organ-
ization.
36.       It is assumed that the farmers would follow a 60 week production cy-
cle. The bilrds will be in the laying unit from age 20 weeks to age 76 weeks
and the cages would then remain empty for 4 weeks for cleaning. The production
cycle includes a concurrent 14 week rearing period from age 6 weeks to age 20
weeks for the following batch of layers.  The farmer's capital requirements and
the costS and returns per production cycle can be stmnarized as follows:

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Health
Background
1.        As in nearly all Africa countries, Malawi's medical services are
poor by European or American standards. As this is very much a result of
shortage of money and trained manpower, it is merely another index of under-
development.  This problem affects all regions of the country in varying
degrees. Malaria, bilharzia, respiratory infections, measles, parasitic
infections, and tuberculosis take a heavy toll of human life.
2.        In recognition of this need, Malawi Government accepted, with
minor modifications, the recommendations of a World Health Organization (WHO)
Health Planning Team which visited Malawi in 1971. This plan proposed a
hierarchy of units constituting a Health Unit, with the higher units super-
vising the lower, and the lower referring patients to the higher. Each Health
Unit, serving a population of 50,000, would consist of the following at full
development:
1 Primary Health Center
4 Health Sub-centers
20 Health Posts
The WHO report obserives that most of the services proposed were already offered
by existing health Uniits, but in a fragmentary fashion with incomplete coverage.
It emphasizes the need for integration of services at each location, an, the
importance of a structure permitting supervision and referral. Recogni2ing
that the basis for comprehensive care already existed, the report reconmlended
that existing units should be regraded and improved where necessary to fit:
into the overall structure of basic health services. While adhering to the
basic principles of the WHO recommendations, it has been found necessary Jn
the interests of ecornomy to make some deletions in these proposals from tiLe
ideal staffing pattern. No provision is therefore made for posts of Health
Inspector at Primary Health Centers, or of Homecraft Worker at Sub-centers
and Health Posts.
Health Unit Descriptions
3.  A.  Previous Structure:
(a)  District Hospital - The main Ministry of Health hospital in an
administrative district, with a medical officer in charge.
Usually has 50-150 beds, operating theatre, X-ray and laboratory.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(b)  RrlHosital - Smaller Ministry of Health hospital, with a
clinical officer in charge. Usually has 20-30 beds in male,
female and maternity wards, but lacks theatre and X-ray.
In future planning, most Rural Hospitals will be graded as
Primary Health Centers, see below.
(c)  Mission Hospital - Range comprises both the above (and
sometimes a smaller unit with beds). Mission Hospitals
fall outside the structure of Ministry of Health types, and
operate with substantial independence.
(d) Dispensary - (Government units have been recently retitled
Rural Health Centers). A unit providing simple outpatient
treatment given usually by a Medical Assistant. Most now
also provide a regular under-five clinic.
(e) Maternity Unit - A unit providing beds for lying-in mothers
and a delivery room under the care of an auxiliary midwife.
Some units also provide ante-natal care and under-fives
clinics.
B. Structure Proposed by WHO Report
(a)  DitictHosital - As above, District Hospital will also
act as the Primary Health Center for the local area, but
require additional staff to carry out the necessary super-
vision.
(b) Primary Health Center - The Primary Health Center is at the
apex of the basic health services structure. As an indepen-
dent unit, it has 16 beds (10 maternity, 6 holding beds)
and a staff consisting of:
1 Clinical Officer
1 Registered Nurse
1 Health Inspector
1 Medical Assistant
2 Enrolled Nurse/midwives
1 Laboratory Assistant
1 Driver
3 Servants
In addition to providing services identical to those of the sub-
center in its immediate locality, it is staffed to provide
referral and supervisory services to the sub-centers and
health Posts within its jurisdiction, an area containing
50,000 population.



ANNEX 7"
Page 3
(c) Health Sub-center - The Sub-center is the basic unit of the
system at which curative and preventive services are in(:egrated.
It is designed to serve a population of 10,000 with outpatient
treatment, under-fives clinics, ante-natal care and delivery
service, health education and communicable disease control
measures, provided by a staff consisting of:
1 Medical Assistant
1 Enrolled Nurse/midwife
1 Health Assistant
1 Homecraft Worker
2 Servants
The first three of these staff constitute the clinic team
which visits the health posts to provide a weekly clinic
and to supervise the Homecraft Worker.
(d)  Health Posts - The Health Post is the smallest unit in the
structure, serving a population of 2,000 in its immediate
locality. It consists of a house for the Homecraft Worker,
with an extended shelter for teaching and holding the weekly
clinic. The Homecraft Worker provides health education,
particularly in nutrition, child care and home hygiene, does
home visiting, and assists with the weekly clinic. She has
simple remedies to treat minor illnesses and injury on a
firstaLd basis. Some health posts are unmanned.
(e) Health Unit - The WHO recommendations for planning basic
health services are based on a Health Unit serving a pop-
ulationi of 50,000. Each Health Unit at full development
will consist of:
1 Primary Health Center        1:50,000  population
4  Health Sub-centers           1:10,000  population
20 Health Posts                 1:2,000   population
Note: The Primary Health Center provides the Sub-center
services to the adjacent 10,000 population. The
Primary Health Center and 4 sub-centers provide thc
Home Craft Worker Service to the adjacent 2,000
population.
4.        The WHO plan of health services, modified to suit local ccaditions
and the funds available, are already in operation in the Karonga and. Lower
Shire project areas and are being financed by German Church Organizations in
the Salima Project Area. The health services available in LLDP area are not
very different frcm those obtainable in these other areas, yet the W1lC scheme
of services have not been extended to this area until now. Likuni hospital
(one of the largest in the LLDP area) reported that a quarter of all cases



Page 4
referred to the hospital doctor or laboratory showed evidence of malaria,
bilharzia or lhookworm.  It is clear that here, as in other parts of the
country, a shift of emphasis from curative to preventive medical services can
reduce the incidence of some of the more prevalent diseases.
Health Services in the LLDP Area
5.        As elsa-where in Malawi, health services in the Program area are
provided by a combination of the Ministry of Health, Missions, and the
District Council. The full list is as follows:
Location and Type                                OnrhiR
Likuni Hospital (160 beds"                       Mission
Namitete Hospital  M130 beds)                    Mission
Nambuma Hospital (50 beds)                       Mission
Mlali Hospital (74 beds)                         Mission
Malingunde HosDital (50 beds)                    Mission
Kabadula Rural liospital (32 beds)               Ministry of Health
Nitundu Rural. Hospital (26 beds)                Ministry of Health
C"hitedza Disper-Sary                           Ministry of Health
Chileka Dispensery                               Minis try of Health
Nathenje Dispensary                              Ministry of Health
Kongoni Dispensary and Maternity                 District Council
Malawi PYP Settlement Scheme                     Ministry of Health
Bunda College Dispensary                         University of Malawi
Just outside the Program area are:
Lilongwe General Hospital (250 Beds)             Ministry of Health
Kawale Dispensary, Old Lilongwe                  Ministry of Health
Area 18 Dispensary, New Lilongwe                 Ministry of Health
Dzenza Dispensary                                Mission
In addition to the above, there are a number of unmanned health posts, at
which mobile clinic services are given.  The Lilongwe District Council has
plans to build maternity services at Units 4, 22, 30 and 33 before 1975.
Total bed provision in the area (even without taking account of Lilongwe
General Hospital, just outside the program area) is close to the national
average at 1.33 per thousand population, but the number of units relative
to the population is clearly sparse, at 1:30,000 distinctly inferior to
the national average of 1:20,000.
IrOveaments to Basic Health Services
It has been decided that for purposes of local government administra-
tion,  the program area should be divided into six sub-areas, each composed of
a cluster of agricultural units.  Although the population of each of these
sub-areas wil lverarae rather more than 50,000, it has been decided that the



ANNEX 7
Page 5
health units should coincide with their boundaries. In 5 of the 6 subdivisions,
there is an existing health facility which could function as a Primary Health
Center, though in only one case will this be located at the main service
center of the Sub-area. The remaining agricultural units, each with a popu-
lation of 10,000 - 12,000, would all merit a Health Sub-center. It is inot
practicable to make good all the accumulated deficiencies in one phase of the
program, and it is therefore proposed that a limited number of new sub-centers
should be built at selected unit centers at this stage, and that unmanned
mobile clinic posts should be established at all the remaining units. At a
later stage, these iFacilities could be upgraded to Sub-center status. Jn the
interim, every unit would have a health service of some kind.
Aided Self-Help
7.        Although health services have not hitherto been a direct responsi-
bility of the program, the stimulus to development exerted by the program has
been evident in the health sector. There has been a quite spontaneous demand
for more accessible services in the program area, especially under fives
clinics. Further, in virtually every unit already taken over by the program,
the local community has started to raise funds for self-help construction of
health facilities. Although self-help activity by its very nature is diffi-
cult to coordinate, it is clear that the tremendous fund of enthusiasm behind
the self-help effort to improve health facilities cannot be ignored; it has
to be channelled into manageable projects which are consistent with overall
planning for the area. The present proposals attempt to take account of
these considerations. It is suggested that in every unit where a Health
Post is to be established, the local community should be encouraged to con-
tribute money, bricks and sand, and inskilled labor; the program building
team will provide materials, supervision and skilled labor. The necessary
liaison between the self help group and the building team will be provided
by the program's Rural Development Section. The additional resources c3ntributecl
by the self-help groups should be used to enhance the basic building. tn those
units where a new Primary Health Center or Sub-center is to be built, it is
proposed that the self-help contribution should be channelled into the :c'n-
struction of shelters for patients and their guardians.
Project Proposals
8.        It is proposed to provide, either through upgrading of existinig
facilities or by entirely new construction, one new sub-center and threi:
new Health Posts in the North West sub-area; two new subcenters and foul
additional Ilealth Posts in the North East sub-area; one new Sub-center .nd
five new Hlealth Posts in the West; one new Sub-center and four new Healt.h
Posts in the Central Sub-area; three new Health Posts in the South West,
and one new Sub-center and two new Health Posts in the South East. In
addition to new buildings, most of the existing facilities will be imprcved,
while the Project will finance staff and other operating costs during the
3-year Project period.  Present health facilities, Project proposals and i:he
post-Project situationi are all summarized in the following table:

ANNEX 10

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Administration of LLDP After the Project
1.        This Annex discusses four questions, viz:
(a) the continued provision of farmer services (e.g. fertilizer,
seed, credit and extension service) in the LLDP area after
the Project;
(b) the likely continuing cost of these services;
(c) arrangements for financing that cost; and -
(d) the future of the program administration, management
and staff after the project.
2.        The LLDP area is expected to achieve its maximum potential produc-
tion under present technology around 1985/86. For this to happen, it is
necessary to maintaini the extension service and supply of seasonal inputs
introduced by the program. Malawi Government has put forward a series of
proposals as to how this work could be carried out.  They envisage that the
unit centers, extension services, the Dzalanyama ranch, egg and milk produic-
tion, and the evaluation unit would all be operated directly by MANR. Eloads
would be maintained by the Ministry of Works, and boreholes by the local
authorities (which would employ the Geological Survey Department for this
purpose).  ADMARC would maintain their input stores and produce buying markets,
while the Malawi Ministry of Health would maintain the health facilities.
The only program component not yet provide for is the adminsitration of 31lall-
holder credit, but it is expected that proposals with regard to this asp Bct
of the program would be presented to the Association no later than April 1,
1976 as part of final comprehensive proposals dealing with post-program
administration (paragraph 4.20).
3.        It is expected that these services would cost the Malawi Goveriment
at constant prices about MK 750,000 a year in operating and equipment reildace-
ment costs.  Another IV 90,000Q  a year would be required to finance the rHcur-
rent costs of the health facilities.  In addition, the credit fund for farmers
would need to be boosted by a total of about MK 500,000 to cope with the input
requirements at full production. Government is fully aware of these cosw:s and
would arrange for thei'r financing. Government cash flow statements for the
Project and Program (Annex 14) show that both generate more than enough (oavern-
ment revenue to finance these costs without difficulty.



ANNEX 1 0
Page 2
4.        Some of the present program staff are likely to be required in
Lilongwe to maintain the services discussed above. Those who are not so
required would be either reabsorbed by the MANR or else reassigned to other
projects and activities in the country where their Lilongwe experience is
expected to prove valuable.

ANNEX  1

MALAWI
LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Smallholder Crop Marketing and Prices
The main crops marketed in the Lilongwe area are maize, tobacco
and groundnuts; there are insignificant quanties of sweet potatoes and beans
grown primarily for subsistence. In theory, LLDP farmers can dispose of
their produce through private traders, the Lilongwe produce market, informal
markets or barter, or through the Agricultural Development and Marketing
Corporation (ADMARC).  In practice, however, because licensed traders are
excluded from the LLDP area, and the Lilongwe produce market is remote, most
LLDP farmers dispose of their surplus produce through:
(a) sale and barter among other farmers and sales to unlicensed
traders; and
(b) sales to institutional buyers for either local processing
and distribution or for export.
Sale and Barter Among Farmers and Traders
2.        It is extremely difficult to gauge the amount of produce disposed
of by barter or through unlicensed traders. No records of such sales exist,
and attempts to deduce the size by subtracting institutional sales from
estimated total production run up against the problem that estimates of the
total production may be wildly off the mark, and records of sales to institu-
tions are only a little less so. In spite of the paucity of records, there
are many reasons to believe that a considerable quantity of smallholders'
surplus produce (perhaps the bulk of it) is sold to non-institutional buyers.
For example, a large discrepancy exists between quantities of smallholder
production recorded by the LLDP Evaluation Unit and the quantities purchased
by either LLDP itself or by ADMARC. The discrepancy seems too large to be
accounted for simply by increased subsistance consumption. Moreover, private
traders are known to have been paying higher prices for maize than ADMARC -
a situation which encourages sales to such traders rather than ADMARC.
Furthermore, significant quantities of maize may have been exported to Zambia
where they earn higher prices through sources other than AD,-MRC.
P,nDP Maize TeilThg ?ogram
3.        fn cr-.ei to encourage farmiers to sell their maize early and avoid
rodent or weevil danmage, LLDP has been operating a maize shelling program
available to ai1 farm;ers in the LLDP area. In providing this service LLDP
was acting as a licersed trader. In addition to shelling and transporting



ANN'N 11
Page 2
maize for the farmer, LLDP pays a price of MK 2.70 tambala per bag, which
until the recent (August 1974) increase in ADMARC's official price for maize,
was 8% higher than the ADMARC price.
ADMARC
4.        Apart from LLDP itself, the only organization directly invcllved in
the marketing of stnallholders' crop is ADMARC. Established in 1971 by the
Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation Act, ADMARC must purchase
"all cotton and tobacco grown on customary land or public land as it may, in
its discretion, consider marketable". 1/ The Act also gives ADMARC the right
to purchase all produce grown on customary land. In interpreting this latter
power, ADMARC regards itself only as a residual buyer of smallholder produce,
buying only what the farmers choose to market through it. ADMARC maintains
about 52 main storage depots or markets, supplemented by over 700 produce
buying markets throughout the country. Within the LLDP area, as of December
1973, ADMARC had about 55 permanent and 34 temporary markets.
5.        ADMARC is independent in its day to day management, but its overall
policy is controlled by the Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources
who also appoints its Board of Directors. In addition to produce marketing,
ADMARC supplies fertilizer, seed and agricultural equipment to smallholders.
It also maintains a price stabilization fund designed to enable it to main-
tain smallholder prices in the face of falling world commodity prices,
and a food reserve (usually about 7% of the annual maize crop) to meet
possible food shortages.  Finally ADMARC operates groundnut and tobacco
grading centers, andi runs seed production farms.
6.        It is clear that ADMARC's efficiencv, willingness to work in i:he
interest of smallho:Lders, and financial viability are crucial for the stuccess
of LLDP. ADMARC is forbidden by its enabling Act (Section 3) from sell;-ng
any produce at a loss, save bv special Ministerial authority in the case of
food items sold  wit:hin Malawi; in that case any losses are to be reinr-wrsed
bv Government out of public funds.
7.        Since 1969 ADMARC has made profits from each year's crop tratling,
ranging from a minimum of MY152,000 in 1969 to a maximum of MK8.7 mill:-on in
1972. Latest available audited accounts are as of March 31, 1973, and they
show that in the year then ended ADMARC made a net profit of MK6.3 million,
all of which was transferred to reserves.  ADMARC's crop trading accourts
and accounting ratios for 1966 to 1972/73 are given in Tables 1 and 2. Its
profit and loss account for the vear ended March 31, 1973 and its balarca
sheet as at that date are in Tables 3 and 4 respectively.

8.        Under the Project ADMARC would continue to market all LLDP small-
holder tobacco, together with any other crops which program farmers sell to
it as long as such crops are within ADMARC's official list of commodities
(Table 5).
Crop Grading
9.        Of the three main LLDP crops - maize, groundnuts and tobacco - only
maize is purchased by ADMARC on an ungraded basis. It must, however, be
shelled before marketing, must be clean and free from weevil, rodent or mould
damage, and must have a moisture content of 12% or less. ADMARC pays 1.75
tambala per lb for maize of this quality. Groundnuts, which must also be
shelled before sale to ADMARC, are bought in three grades - Grade A which are
large whole nuts, Grade B which are smaller whole nuts and Grade X which are
neither A nor B. There are considerable price differentials for the various
grades of nuts (see Table 5). Tobacco is graded into eight different categor-
ies; included in the many factors which determine tobacco grade are the length
and breadth of the leaves, how properly they have been cured, and whether or
not they are spotted. The eight grades of tobacco and the prices ADMARC pays
for them are listed in Table 5.
Tobacco Quota
10.       Tobacco is the only LLDP crop sold under quota.  The quotas are issued
by ADMARC market supervisors on the basis of lists of recommended farmers sub-
mitted by LLDP unit development officers. The average quota is 500-600 lbs
per grower. Market supervisors issue about twice the quantity of seed required
to produce this quota, thus ensuring that even under poor germination and grow-
ing conditions the quota would still be met.
Transportation
11.       All produce intended for sale to ADMARC has to be transported to the
ADMARC depots by the farmer. Of LLDP farmers, about 407 transport their pro-
duce from the farm by ox cart, about 32% on foot, about 16% rely on the LLDP
maize shelling program, and about 5% use bicycles; the rest use other means,
including group hire of lorries. Since only about 8% of LLDP farmers own
ox carts, there is obviously a lot of hiring out or lending of ox carts.
The ox-training program initiated under the LLDP would be continued during
the Project so as to enable as many farmers as can afford them to buy and
operate their own ox carts. Once produce is delivered to ADMARC depots,
it then enters the national transportation system. Most of it goes south
either directly by road (Lilongwe to Blantyre/Limbe) or by lorry to Salima
and thence by rail to Blantyre/Limbe. Some also goes by road and rail to
Rhodesia, South Africa and Zambia.



ANNEX 11

Storage
12.       SmalJl.olders store their maize and other crops in large -ylindrical
cribs made from interwoven twigs, bamboo or reeds and raised on stilts some!
18" above the ground. Some of the cribs are covered with mud to p.ctect tae.
contents more ef'fectively from rodents and insects. The cribs are known as
"nkhokwe" in Malawi. The LLDP Evaluation Unit estimated that storige losses
(due largely to moulds, especially the fungus Diplodia) averaged about 5% to
6% during 1968/69. However, informed opinion in Malawi puts the average
annual loss nearer 10%.
13.       ADMARC's main storage capacity - about 30,000 tons - is located at
the Lilongwe Depot. One half of this capacity is under cover. Produce, partic-
ularly maize, can be stored for a year or more until a market can be found.
Tobacco and groundnuts are, however, as a rule shipped out fairly rapidly.
ADMARC storage losses are infinitesimal, and generally average less than 1%.
Storage premises are sprayed before crops are moved in and fumigated if
insects are later discovered.
Exports
14.       Exports of unmanufactured tobacco and groundnuts have been consist-
ent, averaging in value MK12.3 million and MK4.4 million respectively over the
period 1964 to 1971. Maize exports fluctuate widely, with the marketed surlplus
drying up completely in years of poor harvest. ADMARC undertakes practically
all exports of crops, especially smallholder crops. Tobacco is auctioned at
Limbe before being exported, but groundnuts may pass directly into export chan-
nels. The principal export route is by rail to the Mozambique ports of Nacala
and Beira, although there are also road and rail exports to Rhodesia,, South
Africa and Zambia. Malawi's exports of maize and groundnuts for 1966 to 1972
are listed by colntry of destination in Tables 6 and 7. Tobacco exports are
listed by type in Table 8.
Price DeterminatiLon
15.       Prices paid to the farmer at ADMARC markets for maize, groundnuts
and tobacco are fixed by ADMARC with the twin aim of ensuring a reasonable
return to the fanmer, while enabling ADMARC to earn surpluses to support
national development programs. All ADMARC prices have to be approv,ld by the
Minister for Agriculture and Natural Resources. A comparison of official
prices for 1973 with those for 1974 is given in Table 5.
16.       Prices obtained for exports are determined largely by the wDrld
market situation at the time of contract. Maize is sold on individt.al con-
tracts. Representatives of international tobacco buyers bid at the new
tobacco auctions in Limbe, while groundnuts are sold by forward conitract
directly to confectionery manufacturers, mainly in England.



ANNEX 1 1
P age 5
17.       There is undoubtedly a good international market, and the future
market outlook is bright for all three crops produced at LLDP. Moreover,
Malawi does not produce enough of any of them to make an impact on world prices.
All their prices have gone up considerably between 1973 and 1974. However, it
is difficult to project movements in world prices of LLDP products from the
general trend of wcr16 prices in similar products widely traded by other coun-
tries. This is dzae to the fact that of the three products, only dark-fired
tobacco is directly comparable to dark-fired tobacco produced elsewhere. LLDP
groundnuts are mainly chalimbana - a confectionery type whose market and prices
are quite distirnt from the Nigerian oil-producing groundnut usually quoted in
international zrice lists. Similarly, while nearly all internationa:L grain
price lists quote the price of US yellow maize, few if any give the price of
the white flint variety found in Malawi (and also South Africa/Rhodesia).
International prices of these imperfect substitutes are therefore not a true
guide to likely movements in the world prices of LLDP products, although major
long-term trends may be the same, especially for maize. In January to June
1972, while the average UK c.i.f. price for South African white maize (similar
to Malawi's) was MK45.2 per short ton, the comparable price of USA No. 3 Yellow
maize was MK4C.8. If that differential is maintained, the price of Malawi
maize in 1974 using the IBRD Commodities Forecast should be MK132.9 per metric
ton. ADMARC estimated that the average c.i.f. UK price for Malawi chalimbana
groundnuts in 1973/74 should be about MK314 per short ton.  The export price
for Northern Division dark-fired tobacco (the type grown at LLDP) was estimated
by ADMARC at about 38 tambala per lb f.o.b. Limbe. The relationship between
Malawi farmgate prices employed in calculating the internal economic rate of
return and the world prices is fully described in Annex 15.

Groundnuts are a far from uniform commodity, and the first
necessary distinction is between nuts grown primarily for their high
oil content, and those of a confectionery type, which normally are lower
in oil content. Malawi Chalimbana-type groundnuts normally earn a
premium over Nigerian HPS (hand-picked and selected) nuts, but are of
lower value than South African Natal nuts. The table below shows recent
prices for Nigerian and South African nuts with probable figures for
Malawi for Chlimbana if they had been sold on the world market at that time.
In practice, the bulk of Malawi's groundnuts are sold on long-term con-
tract and the average actual prices obtained in 1972 were less than the
ftgures shown below.

LILONGWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Beef, Milk and Egg Marketing and Prices
Beef
1.        Most of Malawi's 560,000 cattle are kept in village herds on custom-
ary land more as a store of wealth than as a source of immediate income. Na-
tional beef consumption, estimated at 8,500 short tons in 1972, is expected
to increase rapidly with population and income growth in the future. Beef
consumption in Malawi from 1966 to 1972 was as follows:
Year      Slaughters /1        Imports         Exports       Consumption
1966         6,199                99               5             6,293
1967         7,474               128              31             7,571
1968         7,938                85               -             8,023
1969         8,149               188               -             8,337
1970         8,203               178               -             8,381
1971         8,094               243               -             8,337
1972         8,066               431               -             8,497
/1   Converted at 292 lb. CDW per carcass.
Malawi is, therefore, a net importer of beef. Domestic beef supplies are
expected to increase from about 9,000 short tons in 1975 to about 14,000 short
tons in 1985.
2.        The Cold Storage Company Limited (CSC).  CSC, a limited liability
company owned wholly by the Malawi Development Corporation (a parastatal),
operates abbatoirs in two main urban centers, Blantyre and Lilongwe. In 1973,
the combined throughput of the two abattoirs was 12,194 cattle plus 4,687 pigs
and small numbers of sheep and goats. A similar number of cattle were slaught-
ered in 1973. This means that approximately 22% of all cattle slaughtered in
Malawi are processed under modern hygienic conditions. CSC operates below its
full slaughtering capacity because of shortage of slaughter stock. To encour-
age farmers to take advantage of its modern facilities, it slaughters cattle
for them at MK4 per animal - a charge which does not fully cover the cost.
3.        LLDP Cattle.  The national cattle and beef situation and attitudes
described above are reflected in the LLDP area.  Many program farmers buy cattle
as an investment, although an increasing number now fatten steers for sale to



ANNEX 12
Page 2
CSC. The abattoir at Lilongwe provides slaughtering senrices, and CSC provides
full marketing services to those farmers interested in selling their cattle
for slaughtering. There are really three groups of cattle produce-s in LLDh
area:
(a) the Dzalanyama Ranch;
(b) smallholders involved in the stallfeeding scheme (Annex 6) and;
(c) village herdsmen.
The Dzalanyama ranch supplies most of its steers on credit to smallholders for
stall fattening at prices designed more to encourage smallholders than to
cover all ranch costs. Since the demand for the steers far exceeds the supply
at current prices, the ranch has no marketing problem in this respect. After
fattening steers for about 6 months, the farmers sell them to CSC for slaught-
tering.
4.        It is clear from the above discussion that CSC is the main outlet
for beef cattle in the LLDP area. Beef production from the ranch and stall
feeder operation is projected to increase from 207 short tons in 1975/76 to
620 short tons in 1985/86. Beef production from the village herd is expected
to increase from 1,069 to 1,744 short tons. No difficulty is envisaged in dis-'
posing of the beef which would be mainly of exportable quality.  Full details
of projected beef production are in Annex 6.
5.        As of July 15, 1974 CSC's official beef buying prices ranged from
15 tambala per lb for commercial grade to 24 tambala per lb for choice grade.
CSC, which is also responsible for beef import and distribution, markets its
beef on a profit-rnaking basis.  Although both buying prices (from smallholders)
and selling prices are subject to Ministerial approval, CSC made a prcofit
before tax of MK380,000 in 1973, (MK64,000 in 1972).  CSC appears to he an
efficient organization operating from a position of financial streng :h. It
should be able to continue to provide satisfactory marketing facilit:es for
all beef to be produced within LLDP during the Project.  CSC Profit :nd Loss
Account and Balance Sheet as at December 31, 1973, are shown in Tabl,.>s 1 and 2.
Milk
6.        There is a large unsatisfied effective demand for milk in blalawi.
The country imports and consumes large quantities of milk powder each rear.
Wlile effective demand for fresh milk in the Lilongwe area is projectedl at
about 600 gallons per day, production and sales in 1973 averaged only cabout
100 gallons per day.  Demand is expected to grow rapidly, reaching abuiLt 3,000
gallons per day in 1980.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
7.        Almost all the milk is produced by smallholders.  It is processed in
a new Danish-financed dairy near Lilongwe, which is now operating well below
its full capacity of 2,000 gallons a day (with provision for doubling the hand-
ling capacity to about 4,000 gallons a day by 1978).
8.        There is a well-established milk run and future dairy farmers would
live within reasonable walking distance of the established milk-collecting cen-
ters. There will clearly be no difficulty in marketing the incremental annual
output of 40,000 gallons of milk (110 gallons a day) to be produced as a result
of the Project. The farmer is expected to get a price of about 32t per gallon
which, although it is below the import substitution price, allows for the trans-
portation, processing and marketing costs incurred by the dairy, and still as-
sures the farmer a handsome profit. Culled animals would be sold to CSC for
slaughter.
Eggs
9.        A 1973 Mialawi Veterinary Department Survey estimated that the effec-
tive demand for eggs in the town of Lilongwe was about 2.5 million to 3.5 mil-
lion a year, while production was only about 750,000 to 1 million per year.
By 1978 demand is expected to reach 6,5 million to 9 million eggs. There is
thus a large gap which the Project will help to close, as farmers are ex-
pected to produce an increrental 1.2 million eggs a vear at full development.
In view of the nrojected effective demand, the projected outnot is not expected
to have any appreciable effect on Prices. Farmers would be paid an estimated
average nrice of about 40 tamrhala per dozen.
10.       LLDP poultrv farmers, would live within 5 miles of the existing milk
collecting sheds, and their eggs would be collected from these sheds bv repre-
sentatives of the Department of Animal Health and Industrv which nlreadv oper-
ates egg grading and bulking facilities.  During the Project an egg marketing
board would be established wrhich would buy all. the eggs from program farmers
and others, grade, bulk and market then.  Fach farmer is exnected to have 80 to
90 cull birds at the end of each egg laving cvcle (60 weeks). The chickens
would be sold to CSC which has nromised to cooPerate in disposing of these
chickens. This should create no problem, as it is estimated that about 2,000
extra table birds are required weeklv to meet nresent chicken shortages in the
urban centers of Malawi.  For a full discussion of the noultry, dairving and
livestock components, see Annex 6. Calculations of estimated economic net
benefits from poultry and dairvinle are in Annex 15, Tables 6 and 7.

ANNEX 1 3

MALAWI
LILONGIWE LAND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Farm Budge:s
1.        The benefits which typical farmers in the LLDP area would
expect to receive from cZops alone duri.g the Project are discussed
below, Benefits from. beef production.  dairyi'g and poultry are discussed
in Annex 12.
2. 4A f             aer's i ncome from crops -would depend, inter alia, on:
(a)  his cropping pattern;
(b)  the extent to which he applied ferti-lizer, improved seeds
and other Project inputs;
(c)  his skill as a farmer and response to extension advice; and
(d)  climatic and other external factors over which the farmer
has no control,
Although there are numerous possible combinations of the above factors, four
typical farm budgets have been prepared.
(a)  a 4.5 acre farm with sonie tobacco;
(b)  a 4.5 acre farn. withou- tobacco;
(c) a 2.5 acre faTm; and
(d) an 8-acre farm.
It is believed that about  O% of the farmers in the LLDP faJl in categtrries (a)
and (b), with some 25"- in category (c) and another 10'% or so owning ar:und
8 acres or more (category (d)).  The use of the farm size as the criteAion of
income reflects the positive correlation in LLDP between farm size, sk:ill,
and response to modern technology.  The aggregate production estimates f Dr
the Project assume that 25%' of farmers in the LLDP area are unlikelv tc: apply
modern inputs compared with 15° assumed in the Phase II appraisal repol:t.
Similarly, the vields and speed of adoption (8 years instead of 5 years) are
more conservatively estimated in this report than previouslv. These rcvLsed
estimates are based on experience at LLDP over the last six years.
3.        Tables 3 to 6 of this Annex show that a typical fanner with c 1.5
acre farm combining maize, groundnuts and tobacco in the proportions s1 zwn
in Table 4, would improve his income from K1Ol without the Project to K142
over three years. The same farmer without tobacco, would increase his iricome
from K88 to K130 in the same period. A 2.5 acre farner would be unlikcly to
grow tobacco because of its small size and concentrating on growing loc:1J.
variety maize for food would over 3 years increase his income from K48 Fc, K69



ANNEX 13
Page 2
per vear. A typical S acre farmer would be expected to increase his income
from K179 per year to K263 per year over the same period. All the above in-
conies include subsistence.
4.        Yield assumptions are shown inl the farm budgets and projected farm-
gate prices for maize, groundnuts, tobacco and sulphur dust are detailed in
the footnote in Table 1. Fertilizer costs have been projected in accordance
with the IBRD commodity price index at constant prices, the 1974/75 price
being 150%1 of the 1973/74 price.  Although minor increases in seed prices
could occur, no such changes have been included in the projections as their
effect on incomes would be negligible. An exception was made for maize seed
retained from own production, which has been valued at the official price of
1.75 tambala per lb.
5.        Recent extraordir.ary increases in the prices of all chemical
fertilizers have raised doubts about the profitability of applying
fertillizer to maize and tobacco. For the 1974/75 growing season, the
most commonly used fertilizers at LLDP, Calcium Ammonium Nitrate 26%
and Compound 20.2a00 are expected to cost about two and a half times that of
the previous season. In addition, there was some uncertainty whether suffi-
cient quantities would be available to satisfy the projected requirements.
Malawi Government has rejected a fertilizer subsidy for smallholders because
it fears, with reason, that subsidized fertilizers would be illegally ex-
ported to neighboring countries or sold on the black market to private estates.
Instead, the Government intends to compensate the farmers as far as possible
through higher produce prices.
6.        As a first consequence of this policy, the farmgate price for
shelled maize was raised in July 1974 from MK 25 to MK 35 per short ton.
Table 1 shows that this increase effectively compensates for the expected
cost increases for fertilized maize while at the same time increasing
the margin per acre of non-fertilized maize by about 40%. No price
changes were announced for tobacco up to August 1974. The production and
cost filgures presented in Table 1 suggest that a tobacco price increase of
about 15% would be required to offset the effects of a 150% price increase
for fertilizers. While Table t shows margins per acre if fertilizer prices
were to be pegged at MK 9 per bag, Table 2 shows how these margins would im-
prove if fertilizer prices were to decline in the long run, as .s projected
in the IBRD commodity price index.
7.        Results of surveys carried out in different parts of Malawi have
been used to estimate the labor requirements for crop cultivation on an
average farm with 4.5 acres. Required man days for the different crops over
twelve months is as follows:

It is further assumed that an average family can work a maximum of
50 man days per month, divided as follows:
Man             25
Wife            17
Children         8
50
A comparison of the labor requirements with the availability of family
labor suggests that an average farm family on an average holding can
cope with the workload all year round without outside help. They woulk
however be fully occupied during the main planting and harvesting pericds,
respectively November/January and April/May. For the average farmer per
man/day at projected prices would be 65 tambala for maize, 37 tambales
for groundnuts and 18 tambala for tobacco. A comparison of these retulns
with the income per acre shown in Table 1 (which favours groundnuts) hel?s
to explain why farmers have in the past shifted their attention from
groundnuts to maize. Government keeps all farmgate prices under constElni:
review, to ensure sufficient incentive to farmers and has raised the prices
of both maize and groundnuts during 1973/74. This system of adjusting
prices to serve the objectives of Government policy is expected to con-
tinue.

LILONGCWE  AND DEVEL.OPMENT PROGRAM - PHASE III
Economic Costs and Benefits
1.        Tables 1 through 5 detail the costs and benefits used in calculat-
ing the Internal 1Economic Rate of Return (IER) from the Project and program.
2.        Incremental economic costs consist of the following:
(a) fixed asset costs;
(b) incremental farm inputs, which are substituted here for
the incremental credit fund included in the financial
project cost;
(c) operating costs of Project headquarters, extension service
and similar services to be continuied by the 'Malawi Govern-
ment after the ProJect and program neriod;
(d)  the cost of replacinor vehicles and eouipment;
(e) incremental costs of the Pzal.anyama ranch; and
(f)  farmer's poultry and dairving costs.
3.        Incremental benefits consist of the value of the following troduce
over the above what !would have been producecd in the program area withcut  TT,DP:
(a) Maize, groundnuts and tobacco;
(b) cattle from the Dazlanvamna ranch:
(c)  incremental beef produiced from traditional vilia½e herds
as well as value added as a result of the T,I.P stall-
fattening proTram: and
(d)  eggrs and rtllh.
4.        Both the costs and benefits of the health and land allocatior
comDonents have beer. omitted from the calcul.ations becau-se there is no
satisfactory basis for rtuantifying the benefits expected from these cor-
ponents, and the rest of the Project coujld have been imnlemented withoct
them.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
j.        Family labor and land have not been assigned any incremental cost
even though farmers may work a little harder on their farms as a result of
the Project. No significant hiring of farm labor is anticipated.
Pricing of Costs and Outputs
6.        Project outputs have been valued at world prices following the IBRI)
commodity prices forecasts. As all the main Malawi products (maize, ground-
nuts, tobacco and beef) differ from the particular types of these products
employed in compiling the IBRD forecasts, some adjustments have been neces-
sary. Actual world base prices for 1973174 have been used, but, for future
years (i974/75 to 1985 and beyond) such prices have been projected in accord-
ance with the IBRD forecast price index at 1974 constant prices. Costs and
benefits have both been projected at 1974 constant prices on the assumption
that inflationary cost changes would generally result in similar changes in
the prices of benefits, or else in a corrective exchange rate adjustment.
The actual prices applied in the calculations are computed as shown below in
paragraphs 10 to 13,
7.        In calculating the IER for the Phase III project alone, it has been
necessary to arpiortion the operating costs between Phase III and previous
phases. Admirnistration costs of the project, e.g. salaries and vehicle
operating costs lave been allocated according to the number of farmers while
fertilizer and other inputs have been allocated on an acreage basis. Devel-
opment costs and incremental benefits are directly attributable to Phase III
areas or Phase III activities and therefore do not present the same appor-
tionment problem. The Dzalanyama ranch is treated as a Phase II component
merely continued during Phase III, its costs and benefits are therefore
omitted from the calculation of the Phase III IER.
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IER)
8.        Based on the above assumptions, the IER for Phase III alone (de-
fined as those costs and benefits attributable to only areas in which devel-
opment was initiated in Phase III or arising only from Phase III activities)
is 18k. For the entire 3-Phase Program, IER is 13%.
9.        T'he lER for Phase III hias been tested for sensitivity to various
possible risks, thie most likely perhaps, being the possible reduction in
farmer use of fertilizer, with consequent reduction in maize yields.  The
results of the sensitivity tests are as follows:

Computation of World Price for Malawi Northern Dark-Fired Tobacco
12.       Nearly all Malawi tobacco is sold to representatives of world
manufacturers at the Limbe auction.  The difference between price on auction
floor and farmgate price is kept under scrutiny to ensure a fair return to
the farmer. The Malawi auction price for this class of tobacco in 1973/74 is
made up as follows:
Tambala per lb.
Price at auction                                28.0

Computation of World Market Price for Malawi Beef
13.       Cold Storage Company sources showed that mid-1973 prices of beef
imported into Malawi are analyzed as follows:
Inferior Commercial Standard
Price ex-Salisbury (R$/Kg)                  34.17      35.27        37.48

/1   Converted at R$1.0 = K 1.45 (at 1/11/73), and 2.2 lb = 1 kg.
Based on the above calculations, an average farmgate price of 26 tambala
per lb. (i.e. K 520 per short ton) in 1974 is assumed for calculating
the world price of M,alawi beef. This price is projected in accordance
with IBRD index of commodity price forecasts for beef as follows:
