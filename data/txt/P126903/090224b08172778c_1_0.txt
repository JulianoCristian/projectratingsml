                         Since the Project became effective on June 22, 2012, overall steady progress is being made towards the implementation of policy areas, as agreed under the three pillars of
                         Government's reform program. Under the Access to finance pillar, progress has been slower than anticipated. The team is nonetheless, working in partnership with the Government
                         to make a concerted effort to meet the targets in time for the appraisal of the second DPL in the PSC series.
