Approval
Corporate Review Decision           Following the corporate review, the decision was taken to
                                    proceed with the appraisal of the operation.

I.      Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement

1.          Mauritius has an impressive development record. Only a handful of countries
     have defied the odds, transformed their economies, sustained growth acceleration over
     decades and joined the ranks of middle income economies. Maintaining the status requires
     keeping up to the pace of reforms set by its competitors. Mauritius' ambitions are far greater
     as it envisions moving up the ladder and joining the ranks of upper middle-income countries.
     In addition, the competitiveness of the Mauritian economy is at risk amid fears of another
     global downturn fueled by the crisis in Europe. Accelerating reforms is the best response to
     emerging global uncertainties.

2.         Recent economic reforms in Mauritius have continued a long tradition of
     economic growth and development. Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has achieved
     substantial economic growth of around 5 percent per annum, which has underpinned an
     economic transition from a predominantly agricultural economy based on sugar production
     toward a diversified economy structured around textile exports and tourism. However, by the
     mid-2000s, with the erosion of its preferential trade status and rising commodity prices, it
     was evident that reform to further transition Mauritius from a labor-intensive economy
     toward a high value-added knowledge and services economy was needed. As a result, in
     2006 the Government implemented a bold reform program structured around four pillars: (i)
     strengthening fiscal consolidation and public sector efficiency; (ii) enhancing trade
     competiveness; (iii) improving the investment climate; and (iv) widening opportunities. The
     reform was broadly successful in restoring competitiveness, and achieving economic growth
     and employment creation in higher value added sectors. Moreover, the reform helped to
     consolidate government expenditure and reversed the upward trend in public debt. This
     provided the necessary space to adopt temporary counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary
     policies to mitigate the negative impact of the global financial crisis in 2009-10, and the Euro
     crisis in 2010.

3.         However, the reform agenda remains unfinished and critical constraints to
     economic development, particularly with regard to competitiveness agenda, have
     become increasingly evident. There is substantial room for improvement. The World Bank
     till very recently was supporting the Government’s competitiveness agenda through the
     Manufacturing and Services Development and Competitiveness Project, along with the
     Mauritius Economic Transition Project. In March 2011, the Bank was requested by the
     Government to cancel the two sector Investment Loans (ILs) – that were at an early stage of
     implementation - and prepare a new DPL. The new DPL, while focusing on competitiveness,
     would broaden and deepen the areas of focus in light of the evolving development priorities
     of the island nation. The DPL was thus deemed a more appropriate instrument for
     engendering the necessary policy and institutional reforms - as opposed to an IL with a focus
     on public investment and capacity building measures.

4.         The uncertain status of the global economy and the risks this poses to Mauritius
     adds new urgency to reform. Global economic uncertainties pose an increasing threat to a
     small open economy such as Mauritius, primarily on two fronts – the fiscal position and the
     current account deficit. Slower global economic growth could depress domestic growth and
     tax revenues, yet pressure to finance government priorities would likely continue. The fiscal
     position remains stretched, with high public debt, which is only projected to decline by a
     modest amount in the medium-term. Therefore a counter-cyclical fiscal policy would be
     difficult to implement if these external threats materialize. This highlights the need for
     measures that substantially raise public sector efficiency. Additionally, current account
     deficits, although high, have to date been financed mostly through high Foreign Direct
     Investment (FDI) and inflows to the financial sector, but this could quickly reverse if
     international financial markets deteriorate. The concentration of the country’s exports on a
     few markets (Europe) and products (tourism and textiles) could lead to a further deterioration
     of the current account deficit, which requires an acceleration of reforms to improve
     competitiveness and position the economy to access new markets and develop new products.

5.         The support provided by this proposed DPL is instrumental in helping to
     overcome many of the challenges the Government faces. The proposed Private Sector
     Competitiveness Development Policy Loan (PSC-DPL), in an amount of US$15 million is
     the first in a series of two annual programmatic operations in support of the Government’s
     medium-term reform program that centers on competitiveness and equity as its twin pillars.

6.        The Government continues to see DPLs as an important vehicle for supporting
     policy reform in Mauritius. While financing may be needed, it is the technical assistance,
     policy dialogue and additional support to reform champions that the Government most values
     in the World Bank engagement through DPLs. The proposed DPL is being prepared in
     coordination with the First Public Sector (PSP) DPL. The two DPL series are designed to be
     mutually reinforcing and address complementary aspects of the Government’s reform
     program. The PSC DPL series will focus primarily on strengthening the policy and
       institutional environment for private sector competitiveness, while this PSP DPL will focus
       primarily on the performance of the public sector. It is the combination of the reforms
       supported by these two DPLs that will help government improve its competitiveness and
       resilience; and prepare it for a next phase of rapid and inclusive economic growth.

II.       Proposed Objectives

7.           The development objective of the DPL programmatic operation is to strengthen
       the policy and institutional environment in Mauritius to support competitiveness and
       enterprise development. The operation will achieve this by: (i) facilitating competitiveness
       of enterprises; (ii) improving access to finance; and (iii) promoting Information and
       Communication Technology (ICT) and e-Gov for enhancing competitiveness and
       transparency. The proposed DPL is consistent with the CPS objectives presented to the
       Board in October 2006 and the CPS Progress Report of May 2011. The proposed DPL is
       aligned with four CPS pillars, in particular improving competitiveness and investment
       climate along with inclusion and fiscal consolidation. The DPL operation is well aligned to
       the new Africa Strategy that focuses on competitiveness and employment as one of its two
       themes.

III.      Operation Description

8.           The proposed DPL, in an amount of US$15 million is the first in a series of two
       annual programmatic operations in support of the Government’s medium-term reform
       program. The development objective of the programmatic series is to strengthen the policy
       and institutional environment in Mauritius to support competitiveness and enterprise
       development. The DPL series is aligned with the budget cycle, which is the primary vehicle
       used by the government for introducing new policy initiatives. There will be two DPLs in
       this series, one in 2012 and one in 2013. The DPL series takes a pragmatic approach to
       support the policy agenda over a two year period in which realistic results can be defined and
       achieved. The approach is to focus on those reforms that can be completed in the short-term
       while building the necessary foundations for broader reform over the medium-term. The DPL
       series is the principal instrument identified in the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for
       supporting the government’s reform program. For each of these pillars, prior actions have
       been identified that create the underpinnings to support the reform processes. The specific
       measures that have been agreed as prior actions for the first DPL are presented in Annex 1.

VI.      Institutional and Implementation Arrangements

9.          The Government and the World Bank will meet twice a year to review the
      progress of the DPL program and a joint report will be prepared. MoFED will be
      responsible for overall coordination of supervision and monitoring of the reform program
      supported by the proposed DPL series. MoFED will liaise with focal points in the Ministries,
      departments and agencies involved. Periodic monitoring and dialogue with relevant line
      ministries and other stakeholders involved in the implementation of the reforms will take
      place through field missions and through staff based at the Bank’s country office. MoFED, as
      the primary counterpart of the operation, will be responsible for furnishing information to the
      Bank, as required, to monitor outcomes in the policy matrix (Annex 2). Periodic monitoring
      will take place through field missions and through staff based at the Bank’s country office
      and an implementation report will be prepared every six months for discussion with the
      World Bank.


VII.     Risks and Risk Mitigation

10.         The implementation of the proposed reform program entails a number of risks:
      (a) the challenge of maintaining macroeconomic stability as a result of uncertain global
      developments; (b) a slowdown in the momentum of reforms, exacerbated by the withdrawal
      of one of the parties from the Government coalition in July 2011; and (c) limited institutional
      capacity within sector ministries to lead and implement the reforms; and (d) corruption. The
      details of these risks and the proposed mitigation measures are provided below.

11.         The first and perhaps most important risk is that macroeconomic stability may
      come under stress given uncertain global economic developments, especially pertaining
      to the European economies to which Mauritius remains highly exposed. Global
      economic uncertainties continue to present a significant threat to a small open economy such
      as Mauritius, primarily on two fronts – the fiscal position and the current account deficit.
      Slower global economic growth would depress domestic growth and tax revenues, yet
      pressure to finance Government priorities would likely continue. The fiscal position remains
      stretched, with high public debt, which is only projected to decline by a modest amount in the
      medium-term baseline scenario. This would make it hard to implement counter-cyclical
      policies should some of these external threats materialize. Also, current account deficits,
      although high, have been adequately financed mostly through high FDI and inflows to the
      financial sector. This however could quickly reverse if international financial markets
      deteriorate. Finally, the concentration of the country’s exports on a few markets (Europe) and
      products (tourism and textiles) and its large share of imported commodities could further
      deteriorate the current account deficit.

12.         This said, the Government has the means and tools to cope with external economic
      uncertainties while a firm commitment will be needed to rein in public expenditure if a
      substantial slowdown materializes. On the external front, the current level of foreign
      exchange reserves provides a buffer against a potential deterioration in the balance of
      payments. Mauritius’ floating exchange rate also facilitates correction of external imbalances
      in the medium term. The recent trends of an export reorientation toward new markets (i.e.
      Asia and Africa) and new products will also help. On the fiscal front, if the global economy
      slows down and the growth in public revenues eases, the fiscal deficit could deteriorate to
      levels significantly above the Government’s baseline projection of 3.8 percent of GDP. The
      Government is mindful of these risks. A wider deficit (up to 1.2 percentage points of GDP)
      could be financed by the recently created National Resilience Fund, which used public
      savings from 2011 and before. Should revenues dip further, additional adjustment would
      require either a slowdown in infrastructure implementation and/or an acceleration of
      efficiency gains in the public sector, which should be manageable but require firm
      commitment. Furthermore, the relatively large percentage of debt that is maturing highlights
      the vulnerability of public debt to the performance of the domestic financial sector, even
      though roll-over risks are currently low, given the fact that the majority of debt is domestic
      and there is an excess liquidity in domestic capital markets.

13.         The second risk is political risk that may affect the pace of the reform program at
      a time when the need for reform is most urgent. The pace of reform in Mauritius has
      slowed in recent years and the appetite for further aggressive reform appears modest at this
      time. This reflects the fact that many of these second generation reforms will have a
      redistributive effect, sometimes eliminating the rents, subsidies and privileges of certain
      groups. The Government may find it difficult to overcome some of these vested interests,
      some of which are well organized and influential. This is particularly true since many of the
      reforms may only pay dividends in the medium term while costs will certainly be evident in
      the short term. This complexity is further compounded by the withdrawal of one party from
      the Government coalition in July 2011 which has translated into a slim Government majority
      in Parliament. However, when considering the increasing global economic uncertainties and
      the structural constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction that are becoming
      binding, there is no time for complacency and past experience has shown that there is
      continuity in the reform agenda, especially those that are crucial to maintain the country on
      growth trajectory.

14.        There are several ways to mitigate this risk. A slim majority is not unprecedented in
      Mauritius and there is no reason to assume that the current majority will not be able to
      complete its current term. Nonetheless, to the extent that the proposed program has been
      designed to coincide with the remainder of the current majority’s term of office, a slim
      majority presents a risk – albeit manageable – which needs to be recognized. First, the
      Government’s focus on growth of SMEs shall support its inclusion agenda. Moreover over
      the medium term the acceleration reforms for engendering competitiveness and growth will
      generate better conditions for job creation. Second, the Government’s stress on strengthening
      the safety net, primarily by enhancing programs under the NEF but also potentially Social
      Aid, may provide immediate relief to the most vulnerable, thus overcoming their resistance
      to some of the reforms. Finally, better communication will be key to building consensus
      around the reforms, using visits to Mauritius by high level practitioners and management to
      raise awareness and understanding about the reforms and their benefits, both within the
      Cabinet and more broadly.

15.         The third risk is that sector ministries might not have sufficient institutional
      capacity to implement the reforms. Compared to the previous DPL program in which
      MoFED played an active role in leading and coordinating the reform, this new set of reforms
      will be led in many cases by sector ministries. This will involve a broader set of stakeholders,
      which means that building and broadening consensus around the reform agenda will be
      essential. Institutional capacity of sector ministries to design and implement these sector
      reforms may be limited, particularly in the newly created ministries.

16.          The Bank and the Government have signed a Services Agreement for NLTA to
      support institutional capacity. This RTA will complement the Bank’s program and allow
      line ministries to enhance their institutional capacity where needed. Additionally, the DPL
      itself will be a way to build bridges between the different ministries involved in the reform
      program, thereby enhancing coordination. The Bank analytical work program will support
      these reform areas while enhancing institutional capacity of sector ministries. In addition, this
      analytical work program has been coordinated with other Development Partners to leverage
      limited resources and to focus on areas that are more relevant for achieving impact.

17.         The fourth risk relates to corruption which has been at the center in the national
      debate for the past several months. Recent high-level allegations of corruption are under
      investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Corruption is not
      only an impediment to investment but has also triggered a political crisis in Mauritius,
      precipitating the withdrawal of one party from the Government coalition. The risk of
      corruption is mitigated by the fact the Government appears to be supportive of ICAC and
      respectful of its independence as well as the fact that the financial systems in Mauritius, as
      documented in the 2010 PEFA report, appear robust, suggesting relatively minimal risk to
      the proceeds of the loan.


VIII. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects

Poverty and Social Impacts

18.        Mauritius has a low rate of poverty, whether measured in relative or absolute
      terms. Relative poverty was 8.7 percent of population in 2006/07, equivalent to 106,000
      people. Approximately 1.0 percent of the population or 12,000 people live on less than US$1
      per day. Inequality in Mauritius, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is low at 0.388
    compared with other countries in Africa, reflecting the fact that Mauritius is a country with a
    well developed social welfare system that favors equality.
19.       The DPL prior actions are unlikely to harm the poor, while several prior actions
    have the potential to deliver positive impacts on poverty over the medium term. Both
    the improvement of investment climate, strengthening of small and medium enterprise
    (SME) programs and improving access to finance are expected to have significant, if indirect,
    poverty and social benefits. The measures aimed at raising private sector competitiveness
    and increasing investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI), are designed to support
    a virtuous cycle of growth, employment generation and productivity gains. Reform measures
    supported by the three pillars are targeted at decreasing business costs and creating better
    conditions for private local and foreign investments and ultimately leading to job creation.

20.         Supported policies under this first operation will not have a significant
      distributional impact. However, the restructuring of the Development Bank of Mauritius
      (DBM) could have a potentially negative distributional impact on workers and hence on
      poverty levels. In practice it is highly unlikely that such impact will materialize as the
      employment impacts of these measures are limited. One third of the three hundred employees
      of the DBM are involved in the core banking business and will most probably retain their
      employment, another one third of the work force is aged 55 and above, and might be
      incentivized to take a voluntary retirement scheme; losing a job might not necessarily result
      in an income shock for their households. As regards the rest of the workforce, the specific
      risks will be clearly identified during the due diligence carried out by professional transaction
      advisors and formal measures to mitigate the employment shock on redundant workers will
      be put in place by ensuring that (i) appropriate clauses are included in the divestiture
      contracts, (ii) proper budgeting are made to compensate retrenched workers according to the
      law, and (iii) a retraining and re-skilling program is put in place through the Placement and
      Training Program under the National Empowerment Foundation.                 The World Bank is
      supporting the strengthening of active labor market programs of the NEF under the Public
      Sector Efficiency DPL. The rationalization of SME programs will improve the capacity of
      the Government of Mauritius (GoM) to provide targeted business development services
      while at the same time reallocating workers where they might be more productive in an
      attempt to improve efficiency. These reforms will yield direct benefits to lower income
      segments of the population

Environment Aspects

21.         This operation does not pose any significant direct environmental risk. Few if any
      of the reforms supported by the DPL series is likely to have significant direct effects on the
      environment, natural resources, and forestry. Beyond the immediate focus of the DPL, other
      Government policies and development objectives such as increasing tourist arrivals by 2015,
      expanding the port and airport, relieving traffic congestion, and making the business climate
      more investor friendly may have an environmental impact. Historically, the record of
      environmental management, though not perfect, has been relatively good. The Safeguard
      Diagnosis Review carried out in October 2010 shows that some of Mauritius' environmental
      policies are sufficiently robust and are being implemented satisfactorily. The Bank will
      support the GoM in strengthening its environmental institutions under the proposed Piloting
   of Country Systems for Safeguards through project-specific environmental management
   plans for the next SIL to be prepared. All development partners recognize the strategic
   importance of environmental protection, and AFD, UNDP, and EU are actively providing
   technical support in this area.
