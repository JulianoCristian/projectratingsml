Re:
Loan No. 3776-BEL (Second Power Sector Development Project)
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Excellency:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement between Belize (the Borrower) and the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated August 8, 1994, 
as amended.
I am pleased to advise you that, pursuant to your request and our recent 
discussions of the subject, the Bank has agreed to amend the Loan Agreement so as to 
reflect the revisions to the scope of the legislative changes being considered by 
Belize. Therefore, Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement is amended to read as follows:
"The Borrower shall, not later than June 15, 1999, present to its 
Legislature, amendments, satisfactory to the Bank, to the Electricity Act 
defining, inter-alia, quality of service and incentive regulation criteria for 
the 
setting of electricity tariffs." 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
this letter in the spaces provided below.  This amendment letter shall be executed in 
two counterparts, each of which shall be an original. Upon your confirmation, please 
return one fully executed original to us. The provisions of this amendment letter will 
become effective, as of the date of this letter.
Because of their interest in this matter, I am forwarding copy of this letter to 
the Minister of Energy, Communications and Transport.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR 
   RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
