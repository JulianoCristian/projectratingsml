                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation Progress:

                         All project activities with the exception of the development of the Albania Financial Management Information System (AFMIS), have been completed within the closing date of
                         September 30, 2011.            The functional/ technical design for the AFMIS was completed, but the system was not implemented, as the contract negotiations failed in April 2011.
                         Recently completed activities include the rehabilitation of the MoF Main Systems Center and Business Continuity Center, the Government network expansion and other ICT
                         infrastructure improvements, the evaluation of the NSDI and project results, and learning activities for project beneficiaries. Grant disbursement at the end of September 2011 stood
                         at Euro 3,730,288.50 or 67.5 percent of Grant funds. The large undisbursed balance (32.5 percent of Grant funds) is primarily due to the cancellation of AFMIS implementation
                         following abortive contract negotiations in April 2011.

                         Key results include the following:

                         #       A fully synchronized calendar with coordinated procedures linking the NSDI updating, sectoral strategies, the MTBP, and annual budget preparation is in place;
                         #       All ministries submit annual integrated plans, which define policy goals and program objectives, and are reflected in the MTBP;
                         #       The convergence of the MTBP with the annual budget has improved: the average deviation of ministries' budget appropriations from the MTBP ceilings was eliminated in
                         2011 (down from 18 percent in 2008);
                         #       New macro-economic model and debt management strategy have been developed and are in use;
                         #       All expenditure and revenue transactions are registered in the automated Treasury since April 2010.

                         The ongoing repeat Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) also points to significant improvements achieved with support from the project, particularly in the areas of
                         budget predictability, transparency, and comprehensiveness as well as policy-based budgeting and debt management. The activation of the automated Treasury system (AMoFTS) in
                         2010 has also significantly improved the transparency and effectiveness of budget execution.

                         recent evaluation of the first IPS project as well as by the PEFA assessment. The new project is expected to focus on introducing a performance orientation in the policy planning and
                         budgetary processes, and by improving institutional capacity to monitor results at the strategy and program levels. The modernization of public financial management IT systems,
