                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation Progress:

                         With the exception of the disruption caused by the delay in the project extension (October-November 2010), overall grant activities have progressed smoothly and important progress
                         has been made in recent months. Most notably, the automated Treasury (AMoFTS) system is now operational since April 2010 and in use by 36 Treasury offices. The system
                         enables the generation of financial statements and allows for daily recording and reporting of transactions as well as electronic payments through online data exchange with the
                         National Bank of Albania. Parallel paper-based authorizations and accounts reconciliation for budget execution have been eliminated as of August 2010. This marks a major
                         achievement in the project's implementation and public financial management (PFM) reform in Albania. During the remaining project implementation period, the system will be
                         extended to provide new functionalities to transform the Treasury system into a full AFMIS, which would provide linkages with the budget preparation and MTBP systems and include
                         new modules on public investment, budget preparation and external assistance management. With support from an upcoming EC-funded (IPA) project an Access to the system is
                         expected to be decentralized to all ministries and some municipalities in 2011-2013.

                         Evaluation by beneficiaries:

                         A survey of project beneficiaries administered by the Department of Strategy and Donor Coordination in November 20110 indicated that most beneficiary agencies were satisfied with
                         the quality of technical assistance and training received under the project (rated as "excellent" or "very good") and found it had made a positive contribution to their work.
                         Beneficiaries' satisfaction with IT systems and equipment delivered under the project received somewhat less positive feedback and was deemed "very good" or "satisfactory".

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Restructuring and Project Extension:

                         The project has been restructured to include new activities to be financed by an additional donor contribution and the closing date has been extended by one year until September 30,
                         2011 (end disbursement date: March 31, 2011) to allow sufficient time for the completion of the activities. These activities notably relate to the extension of the automated Treasury
                         system to include additional FMIS functionalities (linkage with MTBP and budget preparation modules), new modules for public investment management and external assistance
                         management). In addition, the total amount of the grant was increased to 5,525,486.00 (from 4,525,486.00) thanks to an additional contribution by SIDA and the use of
                         accumulated investment income. The procurement plan has been revised accordingly and has been approved by the Bank. However, the closing date extension was granted
                         retroactively due to the need to resolve a legal issue that arose from the incompatibility of the terms of the Trust Fund extension by one of the donors. This delay has led to the
                         postponement in the launch of some activities, for which contracts were signed in December 2010.
