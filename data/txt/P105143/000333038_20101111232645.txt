SUMMARY
The proposed changes include (i) extending the closing date by one year to September
30, 2011 to implement one of the most important project objectives ­ a fully functional
Treasury System to support AoFMIS; (ii) account for additional financial resources to be
provided from SIDA ( 0.4 million), and in addition for previously unbudgeted resources
(of 0.77 million) (this is the difference between total donor pledges and the value of
resources in the Trust Fund); and (iii) introducing the revised results framework matrix to
reflect all the changes which had taken place from 2008 and to align better with the new
closing date.

The extension results from delays in the early phase of implementation due to delays in
establishing the Trust Fund and the lack of a central implementation unit within the MoF,
and a lack consequent lack of familiarity with the implementation of projects using Bank
procedures. In addition, there have been delays in the completion of the fully automated
Treasury System (not financed under the TF) which are necessary for the implementation
of one of the components of the TF activities.

The project is financed from a Multi-Donor Trust Fund and as such the team was advised
that not all the donor pledges should be budgeted initially. Thus of the resources available
initially 0.77 million were not budgeted (that is the value of the Trust Fund, plus the
resources allocated to TF090837 was 0.77 million less than the total donor pledges). In
addition SIDA has provided an additional of SEK four million (equivalent to 0.4
million). Please see Table 1 below. These additional resources were made available to
support the development of the extension to the Treasury system, which had been
significantly under budgeted.

The revised results matrix was developed as it became clear to both donors and
government that the original matrix contained many results which would be very difficult
to measure. There was thus general agreement that the matrix should be revised, technical
assistance was provided to the government in developing a new results matrix, which also
took into account developments in the project, such as the merger of components two and
three.

PROJECT STATUS
1.      The achievement of the PDO and overall implementation progress have been
rated as moderately satisfactory due to accelerated implementation during 2009, with
several major consultancy contracts being signed. This was helped by the establishment
of the Central Financing and Contracting Unit (CFCU) which has been handling
procurement and financial management since the end of 2008. The TF objectives
continue to be achievable and can be satisfactorily achieved during the extended period.
There is a high level commitment of the Borrower to the activities of the Trust Fund.

2.      Specifically, Component 1 "SAA implantation and EU assistance program and
reporting capacities" is well underway with two consultancies for the Public
Administration Department having delivered most of their outputs. Component 2 and 3
"Implement Medium-Term Budget Program and strengthen Public Investment Planning"
has been able to provide line ministries with relevant instruments and training for an
improved budget planning process. Component 4 "Macro-economic Forecasting and
Debt Management" is almost completed and has substantially contributed to a more
appropriate functional structure of debt management within the MoF, a mid-term debt
management strategy and a new macro-economic forecasting model. Components 5, 6
and 7 all related to improvement of donor coordination and external management have
been continuously provided expertise, technical assistance and training mainly to the
Department of Donor and Strategy coordination. The results are quite visible with an
improved monitoring and reporting quality of DSDC, with a highly competent staff, and
with improved donor coordination.

3.       Component 8 "Monitoring and reporting" related to the Treasury System
modernization incurred most delays. This component includes two subcomponents. The
first is the strengthening of the IT backbone of the central public administration and the
second to extend the Treasury system to include a comprehensive monitoring and
reporting system (Albania Financial Management Information System - AFMIS).

4.     The first subcomponent of component 8 is now underway following a complex
procurement process for basically buying equipments, servers, UPS to improve the
GovNet system at the center of government. Although implementation is of this
subcomponent is now underway without problems, it is likely to require three to four
months beyond the current closing date of the project to complete this activity.

5.     The second sub-component of component 8 (AFMIS) is the most complex and
has experienced the greatest difficulties. The main issue has been that this subcomponent
could not be contracted until the basic Treasury system is close to being fully functional,
as the system itself requires a fully functioning Treasury as its core source of data.
Following significant delays during from 2007 until the second half of 2009, major
progress has been made in the last year on getting the Treasury system functioning. The
process of contracting the AFMIS is now underway, and although expected to be
complex, the activity can reasonably be expected to be completed by September 2011.



                                            5
6.     The project is financed from a child Trust Fund (TF090843) of Multi Donor Trust
Fund (TF070735). The budget of TF090843 is 4,525,486.11. Project Disbursements, at
35.8% of the total amount have picked up in the last 8 months and will continue to do so.
Moreover contracts have now been signed for 2,932,537 Euro or 60% of the amount
available in the TF.


PROPOSED CHANGES
Result Indicators (Annex 1)

7.      When the Trust Fund was originally designed, a Result Framework Matrix was
included as the monitoring and evaluation instrument of the TF. However once
significant implementation began, it was agreed by the contributing donors and the
government that the RFM should be revised to better reflect all the changes within some
of the components of the Trust Fund and especially to improve and account for some of
the outputs which were not properly spelled out in the existing version. The new Results
Framework Matrix has been approved from the Government and agreed upon from all the
donors contributing to the Trust Fund. The overall objective of the Trust Fund and the
specific objectives of the components remain unchanged.

Closing Date

8.     The closing date for Albania, Capacity Building and Support to Build the
Integrated Planning System, P105143 will be extended from September 30, 2010 until
September 30, 2011. This is the second extension. The original closing date was October
31, 2009, thus the total extension is less than two years from the original date.

9.       The proposed extension is necessary given the delays in initiating activities, and
the fact that most components of the Trust Fund are now well under way and
disbursement has accelerated. It is recognized that without the extension, some planned
activities could not be initiated. It is also recognized, that progress is now being made in
the implementation of the modernization of the Treasury, which provides the basis for the
technical aspects of the IPS (mainly under component 8 of the TF activities) to be met.

10.    The project is in good position to implement all the pending activities during the
extended period. Following initial challenges, the Project has successfully built
procurement and financial management capacities within the Ministry of Finance
(CFCU). The MoF is also working very hard to implement successfully component 8.
They have already prepared a revised procurement plan to account for full amount of
money in the TF until September 2011.

    ·   Financing

The Project is financed from Multi-donor Trust Fund TF070735. A summary of the
sources and uses of funds is shown for the current situation and the proposed
restructuring:

  Unbudgeted                                  0.767         0.099

The unbudgeted funds in the restructured project will constitute a contingency reserve
against price and exchange rate fluctuations or other unforeseen contingencies. Hence the
additional one million Euro in expenditure is financed by the additional 0.4 million
contribution from SIDA plus 0.6 million from the reduction in unbudgeted funds. The
residual changes are due to the need to increase the budget for supervision of the project
by an additional year together with small changes in administrative fees and investment
income. The changes in project costs by component are shown in Table 2.
