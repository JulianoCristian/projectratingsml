In 2002,\n            Nigeria had 2.7 million people living with HIV and AIDS The\n            epidemic had already killed a total of 1.7 million people\n            and orphaned 1.5 million children. The country\u2019s nascent\n            efforts to fight the disease were limited to a few severely\n            underfunded health sector initiatives. The Nigeria HIV and\n            AIDS program development project was launched in 2002 funded\n            by International Development Association (IDA). The project\n            has contributed to expand access to support networks, HIV\n            and AIDS care. It has also been credited for increased\n            knowledge on HIV prevention through community based\n            advocacy, particularly in remote areas. The national action\n            committee on AIDS and state action committees on AIDS were\n            established in all 36 states with the official mandate to\n            coordinate the multi-sectoral response. More than 1,500\n            civil society organizations have implemented prevention,\n            care and treatment programs through project funding. The\n            flexibility of IDA financing allowed the project to adjust\n            to substantial changes in donor programs over time and fill\n            funding gaps, particularly those related to work on prevention."}, "docdt": "2009-08-29T06:19:05Z"}
