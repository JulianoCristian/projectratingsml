Re:   ARGENTINA - Ln 3521-AR - Flood Rehabilitation Project
      - Amendment of Percentage of Local Expenditures to be
      Financed
Dear Mr. Cavallo:
      Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated January 7, 1993, between the Argentine 
Republic (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(the Bank) for the above referenced Project.
      We acknowledge the receipt of Nota 0429/02 dated March 25, 1993 of Subsecretaria 
de Asistencia para la Reforma del Sector Publico Provincial, requesting modification 
of the table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement by 
eliminating the percentages of expenditures to be financed for disbursements in 1992, 
since no expenditure to be financed under this Loan was made in 1992. I am glad to 
inform you that the Bank has no objections to such request and consequently the 
percentage of the financing of local expenditures is set at 70% instead of the 
differentiated percentages originally agreed upon.  Therefore, said table shall now 
read as follows:
                            Amount of the
                            Loan Allocated         % of
