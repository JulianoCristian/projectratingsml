These are key lessons learned: 1) Fund\n            non-structural measures that establish the capacity to\n            manage future emergencies. 2) Use simple and easy\n            investments and a flexible project design; ensure\n            participation of interested provinces; maintain competent\n            local executing units; enable flexibility to shift funds\n            among eligible provinces; and prepare a well-formulated but\n            simple project operation's manual. 3) The institutional\n            set-up of the central and provincial sub-units coordinating\n            emergencies was crucial to implementing and sustaining\n            communication and coordination. 4) Emergency operations with\n            a housing component to voluntary resettlement should help\n            define land-use regulations. 5) To restrict development in\n            floodplains and preserve the ecosystem, use financial\n            incentives, practice effective land use and management, and\n            sound governmental policies and programs. 6) Simplify\n            procurement procedures and ensure they are properly used by\n            auditing projects semi-annually. 7) Review proposed\n            sub-projects for their technological and environmental\n            aptness. 8) The use of a structured implementation framework\n            with a very capable project executing unit was key. 9)\n            Strong Bank and borrower supervision is required. 10)\n            Beneficiary participation is essential. 11) In order for an\n            emergency loan to be implemented quickly, overall Bank\n            financing of an emergency operation should be a minimum of\n            60 to 70 percent."}, "docdt": "1999-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
