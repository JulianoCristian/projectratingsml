      are to expand production and promote marketing of export\n            crops by providing credit, critical support services and\n            infrastructure. The project provides for: medium- and\n            long-term farm credit to export crop farmers to be\n            channelled through ACB and the commercial banks. It also\n            includes investments to enable expansion of cigar tobacco\n            production; upgrading of banana boxing plants and port\n            facilities, airport shed and storage facilities, and plant\n            protection facilities. Further, the project provides\n            technical assistance to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MINAG), ACB and the commodity organizations and\n            to carry out extension activities, adaptive research, and\n            marketing studies; and training."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
